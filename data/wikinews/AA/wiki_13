Tropical Storm Alpha formed Saturday in the &lt;a href="Caribbean"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; to break the record for most tropical storms in an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20seasons"&gt;Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ever, making it the 22nd storm of the year. It is also the first storm to be named with a letter of the Greek alphabet. Wilma exhausted the English alphabetic list as the 21st named storm; the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z are skipped when naming &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; storms.

Currently, the storm has sustained winds of 40mph, which is only 1mph over the threshold for a tropical storm. It is centered about 70 miles south of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASanto%20Domingo%2C%20Dominican%20Republic"&gt;Santo Domingo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Dominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt;. A tropical storm warning has been issued for &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt; and portions of the Dominican Republic.

According to scientists, since 1995 an increase in hurricane activity has been due to a rise in ocean temperatures and decrease of wind shear that rip apart hurricanes.

The prior record has stood since the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A1933%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;1933 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . However the season does not end till November 30, leaving room for more storms to form and shatter the record. Scientists have noted that the number of very strong hurricanes is likely to increase further in future years as the effects of &lt;a href="Climate%20change"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; increase. Researcher Dr Peter Webster stated that "What I think we can say is that the increase in (hurricane) intensity is probably accounted for by the increase in sea-surface temperature, and I think probably the sea-surface temperature increase is a manifestation of global warming."

The two year investigation involving the leak of &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; operative &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt;'s secret identity seems to be coming to an end.

Special Counsel &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald's&lt;/a&gt; grand jury, which has been investigating the "outing" of Plame's secret status to columnist &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Novak"&gt;Robert Novak&lt;/a&gt; and other reporters, concludes its work on October 29. The U.S. Department of Justice has established a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/osc/index.html"&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of making any communication public. However, Fitzgerald's office will not comment on the timing of any indictments which may be filed.

Many individuals inside and outside the White House have apparently been interogated. Two high level White House &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff"&gt;Chiefs of Staff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt; to President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Libby"&gt;I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby&lt;/a&gt; to Vice-President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, are part of the focus of the investigation. Both Rove and Libby testified before the grand jury; Rove 4 times, and Libby at least twice. Rove and Libby have been informed that they may be in serious legal trouble.

According to legal sources, Fitzgerald will give final notice to officials facing charges as early as Monday and could convene the grand jury Tuesday, one day earlier than usual, to summarize the case and request approval for possible indictments. The grand jury is scheduled to expire Friday.

Bush administration critics suggest the outing of the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; operative Plame was an effort by the administration to prop up the credibility of pre-war claims that &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; possessed &lt;a href="w%3AWeapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/a&gt;. The Bush administration has responded that the charge lacks any credibility.

Valerie Plame's husband, &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20C.%20Wilson"&gt;Joseph Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, was a former diplomat to &lt;a href="Niger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt; who went public in July 2003 with an &lt;a href="w%3AOp-Ed"&gt;Op-Ed&lt;/a&gt; column that called evidence linking Niger uranium to Iraq bogus. The Wilson column was written after the President Bush 2003 &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20the%20Union%20Address"&gt;state of the union address&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Iraq sought to purchase uranium from &lt;a href="w%3ANiger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Leaked poll finds 45% of Iraqis support suicide bombers who attack allied forces</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Leaked%20poll%20finds%2045%25%20of%20Iraqis%20support%20suicide%20bombers%20who%20attack%20allied%20forces&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A poll conducted by an Iraqi university research team on behalf of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APolitics%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;British government&lt;/a&gt; and reported by British newspapers showed that 45% of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;is support suicide bombers who attack coalition troops in Iraq. In some areas this rises to 65%. 

Other results of the poll include:

<ul>
BULLET::::- 82% of Iraqis are "strongly opposed" to the presence of coalition troops
BULLET::::- Less than 1% of the population feel that coalition troops have brought any improvement in the country
BULLET::::- 67% feel less secure because of the occupation

</ul>
Many Iraqis resent the damage that has been done to their country by the invading forces. Many believe their country has seen a decrease in standard of living, in freedom of movement and in safety and security. Many Iraqis hope that if the coalition forces can be encouraged to leave, the country can return to normal.

The survey contrasts with statements made by UK Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJack%20Straw%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt; and US Secretary of State &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; that there was widespread support for the invasion of Iraq, and that the occupying powers were improving human rights in the country.

UK politician &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMenzies%20Campbell"&gt;Sir Menzies Campbell&lt;/a&gt; said "Such findings are yet another argument in favour of a comprehensive exit strategy". It is not clear what would happen to the many US companies operating in Iraq if the coalition troops were forced out. It seems unlikely that they would retain hold of oil production assets or keep a major role in construction projects, and it is not clear that the US would have benefitted in any way from its incursion into the country.

The poll was "undertaken for the Ministry of Defence and seen by The Sunday Telegraph" in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

<h4>Russian fighter Su-27 crashed near the city of Kaunas, Lithuania, thus violating Lithuanian-NATO airspace. After an enquiry, the pilot was eventually released. Lithuania may have obtained the secret "friend-or-foe" enemy recognition system. The last time in happened, it cost Russia billions of dollars to reprogram its airforce recognition systems.</h4>

The fighter was one of five that were given permission to fly from Russia to its heavily militarized province of Kaliningrad/Karaliaucius/Koenigsberg, separated from the mainland by the territories of Lithuania and Poland. The last plane, piloted by Valery Troyanov, separated and promptly crashed near the city of Kaunas. The pilot ejected and wasn't hurt. German NATO planes that were securing the Baltic airspace were too late to take off because of the Lithuanian radar failures.

Immediately, Russia started a propaganda campaign. It denied the presence of weapons on the plane, however, four rockets and a chaingun have been found, as well as some radioactive materials. Also, Russia pushed for the formation of a joint investigation commission with Lithuania.

Lithuania, meanwhile, stayed true to its traditions of freedom and sovereignty, offering Mr. Tryanov a health test, inviting Russian observers, holding the pilot under house arest at a hotel, inviting the wife to join her husband, cooperating with NATO and Ukrainian specialists, and firing the chief of its airforce for (unwittingly?) giving away classified information to the Russians.

Russian media, which is entirely state-controlled, focused on the rhetoric of Russian military and the foreign ministry, ignoring a declaration of Mr. Troyanov and his wife where they expressed being satisfied with the handling of the case by the Lithuanian government, and proclaiming that Lithuania haven't tested Mr. Troyanov's health. Russia also gave wrong technical data on the airplane involved.

The commission concluded that the accident was not a provocation, and the pilot was released. However, judging from the elaborately planned propaganda campaign, the commission might have preferred to make a decission favourable to good interstate relations. The pilot (who was flying an important international mission) has been proven to be incompetent. Currently, in the cash-strapped Russian army, pilots, such as major Mr. Troyanov, fly only several hours a year - about 15 times less than NATO pilots.

Russia plans to award Mr. Troyanov a medal and send him on a tour of schools to teach the subject of patriotism. Lithuania has demanded a compensation of 3000 euros for the farmer in whose field the plane crashed.

NATO, the European Union and international mainstream media stayed almost completely silent about this accident. IndyMedia.org, meanwhile, refused to publish this article on unknown grounds.
Russia violates the airspaces of its Baltic neighbours at an average rate of 6 times a year. Russia has never admitted any violations. Lithuania (occupied by Russia 1795-1918 and 1940-1990), along with other Baltic countries, have no modern fighter planes of their own, hence their airspace ir protected by their NATO alies. Since 2004, they are NATO and EU members, along with Poland.

&lt;a href="w%3ALech%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Lech Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt; has been elected as the new president of the &lt;a href="Republic%20of%20Poland"&gt;Republic of Poland&lt;/a&gt;, according to first polls. He gained about 53,7% of votes, while his rival, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Tusk"&gt;Donald Tusk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gained 46,3% in the run-off &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20presidential%20election%2C%202005"&gt;Polish presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. 

In the first turn Kaczyński from &lt;a href="Law%20and%20Justice"&gt;Law and Justice&lt;/a&gt; party gained about 34% of votes, while his main rival attracted about 37% of polish society.

Kaczyński, nicknamed "the duck", will replace &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAleksander%20Kwasniewski"&gt;Aleksander Kwasniewski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was ineligible to be elected again, as he was the president of Poland for ten years.

Kaczyński, 56-year-old lawyer and mayor of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , would like to build up the next Republic of Poland, called "Czwarta Rzeczpospolita" (4th Republic of Poland). Many people in Poland believe that Kaczyński, alongside his twin brother Jarosław, will try to throw out corruption and dishonesty from Polish politics.

Pre-election polls had predicted that pro-business Donald Tusk, the leader of conservative-liberal party &lt;a href="w%3ACitizens%20Platform"&gt;Citizens Platform&lt;/a&gt;, would win the election.

Marty Bahamonde, the only FEMA emplyee in New Orleans during hurricane Katrina, testifying before 
the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, contradicts former FEMA director 
Michael Brown's testimony and says Brown ignored his pleas for help.

In an August 31 Blackberry email:

"Sir, I know you know that this situation is past critical. Here are some things you might not know. Hotels are kicking people out, thousands gathering in the streets with no food or water. Hundreds still being rescued from homes" and "medical staff at the Dome expect to run out of oxygen in about 2 hours"

In an email from one of Brown's aids:
"Please schedule Joe Scarborough this evening... Also, it is very important that time is allowed for Mr. Brown to eat dinner. Gievn[sic] that Baton Rouge is back to normal, restaurants are getting busy"

In an industrial relations conference in Melbourne this week, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Andrews"&gt;Minister Kevin Andrews&lt;/a&gt; has released that the government's new industrial relations (IR) legislation is likely to be introduced sometime next week in the Australian lower house. The Senate employment committee will hold an inquiry into the legislation. According to Mr Andrews this inquiry will probably run for a week in the non-sitting period of parliament. He said the legislation would then be debated in the Senate in the last sitting weeks of the year.

The new workplace reforms have evoked widespread controversy from both sides of the political spectrum. The Australian Council of Trade Unions launched TV advertisements to counter the government's new legislation. The 100 million dollar 'Work Choices' advertisements by the Australian Government has been criticised as a political use of taxpayers dollars. 

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Prime Minister John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has contended that the new reforms are necessary to keep our economy competitive and update outdated laws. The opposition says a new class of working poor will be created in Australia under the planned IR changes. 

One proposed change will deny Centrelink welfare payments to anyone who refuses a job, no matter what the conditions. Mr Andrews has backed up the legislation:

"For an individual the best form of welfare they can have is to have a job".

However, Labor's Stephen Smith has rejected such claims

"What we will end up with is people being forced onto inferior wages, inferior conditions and the great risk is that we end up with a working poor just as you find in the United States,"♡❤

Michael Raper, spokesperson for the National Welfare Rights Network says it is a severe penalty.

"We've been trying to draw attention to the fact that any unemployed person will have to accept whatever conditions they're offered because if you reject a job offer you will lose Centrelink payments for eight weeks," he said. 

The University of Sydney has released a report card on the changes available. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.econ.usyd.edu.au/download.php%3Fid%3D4313"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

__NOEDITSECTION__
Marking the anniversary of an incident at Tak Bai police station which led to 78 people suffocating while being detained by the &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; army, relatives of the deceased plan to file a lawsuit with the &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20Province"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt; provincial court seeking 80 million baht (approx. US$2 million, 1.6 million euro) in compensation.

Utt Bueraheng, the lawyer representing the families is confident they will win their case as an investigation into the incident took some disciplinary action against involved senior officers.

The suit will name the Thai Defence Ministry, Army, Royal Thai Police Office, Interior Ministry, and &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt; provincial authorities as defendants. Earlier in the week other lawsuits were filed in relation to the incident; in all cases the named defendants are the same.

The Tak Bai incident is one of the most publicised events of the South Thailand insurgency. On October 25, 2004 six local men were arrested, accused of supplying defence force weapons to insurgents. Villagers organised a protest, demanding that the police release the accused. Instead, the police called in army reinforcements who used tear gas and water cannons on the crowd; shooting started, and seven people were killed.

Hundreds of local citizens, mostly young &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; men, were arrested. They were made to strip to the waist and lie on the ground. Their hands were bound behind their backs and later in the afternoon they were loaded into trucks to be taken to an army camp where they were to be detained. The prisoners were stacked on top of each other in the trucks, and by the time the three-hour trip to the camp was completed, 78 men had suffocated in the heat.

The incident provoked widespread protest, not limited to Muslims in the south. Many non-Muslim Thais were shocked by the army's behaviour. However the Thai Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Sinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, gave his full support to the army and until these lawsuits were brought, very little disciplinary action had been taken against those responsible. Thaksin's response in defending the army's actions was to say the men died, "because they were already weak from fasting during the month of &lt;a href="w%3ARamadan"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;."

The lawsuits brought earlier this week against the five state agencies seek a total of more than eighteen million baht (approx. US$ 440,000 or 370,000 euros) in compensation. The first lawsuit was filed on behalf of relatives of five of the seven protesters killed outside Tak Bai police station; this suit seeks 5.8 million baht. The second lawsuit was filed by a group of seventeen of the protesters who were injured in the clash with police and security forces; this suit seeks 12.4 million baht compensation for injury and loss of property. All of the lawsuits have been brought with the assistance of the Law Society of Thailand.

The aftermath of the Tak Bai incident saw many of the protesters seeking asylum in neighbouring &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;. Recently forty of those who had fled across the border returned after they had been given assurances by authorities regarding their safety.

The leadership of the insurgents remains unclear, with no clearly identified organisational structure, or announced objectives. However, there have been separatists in the former &lt;a href="w%3AMalay"&gt;Malay&lt;/a&gt; sultanate since the 1930s. Under military rule, they were firmly suppressed and only since early 2004 has violence flared in the troubled provinces. The government reacted to this by declaring &lt;a href="w%3AMartial%20law"&gt;Martial law&lt;/a&gt; in January of 2004.

Despite the imposition of Martial law, attacks on police, government officials, schools and military compounds continued unabated. This prompted the Prime Minister to introduce an executive decree for administration in emergency situations early in 2005. Additional troops were dispatched to the troubled provinces bringing the total in the area to 30,000; however, lack of counter-insurgency training and experience meant they have done little in the way of quelling the violence. In the past six months the army has reported that 298 have been killed, and over 300 injured in attacks. The estimated total killed since the start of 2004 is claimed to be over one thousand.

New figures released last week by the Irish Department of Education show a surprisingly &lt;a href="w%3Asecondary%20school"&gt;secondary school&lt;/a&gt; drop out rate in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.

The retention rates report released by Education Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Hanafin"&gt;Mary Hanafin&lt;/a&gt; shows that just 77.8% of the 64,000 students who began their secondary education in 1996 completed the &lt;a href="w%3ALeaving%20Cert"&gt;Leaving Cert&lt;/a&gt; in 2001/2002.

The worst areas in the country appear to be urban areas, particularly in &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; where 26 schools had drop out rates above 50%. Among these were several schools which had a retention rate of less than 60% up to &lt;a href="w%3AJunior%20Cert"&gt;Junior Cert&lt;/a&gt; level.

By gender, the rentention rates for girls were 83.8% and boys were 72.1%.

Poor funding and large class sizes are being blamed for the high drop out rates. Separate &lt;a href="w%3AOECD"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt; figures put Ireland 21st out of 27 developed countries in terms of spending per secondary level student.

Three officials of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;National Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NIA) in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; have been suspended for allegedly spying on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaki%20Macozoma"&gt;Saki Macozoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a businessman with the &lt;a href="African%20National%20Congress"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; (ANC). The three men; deputy director general Gibson Njenje, general manager Bob Mhlanga, and director general Billie Masethla were temporarily relieved of duty by Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils following the allegations.

Masethla has been reported to have clashed with Kasrils over an allegation he made about members of the Directorate of Special Operations(DSO). Also known as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScorpions%20%28South%20Africa%29"&gt;Scorpions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the DSO's mandate is to investigate and prosecute corruption and organized crime. It is a division of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Prosecuting%20Authority"&gt;National Prosecuting Authority&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in South Africa.

In a submission to the Khampepe Commission, which is heading an inquiry into the future of the Scorpions, Masethla charged that members were acting as agents for foreign intelligence.

Macozoma told the Mail and Guardian, "It is correct they did survey me. I found out because it was an overt, in your face kind of thing. I complained to the minister and he confirmed it was the NIA that was involved."

Macozoma is considered part of the President Thabo Mbeki's inner circle and is seen to wield considerable influence over who his replacement will be when the president steps down from the ANC in 2007 and as president in 2009.

Jacob Zuma, former deputy president, was considered the natural successor to Mbeki but was fired in June and charged with corruption. Despite this, he retains his position as deputy president of the ANC and continues to hold widespread support. 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20South%20African%20Trade%20Unions"&gt;Congress of South African Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20African%20Communist%20Party"&gt;South African Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20National%20Congress%20Youth%20League"&gt;African National Congress Youth League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have all charged that Zuma was fired to block his chances of becoming president.

&lt;a href="w%3ARosa%20Parks"&gt;Rosa Parks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;African American&lt;/a&gt; woman who served as a catalyst to the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement%20%281955-1968%29"&gt;American Civil Rights Movement&lt;/a&gt;, died of natural causes on Monday night at her home in &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. She was 92.

Parks was best known for her refusal to yield her seat to a white man who demanded it on a city bus. Her defiance led to the &lt;a href="w%3AMontgomery%20Bus%20Boycott"&gt;Montgomery Bus Boycott&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; in 1955.

She later worked on the Staff of U.S. Representative &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Conyers"&gt;John Conyers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;MI&lt;/a&gt;) who called her "a real apostle of the nonviolence movement" in an interview with ♡❤CNN♡❤.

Parks founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development and was politically active until well into her 80s. 

She received the two highest civilian awards in the U.S.; the &lt;a href="w%3APresidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom"&gt;Presidential Medal of Freedom&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 and the &lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Gold%20Medal"&gt;Congressional Gold Medal&lt;/a&gt; in 1999.

Parks' health had been in decline in the last decade. She had become more and more reclusive to the public. Parks was confined to a wheelchair and suffered from dementia.

As UNICEF launches a global campaign to help the youngest victims of HIV/AIDS, the charity has warned that 18 million children may be orphaned by the disease by 2010.

They say that every minute, a child dies from an AIDS-related disease, a child becomes infected with HIV, and four people in age group 15-24 become infected with the disease.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said: “Nearly 25 years into the pandemic, help is reaching less than 10 percent of the children affected by HIV/AIDS, leaving too many children to grow up alone, grow up too fast or not grow up at all. Simply put, AIDS is wreaking havoc on childhood.”

The campaign, "Unite for Children, Unite Against AIDS" will be launched this afternoon in New York. Along with goodwill ambassador Jemima Khan, and UNICEF's special ambassador and former Bond actor Roger Moore, several world leaders and governmental ministers from around the world will be attending the event.

The UNICEF advisor in Nairobi, Naisiadet Mason, told Reuters: "The day I was told I was HIV positive I was devastated and alone.

"We must create the networks, remove the stigma, supply the drugs. We want to get HIV treated as just another disease because we know it is manageable."

UNICEF will be using Kenya as a case to highlight the "years of neglect" of youngsters infected or affected by HIV/AIDS.

&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i voters have accepted the draft constitution, the &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Electoral%20Commission%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Independent Electoral Commission&lt;/a&gt; announced Tuesday. 78% voted in favor, 21% against. Two, mostly &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt;, provinces rejected the constitution with a two-thirds majority; three rejections by provinces by two-thirds majorities would have caused the constitution to fail.

Voters in the provinces of Anbar and Salahuddin overwhelmingly opposed the draft, casting 97% and 82% "No" respectively. The deciding swing-province in the referendum was &lt;a href="w%3ANineveh"&gt;Nineveh&lt;/a&gt;. While 55% of the voters in the predominately Sunni province opposed the constitution, that was below the 66% threshold necessary to bring the draft to a halt.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ieciraq.org/English/Frameset_english.htm"&gt;Electoral Commission&lt;/a&gt; official Farid Ayar called the vote "100% correct" and said that there were "no cases of fraud that could affect the results of the vote".

But the Sunni official Saleh al-Mutlaq said the referendum was a "farce" and accused the government of stealing ballot boxes in areas where most people voted "No".

Observers from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; dispute that statement. A senior official, Carina Perelli, said the result is "accurate" and that it was checked by her organisation.

The voting turnout was 9.85 million votes, or 63% of eligible voters. This was one million more votes than cast in the interim government election held in January.

Parliamentary elections are now scheduled for December 15, 2005.

&lt;a href="http%3A//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%25C3%25A9_Simon_Azcona_Hoyo"&gt;José Simón Azcona del Hoyo&lt;/a&gt;, ex-President of &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt;, died of a heart attack Monday. He was 74. 

Azcona was President of Honduras from 1986 to 1990 and well-known as US government ally. He supported the Contra rebel groups that fought the left-wing Sandinista government in neighboring Nicaragua. He once called upon the US government to send troops to battle the Nicaraguan army, which had crossed the border to follow the Contras based in Honduras.

Despite his country's reputation for a high level of corruption, Azcona was known one of cleanest politicians according to Reuters.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has dismissed the claims made by the &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASolicitor%20General"&gt;Solicitor General&lt;/a&gt; that the Federal Government's proposed anti-terror laws could be unconstitutional. He has also come under criticism for planning to introduce the laws on &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Cup"&gt;Melbourne Cup&lt;/a&gt; Day, a day when most Australian’s will be paying attention to a Horse Race, and not politics.

In an unusual move, the government will compel an instantaneous debate on the legislation, giving the opposition 10 minutes to scrutinize the draft laws rather than the usual fortnight.

Opposition homeland security spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AArch%20Bevis"&gt;Arch Bevis&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Age"&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt; newspaper "This is an extraordinary abuse of power, the likes of which I don't think anyone would remember," 

"John Howard now has control of both the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;, and if he wants to use his power in an arrogant, bloody-minded way we don't have the numbers to stop him."

Earlier today Queensland’s &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC Radio&lt;/a&gt; that the Prime Minister's proposals could face legal challenges. Other State Premiers are seeking their own legal advice, with only the &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australian&lt;/a&gt; Premier also raising similar concerns

John Howard told ABC’s World Today “The advice we have is that these laws are constitutional. There's never been any doubt raised by our legal advisers”.

The Prime Minister added he would be willing to talk through the issue with the State Premiers. Agreeing this morning that the solicitor-generals from the states will consult along with the national equivalent to work through these issues .

The QLD Premier who supports the principles of the bill told ABC radio “I'm not interested in making this a public issue, or pursuing some sort of silly public debate. What I'm interested in is resolving these issues, ensuring that we actually protect Australia, protect the nation, and protect Australians as well. That's why we've insisted on a public interest monitor. Any of these legal issues we will deal with and we'll deal with them sensibly.

Independent supporters of the bill are urging the government to push ahead. Neil James from the Australia Defense Association says that the &lt;a href="w%3ALegal%20precedent"&gt;legal precedents&lt;/a&gt; recognized during &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20I"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; would indicate that most of the reasonably contentious provisions would be &lt;a href="w%3Aconstitutional"&gt;constitutional&lt;/a&gt;.

However Constitutional lawyer John Williams says that judges and magistrates could argue that the proposed laws undermined &lt;a href="w%3Ajudicial%20independence"&gt;judicial independence&lt;/a&gt;. Dr Williams believes a &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Australia"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt; challenge to the laws was almost inevitable.

Telling ABC Radio that "I could not see that this legislation could operate for long without a challenge being made," 

The Federal Opposition Leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; calling on Mr Howard to exercise vigilance as it would exasperate Australian taxpayers if people mistakenly subjected to his anti-terror laws were then paid thousands of dollars in damages.

Interviewed by Melbourne’s &lt;a href="w%3AHerald%20Sun"&gt;Herald Sun&lt;/a&gt; Newspaper, he said, "You have to, when you are introducing laws like this, make absolutely certain there are checks and balances in it."

Mr Beazley also says that the Anti-Terror Laws aren’t the action the Government could be taking to protect Australians..

"We have yawning gaps, yawning holes in the protection of the Australian people."

He cited Australia's coastal borders as being unprotected, with habitual illegal fishing incursions, a sign of the country's vulnerabilities

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sunni%20leader%20claims%20Iraq%20vote%20was%20a%20%26quot%3Bfarce%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Saleh al-Mutlaq , spokesman for the National Dialogue Council, says his Sunni group does not accept the referendum report because; "We feel that this constitution is illegitimate and the referendum was not done in a correct way; therefore we want the referendum to be repeated in four provinces at least."

Al-Mutlaq also called the referendum "a farce" and said that government forces stole ballot boxes full of "no" votes in the mostly Sunni-Arab provinces. He claimed that 80 percent said "no" in &lt;a href="w%3AMosul"&gt;Mosul&lt;/a&gt;, the provincial capital of &lt;a href="w%3ANinevah"&gt;Ninevah&lt;/a&gt; where the outcome of the election was held in balance. "We believe that the results have been forged in Mosul, Diyala and most southern Iraqi governorates," Al-Mutlaq said.

Another Sunni politician, Hussein al-Falluji, called on the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; to intervene. He said, "Violence is not the only solution, if politics offers solutions so that we can move in that direction. But there is very little hope that we can make any gains in the elections." Falluji echoed concerns that Sunnis disaffected by the vote may join the insurgency inside Iraq.

However, Farid Ayar of Iraq's Independent Electoral Commission said before reading the official vote outcome that, "Whatever the results of the referendum are ... it is a civilized step that aims to put Iraq on the path of true democracy." 

Iraq officials reported that 97 percent of voters in the predominately Sunni province of al-Anbar and 82 percent of voters in Salaheddin province rejected the constitution. The 55 percent "no" vote in Ninevah was short of the 66 percent that would have defeated the referendum.

Shortly before the vote, the largest Sunni political party, the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Islamic%20Party"&gt;Iraqi Islamic Party&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to lend some support to the referendum in return for the inclusion of an option to amend the document. Lawmakers are to convene a body to consider further changes to the constitution before the new National Assembly vote in December. 

Sunni sects account for nearly 20 percent of the country’s population. Their large turnout for the referendum vote is in contrast to the low participation they showed in the January election which established the interim government.

This allegedly will complement the current services offered by Google.

Examples of contributions may include recipes, scientific findings, and other pieces of information one may wish to share. Several news agencies are reporting that Google Base will be used for classified ads. According to the Google Base website, which was made inaccessible to the public after a few hours, both were examples of entries you could post.

Google Base is expected to be a major competitor of &lt;a href="w%3Acraigslist"&gt;craigslist&lt;/a&gt;, which is partly owned by &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; media reported that Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt; suggested yesterday that the government would submit a draft to the &lt;a href="w%3ADiet%20of%20Japan"&gt;Diet&lt;/a&gt; to rewrite the Imperial Household Act within the next year. This is in response to a board of experts who have been investigating the succession issue.

The experts' Board on the Imperial Household Act, personally appointed by the Prime Minister, reached an agreement on the issue that an Empress should be accepted. Implementation of their recommendations would mean that succession to the highest position in Japanese society would occur without a gender bias.

At the present time, the Japanese imperial household has no male member under the age of 20; present law only allows male descendants to ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne. The proposed solution would put &lt;a href="w%3AAiko%2C%20Princess%20Toshi"&gt;Princess Aiko&lt;/a&gt;, the sole child of &lt;a href="w%3ANaruhito%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Japan"&gt;Crown Prince Naruhito&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMasako%2C%20Crown%20Princess%20of%20Japan"&gt;Crown Princess Masako&lt;/a&gt; in place as the most likely to inherit the position of monarch, following behind would be &lt;a href="w%3ASayako%2C%20Princess%20Nori"&gt;Princess Sayako&lt;/a&gt; who will leave the Imperial Household due to her planned marriage with a commoner.
Present law in Japan defines the succession as favouring male children; the last time the country had an Empress was in 1771, when &lt;a href="w%3AEmpress%20Go-Sakuramachi"&gt;Empress Go-Sakuramachi&lt;/a&gt; abdicated to her nephew.

Despite the fact that there is precedent for an Empress, some scholars have suggested family members who previously broke ties with the recognised royal family following the end of &lt;a href="w%3AWWII"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; should be considered for the succession, opening up the field of candidates even more. The group of scholars proposing this solution have stressed that their solution is aimed at maintaining the tradition of a male heir.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=First%20beta%20of%20Windows%20API%20%27Wine%27%20released&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After 12 years of work, the first &lt;a href="w%3ABeta%20version"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; version of &lt;a href="w%3AWine%20%28software%29"&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; (WINE = Wine Is Not an Emulator) , entitled "version 0.9", has been released today.

Wine is a &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt; implementation of &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%27s"&gt;Microsoft's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWin32"&gt;Win32&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAPI"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;. This means that it enables non-Microsoft &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20systems"&gt;operating systems&lt;/a&gt; to run software that was written for Microsoft's operating systems. Wine is not just a simple emulator, but a complete rewrite of the whole Windows API and standard libraries (DLL's).

Written by a community of developers, which includes some companies whose businesses are based on it, Wine runs on &lt;a href="w%3APOSIX"&gt;POSIX&lt;/a&gt; compliant operating systems such as &lt;a href="w%3AGNU/Linux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnix"&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt;-based operating systems. Wine allows a user of one of these operating systems to run Windows applications without having a copy of Microsoft Windows.

As the ♡❤beta♡❤ term suggests, more work is expected before the final release is made. The pre-release status of the software has not prevented some from using it for years to run a wide range of software, including modern games, office software, and news reading applications.

Wine is seen by advocates as an important tool for enabling people to migrate generally away from Microsoft's Windows operating system, or specifically to free software operating systems such as GNU/Linux and &lt;a href="w%3AFreeBSD"&gt;FreeBSD&lt;/a&gt;. If a piece of software that is important to a person or business is only available for Microsoft Windows, it can tie that person or business to using Microsoft Windows. Software such as Wine can free people of such ties (sometimes termed "&lt;a href="w%3Avendor%20lock-in"&gt;vendor lock-in&lt;/a&gt;").

Wine is distributed under the terms of &lt;a href="w%3AGNU%20Lesser%20General%20Public%20License"&gt;GNU Lesser General Public License&lt;/a&gt;. This means that the software can be freely used and redistributed, and its &lt;a href="w%3Asource%20code"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; can be studied, modified, and redistributed. It can also be integrated into software that does not grant these freedoms (&lt;a href="w%3Aproprietary%20software"&gt;proprietary software&lt;/a&gt;).

There are no direct competitors to Wine. The two most related software packages are &lt;a href="w%3AVMware"&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWin4Lin"&gt;Win4Lin&lt;/a&gt;, but neither is &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt;, and both require that a copy of Microsoft Windows is installed. Rather than working as an emulator, they allow for more than one operating system to be run simultaneously.

Two related products that are based on Wine are &lt;a href="w%3ACrossOver%20Office"&gt;CrossOver Office&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACedega"&gt;Cedega&lt;/a&gt;. Each is the flagship product of a company, &lt;a href="w%3ACodeWeavers"&gt;CodeWeavers&lt;/a&gt; focusing on office and &lt;a href="w%3ATransGaming%20Technologies"&gt;TransGaming Technologies&lt;/a&gt; focussing on games emulation, respectively. 

While neither product is entirely free software, CodeWeavers do contribute their modifications to the Wine software back to the Wine community.

<h1>France banning Skype from universities</h1>

&lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; has banned use of the &lt;a href="Skype"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; PC telephony application in Universities. The exact reason is unclear, but state security was one of the reasons given by the authorities responsible. Several other possible reasons have been cited including fears of research secrets being handed over to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that in order to make calls to the public phone network you pay a company in &lt;a href="Luxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; and not the local phone company. 

The Skype software uses an encryption algorithm that makes it next to impossible to monitor calls; this is frequently cited as &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s reason for banning the application.

Some media reports have suggested that French authorities are fearful that whilst they were unable to monitor calls made with Skype, they might be monitored by the US.

However, this version of facts, which has spread like wildfire, was promptly refuted by French authorities who called attention to the fact that the ban only applies to university research centers and laboratories, and not to the general student and faculty population. 

The real reasons behind the ban remains a hot point of debate and controversy, although public opinion in France is not sympathetic to Skype's new profile. Skype has recently been purchased by &lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which the French consider a mammoth e-company with questionable practices and a dubious reputation.

<h1>Suicide bomber strikes Israeli coastal town</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; police confirmed that a &lt;a href="w%3ASuicide%20Bomber"&gt;suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for a blast that killed five people and left many seriously injured. The Wednesday afternoon attack occurred in an open market place in the small costal Israeli town of &lt;a href="w%3AHadera"&gt;Hadera&lt;/a&gt;, a location which has been a frequent target of attacks in the five-year-old &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20uprising"&gt;Palestinian uprising&lt;/a&gt;.

The market place was busy with shoppers in advance of a Jewish Holiday, with many stocking up for the weekend. 

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporters on the scene say 20 have been injured, 6 are critical, 7 are serious, and the death toll is expected to rise. Television pictures are showing a scene of absolute devastation and confusion.

&lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Islamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad of Gaza&lt;/a&gt; has claimed responsibility, which was in response to an Israeli killing of Islamic Jihad commander Luay Saadi in the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, prompting armed groups to take revenge. In an interview with Ynet news, Abu-Muaman the Organization's leader stated ... "This attack is merely a preliminary response by the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; rebellious groups, and harder retaliation is on its way."

&lt;a href="w%3ASaeb%20Erekat"&gt;Saeb Erekat&lt;/a&gt;, a Palestinian negotiator, denounced the attack and said that he hoped the peace between the two sides would not be damaged.

Dr Ra'anan Gissin spokesperson for the Israeli PM, speaking on ♡❤CNN♡❤ is refuting claims that this is a revenge attack, claiming "that this is just another terrorist attack in the Palestinians' plan to rid the Middle East of Israeli."

Khader Habib, a spokesperson for the Islamic Jihad said that ... "The Islamic Jihad movement was committed to the truce, and is still committed to the truce, but this truce should be mutual. We cannot tolerate a one-sided truce."

The recently elected Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad called for Israel to be "eradicated from the map" and condoned the recent wave of Palestinian attacks in his speech today during a conference in Teheran titled "The World without Zionism."
&lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; has stated that the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; would "increase its efforts to ensure the continuation of the truce because it is in the interest of both the Palestinian and the Israeli peoples."

Mark Regev, a spokesperson for the Israeli foreign minsitry responded that "[Abbas] says the right thing... But if we have a criticism it's that he talks the right talk, we're waiting for him to follow through on these commitments. Now there have been some steps taken but we really need to see a serious disarming of these extremist groups."

On Tuesday, the Italian Parliament gave its final approval to the reform of the &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Auniversity"&gt;University&lt;/a&gt; system. The reform, entitled "Moratti reform", is named after the Minister for School and University, Letizia Moratti.

Protests were made before and during the Parliamentary process to approve the law; the city of &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; was partially blocked by several groups of students, professors and assistants demonstrating against the proposed legislation. The situation became serious when the protesters reached Montecitorio square, the location of the lower house of Parliament. The protestors contested several of the members of the government.

The opposition did not participate in the vote.

The reform is strongly opposed by professors, students and other staff, who claimed economical hardship would be caused by the law.

The minister Letizia Moratti opposed the reform. In a statement, Moratti claimed that the aim of the law is to reduce the privileges that some people have.

<h1>Australian anti-terror laws will be delayed</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20anti-terror%20laws%20will%20be%20delayed&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Stanhope"&gt;Jon Stanhope&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt; Chief Minister, is the first &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n state or territory chief to reject the &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;Howard Government's&lt;/a&gt; proposed &lt;a href="w%3A%20Australian%20Anti-Terrorism%20Bill%202005"&gt;anti-terror legislation&lt;/a&gt; in its current state.

He said he would not vote into law the ACT's part of the legislation, including extending &lt;a href="w%3Apreventive%20detention"&gt;preventive detention&lt;/a&gt; of terror suspects to 14 days, unless there were changes.

The &lt;a href="w%3A%20Australian%20federal%20government"&gt;Federal Government&lt;/a&gt; requires the support of a least four states to give the final legislation the go-ahead. If the Commonwealth proceeds with its laws without the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;ACT's&lt;/a&gt; co-operation - the territory could become the odd jurisdiction out, as the only one without preventive detention for people suspected of planning a terrorist attack.

"I'm quite happy to change it provided the situation is covered," Mr Howard told reporters in &lt;a href="w%3AMadang"&gt;Madang&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Islands%20Forum"&gt;Pacific Islands Forum&lt;/a&gt;. "I'm quite relaxed about the final form of the legislation, providing it delivers on the substance of the agreement." Mr Howard said he was not committed to introducing the changes next week, although he wanted them by Christmas.

&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Opposition Leader Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;, who was outraged that the Government had chosen &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Cup"&gt;Melbourne Cup&lt;/a&gt; Day as a cover to introduce the Bills, pointed out that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were at odds.

<h2>Constitutional Questions</h2>

The Australian PM has agreed to changes to Australia's controversial Anti-Terror Laws, after comments from his own Treasurer.

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, speaking to The Age Newspaper for the first time on the issue, apparently contradicted earlier statements made by the PM, saying, "Unfortunately nobody ever finally knows these things until such time as the court rules".

"Peter Costello contradicted John Howard today and went out there and said 'Well it might be unconstitutional but let's just sort of suck it and see'," Mr Beazley said to Melbourne’s Herald Sun newspaper.

Mr Howard said there was nothing of concern in legal advice from the Solicitor-General and he remained convinced the laws were constitutional, but did concede to changes to the so-called “shoot-to-kill” provisions for police.
&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Queensland Premier Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; welcomed Mr Howard's move on the shoot-to-kill clause and said he was confident all constitutional issues could be overcome.

<h2>Human Rights</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20and%20Equal%20Opportunity%20Commission"&gt;The Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission&lt;/a&gt;(HREOC) president is of the belief that the bill needs to be reconsidered because it is not in line with Australia's international human rights obligations.

HREOC is a national independent &lt;a href="w%3Astatutory%20body"&gt;statutory body&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Government"&gt;Australian Government&lt;/a&gt;. It has the responsibility for investigating alleged infringements under Australia’s anti-discrimination legislation.

The Head of HREOC says under the proposed laws the opportunity to challenge a detention order against an individual or a control order against the person's family is unrealistic, and has concerns about what happens to a person after they are subjected to a &lt;a href="w%3Apreventive%20detention"&gt;preventive detention&lt;/a&gt; order.

"They're not told why they're subject to it, nor is there any way in which they can go about challenging the facts upon which that order is made," he told the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;.

"That's the real, the most serious of the human rights issues in the whole procedure. There is no means of reviewing what has been done once its happened."

"&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20human%20rights"&gt;International human rights&lt;/a&gt; law requires that a person who is detained must have the right to challenge this detention in a court without delay. Review before the court needs to include: consideration of whether the order is based on a correct understanding of the facts; whether the detention is fair; whether it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances; and whether it is proportionate to the goal of protecting national security. The current form of the bill simply fails to meet these basic guarantees."

HREOC says a special court should be established to review enforcement provisions in the draft bill.

Stephen Dupont, the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n video journalist whose footage of &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; soldiers burning corpses in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; sparked worldwide controversy, is denying any claims made by others that the bodies in the footage were burned in a disrespectable fashion.

Dupont's video was first broadcasted by the Australian television network SBS earlier this month, showing footage of US soldiers burning bodies in a desertous region of Afghanistan. During an interview with the station regarding his footage, Dupont said, "They [ &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APsychological%20operations"&gt;PSY-OPS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ] used that as a psychological warfare, I guess you'd call it. They used the fact that the &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; were burned facing west [towards Mecca]. ... They deliberately wanted to incite that much anger from the Taliban so the Taliban could attack them. ... That's the only way they can find them." 

The issue has many questioning whether the burning of the bodies, which violate islamic principles, or the broadcasting of the PSY-OPS message violated sections of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Convention"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Some initial news report coverage seems to have interpreted the PSY-OPS broadcast that was stating that the bodies were burned "facing west", as a factual statement. On October 21, Dupont appeared on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; talk show ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Things%20Considered"&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ and clarified this point in an interview, reiterating that the bodies were either burned under orders from officials, or for hygiene concerns brought forth when locals did not retrieve the bodies. Dupont also corrected reports that the bodies were facing toward Mecca, saying: "Look, the bodies as far as I’m concerned, the bodies were lying on the ground, they weren’t facing anywhere, they were just lying there."

Both the Afghan government and the U.S. Army have begun investigations into the claims.

Police arrested over two dozen anti-war protesters for demonstrating without a permit in front of the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. 

The rally consisted of protestors organized in a "die-in", appearing to be deceased. The peace rally was performed shortly after reports that the death toll for U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq &lt;a href="Pentagon%20announces%202%2C000th%20U.S.%20military%20death"&gt;reached 2,000&lt;/a&gt;.

The left-leaning ♡❤MoveOn.org♡❤ led a national campaign to galvanize anti-war vigils. Organization members on their e-mail lists received a notice Wednesday that read: "Dear MoveOn member, Yesterday we reached the sad milestone of 2,000 killed in Iraq. But for the most part, the national media are ignoring this tragic milestone."

Phyllis Bennis of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Institute%20for%20Policy%20Studies"&gt;Institute for Policy Studies&lt;/a&gt; said that changes in U.S. public opinion are showing signs that peace activists are "beginning to give voice to the majority in this country." 

Among those arrested was activist &lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt;. She was arrested for the same offense in another anti-war demonstration just last month.

&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shiniwatra"&gt;Thaksin Shiniwatra&lt;/a&gt;, told journalists attending his weekly press conference that the government would be more aggressive in measures taken to counter insurgency in the country's provinces on the southern border with &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;.

His statement followed coordinated attacks by suspected militants in the provinces of &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20Province"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt;. 

At a time chosen for the likelihood of the predominantly &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; population to be at evening prayers in local mosques, armouries belonging to local village defense forces were raided. According to local media reports there were at least three deaths as well as several people injured &amp;mdash; some seriously. The casualties are said to consist of both insurgents and local villagers.

Thaksin said that the suspected separatists demonstrated "strong coordination" in the attacks, he stated that the authorities in the area should have new measures in place by November to aggressively address the issue. Despite strong words on the matter, the Prime Minister emphasized that, "the government will exercise most restraint and patience", and that the government's objective was to bring peace to the region.

President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHarriet%20Miers%20Supreme%20Court%20nomination%20and%20hearings"&gt;nominee&lt;/a&gt; for Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, &lt;a href="w%3AHarriet%20Miers"&gt;Harriet Miers&lt;/a&gt;, has withdrawn herself from the nomination. 

In a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/documents/miers/MiersResignationLetter.pdf"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; dated October 27, to President Bush, she wrote that "members of the Senate have indicated their intention to seek documents about my service in the White House," and that she "would be expected to testify about my service in the White House." 

Faced with mounting criticism of his nominee from numerous disparate organizations, within and outside the President's &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;, Bush acknowledged her resignation and critics by saying "It is clear that Senators would not be satisfied until they gained access to internal documents concerning advice provided during her tenure at the White House — disclosures that would undermine a President's ability to receive candid counsel. Harriet Miers' decision demonstrates her deep respect for this essential aspect of the constitutional separation of powers — and confirms my deep respect and admiration for her."

The Miers nomination was politically controversial because she is &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Counsel"&gt;White House Counsel&lt;/a&gt; and she was a personal lawyer to Bush when he was governor of Texas. Miers also has no experience as a judge. 

Since there was no record of how she might interpret the Constitution, members of the Senate &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt; requested detailed written replies to a series of questions probing her past. It became apparent that Senators wanted to review White House records documenting legal advice provided by Miers as part of her work for the Bush administration. 

President Bush has been seeking to replace the retiring Justice &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;, the first female Supreme Court Justice, since her July 1, 2005 letter stating she would retire "effective upon the nomination and confirmation of her successor."

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ians plan a nation-wide demonstration on Friday in support of their president's comments that called for the elimination of Israel. The demonstrations would coincide with the annual event called &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Quds%20Day"&gt;al-Quds Day&lt;/a&gt;, where the Israeli control of Jerusalem is protested. 

&lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; in a speech to 3,000 students in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; said Wednesday there was, "no doubt the new wave [of attacks] in Palestine will soon wipe off this disgraceful blot from the face of the Islamic world." At a conference called ♡❤"The World without Zionism"♡❤, the recently elected Iranian president Ahmadinejad said the establishment of Israel was, "a move by the world oppressor against the Islamic world," a reference to Western military and political pressure.

Ahmadinejad won the presidency in June with a populist approach that stressed &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; and revolutionary principles. The speech cited numerous references to the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Ruhollah%20Khomeini"&gt;Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt; and included a declaration that, "As the imam said, Israel must be wiped off the map." 

Other similar remarks, such as "God willing, the eradication of Israel would soon be realized through the continued wisdom of the Palestinian nation," have drawn wide condemnation.

France and Germany have summoned the respective Iranian ambassadors to their countries. A spokesperson for the British government called the remarks "deeply disturbing and sickening". The European Union said in a joint statement that "calls for violence, and for the destruction of any state, are manifestly inconsistent with any claim to be a mature and responsible member of the international community".

Israeli Prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; said that "a country that calls for the destruction of another people cannot be a member of the United Nations" and added: "Such a country that has nuclear weapons is a danger, not only to Israel and the Middle East, but also to Europe."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Secretary General &lt;a href="w%3A%20Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; expressed "dismay" over Ahmadinejad's remarks. In statements released by his secretary on Thursday, Annan, whose plans still include a visit to Iran within a month, said he would "place the Middle East peace process, and the right of all states in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force, at the top of his agenda for that visit." The U.N. Charter calls on all members to refrain from threats or force against the territorial integrity or political independence of another state.

A U.S. state department spokesman, Sean McCormick, said the United States would not support the call by Israel to eject Iran from the United Nations. McCormick's response was centered on issues of the enriched uranium processing in Iran, the human rights of its people, and alleged support for terrorism abroad.

The U.S. has had no formal diplomatic relations with Iran since the &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20Revolution"&gt;Islamic revolution&lt;/a&gt; of 1979.

A report aimed at assessing the credibility of statements made by Ottawa computer engineer, &lt;a href="w%3AMaher%20Arar"&gt;Maher Arar&lt;/a&gt;, confirmed that his account of &lt;a href="w%3ATorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; received while in &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; custody is credible. Steven Toope, the court-appointed author of the report wrote, "I am convinced that his description of his treatment in Syria is accurate" and concluded that "Mr. Maher Arar was subjected to torture in Syria".

In September 2002, when returning to Canada from a family trip to Tunisia, Mr. Arar was detained by U.S. officials in New York when transiting through the city's airport. Mr. Arar holds dual citizenship of Canada and Syria and was travelling on his Canadian passport. U.S. authorities decided to deport Mr. Arar to Syria, accusing him of having terrorist connections. He was detained by Syria for more than a year before Canadian authorities managed to arrange his repatriation. During this time he was interrogated and tortured.

According to Canadian Senator &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20De%20Ban%C3%A9"&gt;Pierre De Bané&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. officials first offered to return Mr. Arar to Canada on the condition that Arar would be incarcerated and charged immediately. Canada was unable to accept these conditions as they were not provided with sufficient evidence for the U.S. charges. The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Charter%20of%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms"&gt;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&lt;/a&gt; does not allow for "detention without proper grounds". After being held in New York for eleven days, U.S. officials deported Mr. Arar to Syria, a country with a longstanding history of torture and abuse of its prisoners.

During talks between the respective Foreign Ministers, &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n minister has expressed doubt that his country's President would be able to visit &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; due to opinion regarding Japanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="Junichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt;'s visit to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYasukuni%20Shrine"&gt;Yasukuni Shrine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister described the prospects for such a visit as "grim".

Ban is currently on a visit for talks with his Japanese counterpart, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANobutaka%20Machimura"&gt;Nobutaka Machimura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where he said that the "people of South Korea were disappointed" at the Koizumi's visit to the controversial shrine.

The Yasukuni Shrine is dedicated to the spirits of dead Japanese soldiers, originally constructed in 1869. The controversy arose as a result of the shrine honouring a number of convicted war criminals. The shrine's policy was to honour all fallen Japanese soldiers, which was not an issue at the time. However, the perception of the shrine in the eyes of some Asian countries occupied during the Second World War is that it is a rallying point for right-wing and nationalist groups within Japan. Japanese peace movements view the shrine in a similar light.

Japanese riot police were deployed on streets surrounding the Korean and Chinese consulates in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AFukuoka"&gt;Fukuoka&lt;/a&gt;, the largest city on the south-western island of &lt;a href="w%3AKyushu"&gt;Kyushu&lt;/a&gt;. Sound trucks belonging to right-wing nationalist groups were circling the area and the police presence appeared to be an effort to control these groups. Police officers on the scene declined to comment.

Relations between Japan and its neighbors have been tense due to Japanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Junichiro Koizumi's&lt;/a&gt; policy of visiting the &lt;a href="w%3AYasukuni%20Shrine"&gt;Yasukuni Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, where the remains of Japanese soldiers killed in wars since the mid-nineteenth century are interred. Koizumi visited the shrine on October 17. Convicted war criminals from the Second World War are also interred at Yasukuni, so Prime Ministerial visits have been severely criticized by other Asian leaders. Territorial disputes between China and Japan have also increased tension in recent months.

The website responded on Saturday by stating, "Their claims are completely frivolous" and that "&lt;a href="http%3A//www.scientomogy.info/index.html"&gt;scienTOMogy.info&lt;/a&gt; is a parody site showing the recent lunacy of Tom Cruise&amp;mdash;confusion of any kind with their site is literally impossible… We're keeping our domain… see you in court."

On September 14, the Church's law firm, Moxon &amp; Kobrin, responded via email that the scienTOMogy website domain was an infringement of their trademark that would cause a "likelihood of confusion" with their own, and thereby broke federal law. Specifically, the Church cited the &lt;a href="w%3ALanham%20Act"&gt;Lanham Act&lt;/a&gt;, 15 U.S.C. � 1125(a).

The Lanham Act contains the federal statutes governing trademark law in the United States. The Church would have to prove factors such as "proof of actual confusion", "product types, proximity and marketing", "their respective appearance and meanings", and "(bad) intention behind selecting the mark".

Glen Stollery, the website's owner hit back at the Church by stating, "We have researched this and believe their claims are completely without merit. The church can provide no proof as to any confusion regarding the sites. For instance, scientology.info does not even exist, so compared to scienTOMogy.info it is hardly a matter of someone hitting the wrong key. We also have a Full Disclaimer at the top of the front page and in the website's meta-tags stating that there is no connection between ourselves and the church. Not to mention the fact that the site is completely non-commercial in nature, and does not generate a single cent of revenue nor offers any services of any kind. It is a parody site showing the recent lunacy of Tom Cruise&amp;mdash;confusion of any kind with their site is literally impossible." 

Stollery continues "The non-commercial use of a trademark as the domain name of a website&amp;mdash;the subject of which is consumer commentary about the products and services represented by the mark&amp;mdash;does not constitute infringement under the Lanham Act." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/3B0C93358B88F28D88256FD90056994B/%24file/0455962.pdf%3Fopenelement"&gt;Bosley Medical Institute v. Kremer (9th Cir., Apr. 4, 2005).&lt;/a&gt; In this instance, we are even one step further removed as their trademark is "scientology" not "scienTOMogy" Their claims are completely frivolous."

If this is the case then it would not be the first time the law firm would be found guilty of filing frivolous complaints. In 1994, Helena Kobrin of Moxon &amp; Kobrin, counsel for the Church of Scientology, was ordered to pay sanctions in the total sum of $17,775 for filing a frivolous complaint in federal court. Stollery states on his website that he believes this is simply a way of "scaring any critics into instantly backing down at the prospect of costly lawsuits regardless of their innocence." In closing he says to the church "I'm calling your bluff. File your lawsuit we're keeping our domain… see you in court"

&lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Libby"&gt;I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, chief of staff to &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, resigned Friday following indictment on five federal felony charges. 

Mr. Libby is charged with obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury to a Grand Jury, and two counts of making false statements to the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt;'s investigation into the &lt;a href="w%3APlame%20affair"&gt;Plame leak&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Libby's resignation was accepted by Vice President Cheney. &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; also accepted Mr. Libby's resignation as Assistant to the President.

The indictment centers on Mr. Libby's grand jury testimony that he learned from media sources that &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20C.%20Wilson"&gt;Joseph Wilson&lt;/a&gt;'s wife, &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt;, worked under cover for the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;. The Justice Department says that Mr. Libby knew of Plame's covert status from at least four government officials, including Vice President Cheney, in the month prior to his talks with the press, but that he sought to hide that knowledge from the investigation. 

No charges were filed against White House advisor &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt;, but he remains under scrutiny in the on-going two year investigation led by Special Counselor &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;. The Seattle Post Intelligencer reported that late Friday, three people close to the investigation stated that the individual referred to in Fitzgerald's record as "Official A" was actually Karl Rove, the so called "senior official in the White House" who allegedly informed Libby on July 10 or 11 of 2003 that Plame was a CIA operative. The Washington Post is reporting that Rove's "fate" will be known soon.

All five charges stem from three conversations Mr. Libby had with reporters about Valerie Plame in 2003 between July 10 and 12: 
<ul>

Mr. Libby testified that Mr. Russert asked him if he knew Mr. Wilson's wife worked at the CIA, and that Mr. Russert told him all reporters knew about Mr. Wilson's wife.

</ul>
<ul>

BULLET::::- Mr. Libby spoke with &lt;a href="w%3AJudith%20Miller%20%28journalist%29"&gt;Judith Miller&lt;/a&gt; of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Mr. Libby again testified that the conversation was about other reporters, and he told Ms. Miller he was unsure Mr. Wilson's wife worked at the CIA.

</ul>

In a nationally televised press conference announcing the indictment, Special Prosecutor Fitzgerald likened the alleged falsehoods of Mr. Libby's testimony to sand being thrown in the face of a baseball umpire. The obstruction of justice count alleges that Mr. Libby made false statements while testifying before the grand jury, and attempted to mislead and deceive the grand jury by doing so.

The two false statement charges relate to FBI interviews conducted in October and November 2003. There is one charge for the July 10, 2003 interview with Mr. Russert, and another for the July 12, 2003 interview with Cooper. One perjury charges alleges Mr. Libby lied to the grand jury about his conversation with Mr .Russert. The second alleges he was lying when he testified to the grand jury that he had told reporters "I hear from other reporters Wilson's wife works for the CIA."

If convicted on all counts, Mr. Libby faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1.25 million fine. In a written statement delivered by his lawyer, Mr. Libby said "today is a sad day for me and my family" but is confident that he will be "completely and totally exonerated."

Vice President Dick Cheney called Mr. Libby in a written statement one "of the most capable and talented individuals I have ever known" and stressed that he is presumed innocent until proven otherwise.

President George W. Bush called the investigation "serious" and said that Mr. Libby "worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people and sacrificed much in the service to this country."

<h3>Background</h3>

In September 2003, CIA Director &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Tenet"&gt;George Tenet&lt;/a&gt; requested a Justice Department probe of the possibility that high officials of the Bush administration leaked to journalists the secret CIA identity of Plame. In December 2003, &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20J.%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick J. Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; was appointed Special Counsel in charge of investigating the leak of the identity of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame. A &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20jury"&gt;grand jury&lt;/a&gt; was convened to hear testimony from reporters and members of the Bush administration. The federal indictment suggests that Libby lied about what he told reporters Tim Russert, Matt Cooper, and Judith Miller. "When citizens testify before grand juries they are required to tell the truth," Mr. Fitzgerald said.

In February 2002, Joseph Wilson was asked to travel to &lt;a href="w%3ANiger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt; in order to investigate claims that Niger had sold &lt;a href="w%3Ayellowcake"&gt;yellowcake uranium&lt;/a&gt; to Iraq, a substance that - after a lengthy purification process - can be used to make a nuclear weapon.

On the 28th of January, 2003, President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; stated in his &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20the%20Union"&gt;State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; address that, "The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa." Much of the President's address was focused on building support for the War in Iraq, on the grounds that Iraq had been developing &lt;a href="w%3AWMD"&gt;Weapons of Mass Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, and this statement was a key part of the rationale to justify going to war. 

On July 6, 2003, Wilson wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times attacking the validity of Bush's assertion by describing how his experiences in Africa had led him to believe no such sale had taken place. He went on to accuse the Bush Administration of manipulating intelligence data in order to exaggerate the threat posed by Iraq. Ultimately, the White House was forced to retract the statement regarding Niger in the State of the Union address. 

On July 14th 2003, journalist &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Novak"&gt;Robert Novak&lt;/a&gt; published a news article that disclosed the identity of Valerie Plame as a CIA operative. Novak attributed the information about Plame's identity to "senior administration officials." After Novak's article was published, other news reporters speculated that Plame's identity as a CIA operative was leaked by the Bush administration in an effort to punish Mr. Wilson for his public criticism of the administration. Valerie Plame and Joseph Wilson are married, although Valerie had been using her maiden name "Plame" in her role as a covert operative rather than using her married name.

In June 2004, President George W. Bush was questioned about the leak by the Justice Department, but not in front of the Grand Jury. Bush first promised to fire anyone in his administration who leaked the CIA identity of Plame, then later qualified this as meaning that he would only act if it could be shown that a crime was committed.

With the Grand Jury scheduled to conclude its term in October 2005, reporter Judith Miller was jailed in July 2005 for refusing to reveal the source of the Plame leak. After 85 days in jail, Miller finally testified before the Grand Jury. Several reporters, including Miller and &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Cooper"&gt;Matthew Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, identified Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove and Dick Cheney's chief of staff Lewis Libby as Bush administration sources who revealed Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA operative.

The indictment comes at the same time as allegations mount that Vice President Cheney and his chief of staff Libby withheld crucial documents from the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Intelligence%20Committee"&gt;Senate Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt; as it was investigating the intelligence failure in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2004. &lt;a href="w%3AJerrold%20Nadler"&gt;Rep. Jerrold Nadler&lt;/a&gt; has requested to expand Fitzgerald's investigation to clear up if the actions in the CIA leak were just a part in a larger scheme to deceive Congress into authorizing war, who was involved and whether their actions were criminal.

The body of civil rights pioneer &lt;a href="w%3ARosa%20Parks"&gt;Rosa Parks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Rosa%20Parks%20dies%20at%2092"&gt;who died on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, will &lt;a href="w%3ALying%20in%20state"&gt;lie in honor&lt;/a&gt; at the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Capitol%23The%20Rotunda"&gt;Capitol Rotunda&lt;/a&gt;, a tribute usually reserved for deceased presidents and war heroes.

The Senate passed a resolution on Thursday for Parks to lay in the Rotunda on Sunday and Monday so that "the citizens of the United States may pay their last respects to this great American". The House of Representatives approved the resolution today.

Parks will be the first woman to be honored in this way.

Senate Majority leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt; said allowing Parks to lie at the Capitol is "a testament to the impact of her life on both our nation's history and future". Minority leader &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; said that Parks' actions "changed not only our country, but the entire world, as her actions gave hope to every individual fighting for civil and human rights." Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Dodd"&gt;Christopher Dodd&lt;/a&gt; added that Parks "is not just a national hero, she is the embodiment of our social and human conscience and the spark that lit the flame of liberty and equality for African Americans and minority groups in this country and around the globe".

Meanwhile, officials in &lt;a href="w%3AMontgomery%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, the place of her historic act of defiance, and &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, her later home and deathplace, ordered that the first seat of every public bus will be reserved to honor Parks until her funeral, which is set for Wednesday.

In the morning of 30 October 2005, &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; with other countries from &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; will switch to Official Winter Time. Thus, 04:00 AM will become 03:00 AM and will be valid until 26 March 2006 when the Official Summer Time will be again used. 

Following Romanian Government's Decision nb. 20 from 1997, Romania adopts Winter Time and Summer Time in the same day with the states of &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and other countries part of this deal. Official Winter Time is adopted in the last Sunday of October and the Summer Time in last Sunday of March.

Usually, the official time of a country is Winter Time. Summer Time is a legal time adopted by some countries or territories during a part of a year. Summer Time is usually one hour in front of Standard Official Time.

This system is used for &lt;a href="w%3ADaylight%20Saving%20Time"&gt;daylight-saving&lt;/a&gt;. During summer months, the time is moved forward in order to use as much sunlight for human activities, as well as to save &lt;a href="w%3AElectricity"&gt;electric energy&lt;/a&gt; used for &lt;a href="w%3Alighting"&gt;lighting&lt;/a&gt;.

In Romania, Summer Time was first introduced in 1932. Until 1939 this worked yearly from the first Sunday of April (in 1932: 22 May) 00:00 AM and the first Sunday of October 01:00 AM (local time). From 1 April 1940 00:00 AM and 2 November 1942 03:00 AM, Summer Time was permanent in Romania. From 1943 the Summer Time was suspended and Romania used just Official Time (Winter Time).

Summer Time was reintroduced from 1979 and guided by two rules until the alignment to European Standards:
<ul>
BULLET::::- 1979&amp;ndash;1983: first Sunday of April 00:00 AM &amp;ndash; last Sunday of September 01:00 (exception: 1979, Summer Time was started in 27 May);

The BBC and CNN has reported that a train derailment Saturday morning at about 4:15 a.m. local time (Friday 2245 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) has resulted in at least 100 casualties in the state of &lt;a href="w%3AAndhra%20Pradesh"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; in Southern India. Heavy rains, which killed over one hundred people in India this week, apparently washed out a section of track. A rescue operation is ongoing as some train carriages overturned into the flood waters and some people are apparently trapped. The BBC reports that many of the passengers were traveling to celebrate &lt;a href="w%3ADiwali"&gt;Diwali&lt;/a&gt;, the festival of lights, which occurs Tuesday.

India operated rail systems carry more than 13 million passengers a day, but has a poor history of safety. The BBC says that about 300 rail accidents are reported each year, resulting in significant casualties.

&lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; residents are claiming that &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; bombings and shootings into Syrian territory are much worse than being acknowledged by either the Syrian or U.S. governments; with Syrian civilians (including children) being killed regularly. 

"The government [of Syria] has kept this a secret because they don't want to be embarrassed," said Joshua Landis, a Fulbright Scholar living in &lt;a href="w%3ADamascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;. "It's the ultimate sign of their weakness, because they can do nothing about this," said the professor from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oklahoma"&gt;University of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;.

One resident of the Syrian town of Abu Kamal said Americans bombed a local house, killing a six-year-old boy. "They killed five or six people this month, every month, but the media doesn't report it. I don't understand." he said.

Yesterday, U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said that Syria is an "outlaw regime."

U.S. officials have acknowledged killing Syrians with U.S. fire, but said their forces have not actually gone across the border.

"They shoot at us here every day, sometimes they're mistakes, sometimes they're not," said Syrian border guard Ibrahim Brahim. "The Americans want to show their power...If we poke our heads up, they shoot."

In May, a U.S. helicopter fired across the border and killed Abdullah al-Hassaki, a Syrian border guard, according to Syrian officials. U.S. Army Lt. Col. Barry Venable ,at the pentagon, would not comment on the allegation but said "the Syrian border with Iraq has been troublesome for some time."

One of the repeated allegations against Syria has been that it has not done enough to secure the Iraq border. The Syrian government makes the point that it has done a lot of work on the border while the U.S. led coalition has done nothing to secure the Iraqi side of the border. Syria's Major-General Amin Suleyman took foreign journalists to the border yesterday to show evidence of what it has done and what the coalition has not done. Syria has created a sand wall running along most of the frontier and built more border posts. The General said they could be doing an even better job if Britain had delivered the night vision goggles which they promised. The larger problem, according to Suleyman, is the complete absence of any regular border security (Iraqi or U.S.) on the Iraq side of the sand wall. 

"Syria did all that was required of it (regarding the border), and all that it was able to do..but we've seen nothing from the other side." Gen. Suleyman said.

Foreign diplomats based in Damascus confirm that Syria has increased its border security, and state that the flow of foreign fighters crossing from Syria into Iraq has slowed to a trickle, estimated to be 35 a month.

, seven-time Tour de France champion and partner of singer Sheryl Crow, has criticized Tour director Jean-Marie LeBlanc for his comments that next year's race will be more exciting without him. LeBlanc said Thursday, "It is a change of era. A period of long domination is over. The path is open. It is an exciting time."

On Saturday night, Armstrong hosted &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;'s satirical TV show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASaturday%20Night%20Live"&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, making light of the allegations. During the opening of the show, Armstrong said: "The last time I did something too good, the French started testing my urine every 15 minutes!" Armstrong's Fiancee, Sheryl Crow, also appeared on the show.

&lt;a href="w%3A29%20October%202005%20New%20Delhi%20bombings"&gt;Three bombs&lt;/a&gt; shook the &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday in crowded marketplace bazaars within minutes of each other, killing at least 61 people, according to recent reports. The national government is on high alert. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement in response to the attack, saying, "India will win the battle against terrorism."

The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reports that ten people have been detained in the investigation into the blasts. Police say they are making progress into the investigation and that it appears the same group was behind all three incidents. 

In addition to the reported deaths, 210 people have been injured in the blasts in central and south Delhi, according to recent reports. With &lt;a href="w%3ADiwali"&gt;Diwali&lt;/a&gt;, the Hindu festival of lights being celebrated Tuesday, the bomb blasts have sent ripples across the nation. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh blamed terrorists for the blasts, but verification of responsibility has not occurred. The blasts, first thought to be masterminded by Lashkar-e-Toiba, a group which India claims is supported by Pakistan, were later asserted by a group called "Inquilab". The blast had all the hallmarks of being carried out by well-funded terrorist groups supported by Pakistan, however its foreign ministry said in a statement: "Pakistan strongly condemns the terrorist attacks in Delhi, which have resulted in the loss of a number of innocent lives."

The bombings came just as India and &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; were beginning to recover from the shock of this month's &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Kashmir%20earthquake"&gt;Kashmir earthquake&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Earlier violence</h2>

Last May, one person died and 49 were wounded by bombs at two Delhi cinemas; the attack was blamed on Sikh militants.

Delhi was the location of a terrorist attack in December 2001. The 2001 event was blamed on Islamic militant groups backed by Pakistan, although Hindu-Muslim conflicts have usually occurred in the disputed region of Kashmir.

<h1>Opposing a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Opposing%20a%20nuclear%20waste%20dump%20in%20the%20Northern%20Territory&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A protest against a proposed nuclear waste dump is continuing this week in Australia's &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Territory"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt;. The traditional owners of the site in the &lt;a href="w%3AArrernte"&gt;Arrernte&lt;/a&gt; Nation say they will continue to protest against the facility near the Stuart Highway about 20 kilometres north of Alice Springs.

The Federal Government wants an operating licence for a new reactor in Sydney, to replace the ageing &lt;a href="w%3AHIFAR"&gt;Lucas Heights facility&lt;/a&gt;. One of the key conditions for the operating licence of a new reactor is the establishment of a viable waste management plan. In July the federal government announced a short list of three locations in the Northern Territory as potential sites for a radioactive waste dump. The Government wants a facility to store and manage low and intermediate level radioactive waste resulting from the medical, industrial and research use of radioactive materials by Commonwealth agencies.

Traditional owners of Athenge Alhere - an estate group of the Arrernte Nation - have voiced their dissent to the nuclear dump and say they don’t want waste from Sydney’s Lucas Heights nuclear reactor brought to their land. "Because the land we take care of, because all our ancestors lived in this land and hunted on this land as well, so it's mainly because of the animals and the next generation of our kids and their children, so we still say no," traditional owner Benedict Stevens said. 

The Medical Association for Prevention of War condemned as "scaremongering" the claims by Federal MPs that the health of Australians would be in jeopardy if a nuclear waste dump was not imposed on the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth Government.

The three proposed sites include:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Fishers Ridge, a defence site 42km south-east of Katherine.
BULLET::::- Harts Range, a defence site 165km north-east of Alice Springs.
BULLET::::- Mount Everard a defence site 27km north-west of Alice Springs.

</ul>
The NT Government cannot prevent the dump from proceeding, as all three sites are all on Commonwealth land. Although the Northern Territory Parliament has passed legislation banning the storage or transport of any nuclear waste, the Federal Government is able to use its external affairs power to override the legislation.

The Federal Government abandoned locating the dump in South Australia and Western Australia following local opposition.

A final decision is expected to be made by the end of 2006, with the preferred site to be operational by 2011.

&lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have partnered to start production on a desktop search program for corporate users. 

Previously, IBM's OmniFind could only look inside standard applications such as &lt;a href="w%3AOracle"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, and Google's Desktop Search program didn't have any extensive network capabilites. The end product of this collaboration will allow for searching managed databases, as well as many unmanaged files, such as personal e-mails, Microsoft Word documents, and rich media files, within corporate servers.

"Getting these two products together makes sense for both of us," David Girouard, general manager of Google's enterprise business unit. "If you want to have a good corporate search product, you have to have desktop search," he said.

No exchange of money has been made between the two companies, and this announcement comes only a few weeks after Google announced its partnership with Sun Microsystems, Inc. Some speculate that Google is making a move to directly challenge Microsoft Corp. in the field of PC Desktop software.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Former advisors to Brazilian Minister of Finance &lt;a href="w%3AAntonio%20Palocci"&gt;Antonio Palocci&lt;/a&gt; have claimed that three million US dollars from Cuba were used in the 2002 political campaign of &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt;. The accusation was printed by the Brazilian magazine &lt;a href="w%3AVeja"&gt;Veja&lt;/a&gt; in its issue circulating this week.

According to Veja, Rogério Buratti, Palocci's secretary in the early 1990s during the period when Palocci was mayor, claims that Ralf Barquete (another advisor to Palocci) had asked him to find a way to bring money from &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. 

Another source, economist Vladmir Poleto who had also worked for Palocci, claimed to have brought the three million from &lt;a href="w%3ABras%C3%ADlia"&gt;Brasília&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ACampinas"&gt;Campinas&lt;/a&gt; by plane. He stated the money was hidden in whiskey boxes: Johnnie Walker Red Label and Black Label and Havana Club (a Cuban brand of rum). Barquete received the money at the Campinas airport Viracopos. Afterwards he claims the money was transferred by car to São Paulo and delivered to &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Workers' Party&lt;/a&gt; treasurer &lt;a href="w%3ADelubio%20Soares"&gt;Delubio Soares&lt;/a&gt;. 

Workers' Party President Ricardo Berzoini has responded saying that the accusation is false. And Lula's aide Gilberto Carvalho has said the story is "absurd". 

According to the blog of &lt;a href="w%3AFolha%20de%20S.%20Paulo"&gt;Folha de S. Paulo&lt;/a&gt; reporter Josias de Souza, Palocci and Lula are worried about the interviews being aired on Brazilian television.

The president of the &lt;a href="w%3APPS"&gt;PPS&lt;/a&gt;, federal deputy &lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Freire"&gt;Roberto Freire&lt;/a&gt; (Pernambuco
state), has stated that his party will ask the Electoral Justice investigatory agency and the Public Ministry to begin a investigation into the charge. The parties &lt;a href="w%3APFL"&gt;PFL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APSDB"&gt;PSDB&lt;/a&gt; are also considering demanding an investigation.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%20narrows%20choice%20to%20Supreme%20Court&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Reuters is reporting that &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; is expected to announce his choice to replace &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.

The ♡❤Chicago Tribune♡❤ reports that President Bush narrowed his short list of Supreme Court nominees to two, with a possible third. The two top individuals in consideration are &lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20A.%20Alito%2C%20Jr."&gt;Judge Samuel Alito&lt;/a&gt; of New Jersey and &lt;a href="w%3AJ.%20Michael%20Luttig"&gt;Judge Michael Luttig&lt;/a&gt; of Virginia. &lt;a href="w%3APriscilla%20Owen"&gt;Judge Priscilla Owen&lt;/a&gt; of Texas may remain as a third possibility. Reuters late Sunday also listed Appeals Court Judges &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20McConnell"&gt;Michael McConnell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEdith%20Jones"&gt;Edith Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAlice%20M.%20Batchelder"&gt;Alice Batchelder&lt;/a&gt; as possibly under consideration. CBS added that the list may include Appeals Court Judge Karen Williams and Michigan Supreme Court &lt;a href="w%3AMaura%20D.%20Corrigan"&gt;Justice Maura Corrigan&lt;/a&gt;.

The nominee, when and if confirmed, would succeed &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Justice Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; who announced her retirement in July. This latest nomination process was made necessary when &lt;a href="w%3AHarriet%20Miers"&gt;Harriet Miers&lt;/a&gt; withdrew from consideration.

Since Congress returned from summer recess, there have been significant changes at the court. When Justice O'Connor originally announced her intention to retire, President Bush nominated &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20G.%20Roberts%2C%20Jr."&gt;Judge John Roberts&lt;/a&gt; to replace her. However, when &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Rehnquist"&gt;Chief Justice Rehnquist&lt;/a&gt; died in September from thyroid cancer, Roberts became the replacement for the Chief Justice.

Both Alito and Luttig are viewed by many as staunch conservatives with strong qualifications. The debate over either conservative candidate is expected to be largely partisan, unlike the Harriet Miers nomination that was widely criticized by both legislative parties for her lack of judicial experience.

Samuel A. Alito, age 55, has served as a judge on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia since 1990. J. Michael Luttig, age 51, has served as a judge on the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond since 1991. Both were originally nominated by President George Herbert Walker Bush.

Maxim Kuzmenko, a mathematics and informatics student of &lt;a href="w%3AMoldova%20State%20University"&gt;Moldova State University&lt;/a&gt;, will be representing the Republic of Moldova at the World Cyber Games to be held in Singapore on November 16. The young man won the qualification War Craft computer game tournament held in Chisinau recently.

Moldova WCG Committee Chairman Mr. Vladislav Lyahov says Kuzmenko has few chances to win at the forthcoming world championship. However, the experience of participation in such grand assemblies and learning more about computer aces' game strategies is simply priceless, he said.

Selective tournaments in Moldova were held in 4 computer games most popular here. The winners in other game competitions will participate in respective World Cyber Game tournaments.

In Moldova, the qualifications gathered nearly 300 aspirants aged 15-24, including women, from all over Moldova.

Russian peacekeepers will stay in the &lt;a href="w%3ATransnistria"&gt;Transnistrian region&lt;/a&gt; until adoption of a political decision on change of their mandate, Russian Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Ivanov"&gt;Sergei Ivanov&lt;/a&gt; has told &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; journalists. Also, Ivanov claims that Russia does not insist on an exclusive right to peacekeeping mission in the region, although Chisinau's appeals to change the make-up of the operation have not received support and have not been introduced in the agenda of the negotiations from October 27-28.

In a discussion with Russian journalists Prime Minister Vasile Tarlev accused Tiraspol of illegal sale of Russian weapons (that would have been used in Beslan too), but his statement was refuted by Russian and Chechen officials.

Ivanov stated: "I stake my life that no munitions left the Russian military bases". Transdniestria has its own army that can defend very well its own depots, Ivanov added.

Minister Ahmed Dakaev, Chechnya's Deputy Home Affairs, as stating that he knows nothing about the sale of munitions from Transdniestrian to &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt;. He qualifies these statements as political.

Of the Transdniestrian foreign department Vitalie Ignatiev said rumors about the illegal sale of weapons from Transdniestrian exist for more than 15 years but nobody could prove it. He has also refuted Moldovan Prime Minister’s statements and sought evidence.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOSCE"&gt;1999 OSCE summit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; had obliged the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops and ammunition from Moldova. Russia interrupted the process two years ago under pretext that Tiraspol delays the withdrawal of weapons from the region.

&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Beta"&gt;Hurricane Beta&lt;/a&gt; hit the &lt;a href="w%3ANicaragua"&gt;Nicaraguan&lt;/a&gt; coast early on Saturday, sending powerful rain and winds their way.

Although it lost some speed during landfall, Beta was still a Category 2 hurricane, with winds of up to 110 Mph (175 kph) and was expected to dump up to 15 inches of rain. Residents from the local coastal fishing villages rushed into flimsy makeshift shelters as the hurricane approached.

"We had a very bad night. The water leaked in, the children were cold. They brought us here without telling us anything. We don't have food or water," Norma Smith, a mother of six, said on Sunday morning.

Neighboring &lt;a href="w%3AHonduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; declared a national emergency, and planned to evacuate 125,000 people. However, residents in the isolated coastal regions are usually wary of outsiders, and many failed to heed the warnings.

"These people do not believe in danger until they really feel it," said Col. Mario Perez-Cassar, the head of Nicaragua's civil defense.

Emergency officials say there have been no deaths so far, but the projected path of Beta takes it straight across Nicaragua, raising the possibility of lethal mudslides in mountainous areas. 

Beta, which was not expected to hit the United States, was the 23rd hurricane this year, more than any Atlantic season on record. This season has also seen more storms than at any point since record-keeping began in 1851. The previous record of 21 was set in 1933.

Last week Tropical Storm Alpha formed, the first time a letter from the Greek alphabet has been used because the list of storm names was exhausted.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; approved a US$9.8 million Competitiveness Enhancement Project (CEP) for the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Moldova"&gt;Republic of Moldova&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. The approved amount represents a US$4.90 million credit and a US$4.90 million grant. The credit is offered under IDA terms, the World Bank Moldova Country Office has reported.

The overall objective of the Competitiveness Enhancement Project is to assist Moldova in enhancing the competitiveness of enterprises through improvements in the business environment and making adequate standards, testing and quality improvement services available to enterprises.

"The project will help the Government of Moldova to implement the business regulatory reform that had been started earlier," said Irina Astrakhan, World Bank Task Manager for the Project. "It will also assist the government to begin modernization of the national standards and quality system, leading to improved competitiveness of the Moldovan economy in domestic and international markets and more attractiveness for foreign direct investment."

The &lt;a href="w%3ACEP"&gt;CEP&lt;/a&gt; Project has four components -- business environment improvement; modernization of measurements, standards, testing and quality (MSTQ) system; facilitation of enterprise access to MSTQ services; and facilitation of access to finance.

"The Project will bring about unquestionable benefits to the economic environment in Moldova by focusing on stability within the framework of business regulation, the promotion of adequate legislation, access to product certification services in line with the standards set by the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, encouragement of an innovative potential for enterprises, and facilitation of access to funding by means of various up-to-date mechanisms", said Mr. Valeriu Lazar, the Moldovan Minister of Economy and Trade.

The enterprise sector, especially SMEs, will be the primary beneficiaries of this project. The Ministry of Economy and Trade Business Regulatory Reform Commission and Secretariat, the Service for Standardization and Metrology, the National Institute for Standardization and Metrology, the Accreditation Center for Conformity Assessment of Products and other institutions of the MSTQ infrastructure will also be helped by the project.

The total cost of the CEP Project is US$14.3 million. In addition to the World Bank credit and grant, the project will also be financed by the Government of Japan in the form of grant amounting to US$4.5 million. The Project implementation period is 4 years, from January 2006 to December 31, 2009.

Since Moldova joined the World Bank in 1992, Bank commitments to the country total approximately US$592 million for 29 operations.

U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; nominated Judge &lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20Alito"&gt;Samuel Alito&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="w%3AAssociate%20Justice%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Associate Justice&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; in a formal announcement at 8 a.m EST (13:00 UTC) this morning.

Bush called Alito one "of the most accomplished and respected judges in America" and stressed that he has "more prior judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years."

Alito is currently a judge at the 3rd Circuit Appeals Court in Philadelphia. He is viewed as a staunch conservative and has been compared to current Supreme Court justice &lt;a href="w%3AAntonin%20Scalia"&gt;Antonin Scalia&lt;/a&gt;.

The nominee, when and if confirmed, would succeed &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Justice Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; who announced her retirement in July. This latest nomination process was made necessary when &lt;a href="w%3AHarriet%20Miers"&gt;Harriet Miers&lt;/a&gt; withdrew herself from consideration after being met with harsh criticism among &lt;a href="w%3ADNC"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGOP"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; lines alike.

The debate over the conservative candidate is expected to be largely partisan, unlike the Harriet Miers nomination that was widely criticized by both legislative parties for her lack of judicial experience.

Alito, 55, has served on his circuit court since 1990 and was originally nominated by President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Herbert Walker Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Volpe"&gt;Joe Volpe&lt;/a&gt;, Immigration Minister of Canada, has set a goal of 255,000 immigrants in 2006 and a longer term goal of 300,000 by 2010. In 2004, there were 236,000 new immigrants and in 2005 that number is expected to increase to 245,000. The Cabinet must approve the immigration target plan.

There are reportedly 700,000 applications currently in the queue and it can take up to four years for an application to be processed to its conclusion. Canada announced the new immigration plan to clear the backlog on April 18, 2005.

Volpe argues that Canada needs to begin thinking of the Immigration Department as vehicle for recruiting given the country's demographics and associated labour needs.

This Tuesday the fifteen-member &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; unanimously adopted a resolution calling for &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; to cooperate fully with the UN International Independent Investigation Commission (UNIIIC). The Security Council demanded that Syria detain suspects indentified by the UNIIC until such time as they could be questioned. The resolution warns of "further action" if Syria fails to cooperate with the investigation.

Ministers from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, were circulating a draft of the resolution with stronger wording on action in the event that Syria failed to cooperate. After the vote US Secretary of State, &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, said: "With our decision today, we show that Syria has isolated itself from the international community through its false statements, its support for terrorism, its interference in the affairs of its neighbours and its destabilising behaviour in the Middle East."

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; had signaled they opposed wording the resolution in a way that threatened sanctions. Chinese Foreign Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALi%20Zhaoxing"&gt;Li Zhaoxing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , told the council, "The commission itself believes that the investigation is yet to be completed and there is no final conclusion. Under such circumstances it is inappropriate for the council to prejudge the outcome of the investigation and to threaten to impose sanctions." 

The final wording was endorsed by all 15 members of the Security Council.

Syria had earlier rejected the findings of the UN investigation into the murder of the former Lebanese prime minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARafiq%20al-Hariri"&gt;Rafiq al-Hariri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"It is a political statement against Syria based on allegations by witnesses known for their hostility to Syria," Mehdi Dakhlallah, Syria's information minister, told Aljazeera.

Kansas has been denied permission to use two key documents commonly used in the writing of science education standards for states, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Science%20Education%20Standards"&gt;National Science Education Standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (published by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Research%20Council"&gt;National Research Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) and Pathways to Science Standards (published by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Science%20Teacher%20Association"&gt;National Science Teacher Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). The respective organizations argued that they could not grant the state of Kansas permission to use these documents in the current form of the Kansas Science Educational Standards, as these overemphasize controversy between the scientific theory of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEvolution"&gt;Evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the argument of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIntelligent%20Design"&gt;Intelligent Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Moreover, the organizations criticize that the standards in their current form distort the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilosophy%20of%20Science"&gt;definition of science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science"&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has expressed its support for the decision to deny Kansas the use of copyrighted material, as "the proposed standards misrepresent both the content and the standing of evolution as a scientific organizing principle".

Proponents of Intelligent Design have characterized the refusal as "an effort to censor the discussion of scientific criticism of Darwinian theory by intimidation and threat". 

This is likely to further delay the ratification of the final vote on the Kansas Science Educational Standards as they will have to be rewritten either to not violate any copyright restrictions or modify their account of evolution and outlook on science. According to University of Kansas professor Steve Case, rewriting the standards will be very difficult, as "there is copyrighted material on every page" of the current document.

This is the second time that Kansas was denied the right to use copyrighted materials in their state standards, following the case in 1999, when Kansas included &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACreationism"&gt;Creationism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a precursor of Intelligent Design, into the school curriculum. A later school board overturned that directive. 
The dispute in Kansas has brought nationwide responses, ranging from a rebuke by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science"&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the creation of internet-sensation &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlying%20Spaghetti%20Monsterism"&gt;Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mythology (which is lobbying the Kansas School Board to give equal time teaching their creationism theory as well.)

The Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;, has denied that his department had notification of sexual abuse allegations made by the Australian &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; detainee, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; in 2003/2004.

"I'd like to see the evidence for this, and we would ask those who make the claims to present us with the evidence, let us look at the evidence, because obviously we are opposed to rape," he said after the &lt;a href="w%3AFour%20Corners%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Four Corners&lt;/a&gt; current affairs TV program presented an exposé relating to the alleged reasons for the detention of David Hicks at Guantanamo Bay. The program included an interview with David Hicks' father Terry Hicks who said that David had told him that the Americans gave him injections and then penetrated him anally with various objects.

Mr Downer's claims were contradicted by Hicks' military lawyer, &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20Michael%20Mori"&gt;Major Michael Mori&lt;/a&gt; who said that an Australian official was present during an interview that was part of the US investigation in 2004 and David Hicks had detailed the issues of being assaulted during that interview. Mr Downer declined to answer these claims when approached by the ABC Radio program &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20World%20Today"&gt;The World Today&lt;/a&gt; but a department official confirmed the Government's position that it was not aware of Mr Hicks' torture claims.

The Labor Party opposition Foreign Affairs Spokesman, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; said in an interview on &lt;a href="w%3ALateline"&gt;Lateline&lt;/a&gt; that Mr Downer "has just washed his hands of these matters" and that he had "adopted a posture of leave it to the Americans and trust the Americans. But when it comes to Guantanamo Bay, with due respect to our friends in Washington, I don't think that's good enough.". Mr Rudd is calling for an independent third party such as the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement"&gt;International Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the claims.

The 2005 &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Cup"&gt;Melbourne Cup&lt;/a&gt; has been won by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMakybe%20Diva"&gt;Makybe Diva&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Second was ♡❤On A Jeune♡❤ and third placegetter was ♡❤Xcellent♡❤.

The Melbourne Cup is the richest &lt;a href="w%3Ahorse%20race"&gt;horse race&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, with prize money in 2005 of A$5,000,000, and is one of the richest horse races in the world. It is run annually on the first Tuesday of November at &lt;a href="w%3AFlemington%20Racecourse"&gt;Flemington Racecourse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, over a distance of 3,200 meters (which is slightly under 2 miles). An estimated crowd of 140,000 flocked to the Flemington Racecourse to watch the race.

This is the first time in the history of the race, first held in 1861, that the same horse has won the race three times. With this being the third consecutive year that ♡❤Makybe Diva♡❤ has won the Melbourne Cup, comparisons are now being made to legendary Australian horse ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APhar%20Lap"&gt;Phar Lap&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Four other horses have won the race twice, of which three won it in consecutive years.

♡❤Makybe Diva♡❤ was ridden by Glen Boss, and was &lt;a href="w%3AHorse%20trainer"&gt;trained&lt;/a&gt; by Lee Freedman. Freedman said on the morning of the race that a win would be a "Herculean task" to achieve. 

The owners of ♡❤Makybe Diva♡❤ received A$3,000,000 in prize money, as well as trophies valued at A$100,000. A$750,000 was awarded to the second placegetter, and A$375,000 to third place, with the remaining prize money distributed amongst the fourth through the tenth placegetters.

&lt;a href="Moldova"&gt;Moldova&lt;/a&gt;n President Vladimir Voronin accused the &lt;a href="Transnistria"&gt;Transnistrian&lt;/a&gt; authorities on Saturday of having supplied &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n weapons to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; during the regime of &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, Russian news agencies have said.

Chisinau "holds official documents from the chancellery of Saddam Hussein, which show that Transnistria had supplied both arms, and entire weapon manufacturing lines to Iraq," Voronin told a group of Russian journalists, adding that an investigation on this case is under way. “Russia’s control over this territory is obvious and we must call to account those who do not desire to solve this conflict”, Voronin added.

“About two billion dollars are being laundered every year in Transnistria and no one wants to give up this source so easily,” Vladimir Voronin said. Being asked what Russia must do to help solve the conflict, the Moldovan President said that it must take the munitions from that territory. “We consider this depot a political shield that supports the Transnistrian regime,” the President emphasized.

Voronin added Moldova can prove Tiraspol sold weapons to Iraq. The document from Hussein’s archive that can confirm this is being studied by the Moldovan authorities now, he said.

Voronin accused Moscow to settle this regional conflict, noting that Russian weapons are "a political coverage to protect the Transnistrian regime." The Moldovan leader noted that he has sent a package of documents to Russia regarding the activity of 13 Transnistrian military companies.

On the other hand, Moldovan Premier Vasile Tarlev accused Thursday the Russian troops in Transnistria of supplying weapons to the Chechen region, In reply, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov said that he "pledges his head" for Russian bases in Moldova, and assured that "no weapons from Transnistria had been sent."
<h3>Transdestrian reply</h3>
Of the Transdniestrian foreign department Vitalie Ignatiev said rumors about the illegal sale of weapons from Transdniestrian exist for more than 15 years but nobody could prove it. He has also refuted Moldovan Prime Minister’s statements and sought evidence...

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Organisation"&gt;Australian Security Intelligence Organisation&lt;/a&gt;, and the Federal government of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have settled out of court with a couple whose house had been raided a couple weeks after the 11 September 2001 attacks against the Pentagon and the World Trade Center towers in the USA.

ASIO, a domestic counter-intelligence service, mistakenly raided the couples house when they had a search warrant for another house.

The couple were detained for an hour and claimed they were assaulted, wrongfully detained and experienced severe shock when, according to their claims, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Organisation"&gt;ASIO&lt;/a&gt; officers threatened to destroy their door and then held them at gun point.

It is also claimed that until an hour after the attack, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Organisation"&gt;ASIO&lt;/a&gt; officers would not allow Mrs. Fatme Iali to put on her clothes. As compensation, the couple asked the court for Aus$1.5 million in damages. Although it is unknown how much Bilal Daye and his wife received in the out of court settlement (under the terms of the deal, the settlement cannot be disclosed), they stated that they were satisfied with the result. 

"Just relieved, I can take care of my family now, that's all I wanted," Mr Daye said.

Mr Daye's solicitor Stephen Hopper said the victory was very important for civil rights, but suggested that close scrutiy of government actions was required in the future. 

"What this case demonstrates is that ASIO can be held accountable ... the government can be held open to scrutiny," he said. 

"Control orders can be slapped onto a person before the evidence can be tested in court ... they should have to justify why such orders and restrictions should be put on a free person before they do it."

"The government's got to be scrutinised for all of its actions and if they make a mistake they should be held accountable."

Mr Hopper argued that the proposed &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Anti-Terrorism%20Bill%202005"&gt;Anti-Terrorism Bill&lt;/a&gt; could prevent media reporting of incidents such as this. 

"If the new laws were brought in and it was an issue of preventative detention no probably not, no," he said

"If it's an issue of an ASIO warrant, under section 34d of the ASIO Act, no, you wouldn't and the Government's got to be scrutinised for all of its actions and if they make a mistake they should be held accountable," he added.

It is unclear what implications it could have for websites like Wikinews, which are hosted on servers outside Australia.

Mark Russinovich, of SysInternals.com, has discovered a so-called "&lt;a href="w%3Arootkit"&gt;rootkit&lt;/a&gt;" which is installed by &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony's&lt;/a&gt; new &lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20rights%20management"&gt;digital rights management&lt;/a&gt;-protected music compact disks (CDs). A rootkit is a common name for malicious software that is used by computer criminals to hide their presence on a compromised computer. Rootkits frequently contain hidden files and are designed to be difficult for the user to detect and remove.

Russinovich classifies Sony's rootkit as &lt;a href="w%3Amalware"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt; because it is alleged to introduce several serious security holes, one of which can be exploited to hide files and prevent the user from removing them. In particular, all executable files which begin with '$sys$' are hidden when the software is installed. He points out that these security holes could be exploited by hackers, or other malware producers besides Sony.

Russinovich explains that naively removing the files will result in a crippling of the operating system on the user's computer. He provides an explanation of the difficult step required to remove Sony's malware. 

Playing the same CDs on computers not running the Windows operating system, or on a non-computer based CD player remains safe. As removing Sony's malware would violate the &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;'s anti-circumvention provisions, &lt;a href="w%3Aripping"&gt;ripping&lt;/a&gt; the CDs on computers running a non-Windows operating system may be the best legal and technically safe option for those who wish to listen to them under Windows.

The software is automatically installed when a Sony CD is played on a computer, and is not mentioned in their EULA. The rootkit has been commercially developed by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.first4internet.co.uk/"&gt;First 4 Internet&lt;/a&gt; and licensed to Sony. 

Other rights management techniques used by music publishers recently include breaking the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Book%20%28audio%20CD%20standard%29"&gt;Red Book&lt;/a&gt; compact disc standard format. This technique causes many CD players to not be able to play the new CDs, but also protects against casual ripping. &lt;a href="w%3AFiona%20Apple"&gt;Fiona Apple's&lt;/a&gt; recent album release in the United States uses such technology.

&lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; say they are ready to unify on the athletic field. For the first time, senior sports officials say the two countries will compete as a combined team in the next &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOlympics"&gt;Olympics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

North and South Korea's top athletes will go for the gold as part of the same team during the 2008 Olympics in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and in the 2006 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20Games"&gt;Asian Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADoha"&gt;Doha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Senior athletic officials from both countries confirmed the news on the sidelines of the ongoing East Asian games in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMacau"&gt;Macau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

North Korean team representative Kim Yeong Min says the united team will be a powerful display for the world. Mr. Kim says the unified team will show the world that North and South Korea are one nation.

North and South Korean athletic teams have marched together in several past athletic opening ceremonies, but never competed as a unified team.

The Korean peninsula has been divided by the world's most heavily fortified border since the communist North fought the capitalist South in a 1950&amp;ndash;53 war. But contacts between the two Koreas have increased in a gradual warming of relations since an historic 2000 summit in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APyongyang"&gt;Pyongyang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Sports-related cooperation is part of a broader strategy of North-South engagement supported by the South Korean government.

The two Koreas are expected to work out details of the combined team in a meeting next month in the North Korean border city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKaesong"&gt;Kaesong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The location has come to symbolize South Korean economic engagement with the North, because it is the home of a South Korean industrial joint venture with Pyongyang. It is also where &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeoul"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; opened its first government liaison office in North Korea last week.

Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer denied his department knew of sexual abuse allegations by Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks. He made his remarks after a TV exposé aired which included an interview with David's father Terry Hicks who described the abuse. Mr Downer's denials were contradicted by Hicks's military lawyer who said an Australian official was present during a US investigation interview in 2004, and David Hicks had detailed being assaulted during that interview.

&lt;a href="UN%20calls%20for%20further%20Syrian%20cooperation"&gt;UN calls for further Syrian cooperation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The United Nations Security Council has adopted a resolution calling for Syria to cooperate fully with the UN International Independent Investigation Commission. The Security Council demanded that Syria detain suspects indentified by the commission until they could be questioned. The resolution warns of "further action" if Syria fails to cooperate with the investigation.

&lt;a href="Bush%20nominates%20Alito%20to%20U.S.%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Bush nominates Alito to U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
U.S. President George W. Bush has nominated Samuel Alito to become an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Alito is currently a judge at the 3rd Circuit Appeals Court in Philadelphia and is viewed by many as a staunch conservative. This latest nomination process was made necessary when White House counsel Harriet Miers withdrew herself from consideration after being met with harsh criticism among Democrat and Republican lines alike.

Today, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Secretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; renewed his denial to grant a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; commission access to inmates at the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantánamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; detention center. Last week the United States offered to let United Nations representatives visit the detention center, but they refused to let United Nations representatives visit the entire detention facility or interview detainees.

The United Nation's Special Rapporteur on torture, Manfred Nowak, told reporters on Monday that even China does not impose such conditions for United Nations visit of detention centers and that the United Nations could not accept an offer to visit the United States facility under conditions that are different from other nations. Nowak did show willingness to compromise on other controversial questions as the duration of the visit, which is limited to one day, and which individual United Nations representatives would be involved in the visit.

The United States has voiced objections to two of the proposed team of five United Nations inspectors: Leandro Despouy, Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and Paul Hunt, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Paul Hunt in particular has expressed strong suspicion of torture having occurred in Guantánamo. Those approved include Nowak from Austria in position as Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Asma Jahangir from Pakistan as Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and Leila Zerrougui from Algeria as Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on arbitrary detention.

The United Nations has been requesting access to the naval base for four years. The United States has explained that the restrictions placed on the UN visit are due to the nature of the ongoing &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terrorism"&gt;War on Terrorism&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; met behind closed doors on Tuesday under &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pressure to investigate the intelligence that led to the war in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The rare parliamentary rule invoked by the Democrats forces the removal of all media, staff, and tourists from the chamber. Congress will stop working on legislation temporarily.

Senate Minority Leader &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; stated that a private session was justified by the fact that the indictment of Lewis Libby showed how the administration manipulated the intelligence in order to justify the War on Iraq. President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; made his case on the war by citing U.S. intelligence showed Iraq with the possessions of weapons of mass destruction. Both the &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; weapon inspector team and the U.S. military found no such weapons.

Conservatives saw the unusual maneuver as a ploy to distract the public from President Bush's recent nomination of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20Alito"&gt;Samuel Alito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and dismissed the investigation, which has been in the news over the past several days with the resignation of Vice President Cheney's aide &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScooter%20Libby"&gt;Scooter Libby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after the disclosure that Libby lied under oath about leaking information that would provocate war between Iraq and the U.S.

<h1>Gomery report on Sponsorship Program released</h1>

Justice John Gomery has released a preliminary report into &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASponsorship%20scandal"&gt;Sponsorship Program&lt;/a&gt;, which was run from 1996 to 2003 by the federal Public Works Department to win support for &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federalism"&gt;federalism&lt;/a&gt; in Quebec. The program has recently come under fire for allegedly scandalous practices and has been accused of being a front to reward Liberal Party supporters. 

The issue came to a head in the spring of 2002, when the Globe and Mail, using Canada's Access to Information Act, discovered that $550,000 had been paid to Groupaction Marketing for a report that could not be located.

Former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Chr%C3%A9tien"&gt;Jean Chrétien&lt;/a&gt; then ordered Auditor General Sheila Fraser to look into the matter, who promptly launched a full investigation with assistance from the &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt;. In 2004, Fraser's audit was released and found that over $100 million was incorrectly paid to communications agencies rather than for social and cultural events which was the original intention of the program.

According to Fraser, officials "broke just about every rule in the book."

Under intense criticism from both the public and opposition parties Prime Minister Paul Martin launched a public inquiry into the scandal which was to be headed by Justice Gomery.

The report found evidence of political involvement in the handling of the program, and found an "implicit link between the contributions and the expectation that the government contracts would be awarded."

The report also claims that Chrétien holds some personal responsibility for the mismanagement. "Since Mr. Chretien chose to run the program from his own office," the report reasoned "he is accountable for the defective manner in which the sponsorship program and initiatives were implemented."

Among those accused of wrongdoing are Jean Pelletier (Chrétien's former chief of staff), Chuck Guité (the bureaucrat in charge the program), Jacques Corriveau (president of &lt;a href="w%3APluriDesign"&gt;PluriDesign&lt;/a&gt; Canada), and Jean Brault (president of &lt;a href="w%3AGroupaction"&gt;Groupaction&lt;/a&gt;).

A small group of people gathered in protest outside the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; at midday. The group was protesting the proposed &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Anti-Terrorism%20Bill%202005"&gt;Anti-Terrorism Bill&lt;/a&gt;, calling upon &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Premier Iemma&lt;/a&gt; not to support the laws. The protest was organised by the &lt;a href="w%3AGreens%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales Greens&lt;/a&gt; and was addressed by several speakers, including &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Rhiannon"&gt;Lee Rhiannon&lt;/a&gt;, an elected Greens parliamentarian from the New South Wales Legislative Council.

One protester carried a placard which read: "Terrorism Laws=Fascism!" She compared the proposed legislation to the &lt;a href="w%3AEnabling%20Act%20%28Germany%29"&gt;1933 German Enabling Act&lt;/a&gt;, saying "It is the most basic rule of democracy is that you have the right to legal representation and Hitler took that away, that was &lt;a href="w%3AHabeas%20corpus"&gt;Habeas corpus&lt;/a&gt; as it was called, in 1933 legislation and from that moment on thats when everything began. They could remove people, anyone who objected anyone who was a witness, anyone who tried to find out what happened could also be removed."

"John Howard's terror law would not make Australia safer", Lee Rhiannon said in her speech, "They will not stop a London style bombing occurring in Australia and that's what we need to remember. This is another one of John Howards's lies. Let's remember weapons of mass destruction, (and) &lt;a href="w%3AChildren%20overboard"&gt;children overboard&lt;/a&gt;."

The Australian government introduced anti-terror laws after September 11, and has sought to extend those laws in the wake of the &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;London train bombings&lt;/a&gt;. 

The government claimed in a media release today that it has this week received specific information about a terrorist threat to Australia. 

"The Government has received specific intelligence and police information this week which gives cause for serious concern about a potential terrorist threat. The detail of this intelligence has been provided to the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Minister for Homeland Security," the release said. 

The government claims that the new bill is intended to improve the ability of intelligence services and the police to counter this threat. 

"The Government is satisfied on the advice provided to it that the immediate passage of this bill would strengthen the capacity of law enforcement agencies to effectively respond to this threat," the release said. 

Dr Andrew Lynch, Project Director of the Terrorism and Law project at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gtcentre.unsw.edu.au/projects_partners/projects/tal/index.asp"&gt;Gilbert &amp; Tobin Centre of Public Law&lt;/a&gt;, has said that Rhiannon has raised some valid issues regarding some of the provisions in the proposed legislation. 

"It is difficult to see how many of [the provisions] will enhance our security. For example, the bans on free speech will only drive inciting and hateful messages under ground which must make the job of security forces harder in identifying real threats. The restrictions on family members knowing about the detention of their children is not conceivably going to improve our safety. There is a lot to be said for the view that depriving people of their liberty on the basis only of 'reasonable suspicion' might well fuel feelings of alienation amongst some groups which could be harnessed by extremists," Dr Lynch said.

Australian agencies under the responsibility of the federal Treasurer, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, spent approximately $17,000 &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; on massage services in 2004, namely the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Bowen"&gt;Christopher Bowen&lt;/a&gt; asked the Treasurer for details on massage services in a question on notice, and received the answer on October 31. 

637 ASIC staff made use of massages, compared with only 50 in the ABS, who however spent more on massages than ASIC. ABS staff paid $15 for 15 minutes and $10 for 10 minutes, while ASIC staff paid only $10.86 per massage.

Tempers are flaring in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3AKansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, where a school board may be on the verge of passing a measure to require that &lt;a href="w%3Aintelligent%20design"&gt;Intelligent Design&lt;/a&gt; be taught in public school science classes.

Christian political activists such as Reverend Jerry Johnston of First Family Church in Overland Park Kansas are supporting the effort to shape Kansas science standards according to religious beliefs. Johnston said, "Getting intelligent design into school curricula is the worthiest cause of our time and the key to reversing the country's moral decline."

In an apparent attempt to make the inclusion of Intelligent Design into the curriculum seem foolish, "believers" in the &lt;a href="w%3AFlying%20Spaghetti%20Monster"&gt;Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;/a&gt; are lobbying the Kansas school board, calling for it to require that creation by the Flying Spaghetti Monster be taught alongside &lt;a href="w%3ADarwinism"&gt;Darwinism&lt;/a&gt; and Intelligent Design. 

Bobby Henderson, the creator of "pastafarianism", said "I think we can all look forward to the time when these three theories are given equal time in our science classrooms… One third time for Intelligent Design, one third time for Flying Spaghetti Monsterism, and one third time for logical conjecture based on overwhelming observable evidence."

Several members of the Kansas Board of Education have already indicated that they might vote in favor of such an initiative. Board member Carol Rupe wrote, "The new version (of science standards) changes the very definition of science from 'seeking natural explanations' to 'seeking logical explanations.' That is why I think FSMism is able to be included. It is as 'logical' as any other theory."

In 1999, Kansas also wrote &lt;a href="w%3ACreationism"&gt;Creationism&lt;/a&gt;, a precursor of Intelligent Design, into the public school curriculum. A later school board, however, overturned that directive.

New terror amendments are to be rushed through Australian Federal Parliament based on new threats recently revealed by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Organisation"&gt;Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO)&lt;/a&gt;. The government claimed in a media release today that it has this week received specific information about a terrorist threat to Australia.

"The Government has received specific intelligence and police information this week which gives cause for serious concern about a potential terrorist threat. The detail of this intelligence has been provided to the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Minister for Homeland Security," the release said. 

The government claims that the new bill is intended to improve the ability of intelligence services and the police to counter this threat. 

"The Government is satisfied on the advice provided to it that the immediate passage of this bill would strengthen the capacity of law enforcement agencies to effectively respond to this threat," the release said. 

The opposition leader, Kim Beazley, has been briefed by the Prime Minister on the nature of the threat, and has pledged that Labor will support the amendments. 

The amendments are separate to the proposed &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Anti-Terrorism%20Bill%202005"&gt;anti-terror legislation&lt;/a&gt;.

Some commentators noted that the nation's security alert level had not been escalated as a result of the new information and remained at "medium" and a subsequent interview with the Attorney-General, &lt;a href="w%3APhilip%20Ruddock"&gt;Philip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ALateline"&gt;Lateline&lt;/a&gt; appeared to indicate that there was in fact no information about a specific imminent threat.

Greens' Senator Bob Brown noted that there are already laws that could deal with a specific imminent threat: "Whoever these unnamed people are, they can be arrested, they can be interrogated for up to seven days, they can be charged under the current crimes act." he said.

The government has a track record of presenting misleading information to the public for political ends as in the infamous &lt;a href="w%3AChildren%20overboard%20affair"&gt;children overboard affair&lt;/a&gt; when refugees where vilified by ministers of the Australian government, including the Prime Minister, on the basis of false evidence.

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Blunkett"&gt;David Blunkett&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWork%20and%20Pensions%20Secretary"&gt;Work and Pensions Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, resigned following a meeting with &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; today. 

Public pressure had been growing on Mr. Blunkett to resign after revelations emerged that he had broken the British Ministerial Code of Conduct in relation to his large shareholdings and short-lived directorship in a company called DNA Bioscience. It is the second time Blunkett's has been forced to stand down from office, having previously stepped down as home secretary last year over claims that his office fast-tracked a visa application.

A member of the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrat"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; party, &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Mulholland"&gt;Greg Mulholland&lt;/a&gt; said "I think he's done the right thing &lt;nowiki&gt;[in quitting]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, having done several quite blatantly wrong things". In an interview with the Sheffield Star yesterday, Blunkett declared that he would not resign, insisting that he had "done nothing wrong."

Blunkett's replacement was named as &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hutton"&gt;John Hutton&lt;/a&gt;, previously &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Duchy%20of%20Lancaster"&gt;Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;.

At least thirty-three more people have died in a second day of protests in &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;. Reuters put the figure at twenty-three.

According to incoming reports police forces opened fire on stone-throwing youths who were engaged in protest.

The protests were called in reaction to the results of the parliamentary elections held in May which many opposition figures maintain were rigged. When the election results were first declared in June riots erupted in which 36 people died.

The latest series of protests come as the parliamentary session is scheduled to begin. The opposition party, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20for%20Unity%20and%20Democracy"&gt;Coalition for Unity and Democracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called the protest and refused to take their seats until new and transparently organised elections are held, and mass arrests of opposition activists cease. The party said that six of its top officials, including chairman Hailu Shawel and vice-chairman Berhanu Nega, had been detained. 

30 taxi drivers who took part in demonstrations against the parliamentary elections were arrested and had their licenses revoked. 

Authorities have jailed at least two journalists and increased censorship of media coverage of anti-government protests, reports the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20to%20Protect%20Journalists"&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . On 2 November, police arrested two editors and a reporter from the independent Amharic-language weekly Hadar. Many other journalists have gone into hiding and much of the independent press has stopped publishing on orders from the police.

The &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reports that an anonymous source in Black Lion Hospital told their reporter that most of the dead had been shot in the chest. One eye-witness at the hospital claims that the police fired randomly into the crowd.

The dead were all shot by riot police and opposition spokesman Gizachew Shiferaw said police used excessive force. The previous day, however, two of the dead were police shot by protesters. The Government accuses the opposition of attempting to topple the government, and dismissed an assessment by &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; monitors that the elections failed to meet international standards.

A record number of 11 MPs were ejected from the Australian Parliament during the uproar that ensued the introduction of the government's controversial industrial relations legislation.

The opposition Industrial Relations Spokesman, Stephen Smith said that the speaker had only applied his ruling to the opposition side of the house and said that "My impression sitting in the chamber was that there was plenty of noise coming from both sides".

The new bill of nearly 700 pages sees the end of Australia's 100 year old wage fixing system and will push more workers onto individual contracts, allowed award conditions like penalty rates to be bargained away and removed unfair dismissal laws for most workers.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20industrial%20relations%20legislation%2C%202005"&gt;industral relations reform legislation&lt;/a&gt;
made up of 700 pages of bill legislation and 500 additional pages of explanatory memoranda was introduced into the Federal &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; November 2, where the Opposition heatedly attempted to address their perceived problem of the Government's lack of discussion and debate over the matter.

The &lt;a href="w%3Afirst%20reading"&gt;first reading&lt;/a&gt; of the bill was the first order of the day, and when &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Andrews"&gt;Kevin Andrews&lt;/a&gt; tried to do so, Opposition member &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Smith"&gt;Stephen Smith&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for workplace relations, immediately moved a motion deferring the bills to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation. The &lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20House"&gt;Leader of the House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; moved that Smith and the necessary supporter &amp;mdash; viz., &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Gillard"&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; be not further heard (&lt;a href="w%3Acloture"&gt;cloture&lt;/a&gt;). The Government's majority in the House ensured that this would happen. However, Opposition members attempted to use House standing orders necessitating that copies of the bill to be "available to Members", with argument arising whether "available to Members" meant all members or simply whether some copies should be available; this ended up in a dissent motion moved against the &lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Speaker of the House&lt;/a&gt;.

Later, in a heated &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt;, where six members of the Opposition, (&lt;a href="w%3AKelly%20Hoare"&gt;Kelly Hoare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Irwin"&gt;Julia Irwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Ripoll"&gt;Bernard Ripoll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACatherine%20King"&gt;Catherine King&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AGavan%20O%27Connor"&gt;Gavan O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;), were removed from the Chamber during Question Time under standing orders for disruption &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="w%3AJill%20Hall"&gt;Jill Hall&lt;/a&gt; quipped that she was "glad to be still here to ask [her] question" &amp;mdash; nearly all questions to the Government put by the Opposition, the subsequent time for matters of public importance, and some members in the adjournment debate, was all on the topic of the industrial relations reform. 

To implement and fund the legislation, the government will "spend an additional $486million on industrial relations changes over four years, or $121million a year. This spending would be in addition to the present annual budget of $86million." said an unnamed government source for ♡❤The Australian♡❤.

The government will need to use its &lt;a href="w%3ACorporations%20Act%202001"&gt;corporation powers&lt;/a&gt; to remove the powers from the states to alter the award conditions and other employee employer related conditions. But the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; has received legal advice that the legislation maybe unconstitutional, the reason being its being used to end the role of the states and territories &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20States"&gt;Australian States&lt;/a&gt; in the industrial relations system. "It is our view that the Commonwealth is misusing this law to achieve exactly what it was designed to prevent", Iemma said. Mr Iemma will be challenging the changes in the high court with &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie Premier&lt;/a&gt; of Queensland supporting his challenge in the &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Australia"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; police have declared that the numerous bomb threat e-mails circulating the city today were all hoaxes. The messages warned of a late afternoon bomb attack at Town Hall station. 

There were unconfirmed reports of evacuations at Town Hall Station, although it is not clear whether these were officially sanctioned, or just the result of word-of-mouth.

The police stated that there have been no evacuations. The Deputy Police Commissioner has said that the threats were "nothing more than a hoax", appealed for calm, and says that if any credible threats are received, the public will be kept informed and dealt with appropriately.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; has issued a report warning that a bird flu pandemic could cost the Asian economy up to $283 billion and lead the region into recession. 
The report has identified the tourist, transport and retail sectors of the Asian economy as being particularly vulnerable to the effects of such an outbreak. World Bank economist Homi Kharas noted that, "One large shadow looms over the generally positive economic outlook we have sketched out... and that is avian flu." 

The report, published twice annually by the World Bank, admitted than Asia's recent growth was going to slow down slightly anyway in 2006 (due to higher oil prices and tighter monetary policy), but that a bird flu epidemic could make this partial slowdown much worse.

The report comes just days ahead of an Asian political summit, where the foreign ministers of many of the countries already affected by the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; virus are expected to agree to even closer co-operative measures to help stall the advance of the virus. The foreign ministers of &lt;a href="w%3ACambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALaos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABurma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; have already agreed to closer co-operation to contain the virus and develop a vaccine.

<h1>Teaching Intelligent Design: Incumbent Dover PA school board fails reelection</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Teaching%20Intelligent%20Design%3A%20Incumbent%20Dover%20PA%20school%20board%20fails%20reelection&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ADover%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Dover, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; school board became the first to mandate inclusion of &lt;a href="w%3AIntelligent%20Design"&gt;Intelligent Design&lt;/a&gt; in a public school biology curriculum. For this year's November 8 election, Republicans fielded a pro-Intelligent Design slate of candidates including some returning candidates who had previously voted to include a statement about Intelligent Design in the biology curriculum. A mixed slate of Democrat and Republican candidates came forward as an alternative group of school board candidates, the Dover CARES coalition. They proposed to remove Intelligent Design from the biology curriculum but allow discussion of Intelligent Design in courses dealing with philosophy and comparative religion. 

All eight open school board seats were won by Dover CARES coalition candidates. Two candidates who had previously voted as school board members to include intelligent design in the public school science curriculum received the fewest votes in Tuesday's election. One of the newly elected board members is Bryan Rehm, a parent of a Dover school student. Rehm, along with ten other parents, initiated a law suit against the school board for its decision to insert Intelligent Design into the science curriculum.

In October 2004, the Dover school board decided that Intelligent Design is a scientific theory that should be mentioned in biology classes that include discussion of biological &lt;a href="w%3Aevolution"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; as part of the course content. The board mandated that a statement should be read in those classes stating "Intelligent Design is an explanation of the origin of life," and "The school leaves the discussion of the Origins of Life to individual students and their families."

The school board's statement on Intelligent Design directs students to the book ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOf%20Pandas%20and%20People"&gt;Of Pandas and People&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as a source of information "for students who might be interested in gaining an understanding of what Intelligent Design actually involves." This book is published by the &lt;a href="w%3AFoundation%20for%20Thought%20and%20Ethics"&gt;Foundation for Thought and Ethics&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit organization founded for the purpose of "promoting and publishing textbooks presenting a Christian perspective."

Parents of some Dover public school students filed a &lt;a href="w%3AKitzmiller%20v.%20Dover%20Area%20School%20District"&gt;lawsuit against the school board&lt;/a&gt;, charging that including the school board's statement on Intelligent Design was an attempt to introduce religion into the science curriculum. The book ♡❤Of Pandas and People♡❤ says, "Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency." The original complaint in the law suit against the school board claimed that "Intelligent design is a non-scientific argument or assertion." 

The US District Court Judge John Jones, who heard the non-jury case, hopes to make his ruling by the end of the year. The evidence phase of the trial ended on November 4, 2005.

A local Dover newspaper, the ♡❤York Daily Record♡❤, editorialized that Dover voters should take trial testimony into account during the general election when they could cast votes for school board members along with other elective offices.

Biology teachers in the Dover schools have refused to read the school board's statement on Intelligent Design to students because the Pennsylvania state code for education states that "The professional educator may not knowingly and intentionally misrepresent subject matter." In a letter to their administrator, the teachers stated their view that "Intelligent design is not science." School administrators have been reading the school board's Intelligent Design statement to students in Dover public schools.

The uprising continued Thursday in the suburbs of &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, where residents have set fire to buildings, cars, and buses and shot at police and firefighters. Reports indicate that at least nine people have been injured as a result of the violence. 

Numerous uprisings have been reported in over 20 Paris suburbs, all of which are towns with large African immigrant populations, poor education, health, and infrastructure, and long histories of police brutality and deportations.

French President &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; met with his administration on Wednesday to discuss the current situation. However, there has been no announcement regarding strategies to suppress the violence. The communities are calling on riot police to be withdrawn, since they are serving primarily to incite further confrontation.

The uprisings erupted when two teenagers, 15 and 17 years of age, died of electrocution in a power station where they were hiding to escape an ID check from police. A third is seriously injured. 

The uprising gained force and spread across the country after riot police tear gassed the women's prayer room of a mosque on the holiest night of Ramadan, then called women "whores" as they emerged, choking.

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; stepped up use of &lt;a href="w%3ASonic%20boom"&gt;sonic boom&lt;/a&gt; raids against civilian communities in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; this week. The Guardian reported that during the past week, Israeli jets created 28 sonic booms by flying at high speed and low altitude over the Gaza Strip. The sonic booms usually occurred 1-2 hours apart during nighttime hours. According to the Palestinian Health Ministry, the sonic booms have led to miscarriages and heart problems. Buildings in the area have also been damaged, including the ♡❤Chairman Arafat shop♡❤ in Gaza City. Israeli citizens living in communities around Gaza have also complained of the booms. The United Nations filed a letter of protest with the Israeli government, alleging that the tactic is an abuse of human rights. 

Israel defended its raids, saying the booms are designed to be a show of force against militant groups in the region. According to the Guardian, an anonymous senior Israeli army intelligence source says that the sonic booms were being administered to break civilian support for armed Palestinian groups. "We are trying to send a message in a way that doesn't harm people. We want to encourage the Palestinian public to do something about the terror situation," he said. "What are the alternatives? We are not like the terrorists who shoot civilians. We are cautious. We make sure nobody is really hurt."

The Gaza Community Mental Health Programme filed a suit this week in the Supreme Court. Eyad El Sarraj is a psychologist and director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme. He told the Guardian Unlimited, "The Israelis do it after midnight and then every one or two hours. You try to go to sleep and then there's another one. When it happens night after night you become exhausted. You get a heightened sense of alert, waiting continuously for it to happen. People suffer hypertension, fatigue, sleeplessness."

"For children, the loud noise means danger. Adults may know it's only a sound but small children feel threatened. They are crying and clinging to their parents. Afterwards they are dazed and fearful, waiting for something to happen."

&lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Libby"&gt;I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby&lt;/a&gt;, former chief of staff to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Vice President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, pleaded not guilty before the U.S. district judge, Reggie Walton, in Washington's E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse on Thursday, in response to his indictment regarding the &lt;a href="w%3APlame%20affair"&gt;CIA leak scandal&lt;/a&gt;. 

"With respect your honor, I plead not guilty," Libby said.

Libby's lawyers addressed reporters following the arraignment. "In pleading not guilty he has declared to the world that he is innocent. He has declared that intends to fight the charges in the indictment, and he has declared that he wants to clear his good name," said attorney &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Wells"&gt;Ted Wells&lt;/a&gt;. "He wants to clear his good name, and he wants a jury trial," Wells added.

The former vice presidential aide was indicted by Special Prosecutor &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; last week on two counts of perjury, one count of obstruction of justice, and two counts of making false statements. The indictments focus on whether he attempted to cover up his actions during the investigation instead of whether he illegally leaked the identity of undercover &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; agent &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt;. After being charged, Libby immediately resigned his position.

In an independent report released today, the National Audit Office has accused Learndirect and its administrators Ufi (University for Industry) of being 'too bureaucratic' in their administrative processes. They say that the administrative structure is too large, and should be streamlined. This should free more money to spend on students.

However, they have praised Learndirect, saying that they have 'pushed the boundaries of learning' in a short time frame.

Sir John Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office issued this statement:

"Learndirect is a major innovative feat that within a few short years has become the largest education provider of its type in the world. It is attracting large numbers of learners who otherwise would not have undertaken learning.

Management and administration costs have reduced with time but still take up too large a portion of the budget. They need to be streamlined so that more money can go into services for learners, and to increase the emphasis on small- and medium-sized businesses.”

An anti-American rally in &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; became violent Friday when rioters clashed with police, set street bonfires and destroyed storefronts over six square city blocks. Earlier there was a peaceful march by about 10,000 demonstrators who listened to &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt;, Venezuelan President, urge them to fight U.S. policies, including free trade agreements. 

Bolivia's leading presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt; also joined the protestors to oppose U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

On Thursday, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; announced the first major expansion of &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Google%20services%20and%20tools%23Print"&gt;Google Print&lt;/a&gt; -- allowing visitors to &lt;a href="w%3Asearch%20engine"&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; and read a further 10,000 texts via the project's website. The new additions are out-of-copyright &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; literature and historical documents from the &lt;a href="w%3Anineteenth%20century"&gt;19th century&lt;/a&gt;. 

This initial expansion comprises documents from the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Public%20Library"&gt;New York Public Library&lt;/a&gt; and the libraries of &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20University"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Michigan"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;. In a formal statement, University of Michigan president &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Sue%20Coleman"&gt;Mary Sue Coleman&lt;/a&gt; said, "Today we welcome the world to our library. As educators we are inspired by the possibility of sharing these important works with people around the globe."

Since its initial announcement, the project has been the subject of legal threats from publishing companies and authors who want to ensure that Google does not scan and distribute copyrighted material without permission. As a result of the legal action the scanning of copyrighted material has been on hold, and there has been speculation that the project was a failure. However, Google has announced that it restarted scanning copyrighted works from the 1st of November.

Google's controversial service also faces competition from the &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Content%20Alliance"&gt;Open Content Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, formed by internet companies including &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Archive"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;.

New outbreaks of the lethal &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of the &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20influenza"&gt;avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; have been documented in &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. According to a Vietnamese animal health officer, 4,000 poultry and water fowl have died of the virus after October 25 in provinces 70 kilometres north of &lt;a href="w%3AHanoi"&gt;Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;. In China, 9,000 chickens and twenty wild birds have died of the virus in just over two weeks with more than 300,000 birds culled as a precaution.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; authorities are planning on culling 180,000 chickens in response to the discovery of the first case of bird flu in the country in over a year. Most of Japan's previous avian influenza outbreaks have been due to the H5N2 strain, which poses no known threat to humans. The virus found in a farm north-east of &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; has been confirmed as belonging to the H5 family, but additional tests are needed to find out whether it is the H5N1 strain. A Japanese agriculture ministry official said that there was "little concern" of the virus being the H5N1 type as no case of the strain has previously been found in the area.

At least 60 people have died of the H5N1 strain in east Asia. Over 40 of the fatalities have occurred in Vietnam, where tests are currently being conducted for at least one possible additional human infection. China has not reported any human infections of the avian flu.

The departure from France of the new &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;Airbus A380&lt;/a&gt; superjumbo airliner on a tour of Asia and Australia has been delayed, leading to a rearrangement of its public appearances. Citing "a precautionary measure", Airbus announced that two of the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on the prototype airliner would be replaced before the tour commenced.

Singapore will remain the airliner's first stop, where &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Airlines"&gt;Singapore Airlines&lt;/a&gt; will display the aircraft they intend to launch into passenger-carrying service in November 2006. It is expected that the Airbus 380 will wear the livery of Singapore Airlines when it arrives on November 11, three days later than originally planned.

The massive airliner will then bypass the planned stop in Malaysia, and fly directly to Sydney, then Melbourne and Brisbane as part of the leadup to &lt;a href="w%3AQantas"&gt;Qantas'&lt;/a&gt; 85th birthday celebrations on November 16. Qantas plans to commence A380 operations starting in April 2007. 

The Malaysia visit will be rescheduled for November 17, occurring during the return flight to France.

It is unclear whether the originally planned Australian tour dates can be kept, and sources indicate that the airliner's first stop in Brisbane, on November 11, maybe eliminated in favour of a brief appearance on November 16.

Authorities are looking for USD$75,000 in frozen bull semen stolen Sunday from liquid nitrogen tanks at a farm in &lt;a href="w%3AFrederick%20County%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Frederick County, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. Eric Fleming, the owner, says the semen took 4 to 5 years to collect from 40 to 50 bulls. He had planned to sell the semen at an upcoming Denver cattle show.

The collection and storage of semen can be a very profitable business&amp;mdash;the ease of transportation reduces the costs normally associated with insemination, namely the transport of bull and cow to one another. Collection can be tricky, however, as bulls do not always produce as expected and the process is not particularly easy.

"I will give a nice fat reward for any information on semen that was stolen from my tank today," Fleming posted to a livestock breeder's message board. "It was a mother load of semen."

&lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; – An Irish construction worker accused of a record breaking £26.5 million (US$45 million) bank robbery committed in December 2004 was formally charged in a court in &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. Dominic McEvoy was charged with possession of a firearm and false imprisonment in connection with the case.

On December 20, 2004, McEvoy allegedly held an assistant bank manager's family hostage while the manager and a colleague were forced to admit thieves to a branch of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Bank"&gt;Northern Bank&lt;/a&gt; in Belfast. The thieves then emptied the vault. Police have blamed the robbery on the IRA which has repeatedly denied any connection to the theft. &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt;, a political party linked with the &lt;a href="w%3AProvisional%20IRA"&gt;Provisional IRA&lt;/a&gt;, has protested the arrests, accusing police of targeting IRA sympathizers and supporters in their investigation.

The Northern Bank heist is one of the largest in Europe since the theft of more than US$65 million from a London bank in 1987.

A coordinated set of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; protests against proposed &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Anti-Terrorism%20Bill%202005"&gt;anti-terror bills&lt;/a&gt; and calling on the withdrawal of troops from &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; began in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; today. Approximately one thousand people gathered in Belmore Park in the center of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; capital for a rally and march through the city.

According to the protestors the new legislation may, if passed, may be used to suppress important civil liberties.

"These new laws are against dissent" said David Bernie, a speaker from the NSW Council for Civil Liberties. "We are seeing a big change. Now, questioning warrants, people subject to those are not allowed to talk about it for two years. Now, this is automatic, and it is automatic irrespective of whether there is any need for secrecy or not. So ASIO doesn't have to apply for any gag order, the gag order applies automatically. Its stops not only that person talking about it, but their lawyer talking about or the media talking about it."

Mr. Bernie said that under the laws, it may be a criminal act for family members to discuss the fact that a member of the same family had been secretly detained. "Would John Howard, if he was told by his son, 'I am safe but I can't tell you where I am', not tell Janette about it? It just is a ridiculous situation."

The Prime Minister has said that the new anti-terror legislation is justified because of the threat to Australia. Mr Howard said in an interview with John Laws on November 3 that he won't enjoy enacting laws that restrict civil liberties, but that it is necessary under the current circumstances. 

"Now I don’t like the fact that we have to do this. I don’t like it at all. In many ways it’s as distasteful to me as it is to the most rampant civil libertarian in the country. But we are living in different times, and anybody who thinks that we’re not, is frankly, out of touch with reality. This country is not immune from the possibility of a terrorist attack. It is not. And people who think it is are just kidding themselves," Mr Howard said. 

On return to Belmore Park further speeches took place, and the rally was concluded with a speech from Paul White from the Muslims for Peace organisation. He suggested that the notion that it was necessary for foreign troops to stay in Iraq to prevent civil war was false. "The historical fact is that Iraq has never had a history of sectarian conflict. Never, never, never. &lt;a href="w%3ASunnis"&gt;Sunnis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27tes"&gt;Shi'tes&lt;/a&gt; live all over Iraq, not just in the South and in fact they are heavily inter-married." he said. He suggested that most of the violence in Iraq was directly or indirectly the result of foreign intervention. "The real leaders of Iraq's Muslims are unanimous, Sunni and Shi'ite, in denouncing sectarian violence". He concluded, "The only solution to the chaos in Iraq is for all foreign troops to leave Iraq."

Former &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AMikhail%20Gorbachev"&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a&gt; has warned that rapid &lt;a href="w%3Aglobalization"&gt;globalization&lt;/a&gt; without governance has led to a growing gap between the world's rich and poor. He has also asserted that global cooperation is needed to address problems such as poverty, terrorism and environmental damage.

"We need new thinking for the new world," said Gorbachev during a speech last month at Miami University of &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. "You cannot make people happy by using tanks and missiles."

Gorbachev, leader of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991, has been credited with ending the &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;. As Soviet leader, he implemented wide-ranging political and economic reforms. However, his reforms have been blamed for inadvertently causing the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.

In 1993, Gorbachev founded the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Cross%20International"&gt;Green Cross International&lt;/a&gt;, of which he was one of three major sponsors of the &lt;a href="w%3AEarth%20Charter"&gt;Earth Charter&lt;/a&gt;.

A new online television channel, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AInternacia%20Televido"&gt;Internacia Televido&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, has been launched following just over two years of fundraising and preparation. It is the first channel ever to be broadcast entirely through the &lt;a href="w%3Ainternational%20auxiliary%20language"&gt;international auxiliary language&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEsperanto"&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt;, and was launched at midnight &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt; time on Saturday night. The name means 'International Television'. The channel aims to create an international television network combining professional content with the collaboration of ordinary users from around the world. Programmes will range from news shows and documentaries to culture, educational programming and children's entertainment.

The project, supported by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Esperanto%20Association"&gt;World Esperanto Association&lt;/a&gt; amongst others, was announced in October 2003 in &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; by Brazilian entrepreneur Flavio Rebelo, whose media business CIDCON also runs the Esperanto language web portal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A%C4%9Cangalo"&gt;Ĝangalo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ghangalo.com"&gt;www.ghangalo.com&lt;/a&gt;, 'Jungle') and publishes music. The original intention was to establish a 24-hour &lt;a href="w%3Astreaming%20media"&gt;streamed&lt;/a&gt; online channel, with four hours of original programming per day (repeated six times daily) and a daily news bulletin. A subsequent international fundraising campaign to raise the required sum of €35,000 to establish the channel involved Rebelo speaking at several Esperanto events throughout Europe during the early months of 2004 through the support of an anonymous Asian donor.

The project failed to garner sufficient funds to meet its original deadline, but in August this year Rebelo confirmed that a scaled-down version of the project would go ahead upon the sum of €23,000 being reached. The channel currently features 90 minutes of programming daily, with one weekly news bulletin, and three waged employees instead of the intended ten. It is intended that the channel will be funded past its initial six-month period through on-air advertising revenue and further private donations, and expanded as revenue permits.

Experimental television broadcasts in Esperanto were not first made until the advent of Internet technology. A previous online Esperanto TV project (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.esperanto.tv"&gt;www.esperanto.tv&lt;/a&gt;), under the auspices of the Italian &lt;a href="w%3ATransnational%20Radical%20Party"&gt;Transnational Radical Party&lt;/a&gt;, failed to realise a finished product. Since the &lt;a href="w%3A1920s"&gt;1920s&lt;/a&gt;, radio broadcasts have been made regularly in Esperanto by broadcasters such as &lt;a href="w%3ARAI"&gt;RAI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Radio%20International"&gt;China Radio International&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARadio%20Polonia"&gt;Radio Polonia&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Armed gunmen attack cruise ship off Somali coast</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Seabourn%20Spirit"&gt;The Seabourn Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, a cruise ship sailing off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, narrowly escaped an attack by gunmen believed to be &lt;a href="w%3Apirates"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt;.

The pirate attack occurred on Saturday, when two boats approached the ship and began firing automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenades, injuring one crew member.

The crew took evasive action and escaped safely by employing an acoustic bang which caused the gunmen to flee believing they were under fire.

302 passengers and crew, mostly from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, were onboard when the gunmen opened fire. The attack took place 160km (100 miles) off the Somali coastline, which has a reputation for pirate activity.

Deborah Natansohn, president of the Seabourn Cruise Line told CNN Radio, "The occupants of those boats did not succeed in boarding the ship and eventually turned away ... our captain and crew did a terrific job taking responsive action."

Edith Laird, from Seattle, told the BBC, "My daughter saw the pirates out our window. […] There were at least three &lt;a href="w%3ARPG"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; that hit the ship, one in a stateroom four doors down from our cabin."

According to Mike Rogers, a passenger from &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, the captain opted not to sound the alarm and instead announced the attack over the speakers, fearing the sound would drive people to the deck and place them in the line of fire.

Natansohn has stated that the company will re-evaluate future trips to the area. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ASeafarers%20Assistance%20Program"&gt;Seafarers Assistance Program&lt;/a&gt; (SAP) is planning on highlighting the incident and its potential costs for tourism on Monday.

Pirate attacks have been an increasing problem in the area, with 23 hijackings and attempted seizures recorded by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Maritime%20Bureau"&gt;International Maritime Bureau&lt;/a&gt; (IMB). Two of the attacks were on ships carrying aid for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Program"&gt;World Food Program&lt;/a&gt;. One attack involved a ship carrying 935 tons of rice for Asian tsunami victims. The crew had been held for three months before being released. According to the IMB, the pirates - mostly made up of the Horn of Africa’s former navy as well as former fishermen - represent a serious threat to commercial shipping.

Somalia has been a volatile area since the ousting of former dictator Mohamed Said Barre. The country has been operating without a central administration since 1991 and is now controlled by warlords.

Australian media has speculated that the attack on the ship may be an act of terrorism rather than one of piracy.

&lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; – The first &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; passenger flight since war broke out between the two nations 25 years ago, has arrived safely in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;. The plane left &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%20International%20Airport"&gt;Baghdad International Airport&lt;/a&gt; with 65 passengers and touched down in the Iranian capital a few hours later. It was an historic event, marking the end of a quarter-century of hostilities during which all flights from and to Iran were suspended by the former &lt;a href="w%3ABa%27athist%20party"&gt;Ba'athist&lt;/a&gt; regime.

A spokesperson for the Iranian civil aviation authority, Reza Jafarzadeh, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France%20Presse"&gt;Agence France Presse&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that there were plans to resume regular commercial flights from Baghdad to Tehran on November 16, although Iran would not consider flying its own aircraft to Iraq until the security situation was resolved. 

Iran's president, &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; told reporters that the "protection of Iraq's territorial integrity, independence and might is of special significance to Iran."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Britain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; have repeatedly accused Iran of allowing militants to cross its border to help Iraq's insurgents fight the US occupation. Earlier today, &lt;a href="w%3AMajor-General%20Jim%20Dutton"&gt;Major-General Jim Dutton&lt;/a&gt;, a British soldier commanding a multinational force in Basra, gave a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; during which he claimed that insurgents were getting the technology to create increasingly sophisticated bombs from across the border.

In what appears to be a continuing trend from the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Australian House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt; session November 2, an further six Federal Opposition members and one Government member were ejected during and just after Question Time November 3.

&lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt;, having been warned earlier to Question Time was the first removed, and after Opposition members had interjected "Boring, boring!" to an answer from the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Treasurer"&gt;Australian Treasurer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; describing the Opposition stance on the industrial relations reform as a "scare campaign", the Speaker &lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Andrew"&gt;Neil Andrew&lt;/a&gt; issued a "general warning". 

&lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Swan"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Tanya Plibersek|Tanya Plibersek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJill%20Hall"&gt;Jill Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Irwin"&gt;Julia Irwin&lt;/a&gt; (who was also removed yesterday) were also asked to remove themselves under &lt;a href="w%3Astanding%20order"&gt;standing order&lt;/a&gt; 94(a). 

When controversy arose after a question was asked to the &lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20House"&gt;Leader of the House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt;, about the issue of distributing bills on the industrial relations changes and the Speaker intervened in favour of Abbott, he went on to say that &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Smith"&gt;Stephen Smith&lt;/a&gt; "took copies of the workplace relations bill, handed them to an adviser and then the adviser exited the chamber...he then raised a point of order claiming copies were not available". &lt;a href="w%3AGraham%20Edwards"&gt;Graham Edwards&lt;/a&gt; said "You're a fraud, Abbott!" and he was also removed.

Later, when Smith rose after Question Time to make a personal explanation that he did not "[remove] nor [steal] 60 copies of the bill", &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ferguson"&gt;Michael Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; had interjected and was removed -- the only Government member to be removed over the previous few days. Julia Gillard asked the Speaker that of the eighteen Opposition members and one Government member removed over the last two days, "whether 18:1...equals a fair application of the rules as to keeping order in the House", to which he said that "the last two days have been particularly noisy and...it has required more discipline than the chair would like to have to exercise."

A &lt;a href="tornado"&gt;tornado&lt;/a&gt; with winds up to 300 km/h has killed at least 19 in &lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;. The tornado touched down at around 2.00 AM local time on the 6th of November in northern Kentucky and then crossed the Ohio River into southern Indiana near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEvansville%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Evansville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Indiana where the majority of casualties were reported. "At least five people were confirmed dead in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarrick%20County"&gt;Warrick County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and at least 18 were killed in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVanderburgh%20County"&gt;Vanderburgh County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , according to county officials."

Peak storm season for the region is generally April through June - a storm of this ferocity is quite rare at this time of year, according to the National Storm Prediction Centre.

The death toll varies between sources, but between 19 and 23 is the current estimate, with most of those in Indiana.

<h1>First casualty of French riots reported</h1>

Jean-Jacques Le Chenadec has been reported as the first casualty of &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;recent rioting&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. The 61-year old man was beaten by a hooded rioter last week and had been in a coma since the attack.

The uprising was set off by the death of two teenagers who were allegedly chased by police and hid in an electric power station where they were electrocuted. 

The French riots have further intensified over the past few days and are now said to have spread to nearly every city in the country.

The French prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Dominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt;, announced on Monday plans to allow the nation's regions to impose curfews. Mr. de Villepin appeared the day before on television with an appeal to end the violence. 

The president, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;, ended his silence on the rioting on Saturday, when he spoke to the press. "Those who want to sow violence or fear will be caught, tried and punished," he said. "But we also understand very well that we must move towards respect for each individual, justice and equality of opportunity. We are all completely determined to go down this road and pursue the efforts that are already under way in this domain."

The Minister of the Interior, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, called for a radical overhaul of the French social model that he said, "in every aspect, needs to be fundamentally rebuilt." On the same day, various people &lt;a href="http%3A//totalementcretin.apinc.org/blog/2005/11/06/289-soutenez-sarkozy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//standblog.org/blog/2005/11/07/93114486-le-standblog-en-mode-degrade-et-quelques-liens"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discovered that UMP, the political party of Nicolas Sarkozy had bought the Google AdWords 'banlieue' (suburbs) to advertise their own website on google.fr.

Arrests in the rioting total nearly 1200 following the deaths of two youths on October 27. The unrest, which started in a Paris suburb, has spread to over 270 towns across France. More than 4300 cars have been torched across the country, and 2 schools were burned.

<h1>Arrests made in Australia after 'anti-terror' raids</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Arrests%20made%20in%20Australia%20after%20%27anti-terror%27%20raids&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Seventeen people have been arrested overnight in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, in what Police have described as 'anti-terror' raids. New South Wales (NSW) and Victorian police conducted the raids, and both police chiefs have said that the action foiled a terrorist plot. &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Police"&gt;New South Wales Police&lt;/a&gt; Commissioner Ken Moroney said that, "we have disrupted what I would regard as the final stages of a terrorist attack or the launch of a terrorist attack in Australia." The Guardian is reporting that some of those arrested in Sydney are alleged to have been stockpiling chemicals. 

Some of those arrested in Melbourne have appeared in court, including Abu Bakr, also known as Abdul Nacer Benbrika. Benbrika was criticised last year for comments he made in support of al-Qaeda. 

<h2>New South Wales</h2>

In NSW, warrants were executed in Lakemba, Belmore, Wiley Park, Greenacre, Illawong, Punchbowl, Hoxton Park, Condell Park, Ingleburn, Belfield, Bankstown and Kemps Creek, resulting in 8 arrests. 

A NSW Police spokesman has said that one of the men arrested was shot in the chest by police in Green Valley at about 9am, after firing at police. "One officer was struck, we believe in the hand, and suffered a minor wound," the spokesman said. "One of the police officers returned fire and the person of interest to police was wounded in the neck."

It has been reported that the arrests in Sydney, unlike those in Melbourne, do include charges relating to planning and preparation of violent acts. The suspects have not yet appeared in court and the case has been adjourned to Friday.

&lt;a href="w%3AMick%20Keelty"&gt;Mick Keelty&lt;/a&gt;, Commissioner of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; (AFP), has said that the seven people arrested in New South Wales will be charged under the anti-terrorism legislation that was rushed through parliament last week. Mr Keelty has said that the details of the allegations against the men should be kept secret. 

"An application will be made by the Commonwealth &lt;a href="w%3ADirector%20of%20Public%20Prosecutions"&gt;Director of Public Prosecution&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon to suppress the details of the allegations," he said.

Keelty justified the action by arguing that "we give these people a fair opportunity to prepare their defence before the court rather than run the trial in the media."

<h2>Victoria</h2>

In Victoria, warrants were executed in Dallas, Hoppers Crossing, Fawkner, Preston, Haberfield, Coburg, Yarraville, Meadow Heights, Hadfield and Mount Druit, resulting in 9 arrests. 

&lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20Police"&gt;Victorian Police&lt;/a&gt; Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Nixon"&gt;Christine Nixon&lt;/a&gt; also believes that the raids prevented a terrorist attack, however she stated that the police did not know what form the attack would take, saying "we weren't exactly sure when nor, more importantly, what they planned to damage or do harm to." Commissioner Nixon said that they had sufficient evidence to proceed. 

Nixon said that the raids were the result of a long-term operation. When queried, she confirmed that the &lt;a href="Anti-terror%20amendments%20to%20be%20rushed%20through%20Australian%20parliament%20because%20of%20new%20%27potential%20threats%27"&gt;anti-terror legislation rushed through Parliament last week&lt;/a&gt; was related to today's raids. "Some of that is related to that amendment that occurred," she said. The changes became law just two days ago. 

Those arrested will be charged with "a range of offences", however the exact nature of the charges is yet to be announced. It is not yet clear to what extent the emergency legislative changes rushed through parliament last week are a legal basis for the arrests.

One of those arrested in Melbourne was Abu Bakr, also known as Abdul Nacer Benbrika. He is a dual Algerian and Australian citizen, and was criticised last August when he told ABC Radio that he supported al-Quaeda. At the time he denied being involved in any terrorist activity. 

In an interview on the ♡❤ABC Radio♡❤ "National Breakfast" program, Rob Stary, a criminal defence lawyer who will be representing those arrested in the Melbourne raids said that, as far as he is aware, the charges all relate to being a member of a proscribed organisation, and none of the Melbourne suspsects had been charged in relation to any planning or preparation offences. At the time of the interview he was not aware which proscribed organisation the charges relate to.

Seven men have appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court, on charges of intentionally being a member of a terrorist organisation and knowing the organisation was a terrorist organisation. The court has heard that Abu Bakr is the "spiritual leader" of the group and the prosecutor alleged that the organisation is directed by Abu Bakr. Speaking of the Melbourne arrests, Prosecutor Richard Maidment QC alleged that the group constituted a "terrorist organisation". Making reference to the Sydney arrests he said that the Sydney suspects had "gathering chemicals of a kind that were used in the London Underground bombings," and planned to kill "innocent men and women in Australia."

On November 6, 2005, thousands of puzzle lovers from around the country swarmed Coral Gables, Florida, USA, with the hopes of being the first to solve a series of interactive riddles and win a weeklong resort vacation for four, as part of a free event called 'The Herald Hunt.' Billed as an 'urban puzzle safari', the Herald Hunt was designed by Dave Barry and Tom Shroder, and produced by The Miami Herald newspaper.

The Sunday issue of the Miami Herald included a special Hunt section which listed over eighty numbered clues. But only five of the clues were legitimate; the rest were red herrings. Participants roamed the city in search of five numbers that would reveal the identity of the genuine clues from the newspaper. Cryptic hints were embedded in unusual places: street trolleys bearing strange messages, speakers blaring loud music, actors on the sidewalk making hand gestures, and even in the songs sung by a barbershop quartet in front of City Hall.

The five correct clues, when combined with a final clue announced at 3pm, yielded a phone number. Teams that correctly deduced and called the phone number heard a message containing one final puzzle that needed to be solved in order to win the prize.

The members of this year's winning team were Robin and Cary Ginter, Steve Friedland, Brian O'Neil, and Mark Engelberg. They were the first team to decode the phone message and complete the final task.

Engelberg and O'Neil flew in from across the country to attend the Hunt with their friends who are local to the area. O'Neil explained, "There's no other event I'm aware of that's quite like the Herald Hunt. There are other puzzle competitions, but nothing on this kind of large scale."

This is Engelberg's and Friedland's third win, and a second-time win for the other members of the team. When asked to explain the secret of their success, Engelberg said that teamwork was key. "We've gotten very good at working together," he said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Vice President Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; lobbied Senate &lt;a href="w%3ARepublicans"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; to exempt the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; from the proposed ban on &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; of terror suspects held by the United States. According to senators participating in the closed door-session, Cheney argued that the administration needs an exemption from the ban on "cruel, inhumane or degrading" treatment of detainees in United States custody to be effective in the "&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20on%20terrorism"&gt;war on terrorism&lt;/a&gt;", although he also said that the United States does not engage in torture.

The Vice President's appeal comes at a time when Congress is still dealing with the aftermath of the &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse"&gt;Abu Ghraib prison scandal&lt;/a&gt;, as well as allegations of torture in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time questions about secret CIA detention centers outside of United States territory and cases of individuals that have been extradited from the United States to countries that are known to practice torture to obtain intelligence information resurface in the media.

The Bush administration is growing increasingly isolated in its stance on this issue. Republican &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Hagel"&gt;Senator Chuck Hagel&lt;/a&gt; said on ABC television "I think the Administration is making a terrible mistake in opposing John McCain's amendment on detainees and torture," and added "Why in the world they're doing that, I don't know."

The Office of the Vice President declined to comment on this issue.

The organs of a 12 year-old Palestinian boy killed by Israeli soldiers have been transplanted to Israeli patients, helping to save their lives.

Ahmed al-Khatib was shot during clashes in &lt;a href="w%3AJenin"&gt;Jenin&lt;/a&gt; last week when soldiers mistook his toy gun for a real one. He later died in a hospital. The &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israeli Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt; regretted the incident.

Ahmed's kidneys, liver, lungs and heart were transplated to a total of six patients, including Israeli Arabs, Jews, and &lt;a href="w%3ADruze"&gt;Druze&lt;/a&gt;. One of the recipients was 12 year-old Samah Gadban, who had been waiting for a new heart for five years. Her father thanked Ahmed's family "from the depths of my heart" and called the donation a "gesture of love". 

Ahmed's father, Ismail al-Khatib, said the family made the decision to donate his son's organs "for the sake of the world’s children and the children of this country". He added that saving lives was more important than religion and thinks that his son "has entered the heart of every Israeli".

al-Khatib stressed he has received nothing but praise from fellow residents in Jenin.

The Speaker of the &lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AReuven%20Rivlin"&gt;Reuven Rivlin&lt;/a&gt;, praised the action saying that this "remarkable gesture [...] despite the war and conflict without solution for nearly 100 years, must be noted".

A documentary aired on November 8 on an &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; state-run satellite channel &lt;a href="w%3ARAI"&gt;RAI&lt;/a&gt; claims that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military used &lt;a href="w%3Achemical%20weapons"&gt;chemical weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Anapalm"&gt;napalm&lt;/a&gt;-like bombs during a bombardment of &lt;a href="w%3AFallujah"&gt;Fallujah&lt;/a&gt; in November 2004. The documentary, entitled ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFallujah%2C%20The%20Hidden%20Massacre"&gt;Fallujah: The Hidden Massacre&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, asserts that the US military used &lt;a href="w%3Awhite%20phosphorus%20incendiary"&gt;white phosphorus&lt;/a&gt; on the civilian population during the bombardment, and backs these allegations with interviews with former US soldiers as well as residents of Fallujah.

White phosphorus is a spontaneously flammable chemical used in battlefield illumination or to generate smoke screens. Contact with the substance results in burning and melting of skin and flesh. According to an account of a former US soldier, the phosphorus explodes and forms a &lt;a href="w%3Aplume"&gt;plume&lt;/a&gt;, killing everyone within a 150 metre radius. The smoke produced by burning phosphorous converts to hot, concentrated phosphoric acid on contact with human skin, eyes, lungs and mucous membranes producing characteristic chemical burns internally and externally. White phosphorus is also a highly toxic substance with an average lethal dose (&lt;a href="w%3ALD50"&gt;LD50&lt;/a&gt;) of &lt;a href="w%3APhosphorus"&gt;50 milligrams&lt;/a&gt;; lethal intoxication causes a slow death after 5 to 10 days.

White phosphorus bombs are considered &lt;a href="w%3Aincendiary%20device"&gt;incendiary devices&lt;/a&gt;, though RAI claims that they are chemical weapons. The US military admits using white phosphorus to illuminate battlefields, but denies having used it as a weapon against civilians. The United States has ratified the &lt;a href="w%3AChemical%20Weapons%20Convention"&gt;Chemical Weapons Convetion (CWC)&lt;/a&gt;, but has not ratified the "Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III)" which forbids the use of incendiary weapons against places with concentrations of civilians.

A statement issued by the United States in December 2004 pointed out that phosphorus shells are not outlawed, and that "US forces have used them very sparingly in Fallujah, for illumination purposes." RAI's film, however, alleges that the US has attempted to destroy footage of use of white phosphorus on civilians in Fallujah.

"A rain of fire fell on the city, the people struck by this multi-coloured substance started to burn, we found people dead with strange wounds, the bodies burned but the clothes intact," says Mohamad Tareq, a biologist in Fallujah interviewed for the film. Jeff Englehart, a former US soldier, describes on the documentary: "Burned bodies, burned women, burned children; white phosphorus kills indiscriminately... When it makes contact with skin, then it's absolutely irreversible damage, burning flesh to the bone."

The Pentagon has previously &lt;a href="http%3A//usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive_Index/Illegal_Weapons_in_Fallujah.html"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that white phosphorous was only used for illumination purposes in Fallujah: “U.S. forces have used them very sparingly in Fallujah, for illumination purposes. They were fired into the air to illuminate enemy positions at night, not at enemy fighters.” However, the documentary clearly shows two types of munitions being used:
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/luu2.htm"&gt;LUU-2 Parachute flares&lt;/a&gt; for illumination.
BULLET::::- White phosphorous incendiaries being used to attack a large &lt;a href="http%3A//www.revver.com/video/2963"&gt;residental area&lt;/a&gt;. This corroborates the eyewitness testimony in the documentary claiming many civilians were killed in their homes by incendiary and caustic materials.

</ul>
The Pentagon and the U.S. Administration stopped short of denying the claims that white phosporus was used in Fallujah, although U.S. Marine Major Tim Keefe insisted that it was not used to "target" civilians. The use of incendiary weapons against civilians is banned by an additional protocol to the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt; that was added in 1980, however the United States did not sign this protocol and it does not directly cover the use of toxic smokes.

The documentary also implies that US troops used &lt;a href="w%3AMark%2077%20bomb"&gt;Mark 77 incendiary bombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/mk77.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Fallujah, which contain an upgraded &lt;a href="w%3Anapalm"&gt;napalm&lt;/a&gt; formulation. The main difference to Vietnam-era napalm being the replacement of gasoline with kerosene in the mixture, and it is reported that the mixture contains &lt;a href="w%3AMark%2077%20bomb"&gt;oxidizing agents&lt;/a&gt;, including white phosphorus. The US military does not call MK77 munitions "napalm" bombs. However, the use of MK77 munitions against Iraqi troops in 2003 had a "strikingly similar" effect to napalm as confirmed in August 2003 by the US military representatives Col. Randolph Alles and Col. Michael Daily.

In the aftermath of a 14-year long civil war, &lt;a href="w%3ALiberia"&gt;Liberians&lt;/a&gt; are holding elections for their first post-war president. Of the two final candidates &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="w%3AEllen%20Johnson-Sirleaf"&gt;Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Weah"&gt;George Weah&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; Mr Weah had a higher percentage of the vote in elections held on October 11 this year. A secondary election was held recently, but the final winner has not been chosen.

Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf, 66-year-old former economist of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank%20Group"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; graduate, the so called "Iron Lady", is very popular along educated people and women. Her supporters consider her to be the better candidate due to her economics background. She was the runner-up in the October 11 elections, receiving about 20% of votes. Opponents point to the fact she'd be the first woman leader ever in Africa, and that she does not have the support of the rebel warlords.

Mr. Weah, 39-year-old well-known football player and former star of &lt;a href="w%3AAC%20Milan"&gt;AC Milan&lt;/a&gt;, is said to be a successful man. His supporters, who call him "King George", are generally made up of young men - many of them war veterans. But his opponents say that he is an inexperienced leader, without political skills. He won the voting on October 11, 2005, receiving 28% of votes.

on November 28 we will know who won

According to United Nations peacekeepers only a single incident of violence was reported during the elections. The elections results are expected in about 2 weeks.

The Prime Minster &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said that "the contract was awarded in the normal fashion", and that he did not know if Salmat donated to any other parties, and said that he ask someone to "just do a little bit of research this afternoon" to get further information on the matter. After Question Time the Prime Minister confirmed that Salmat was selected through an open tender process, and expressed his belief that "expressions of political support should not disbar one from preferment on the merits."

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Vatican"&gt;The Vatican&lt;/a&gt; issued a defence of &lt;a href="w%3ADarwinian%20evolution"&gt;Darwinian evolution&lt;/a&gt; at a news conference Thursday.

In what many are calling a direct attack on the rising support for fundamentalist creationism in America, Cardinal Poupard, head of the Vatican Pontifical Council for Culture, stated that the Genesis description of God's creation of the universe and Darwin's theory of evolution are "perfectly compatible" if the Bible is properly interpreted.

"The fundamentalists want to give a scientific meaning to words that had no scientific aim," he said, and that the point of Genesis is that "the universe didn't make itself and had a creator."

"The faithful should heed modern science and to guard against religion crossing over to fundamentalism if it ignores scientific reasoning."

"Science should also listen to religion. The atomic bomb and cloning are from reason with no ethical or religious link."

When asked directly about intelligent design, Mons. Basti quoted John Paul II, saying that evolution was "more than just a hypothesis."

There has been flooding in and around &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; in the state of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; today. Some areas have received 100mm of rain in less than 24 hours. In some suburbs phone and mobile services seem to be having a lack of connectivity. Around 60 houses have been damaged due to the flooding and some metropolitan roads have been closed off and motorists have also been advised to adviod these areas. Flood waters also submerged Christmas decorations along the &lt;a href="w%3ATorrens%20River"&gt;Torrens River&lt;/a&gt; put out by the South Australian Brewing company. The Christmas decorations were on display as of the coming Christmas pageant. Local residents report that the light from Christmas decorations were again visible around 7:00pm.

Sandbags have been supplied to the worst areas and some relief for flood water victims has already been suggested. The rain has also filled Adelaide's water reservoirs to capacity and caused them to overflow, as stated by water authorities.

Houses have also been evacuated near the banks of the Gawler River, and many other residents have been advised by the South Australian &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Emergency%20Service"&gt;State Emergency Service&lt;/a&gt; to leave their homes earlier rather than later.

<h1>France invokes emergency law in response to riots</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=France%20invokes%20emergency%20law%20in%20response%20to%20riots&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The French government used a 1955 law to impose a ♡❤♡state of emergency♡❤♡ across &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to quell the rioting that has wracked the country for the last 12 days. French Prime Minster &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; today declared, "The republic is at an hour of truth." 

Curfews designed to restrict the movement of those that might engage in violence and rioting allow the government to imprison individuals for up to two months. The northern city of &lt;a href="w%3AAmiens"&gt;Amiens&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first to impose a curfew; unaccompanied youth in that city will be unable to walk the streets between midnight and 6:00 a.m.

The 1955 law invoked by the cabinet Tuesday morning will allow local officials throughout the country to impose curfews. In French terminology, the government invoked the law through a presidential ♡❤décret♡❤ (decree), which corresponds to an executive order in American terminology. The law originates from the &lt;a href="w%3AAlgerian%20War"&gt;Algerian War&lt;/a&gt; and has never been used in &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20France"&gt;Metropolitan France&lt;/a&gt; until now. Villepin said that more than 9,500 police have been called up to help bring the riots under control.
Article 11 of the law permits &lt;a href="w%3Afreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt; of all types of media (including &lt;a href="w%3Atheatre"&gt;theatre&lt;/a&gt; performances), if specifically authorized by a decree. The French government has so far not elected to use this possibility.

In the last 12 days more than 5,000 cars have been set ablaze, and at least 1,500 have been arrested in what is the worst public violence in France since 1968.

&lt;a href="European%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s probe to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVenus"&gt;Venus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was successfully launched on Wednesday, November 9, at 0333 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGMT"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20probe"&gt;probe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , entitled &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVenus%20Express"&gt;Venus Express&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , separated from its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20launch%20vehicle"&gt;Soyuz Fregat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; carrier 90 minutes after the launch, after which it emitted a signal marking the start of its journey to Earth's closest planetary neighbour.

Venus Express is to arrive at Venus in April 2006. The probe will spend at least 15 months—two Venusian days—studying the planet. The orbiter, however, has enough fuel to operate for 1000 Earth days.

The 220 million € (260 million US$) probe is set to examine the turbulent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aatmosphere"&gt;atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and intense &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20effect"&gt;greenhouse effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Venus. The probe will study the planet's temperature variation, cloud formations, wind speeds and gas composition. It is hoped that the results will help scientists understand Earth's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; better.
Venus express is a clone of Mars Express which has been orbiting &lt;a href="Mars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; since December 2003.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; police have called off the search for missing &lt;a href="w%3AIrwin%20County%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Irwin County&lt;/a&gt; school history teacher Tara Grinstead, after more than two weeks. &lt;a href="w%3AOcilla%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Ocilla, Georgia&lt;/a&gt; Police Chief Billy Hancock is reported as saying that volunteers and public safety officials have completed their search of the county, a search that spanned 358 miles and that involved cadaver dogs, horses, helicopters, four-wheelers, people on foot, and the assistance of more than 50 public safety agencies.

Hancock is reported as saying that searchers found some clothes, but that there is no indication that they are actually Grinstead's.

Grinstead, aged 30, was first reported missing on October 24, 2005. Her unlocked car was outside of her home, but, according to police reports, her pocketbook and keys were missing. She was last seen on October 22, 2005. Both the clothes that she was wearing when she was last seen and her cell phone were found at her home.

Anota Garris, Grinstead's sister, has said that civilian searches will continue. A US$80,000 reward has been offered for her safe return.

Thousands of protestors demonstrated today in &lt;a href="w%3ABaku"&gt;Baku&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="w%3AAzerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;. They left their houses due to unrest over the results of the November 6 parliamentary elections, which, according to the opposition, are faked. The protest lasted about three hours before being shut down.

The protest gathered some 15,000 people, but the opposition hoped to gather 30,000 to 50,000 Azeris. Many people were stopped by police on their way to the outskirts of Baku. The main demonstration took place at Gelebe Square. When rioters tried to enlarge the protest, police used force to stop them.

Some Azeris believe that a "three hour revolution" wouldn't change anything in the country. They believe that the demonstration was controlled by the government.

The November 6 elections, won, according to officials, by the governing New Azerbaijan Party, have been condemned by international organizations, such as The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and by independent observers. The &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; reports that results in about 43% of polling stations were faked.

To prevent protests, re-runs were ordered in two districts by election officials. Also, one recount will take place.

At least three explosions hit &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-owned hotels in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmman"&gt;Amman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this evening, killing at least 57 people and wounding at least 245 others.

The first of the apparently coordinated suicide bombings occurred at 8.50 pm (1850 UTC) at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHyatt"&gt;Grand Hyatt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hotel in the &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;ian capital. It was followed by explosions at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARadisson%20Hotels%20%26amp%3B%20Resorts"&gt;Radisson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; SAS and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADays%20Inn"&gt;Days Inn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The hotels are particularly popular with American and Israeli tourists. At least one American was killed, and at least two others were wounded. They were not identified due to the condition on anonymity in the embassy.

The bomb at the Grand Hyatt hotel apparently went off in the lobby; the bomb at the Radisson SAS exploded in a wedding hall packed with around 300 people. Most of the casualties are believed to be Jordanian.

Jordanian King Abdullah II has condemned the bombings and announced that "justice will pursue the criminals".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20fundamentalism"&gt;Islamic fundamentalist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; group &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , led by militant &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is said to have claimed responsibility for the attacks on their website. The news was reported by several news outlets, but the authenticity of the claim has not yet been verified.

&lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, has suffered what some consider a humiliating political defeat after the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; dismissed a controversial government proposal to permit the detention of terror suspects for up to 90 days without bringing charges. Under current UK anti-terrorism laws, suspects can be held for up to 14 days without any charges being made against them.

Members of Mr Blair's &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; used the vote to rebel against the proposal, with a crucial 49 tipping the balance to reject it by 322 votes to 291. It was the first &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons"&gt;Commons&lt;/a&gt; defeat for Mr Blair in his 8 years as Prime Minister. Later, a second proposal to extend the detention time limit for terror suspects to 28 days was passed by 323 votes to 290.

The police called for new powers after the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;bomb attacks&lt;/a&gt; in London on July 7, 2005. They argued that because &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-terrorism"&gt;anti-terrorist&lt;/a&gt; investigations can take considerable time, the new powers would have been justified. Critics are sceptical of these claims. Opponents believe that by effectively giving the government the right to imprison for up to three months anyone who it alleged to have been involved in terrorism, without having to present any charges in court to justify the detention, the bill could have led to abuses of power. 

Leaders of the opposition parties were delighted with the results. &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Conservative%20Party"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Howard"&gt;Michael Howard&lt;/a&gt; said the vote had "diminished" the Prime Minister's authority and that he should tender his resignation. &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Liberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, called Mr Blair a "lame duck".

Speaking after the result of the vote was announced, Mr Blair accused those who'd opposed the measure of being "out of touch", talking of a "worrying gap between parts of Parliament and the reality of the terrorist threat and public opinion". 

Former Conservative ministers Peter Lilley and Stephen Dorrell criticised the government for using senior police officers to lobby MPs over the vote. They characterised this as the "politicisation of the police".

<h1>Over 30 killed in a Baghdad restaurant bombing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Over%2030%20killed%20in%20a%20Baghdad%20restaurant%20bombing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A suicide bomber detonated himself in a crowded &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; restaurant Thursday morning at approximately 9:30 local time (0630 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGMT"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ). 35 were reportedly killed and 25 wounded in the blast. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

The restaurant was frequented by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -backed Iraqi security forces, often the target of &lt;a href="Sunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; Arab rebels and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslamism"&gt;Islamist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Al-Qaeda groups. A police officer said that at least four Iraqi police patrols were in the restaurant at the time of the bombing.

The bombing was one of the biggest attacks in Baghdad in recent months. A statement on an Islamist website used by Al-Qaeda said that the attack was a part of an Al-Qaeda campaign to counter recent raids by US and Iraqi forces on suspected militant strongholds near the &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n border.

The attack came just a day after the bombing of hotels in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmman"&gt;Amman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, attacks also claimed by Al-Qaeda.

The &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;Court of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has ruled on a case brought by a &lt;a href="Muslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; student of &lt;a href="Istanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; university. The ruling upholds the law in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; that bans the wearing of headscarves in universities and public offices.

Leyla Sahin brought her case to the court in 1998 after being excluded from classes for wearing an &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; headscarf. She contended that the ban discriminated against her and denied her right to an education.

The court ruled that Turkish law was consistent with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Convention"&gt;European Convention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;a href="Human%20rights"&gt;Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; and with the protection of women's rights in general.

The ban was reasonable as a measure to help maintain Turkey as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecularism"&gt;secular society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the court ruled. It argued: "When examining the question of the Islamic headscarf in the Turkish context, there had to be borne in mind the impact which wearing such a symbol, which was presented or perceived as a compulsory religious duty, may have on those who chose not to wear it."

The ruling will impact over 1,000 other similar cases brought by Muslim women in the country.

&lt;p&gt;On November 6, Thunderbird: The Garvin School of International Management Rugby Football Club were crowned champions after defeating the University of California at Berkeley: Haas School of Business 17-7 at the Ninth Annual Thunderbird Rugby Invitational tournament. Thunderbird was undefeated throughout the tournament, after playing five other teams over two days. Final scores were:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Thunderbird 14 beat Tobacco Rd (Duke/ UNC) 3
BULLET::::- Thunderbird 12 beat Cornell 0
BULLET::::- Thunderbird 7 beat Wharton 0
BULLET::::- Thunderbird 11 beat Univ. of Texas 8
BULLET::::- Thunderbird 17 beat Berkeley 7

</ul>
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the five teams above, Kellogg also participated in the tournament. Third place went to the University of Texas: McCombs School of Business. The tournament is held every year in spring at Thunderbird, and is open to rugby teams from MBA schools. This year’s tournament was held under beautiful weather at Thunderbird’s Glendale campus, and was watched by more than 250 participants and spectators.

&lt;p&gt;“Our team performed admirably. After a difficult season finding our form in our own Arizona league, we managed to pull together and set up some great plays. Our forwards proved to be a solid force, and gained us much ground” said Thunderbird co-captain Mike Bruneau.

&lt;p&gt;Team president, Scott Harper, commented “The tournament was great. The support from all of our fans and sponsors really helped us to put on an exciting event. We had a lot of very tough competitors, and were happy to win it against such strong teams.”

&lt;p&gt;Fans were treated to two great days of rugby. Each game included two 20-minute halves, and each team was scheduled for three games on the first day, and two on the final day. The highlight of the tournament was live bull riding and steer wrestling that took place near the campus, drawing an audience of over 200 people.. Each team nominated a representative to see if they could stay on a bull the longest, as well as a team who could wrestle a steer the fastest.

&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird RFC would like to thank the sponsors for their kind generosity and support. Sponsors for the tournament included Siemens, Wells Fargo, Trump Enterprises, the Thunderbird Student Government and the Thunderbird Alumni Rugby Association.

On 11 November 1975, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; faced a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAustralian%20constitutional%20crisis%20of%201975"&gt;constitutional crisis&lt;/a&gt;. By &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALoss%20of%20Supply"&gt;failing to obtain Supply&lt;/a&gt;, that is, with its financial Appropriation Bills repeatedly rejected by the upper house, the Australian national government had effectively run out of money. In response, the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGovernor-General%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Governor-General&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJohn%20Kerr"&gt;Sir John Kerr&lt;/a&gt;, dismissed the Prime Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGough%20Whitlam"&gt;Gough Whitlam&lt;/a&gt;. A caretaker government under the Opposition leader &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMalcolm%20Fraser"&gt;Malcolm Fraser&lt;/a&gt; was formed and held office until a new general election was called. Despite Whitlam's call for Australians to "maintain the rage", Malcolm Fraser became prime minister in a landslide win to his party.

Immediately following his sacking, responding to the formal "God save the Queen" which ended the proclamation terminating his government, Gough Whitlam declared from the steps of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAustralian%20Parliament%20House%23Old%20Parliament%20House"&gt;Parliament House&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;blockquote&gt;♡❤Well may we say "God save the Queen" because nothing will save the Governor General. . . . The proclamation you have just heard read was countersigned Malcom Fraser, who will go down in Australian history from Remembrance Day 1975 as Kerr's Cur.♡❤&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; faithful "maintained the rage" and Australia's current prime minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said Sir John Kerr was "savagely maligned by history", the anniversary was a non-event for most Australians. The day in Australia focused on the 87th anniversary of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARemembrance%20Day"&gt;the end of World War I&lt;/a&gt; and the ongoing news events of the day.

Jan Krc, the spokesman for the US embassy in Prague, has confirmed that the embassy had asked the &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech government&lt;/a&gt; to grant asylum to some &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; prisoners, Muslims of Chinese origin, who had formerly been suspected of being terrorists. Krc said that the Muslims face persecution if they are sent back to China.

Krc said the request was "a humanitarian request because we clearly need to place these people somewhere," adding that the ex-prisoners would have as much liberty as anyone else given asylum.

The Czech Republic's Interior Minister Frantisek Bublan said; "It concerns prisoners concentrated at the Guantanamo base, of whom membership of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; has not been proved. We were asked if we could not include them here in an asylum process." 

The Czech interior ministry spokesperson, Radka Kovárová, said that the Czech government turned down the Americans' request: "Minister Bublan evaluated the whole issue and, bearing in mind potential security hazards, said he would not see offering asylum to these persons as appropriate."

<h1>Australian government accused of hypocrisy over World Court statement</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20government%20accused%20of%20hypocrisy%20over%20World%20Court%20statement&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20government"&gt;Australian government&lt;/a&gt; was accused of hypocrisy today over a media release about the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;International Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; (ICJ). In the joint release the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General welcomed the election of a New Zealander, Sir Kenneth Keith, as a judge on the ICJ, and said that "Australia strongly supported Sir Kenneth's candidature to the Court". Advocacy groups made the accusation because Australia withdrew from the jurisdiction of the maritime division of the ICJ in 2002, because of a dispute with East Timor. 

Jefferson Lee from the NSW Branch of the Australia-East Timor Association said that "it is hypocritical that they are celebrating the appointment of an ICJ judge given the fact that Australia withdrew from the jurisdiction of the ICJ maritime division in March 2002."

A spokesman for the Minister for Foreign Affairs rejected the suggestion that the minister had been hypocritical, and said that it had always been government policy to resolve such disputes via bilateral negotiation. 

"Maritime boundaries should be resolved by negotiation. This is how we have done it with all other countries we have negotiated with. Maritime boundaries are an issue of sovereignty," he said. 

Mr Lee was referring to Australia's redeclaration of its recognition of the court. On March 22, 2002, Australia deposited a new declaration with the ICJ, which stated that its recognition of the Court did not apply to "any dispute concerning or relating to the delimitation of maritime zones, including the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf, or arising out of, concerning, or relating to the exploitation of any disputed area of or adjacent to any such maritime zone pending its delimitation." This was widely understood at the time to be the result of Australia's dispute with East Timor over the maritime border. The declaration was signed by Mr Downer, who co-sponsored today's media release. The issue is especially important to both countries as the Timor Sea holds significant oil reserves. 

Mr Lee argued that Australia was unfairly using its stronger bargaining position in negotiatons, and deliberately avoiding submitting to a decision by the court.

"They are constantly harping on about the necessity of resolving the Timor Sea issue by bilateral consultation between the Australian and East Timorese government rather than subjecting the dispute to the umpire, i.e. the international court of justice maritime division," he said. 

Tom Clarke, Coordinator of the Timor Sea Justice Campaign, argues that the governments stance in relation to the ICJ is hypocritical. 

"By picking and choosing specific parts of the ICJ’s jurisdictions that it does and doesn’t want to acknowledge, the Australian Government demonstrates that it does not take International Law seriously. Our Government has some shocking double standards," he said. 

Mr Clarke also drew attention to the economic situation in East Timor. "When we’re talking about the Australian Government taking millions of dollars while East Timorese children are dying of preventable diseases, it really is no laughing matter."

Associate Professor David Reeve of the Department of Chinese and Indonesian, University of New South Wales, was asked if he thought the minister was being hypocritical. 

"Foreign policy is a tricky business, with lots of strands. And there are always tensions between any country's idealism and interests. It often happens that different bits of foreign policy thrust may seem to be contradictory, but it's a complex world, and any government is trying to play lots of notes simultaneously. In this case I think Downer can be quite genuine in his congratulations, while the advocacy groups have a good opportunity to highlight their perfectly logical views," he said. 

There has not been an Australian or New Zealand judge on the court since 1967. Sir Kenneths position with the court starts in 2006, and lasts for nine years.

The new &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="WorkChoices"&gt;industrial relations legislation&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed "WorkChoices" by the Government, passed the &lt;a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; November 10. It is to be considered next by the &lt;a href="Australian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;.

The House session became tumultuous, with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20House"&gt;Leader of the House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Tony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; moving a motion to permit an hour to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aconsideration%20in%20detail"&gt;consideration in detail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stage of the bill, comparing the amount of debate on other bills to this one, stating "we have had very, very extensive debate" and that "members opposite are not interested in debating this bill, they are not interested in trying to improve this bill; they simply want to reject this bill". The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManager%20of%20Opposition%20Business"&gt;Manager of Opposition Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the House, &lt;a href="Julia%20Gillard"&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/a&gt; (Abbott's opposition counterpart), had noted that "more than 20 Labor members are going to be silenced by this motion which is gagging debate", and when Abbott moved to put the question, "and, here we go, we are going to have a gag on a gag. You’re proud of that, are you? You’re proud of that?"

As &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnnette%20Ellis"&gt;Annette Ellis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; amongst others was one of the aforementioned speakers who had not the time to speak in the debate, she asked whether she could incorporate her speech into Hansard &amp;mdash; the Government granted leave for all speakers who intended to speak but could not to incorporate their speeches into Hansard.

In the consideration in detail stage, the Federal Opposition had moved a number of amendments to the legislation, one which would effectively &amp;mdash; as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Smith"&gt;Stephen Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had put it &amp;mdash; "kill the bill", another which would rename the bill to the "Workplace Relations Amendment (Cut Wages, Cut Conditions and Entitlements, No Fairness, No Work Choices) Bill 2005", but this amendment was ruled out of order by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hawker"&gt;David Hawker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

These amendments failed due to the Government majority in the house, and subsequently the bill was successfully read a third time.

&lt;a href="Mohamed%20el-Baradei"&gt;Mohamed el-Baradei&lt;/a&gt;, head of the &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; watchdog group &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (IAEA), may go directly to &lt;a href="Tehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; some time this week with a compromise plan to reduce the possibility that &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; may make use of its uranium enrichment program to produce nuclear arms.

Under a compromise plan negotiated last week between the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEU-3"&gt;EU-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (consisting of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, a loose agreement was reached where the final stages of nuclear enrichment within Iran, uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas, would be transferred to &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.

Gholamreza Aghazadeh, who heads the nuclear program in Iran, rejected the proposal on Saturday, insisting that the uranium enrichment program must be carried out in Iran. The rejection came after a meeting with Russian foreign minister of affairs &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIgor%20Ivanov"&gt;Igor Ivanov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Reza%20Assefi"&gt;Hamid Reza Assefi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , denied the meetings were to develop a nuclear program partnership with Russia that specifically relates to the new IAEA proposal.

The IAEA board will meet on November 24, when they may decide to refer Iran for possible economic sanctions before the &lt;a href="U.N.%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N. Security Council&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. secretary of state, &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, has distanced the United States from the short deadline for Iran to conform to the new plan. A state department spokesman, Adam Ereli said on Thursday that, "The secretary does not conduct diplomacy by deadline."

Enriched uranium can be used to generate energy or to make nuclear weapons, a capability Tehran claims is their right to pursue for the peaceful purposes of generating electricity.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABalance%20of%20trade"&gt;trade deficit&lt;/a&gt; hit a new record in September to $66.1 billion, up $5.7 billion from August. The trade deficit so far this year totals $529.8 billion. 

A large part of the deficit is attributed to Hurricanes &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Rita"&gt;Rita&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of the increase is attributed to energy imports that were needed after Hurricane Katrina slowed down domestic oil production. &lt;a href="w%3ACrude%20oil"&gt;Crude oil&lt;/a&gt; imports dropped $350 million due to shut down refineries, yet &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; imports increased $3.7 billion. Fuel oil and petroleum products increased by $6.8 billion. There was also a 2.6 percent drop in exports.

Also affected by Katrina, food exports fell $296 million from transportation delays caused by the shutdown of the port of New Orleans. The total decrease in all exports was $2.8 billion. 

The largest trade deficit is with China, up $1.6 billion to a record $20.1 billion after a flood of toys, clothes, and televisions were shipped to the United States.

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; has adopted an amendment, proposed by Senator &lt;a href="w%3ALindsey%20Graham"&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Carolina"&gt;SC&lt;/a&gt;), to a defense bill limiting detainees' court privileges. 

The amendment would make the Combat Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) statutory law, the Annual Review Board (ARB) statutory law, require the designated civilian officer to be a government official who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, not allow the preponderance of evidence against a detainee be derived from undue coercion, and remove &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo"&gt;Guantanamo&lt;/a&gt; prisoners' right to file &lt;a href="w%3AHabeas%20corpus"&gt;habeas corpus&lt;/a&gt; petitions in federal courts.

In regards to the habeas corpus provision, the amendment specifically states, "No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien outside the United States (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(38) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38)) who is detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba." &lt;a href="http%3A//thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F%3Fr109%3A55%3A./temp/~r109VfNmwp%3Ae27047%3A"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The amendment passed with a 49-42 vote. Five Democrats jumped party lines to vote for and four Republicans jumped party lines to vote against the amendment. Nine Senators, seven Republicans and two Democrats, did not vote on the amendment. &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Conrad"&gt;Kent Conrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Landrieu"&gt;Mary Landrieu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Lieberman"&gt;Joseph Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Nelson"&gt;Ben Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Wyden"&gt;Ron Wyden&lt;/a&gt; were the Democrats who voted for the amendment. &lt;a href="w%3AArlen%20Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%20Chafee"&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Smith"&gt;Gordon Smith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20E.%20Sununu"&gt;John Sununu&lt;/a&gt; were the Republicans who voted against the measure.

Senator Graham is quoted as saying, “The president has established procedures to determine who is an enemy combatant and to annually review their status. It’s now time for Congress to sign-off on these procedures and turn them into a statute, a move the courts will give great deference to.”

It should be noted that under Graham's amendment, detainees would be able to challenge only the narrow question of whether the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense at the time the military determined their status as an enemy combatant were followed. The Court of Appeals for the DC circuit would still retain the ability to rule on that question.

Civil liberties groups as well as human rights groups issued statements opposing the amendment. "The Graham amendment will create a thousand points of darkness across the globe where the United States will be free to hold people indefinitely without a hearing and beyond the reach of U.S. law and the checks and balances of the courts enshrined in our Constitution," the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Constitutional%20Rights"&gt;Center for Constitutional Rights&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement.

"The Graham amendment would strip all courts, including the Supreme Court, of jurisdiction to consider habeas corpus petitions or any other action challenging any aspect of the detention of foreign detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, except for the narrow question of whether status review boards follow their own rules," said a press release from the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Sony faces class action lawsuits for DRM</h1>

&lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; are the first to bring litigation against &lt;a href="w%3ASony%20BMG"&gt;Sony BMG&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20rights%20management"&gt;digital rights management&lt;/a&gt; (DRM) software found in at least 20 music discs released by Sony. The software automatically installs after the user agrees to a &lt;a href="w%3Aend%20user%20license%20agreement"&gt;end user license agreement&lt;/a&gt; (EULA) before the music disc can be played, and includes a &lt;a href="w%3Arootkit"&gt;rootkit&lt;/a&gt; that can create vulnerabilities in the user's &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; computer. One &lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;trojan horse&lt;/a&gt; exploiting the hole has already been discovered online.

The California lawsuit, filed on November 1, claims that the software violates the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, the Consumer Protection Against Computer Spyware Act, and the California Unfair Competition Law. The upcoming lawsuit in New York would seek restitution for consumers nationwide. 

Mathew Gilliat-Smith, the CEO of &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%204%20Internet"&gt;First 4 Internet&lt;/a&gt;, the company that created the software, claims it is "benign content." Meanwhile, in an ♡❤&lt;a href="NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ interview, a Sony BMG Music Entertainment Vice President said, "Most people, I think, don't even know what a rootkit is, so why should they care about it?"

Sony and First 4 Internet have released "patches" and uninstall kits, after programmer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Russinovich"&gt;Mark Russinovich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; discovered the hidden files from the rootkit. However, these uninstall kits are only installable online through an &lt;a href="w%3AComponent%20Object%20Model"&gt;ActiveX application&lt;/a&gt;, a technology many security experts advise users to deactivate due to its high execution privileges on host computers.

In addition to questions of legality, the DRM software has come under fire from media rights activists and even artists who unwittingly found their albums more stringently protected than they approved of. Furthermore, Sony's DRM software "phones home" each time one of their CDs is played. The license agreement does not reveal this behavior, nor does it acknowledge the existence of the rootkit itself.

Thomas Hesse of Sony BMG recently told the San Francisco Chronicle that 60 percent of Sony BMG CDs released in the United States currently have copy protection measures, and that they aim to hit 100 percent by early 2006.

&lt;a href="w%3AKazimierz%20Marcinkiewicz"&gt;Marcinkiewicz&lt;/a&gt;'s cabinet has been given a vote of confidence by &lt;a href="w%3ASejm"&gt;Polish parliament&lt;/a&gt;. Marcinkiewicz, from &lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20and%20Justice"&gt;Law and Justice Party&lt;/a&gt; (PiS), has won the voting with vote distribution 272 for and 187 against. His minority government have gained the support of minor, pro-social parties - &lt;a href="w%3ASelf-Defense%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland"&gt;Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland&lt;/a&gt; (Samoobrona RP), &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20Peasant%20Party"&gt;Polish Peasant Party&lt;/a&gt; (PSL) and &lt;a href="w%3Aeague%20of%20Polish%20Families"&gt;League of Polish Families&lt;/a&gt; (LPR).

&lt;a href="w%3ACitizens%20Platform"&gt;Civic Platform&lt;/a&gt; (PO) and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Alliance%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Left"&gt;The Alliance of the Democratic Left&lt;/a&gt; (SLD) voted against the cabinet.

Marcinkiewicz believes that his government will stop corruption and will help getting out of unemployment problem in Poland. His expose was praised by his party, LPR and PSL. Although Andrzej Lepper, the leader of Self-Defence Party, wasn't satisfied by the expose, he accepted it.

Leaders of both Civic Platform and The Alliance of the Democratic Left criticised the expose.

Conservative-national Peace and Justice Party won the September 25 voting, receiving 27% of votes (155 seats in 460 members &lt;a href="w%3ASejm"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt;), while their main opponent, conservative-liberal Civic Platform - 24.1% (133 seats). Winning parties were planning building up a strong, conservative-liberal coalition, but after the clinch between them, caused mainly by choosing Marek Jurek as a speaker of parliament, talks had been stopped.

&lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; could face a &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; inquiry into claims that chief police officers were pressured to support a political agenda during &lt;a href="Blair%20suffers%20defeat%20in%20vote%20on%20terror%20laws"&gt;Wednesday's vote to extend detention without charge&lt;/a&gt;. 

Chief police officers were asked to lobby MPs wavering over the introduction of a controversial new law allowing police to detain a terror suspect for 90 days without charge. Although the proposal was rejected by the House of Commons, the lobbying has provoked criticism from senior members of the opposition &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, who are pushing for an inquiry into the behaviour of government ministers towards the police and for 'embroiling them in politics'. 

Former Tory cabinet minister &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Lilley"&gt;Peter Lilley&lt;/a&gt; said: "Every chief constable knows their job is up for re-selection in the next year or so. That puts great pressure on them."

Home Office minister &lt;a href="w%3AHazel%20Blears"&gt;Hazel Blears&lt;/a&gt; denied the claims: "It is entirely proper that the police were there to make their case and for Parliament to consider it."

"Certainly, as a Member of Parliament I would want to have the benefit of the best professional advice I could get before reaching my decision."

The &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalian&lt;/a&gt; government called on Saturday for the international community to help stem the wave of recent seafaring pirate attacks off their coast in the Indian Ocean.

The London-based &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Maritime%20Bureau"&gt;International Maritime Bureau&lt;/a&gt; (IMB) reported yesterday that a &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; merchant vessel and its crew of 26 have been hijacked by Somalian pirates off their coastline. 

The predominantly Thai crew were kidnapped at gunpoint, and a ransom has been demanded for their release. The merchant ship was en-route from &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AYemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt; with a cargo of sugar.

A letter to Somalia from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; security council admonished the government. Somalia has largely disintegrated into fiefdoms since the former dictator &lt;a href="w%3ASiad%20Barre"&gt;Siad Barre&lt;/a&gt; was ousted in 1991. 

Last weekend, a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;-owned cruise ship was attacked with rocket propelled grenades. It is the fourth ship to be attacked in the space of a week. According to the IMB, there have been 23 other pirating attacks in coastal waters off the east African nation since March 15.

&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20McCartney"&gt;Sir Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled on Saturday, November 12, to perform the first concert broadcast live into space. Performing in &lt;a href="w%3AAnaheim%2C%20California"&gt;Anaheim, CA&lt;/a&gt;, McCartney will awaken astronaut Bill McArther and cosmonaut Valery Tokarev on the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. Songs played will include "English Tea" from his newly-released album "Chaos and Creation in the Backyard." Also on the playlist is the Beatles classic "Good Day Sunshine".

The idea for the show originally came from a report McCartney received about "Good Day Sunshine" being used to wake astronauts aboard the space shuttle ♡❤Discovery♡❤ as it prepared to land in August. Said Sir Paul "I was extremely proud to find out that one of my songs was played for ♡❤Discovery♡❤ this summer. In our concert we hope to return the favor."

This event will mark the first time a live music show is broadcast into space. It should be noted that only his voice will be heard, as there is no video feed from the site. The former Beatle has seen interest in his work climb recently with the release of a critically-acclaimed album and a children's book, as well as a series of American commercials feature songs from his new album and a collage of video clips and photos detailing his life's work.

<h1>Research articles predict next earthquake</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Research%20articles%20predict%20next%20earthquake&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Two research articles published this week illustrate continuing efforts to predict earthquakes. The first article builds upon the idea that analysis of the first &lt;a href="w%3ASeismic%20wave"&gt;seismic waves&lt;/a&gt; from an earthquake can provide a way to generate a several second warning that an earthquake will hit. However, for such warnings to be useful, the early seismic waves should also allow prediction of the strength of the earthquake. An article published in this week's edition of &lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;♡❤Nature♡❤&lt;/a&gt; concludes that scientists might be able to distinguish small earthquakes from big ones by using the very first second of information contained in seismic waves. 

Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, say the measurements of seismic waves soon after a trembler can signal whether it will be a minor or monster trembler. "Basically, a high-pitched squeal means that you'll get a smaller quake. A low-groan means something bigger," says the University of California's Richard Allen. 

In the study, Allen and colleagues analyzed records of 71 major Pacific Rim quakes in the past decades including 24 events that were greater than a magnitude 6. Using a mathematical model, they were able to estimate a quake's size to within one magnitude unit from as little as four seconds of data of the frequency of the energy in the primary wave. These low-energy waves typically cause a jolt, signaling the occurrence of a quake.

According to a traditional theory, called the cascade model, we cannot know anything about an earthquake's ultimate magnitude until it is finished. This is because spread along a fault line depends on the stress in each individual part of the fault. Given that this information is not available to the initial rupture point, it should be impossible to tell from that first slip how far it will go or how long it will last.

The study by Berkeley's Allen and Erik L. Olson of the University of Wisconsin-Madison builds upon earlier work by Yutaka Nakamura in Japan. Nakamura's research indicated that the frequency of the &lt;a href="w%3AP-wave"&gt;P wave&lt;/a&gt; can allow prediction of which earthquakes will have a magnitude greater than 6 and distinguish them from small tremors that do not require warnings. Some fire stations use P wave detectors to automatically open doors in an effort to make sure that emergency vehicles are not trapped inside by doors that can be jammed shut by earthquake damage. 

The goal of this research is to make the best possible use of the information from the earliest seismic waves emitted by an earthquake as part of an alert system to give seconds to tens of seconds of advance notice of an impending quake -- enough time for schoolchildren to take cover, power generators to trip off and valves to shut on pipelines. A major limitation of this work is that the greatest earthquake damage is near the epicenter where there is little time difference between the early P waves and the strongest damaging earthquake waves. 

The second research paper, published this week in the scientific magazine &lt;a href="w%3APhysical%20Review%20Letters"&gt;♡❤Physical Review Letters♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, builds upon earlier research into patterns of earthquake activity at specific faults. The new research by scientists from Israel and Germany led by Prof. Shlomo Havlin, of Bar-Ilan University's Department of Physics in Israel, concerns prediction of the timing between earthquakes.

Prof. Havlin's research, in collaboration with Prof. Armin Bunde, of the Justus-Liebig University in Giessen, Germany, and Bar-Ilan University graduate student Valerie Livina, involved a large number of past earthquakes at many different faults. The data used in this study were for earthquakes ranging from magnitude 2 to magnitude 5.5 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;Richter Scale&lt;/a&gt;. Data were from several areas of the world including California, Japan, and New Zealand. The new results are consistent with previous studies which have indicated that some faults have more frequent small earthquakes while other faults have less frequent and larger earthquakes.

Nearly two months after the &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; parliamentary election, the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (SPD) and the Christian Democrats (&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;CDU&lt;/a&gt;) and their sister party, the Christian Socialists from Bavaria (&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Social%20Union%20in%20Bavaria"&gt;CSU&lt;/a&gt;), have reached a hard-fought deal to form a grand coalition, paving the way for &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; to become Germany's first female &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20Germany"&gt;chancellor&lt;/a&gt;.

When the result of the elections on 18th September prevented both parties from forming a coalition with their respective preferred partners, the Greens and the Free Democrats, they were forced to engage in coalition negotiations with each other.

The negotiations were long and difficult; in the process, &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt; (SPD) gave up his ambitions for the chancellorship, SPD chair &lt;a href="w%3AFranz%20M%C3%BCntefering"&gt;Franz Müntefering&lt;/a&gt; resigned over the refusal of the party leadership to approve his candidate for a high party office, and &lt;a href="w%3AEdmund%20Stoiber"&gt;Edmund Stoiber&lt;/a&gt; (CSU) withdrew from federal politics and abstained from becoming Minister of economics.

"After 39 years of being political opponents on the federal level CDU, CSU and SPD want to move our country forward in common responsibility as the federal government", chancellor-designate Merkel said at a joint press conference. Outgoing SPD chair Müntefering added that "cooperation is good for the country".

Under the new &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cdu.de/doc/pdf/05_11_11_Koalitionsvertrag.pdf"&gt;agreement&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="w%3AVAT"&gt;value added tax&lt;/a&gt; (VAT) will increase by 3% to 19% from the beginning of 2007, the legislative competence on the federal level and of the states will be modified, and further reforms of the job market will be implemented. Married persons with an income that exceeds 500,000 € will have to pay an extra 3% on their income, the same applies to unmarried persons with over 250,000 € income. Dismissal protection only kicks in after two years of employment. The agreement also includes several amendments, some of them define by the letter how the wording of the constitution will be changed.

The coalition agreement was criticised by trade unions, employers' federations, and industry organisations. A VAT increase would "stall the economy" said Klaus Wiesehügel, the head of a construction union. The chairman of &lt;a href="w%3APorsche"&gt;Porsche&lt;/a&gt;, Wendelin Wiedeking, said that "we were only served lies. Everyone, whether low or high income, notices that."

Party conferences are expected to ratify the agreement next week; the election of Merkel as chancellor is scheduled for 22nd November.

President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; accused critics of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; of rewriting history and distorting the events that led to the U.S. invasion. In an effort to divert criticism of his administration's decision to go to war with Iraq, Bush said that some &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; viewed the same intelligence and came to similar conclusions. "Some Democrats and anti-war critics are now claiming we manipulated the intelligence and misled the American people about why we went to war," Bush said.
&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; Minority Leader &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; (Democrat) responded "Attacking those patriotic Americans who have raised serious questions about the case the Bush administration made to take our country to war does not provide us a plan for success that will bring our troops home," Reid said.

At the same time, the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Intelligence"&gt;Senate Intelligence Committee&lt;/a&gt; is making progress toward an agreement on how to implement 'phase two' of the Iraq &lt;a href="w%3AWeapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;WMD&lt;/a&gt; investigation set up to investigate how administration officials used the intelligence information available in the run-up of the Iraq war. The first phase of this investigation only focused on the quality of the intelligence information. Phase two was postponed until after the November 2004 elections.

The besieged airline industry received some good news today, United Airlines plans to hire 2,000 flight attendants. This is the first time in four years United has increased the number of flight attendants it employs. 

United Airlines, the second largest US carrier, furloughed many flight attendants as a result of decreased air travel after September 11th. At one time 5,500 flight attendants were on furlough. United finished recalling flight attendants on October 31st. The airline's problems were further aggravated by soaring fuel prices forcing the company to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy which it plans to emerge from in 2006. 

The new hires are intended to replace retirees and flight attendants who decided not to return from furlough. 

United stated that it will begin accepting applications November 13th at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.united.com/flightattendant"&gt;United flight attendant application page&lt;/a&gt;

The Galeras volcano could have an eruption at any moment according to Julian Villaruel, director of the &lt;a href="w%3AColombian%20Institute%20of%20Geology%20and%20Mines"&gt;Colombian Institute of Geology and Mines&lt;/a&gt; (Ingeominas).

The spokesman for the Volcanoes and Seismologic Observatory of Pasto &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ingeominas.gov.co/web/pasto/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, explained that the Galeras volcano has registered a level two activity in a scale of 1 to 4, which means that an eruption is likely to happen in days or weeks.

He declared that some of the measurements taken have been analyzed by scientific institutions in the US that have confirmed the likelihood of an eruption.

The observatory and the local committee for the prevention and reduction of disasters (CREPAD) will continue to keep a watchful eye on the behavior of the volcano in order to instruct the residents about the risks and the evacuation routes in case of eruption.

The Galeras summit is 4276 meters (14,028 feet) above sea level. The last time it registered some activity was in 2004. &lt;a href="w%3APasto"&gt;Pasto&lt;/a&gt;, at its base, is a city of about 400 thousand people. There are 5 other towns around the Galeras skirts. 60,000 people live around the influence zone and about 9,000 live in the area of highest risk.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Japan%20to%20hunt%20950%20whales%20for%20%26quot%3Bscientific%20research%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; whaling fleet is reportedly heading into the seas around &lt;a href="w%3AAntartcica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, drawing widespread condemnation from campaigners. Japan's fleet of six ships left the port of Shimonoseki, western Japan with a quota of 940 minke whales and 10 fin whales. 

Calls for the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; government to intervene have been rejected by the environment minister, &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Campbell%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;Senator Ian Campbell&lt;/a&gt;. Japan's whaling program, which is claimed to be for scientific purposes, is expected to kill nearly one thousand whales this season.

"Japan's attempt to dress up its commercial whaling as science is an insult to modern science," said &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx%3Foid%3D155388"&gt;International Fund for Animal Welfare&lt;/a&gt; (IFAW) Director of Wildlife and Habitat. "It's time for the Japanese Government to respect the rest of the world - It's time to stop whaling." A &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; statement dismisses the assertion of the Japanese government that whales are contributing to the collapse of fish stocks.

Senator Rachel Siewrt, spokesperson on marine matters for the Green Party said, "Mr Campbell can't answer a simple question on whether or not the Government plans to take any one of a number of legal and diplomatic actions open to it."

Legal action open to the Australian government includes invoking provisional measures under the auspices of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. These measures would &amp;mdash; in effect &amp;mdash; be an injunction preventing whaling from being started within the 14 days following.
In December, the &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Shepherd"&gt;Sea Shepherd Conservation Society&lt;/a&gt; will engage the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary. The Sea Shepherds say the Japanese whale kill is illegal. They will be acting in accordance with the United Nations World Charter for Nature in their intervention. The groups objective is to "hunt down the Japanese whaling fleet and harass, block, obstruct, and intervene against their illegal whaling operations."

According to Sea Shepherd: "The Japanese are violating the Southern Ocean Sanctuary. They are violating the International Whaling Commission moratorium on commercial whaling. They are targeting endangered fin and humpback whales that are protected under the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna. They are also in violation of the Australian laws protecting the Australian Antarctic Territorial waters."

International Fund for Animal Welfare condemns what it calls a "mass killing program — a defiance of international criticism and a global ban on commercial whaling — as commercial whaling disguised as science." IFAW urges the Australian Government to take Japan to the international courts to bring this program to an immediate halt.

Japan plans to kill over 900 minke whales and ten fin whales during the next six months as part of its whaling program, JAPRA II, marking a sharp escalation in Japan's whaling activities. "It is a dark day for some of the world's most magnificent creatures. Let's be under no illusion—this is commercial whaling in disguise. The Australian Government must respond swiftly by taking legal action to stop the boats in their tracks," said IFAW Marine Campaigner Darren Kindleysides.
Leading international law expert, Professor Don Rothwell, has advised IFAW that the Japanese Government is breaching international laws with JARPA II. He has advised that the Australian Government has very strong grounds to take Japan to in the International Law of the Sea to stop "scientific" whaling. Japan is targeting whales that are listed as endangered.

He argues that Japan's plans to double its whale take are an abuse of its legal right. "The number of whales that Japan purports to take is not commensurate with the number of whales that would be necessary to engage in scientific research," he said. "There's also increasing evidence that non-lethal means can be used to take data from whales to obtain information about whaling stocks."

&lt;a href="w%3ASony%20BMG"&gt;Sony BMG&lt;/a&gt; has announced it will suspend production of CDs with their controversial "anti-piracy" software. The move follows litigation being brought against the company for the software which allegedly opens up &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; to malicious attacks.

In an ironic turn of events, it now appears that Sony's software violates the copyright of the popular &lt;a href="w%3ALAME"&gt;LAME&lt;/a&gt; mp3 player, which is distributed under a public license. In the past, German courts have forced companies to release their source code to the public when it was based upon software distributed under such a license.

<h1>Fires at Baxter Immigration Detention Centre in South Australia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fires%20at%20Baxter%20Immigration%20Detention%20Centre%20in%20South%20Australia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

34 accommodation units have been destroyed by fire at the &lt;a href="w%3ABaxter%20Immigration%20Reception%20and%20Processing%20Centre"&gt;Baxter Detention Centre&lt;/a&gt; near Pt Augusta in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; today. The blaze also gutted a kitchen, laundry, recreational area and officers' station. The original blaze broke out around 4am ACST in the kitchen of the "White One" compound which houses single men. Fire units took almost three hours to put them out.

Fifty-eight detainees were evacuated from Baxter IDC. Six have been treated for smoke inhalation. 

Immigration minister &lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone%20Immigration%20Minister"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt; says about 17 rooms have been ruined and others damaged. She says deliberate property damage will not be tolerated and the Australian Federal Police are questioning four detainees over the blazes and anyone found responsible will be charged. 

"Anyone with no lawful right to be in Australia should leave irrespective of the behaviour that they've undertaken, but if someone with a visa or without a visa to be in Australia engages in criminal conduct that would be taken into account in terms of cancelling a visa," she said.

The Metropolitan Fire Service (MFS) said four fires appeared to have been deliberately lit. "The first fire in the kitchen area was followed by three other separate fires within the complex," an MFS spokesman said.

Refugee rights advocate Pamela Curr said she had concerns about the safety of detainees in the event of a fire because of the electronic doors. She said detainees at a detention centre at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport had been killed during a fire last month because authorities had been unable to manually open the electronic doors. "Thank heavens nobody seems to have been hurt today," she said. "We're always on the alert that Baxter is not a safe detention centre".

Bernadette Wauchope from Rural Australians for Refugees says the destruction will continue until something is done. "They become so desperate that they attempt self-harm or attempt suicide or maybe resort to lighting fires," she said. "After being locked up for years and years the feeling that they're isolated and that nobody's listening to what their stories are, often that, well it does contribute to these kinds of acts," she said.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; was the guest of honor in a memorial ceremony attended by some 200,000 &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israelis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; to mark the 10th anniversary of the assassination of Israeli Prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AYitzhak%20Rabin"&gt;Yitzhak Rabin&lt;/a&gt;. The rally was delayed one week due to Clinton's schedule. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt; opened his speech with some words of respect to the deputy prime minister Shimon Peres, "My dear friend Shimon Peres, thank you for servicing the case of peace all of your life and being a partner and a leader to all of us".

Regarding Rabin, Clinton said, "I loved him very much, and I was in awe of his ability to move from being a soldier to being a peacemaker, a politician to a statesman".

Clinton said that it was a great honor for him to be at the ceremony with his wife, daughter and friends from America to stand in solidarity for the memory of Yitzhak Rabin. He said: "If he were here he would say, "There is enough of all this missing. If you really think I lived a good life, if you think I made a noble sacrifice in death, then for goodness sakes, take up my work and see it through to the end" and concluded his speech with the words in Hebrew &amp;mdash; "Shalom Haver" (Goodbye my friend).

Later Clinton joined Peres and the rest of the politicians, most of whom were from Rabin's Cabinet and were with him on the same stage in the original peace rally for singing "The Song For Peace", the same song that they sang with Rabin that night.

Canadian &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Games"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; swimmer Mike Minenko has announced his official retirement from the sport. Mike finished fifth in his premier event, 100m Butterfly, at the 2000 &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Olympics"&gt;Sydney Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and won a silver medal in the freestyle relay at this years World Championships.

30 year old Mike, who grew up in a small town in Saskatchewan, currently lives in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; with his wife, American swimmer Lindsay Benko. Nicknamed "The Tank" with a height of 6'3", Mike never forgot his roots and was keen to emphise the importance of his hometown, telling the Canadian media "Small town values are so important"..."The people in a small town...they appreciate you working hard."

In addition to his World Championship medal, Mike holds the 50m and 100m butterfly long course and short course Canadian national records.

A journalist for the French Daily ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALib%C3%A9ration"&gt;Libération&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Christophe Boltanski, was attacked on Friday by several men in a street of &lt;a href="w%3ATunis"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;, where he was reporting on the repression of human rights activists.
He was badly beaten and stabbed with a knife in the back by four unidentified assailants near his hotel in the embassy district. Boltanski was also hit in the face by pepper spray. He called for help, but the policemen on guard outside the nearby Czech Embassy did not react, according to ♡❤Libération♡❤. 

Boltanski filed a complaint on Saturday morning before returning to Paris. ♡❤Libération♡❤ and Reporters without Borders suspect this attack was a deliberate act of intimidation decided by the Tunisian regime. According to a United Press International report, Tunisian authorities arrested two men Saturday on suspicion of assaulting Boltanski.

<h1>Chinese hunger strike continues at Australian detention centre</h1>

Three Chinese men being held at Sydney's Villawood Immigration Detention centre have ended a four-week &lt;a href="w%3AHunger%20strike"&gt;hunger strike&lt;/a&gt;. But another three detainees are continuing to refuse food for the 25th consecutive day. The men began their hunger strike on October 20 to protest Australia's &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;Mandatory Detention policy&lt;/a&gt;.
They said they had been persecuted by the communist regime in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and came to &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; seeking protection. Four of the detainees were taken to hospital last week but three were released on Friday. The remaining man in hospital has ended his protest.

"Three detainees in Villawood remain on voluntary starvation," an immigration department spokesman said. "Two Villawood detainees have agreed to stop their hunger strike.

Australian refugee advocates say they are concerned about the welfare of the Chinese men, who have been on a hunger strike since October 20 at Sydney's &lt;a href="w%3AVillawood%20Immigration%20Detention%20Centre"&gt;Villawood Immigration Detention Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Three of the six men from mainland China are continuing to refuse food at the centre.

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has refused to process the Chinese Asylum Seekers claims until they stop the hunger strike. &lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt;, urges the hunger strikers to end their protest. "Participation in a hunger strike will not help the cause of the individuals concerned," the Minister said. "I have personally written to all six to advise them that I will not be considering any cases while protest activity continues." 

The six original hunger strikers said in an &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ajustaustralia.com/informationandresources_speeches.php%3Fact%3Dspeeches%26amp%3Bid%3D22"&gt;October 29 statement&lt;/a&gt; that they are protesting against Australia's &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;Mandatory Detention policy&lt;/a&gt; and the mental and physical impairment caused by the long-term detention in Villawood - during which, they say, many people suffer long-term insomnia, dysphoria, and even mental breakdown. 

"We were persecuted by the communist regime in our own country where people lost their fundamental freedom, human rights, democratic rights and rule of law. Due to the inadequacy of the detention policy in Australia, we were forced to lose our freedom again and may, at any moment, be deported back to China and face severe persecution again," said the hunger strikers.

At a rally outside Villawood on October 29, the Refugee Action Coalition (RAC) said the asylum seekers want to be released from detention while their claims for refugee status are processed. RAC spokesman Mark Goudkamp says the men have been in detention for up to nine months. 

"We want to show people that they're not completely isolated, that they have support on the outside, and we want to get their message out as far as we can," he said. Mr Goudkamp says one of the asylum seekers is a &lt;a href="w%3AFalun%20Gong"&gt;Falun Gong&lt;/a&gt; practitioner and the others are pro-democracy, against the Chinese Government.

Ian Rintoul, also from the Refugee Action Coalition, says five of the men are asylum seekers and the sixth man's business visa has lapsed. "The treatment of the Chinese in detention shows that the department still has to face up to the underlying problems of mandatory detention," Mr Rintoul said.

"The Chinese are facing the same obstacles and the same departmental attitudes that kept asylum seekers behind the razor wire for years. The men make the point that they feel their lives are being destroyed by mandatory detention."

Mr Rintoul said most of the six Chinese asylum seekers had been living in Australia since the late 1990s and had children here. All had been taken to Villawood for immigration breaches and had lodged asylum claims, some of which had been rejected and were in the process of appeal. They want to be free to be reunited with their families.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20immigration"&gt;Immigration Department&lt;/a&gt; says the hunger strike will not influence decisions on the men's applications for asylum. 

But Mr Rintoul says that is not what the strike is about. "What they can't understand is why that claim can't be processed while they're living in the community," he said. "What the hunger strike highlights is why the misery of mandatory detention continues."

Peter Job from the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Victorian Greens&lt;/a&gt; has expressed grave concern for the remaining three detainees continuing their hunger strike past its twenty-sixth day. "Asylum seekers who maintain they have strong claims should have their cases re-heard. Given the obviously harmful nature of long term detention they should be allowed to live in the community while this takes place," said Mr Job.

A 25 year old British man has been reported to have made a full recovery from the &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV virus&lt;/a&gt; . Andrew Stimpson did not take any drug treatments after being diagnosed with the virus in August 2002 and was found HIV negative in October 2003.

Stimpson's two HIV tests were performed by the Chelsea and Westminster Healthcare NHS Trust. It has been reported that the hospital is standing by the validity of the two tests that have so far been performed. The hospital would like to perform additional tests that might reveal an explanation for the two contradictory test results. Tests used for diagnosis of HIV infection can produce &lt;a href="w%3AHIV%20test%23Diagnosis%20of%20HIV%20infection"&gt;false positive&lt;/a&gt; results. When this happens, additional testing is required in order to determine if there ever was an actual infection. Some news reports suggest that Stimpson may have had contact with someone known to be HIV-positive and that multiple HIV tests performed by a clinic all gave positive results for Stimpson before he was first tested by the Chelsea and Westminster hospital. However, Michael Hopkin of the British journal ♡❤Nature♡❤, has reported that while Stimpson tested positive for &lt;a href="w%3Aantibody"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; to HIV in 2002, "tests done during more than two dozen visits in 2003 and 2004 proved negative for the antibodies". This suggests that either HIV infection took an unusual course in Stimpson or the original test results indicating infection were a false positive.

Many similar cases have been reported in Africa, where the virus is widespread. Due to poor medical facilities all of these reports have been largely anecdotal&amp;mdash;Mr Stimpson represents the first well documented case. However, until additional tests are performed it is impossible to know if the second test was a &lt;a href="w%3AFalse%20negative"&gt;false negative&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Andrew Grulich, who has a PhD in epidemiology and works at the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research at the University of New South Wales has expressed doubt that Stimpson was cured of an HIV infection. In some infected patients, HIV levels can fall to undetectably low levels until their immune system is defeated and virus levels begin to rise. 

This discovery may offer a promising new window into how the virus works and furthers hopes that one day a vaccine and/or cure will be found for the disease that is carried by around 35 million people worldwide.

The rocket, which has a record payload of 10,000 kg, was due to launch in the 45 minute window opening at 4.35PM (23:45 GMT) on November 12th, 2005 from a base at &lt;a href="w%3AKourou"&gt;Kourou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Guiana"&gt;French Guiana&lt;/a&gt;. Officials have not yet given a new date for launch.

The rocket is the ECA version of the Ariane 5 rocket, which has been modified to enable it to carry a heavier payload. This rocket is carrying the Spaceway 2 for customer ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.directv.com/"&gt;DIRECTV&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and Telkom 2 for customer ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.telkom.co.id/"&gt;PT Telkom Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, both telecommunications satellites to be released into a geosynchronous orbit.

The maiden flight of the Ariane 5 ECA ended in disaster in 2002 when the rocket veered off course over the Atlantic Ocean and self-destructed, dumping two satellites worth 600 million euros into the sea. A second flight successfully launched in February, 2005, releasing two satellites into orbit. This will be the rocket's third flight.

20,000 labour activists in &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; joined a union-organised protest in the streets of downtown &lt;a href="Seoul"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday to express opposition to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAsia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation"&gt;Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (APEC) forum currently underway in the southeastern port city of Busan. 

The APEC summit of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Rim"&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leaders will include &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. The two-day APEC summit, expected to bring together 21 regional leaders, opens officially on November 18 in the South Korean port city of Busan. The APEC agenda includes discussions on how to enhance global free trade. 

Protesters' placards declared "No Bush visit" and "No APEC", demanding a revision of domestic &lt;a href="labour"&gt;labour&lt;/a&gt; laws to improve conditions for temporary workers. Police lined the protest route, using buses to block streets as protesters marched close to the US embassy and the presidential Blue House. City police officials said there were no reports of violence. 

The rally was organised by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20Confederation%20of%20Trade%20Unions"&gt;Korean Confederation of Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (KCTU), the second-largest labour organisation in South Korea. 

"APEC is playing the vanguard role of spreading new liberalism in trade which makes the rich richer and the poor poorer," said O Jong-Ryul, head of the People's Action against APEC &amp;mdash; another of the protest organising groups. The activists said APEC had become a tool for US multinationals seeking to expand their dominance in the world market "under the pretext of trade liberalization."

The rally was held after the death of a South Korean farmer, who allegedly committed suicide on Friday morning to protest the free trade and opening of the South Korean agricultural market. 

The rally cut off downtown traffic and caused severe congestion. No serious crashes were reported.

<h3>More protests expected</h3>
Some 80 protest leaders said they would organize regular street rallies throughout the week of APEC meetings. The KCTU intend to hold another rally in Busan on Thursday, in opposition to further trade liberalization and investment regulations. 

Activists hope to bring 100,000 protestors into the streets to oppose the summit. They call on the government to provide all citizens with access to free medical care and education and to address the problem ofincreasing South Korean wealth disparity.

"We will fight aggressively at the national rally on November 18 against the Busan APEC Summit and open Busan International People Forum by gathering all Korean progressives including workers, farmers and students," said a KCTU spokesperson.

Busan police said the rally would not disturb the meeting. "The police will also increase the number of personnel from some 7,000 to 22,000 and station more armored cars to prevent any violent protests," an official said. 

A spokesman for the port city of Busan, Steve Tang, said 37,000 officers from South Korea's national intelligence service, police, military, fire service, coast guard and customs were on high alert for APEC. 

The National Police Agency has banned nearly 1000 foreign activists from entering the country before the APEC summit, and is closely monitoring 350 activists. Further measures include a no-fly and no-vessel zone within a 7km radius of the APEC venue retreat. 

The city's police, have been on emergency duty since October 19.

The &lt;a href="w%3APrefect%20of%20Police"&gt;Prefect of Police&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; has banned public meetings in Paris, fearing violence in the &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; capital this holiday weekend, which marks the 87th anniversary of the end of &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20I"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;. Police remained on alert throughout the weekend, with some 12,000 security officers deployed around the country.

After more than a &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;fortnight of civil unrest in France&lt;/a&gt;, police imposed the temporary public meeting ban in response to Internet and text messages calling for violent action in the French capital. The government has declared a state of emergency in Paris and 30 other areas to help quell the unrest.

Today, Sunday 13 November, French authorities have reported less urban violence - despite fears of a rampage that prompted thousands of police to fan out at high-profile targets such as the Eiffel Tower. Across the country, the situation appears calmer. Rioting, car-burnings and arson attacks appear to be waning. 

Nationwide, 374 cars were torched on Saturday night, down from 502 on the evening of November 11, police said today. About 100 vehicles go up in flames in France on a typical Saturday night.

National Police Chief Michel said there had been a "major lull" in the rioting on the 17th night of urban violence. If the calm continues, "things could return to normal very quickly," he said at a news conference on Sunday. Night curfews are still in force in several areas. Mr Gaudin said there was a "downward trend" in the incidence of violence "with some resistance in the Paris region. This weekend we will exercise extra vigilance in the Paris region." 

On Thursday, President Jacques Chirac acknowledged that France had "undeniable problems" in poor city areas and must respond effectively. "Whatever our origins we are all the children of the Republic and we can all expect the same rights," he said.

Surveillance has been stepped up on suburban transport, petrol sales in small quantities have also been banned. 

Mr Chirac defended his use of state-of-emergency legislation, and said the priority was still to restore order. The state of emergency, adopted on Wednesday and renewable after 12 days, allows French authorities to impose curfews in designated areas, ban public meetings, search for weapons without a warrant and issue house-arrest orders.

Some 7,500 cars and dozens of buildings including schools and businesses have been torched since the violence began. 2,350 people have been arrested and 358 have recieived prison sentences.

The recent unrest erupted on October 27 following the deaths of two teenagers electrocuted while hiding from police in an electrical sub-station.

APEC, the Asian Pacific Economic Conference, whose membership includes about 47 percent of global trade and 57 percent of the world's GDP plans to meet in Busan, South Korea. The meeting will include US president George W. Bush, China's Hu Jintao and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi as well as 18 other heads of Asian governments.

WTO negotiations have met much resistance on reducing farm subsidies of some of the wealthier nations. Two previous talks have failed to break the stalemate 

"Support for the WTO negotiations is the No. 1 issue and the leaders will make a standalone statement on this," Choi Seok-Young, executive director of the APEC Secretariat said. 

Officials have drafted a statement backing the WTO's agenda. Officials are expected to sign the statement during the conference. 

Many leaders hope to end the stalemate over agricultural subsidies currently plaguing the WTO. "It's very important that they seek a breakthrough in this current deadlocked situation" South Korea's senior official and chairman of the meeting Kim Jong-hoon said.

"APEC would like to change this message of crisis into a message of hope."

"Bird flu will be one of the most important issues to be discussed because it could harm our people through illness, death and through loss of business and jobs." Choi-Young also said that leaders in Busan this week may suggest ways to end the deadlock in agriculture and to move forward on industrial goods and services. 

Protesters have other plans for the conference. 

Sunday, protesters peacefully demonstrated in Seoul in advance of the conference in a rally organized by Korean Confederation of Trade Unions. Organizers say thousands more will be in Busan during the meeting. Approximately 18,000 to more than 20,000 participated in Sunday's rally. Protesters wearing red headbands caring signs saying "No Bush visit" and "No APEC." Demands also included better conditions for temporary workers and better social security for all workers.

The inland city of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGoulburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Goulburn&lt;/a&gt; is still facing major water restrictions despite an easing in drought in the State over the past few months. The water levels in the city's dam, the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APejar%20Dam"&gt;Pejar Dam&lt;/a&gt;, are still very low at 11% full, with the total water supply at 32% capacity in comparison to 36% capacity over the same period last year. Available capacity for the city at 31 October 2005 was still under 20% and the water consumption rate of the city is approximately half compared with the five-year average.

Above average rainfalls in September 2005 have delayed some of the harder decisions facing the town in the middle of the year, such as the closing down of industries dependent on water usage. In May 2005, Pejar Dam was at 10% of its capacity and the town was looking at running out of water within eight months. There had been no significant rainfall since December 2004 and the dam was last full in November 2000.

Religious broadcaster &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Robertson"&gt;Pat Robertson&lt;/a&gt; warned residents of a rural &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; town Thursday that disaster may strike there because they "voted &lt;a href="w%3AGod"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; out of your city" by ousting school board members who favored teaching &lt;a href="w%3Aintelligent%20design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt;.

All eight Dover, Pa., school board members up for re-election were defeated Tuesday after trying to introduce "intelligent design" — the belief that the universe is so complex that it must have been created by a higher power — as an alternative to the theory of evolution.

"I'd like to say to the good citizens of Dover: If there is a disaster in your area, don't turn to God. You just rejected him from your city," Robertson said on the Christian Broadcasting Network's "700 Club."

Eight families had sued the district, claiming the policy violates the constitutional separation of church and state. The federal trial concluded days before Tuesday's election, but no ruling has been issued.

Later Thursday, Robertson issued a statement saying he was simply trying to point out that "our spiritual actions have consequences."

"God is tolerant and loving, but we can't keep sticking our finger in his eye forever," Robertson said. "If they have future problems in Dover, I recommend they call on Charles Darwin. Maybe he can help them."

The BBC reports that &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Meles%20Zenawi"&gt;Meles Zenawi&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that he had moved thousands of extra troops to the north of the country, to prevent an invasion by Eritrea. Ethiopia is estimated to have nearly half its armoured units in the area. Sapa-AFP reports however, "It is not true at all that there is an Eritrean troop movement," and, "Eritrea is only engaged in its development projects and agricultural revolution," as stated by the Eritrean Information Minister.

"We will not provoke the other side, nor will we be provoked by the other side," Information Minister Ali Abdu told Reuters in Nairobi by telephone from the Eritrea[n] capital Asmara.

As frustration grows on both sides, some fear that recent Ethiopian troop movements to the frontier while the domestic political situation worsens could lead to renewed conflict. AFP reports that "Ethiopia[n] police on Monday accused Eritrea of fuelling deadly street violence that rocked the country early this month and claimed the lives of at least 48 people."

At the close of a 3-year war over their common border, Eritrea and Ethiopia decided to settle their differences in court. The Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague in the Netherlands presided over the Border Commission. Its decision in 2002 was hoped to be the conclusion to this long conflict.

Instead the stalemate has drawn on for three years. One of the modalities of the &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Algiers_Agreement"&gt;Agreement&lt;/a&gt; was that the decision would be 'final and binding.' In essence, both parties agreed to the decision in advance. At the announcement of the decision both parties lauded the decision as being fair and on the side of justice.

Since that time however, the border between these two countries remains unmarked. The Ethiopian Government refuses to allow the marking of the boundary, saying that there must be allowance for the shifting of the border. On the other hand the Eritrean Government has recently curtailed the movements of the UN peacekeeping mission.

This Cold War has been cool for years, but as frustration mounts the conflict simmers and sparks have already begun to fly.

Michael and Cathryn Borden, a couple, both 50 years old, were found shot to death in &lt;a href="w%3ALititz%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Lititz, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; shortly after 8 AM &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; (1300 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). Their 9 year old son, David, had fled to a neighbor's house and called emergency assistance (911). The couple's younger daughter, Kara Beth Borden, age 14, was reported missing. Her older sister was found in the home unharmed.

Police believe that the abductor was 18-year-old David G. Ludwig. Neighbor Stephanie Mannon said Ludwig had been secretly dating Kara, without the approval of Kara's parents. "It wasn't because he was a shady character," stated Mannon, "because he wasn't."

An &lt;a href="w%3AAMBER%20Alert"&gt;Amber alert&lt;/a&gt; was issued for Borden, with her description stated as: white female, age 14, 5'1", 100 pounds, brown hair with blonde highlights. She was last seen wearing a black sweat shirt with "Pillar" across the front, blue jeans and black sneakers.

Public transport in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; came to a halt following an anonymous tip-off to police over an alleged bomb on the city's mass-transit network. Trains, buses and railway stations were evacuated by authorities without elaboration on the threat. They have not yet found any evidence to support the claim.

Passengers were moved at least 100m away from buses and train stations, and all luggage was removed. All inbound and outbound services from Southbank, Roma Street, Central and Fortitude Valley stations had been affected, but now most services have resumed, albeit with delays.

Police received a "general threat" about Brisbane-bound train and bus services from an unidentified source, leading to services being suspended from 11.45am (AEST) on Monday, a police spokeswoman said.

The scare takes place against the background of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Government"&gt;Australian Federal Government&lt;/a&gt;'s introduction of harsh new &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20anti-terrorism%20legislation%2C%202004"&gt;anti-terrorism laws&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; is due to make an announcement shortly.

Climatologists believe artificially induced &lt;a href="w%3Aclimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; is the reason Australia is destined for the warmest year on record. Temperatures so far this year have averaged one degree above the 30-year average, the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bom.gov.au/"&gt;Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/a&gt; (BOM) told the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.greenhouse2005.com/"&gt;Greenhouse 2005 – Action in Climate Change Conference&lt;/a&gt; being held in Melbourne this week.

The head of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bom.gov.au/climate/"&gt;National Climate Centre&lt;/a&gt;, Michael Coughlan, says Australia has had the warmest ever first 10 months of 2005, and seems likely to be a record-breaking year. "It's typically been a degree or more above the average for most of the months," said Mr Coughlan. "When you think you're averaging over hundreds of stations across Australia, to get a one degree warming over such a large area is fairly significant."

According to BOM, Australia has experienced its warmest start to a year on record (since 1950), with the January to October temperature averaging 1.03 degrees Celsius above the 30 year average (1961-1990). Annual mean temperatures have increased throughout Australia since 1910, particularly since the 1950s. 

"If one draws a trend line from the mid-50s or early 50s, through to the present, it's a fairly steady upward trend. And it's interesting that this is not true only of Australia, but it's fairly typical throughout most continents now, most parts of the world," said Mr Coughlan.

As the average temperature has risen, there has been an increase in the incidence of hot days and hot nights, and a reduction in the number of cold days and nights. This warming is mirrored in the oceans around Australia.

Michael Coughlan says warm sea surfaces are a significant factor in the creation of cyclones and hurricanes. "One might expect, with those sea temperatures being warmer than they have been in the last few years, that the odds would be tipped towards perhaps a greater number of the cyclones than we have seen in the last few years," he says.

Warming is not the only sign of change in Australia’s climate. Other changes include a marked decline in rainfall in southwest and parts of southeast Australia, and recent reduction in rainfall through the eastern states. At the same time, rainfall in the arid interior and northwest has increased dramatically, in some places nearly doubling during the last 50-years.

"Climate change affecting Australia is real," says &lt;a href="w%3ACSIRO"&gt;CSIRO's&lt;/a&gt; Dr Bryson Bates. "In 2005 the questions we face are how best to respond and adapt – from projections in agriculture to changing ecosystems, reduced catchment flows and downward rainfall trends," Dr Bates says.

The GREENHOUSE 2005 Action on Climate Change Conference is expected to attract 400 Australian and international delegates.

Protest meetings in other capital cities are expected to attract workers in their tens of thousands. The rallies will take place in 300 regional sites across Australia.

Labor's opposition spokesman on industrial relations, Stephen Smith says, "The more people become aware of the nature of the changes and the detail of the changes, the more they realise how vulnerable they are and the more they want to do something to prevent the changes."

Mark Bethwaite, from Australian Business Ltd, believes most people will go to work as usual. "Because frankly they are not convinced by the scare campaign the ACTU has been running," Mr Bethwaite said.

The Federal Government has been accused of instructing agencies to refuse staff leave to attend the rallies against its IR changes and says it will not be affected by a rally of one person or a 100,000. 

The Federal Department of Workplace Relations has issued advice to other departments that employees wanting to attend the National Community Day of Protest should be denied leave.

State and territory leaders intend to mount a High Court challenge to the Federal Government's proposed industrial relations changes. 

The ACTU say, "the IR changes are not just an attack on workers – they fundamentally undermine the values that make Australia great. Beneath all the glossy advertising are proposals that will unfairly curtail your rights at work, cut the amount of time you can spend with family, and erode your job security."

The federal government have spent over fifty million dollars on promoting the radical new changes.

Unions say the changes will make it easier for workers to be sacked; cut take-home pay and reduce minimum standards; change the way minimum wages are set to make them lower; replace the award safety net with just five minimum conditions; restrict access to unions; make it harder for employees to bargain as a group; and reduce the powers of the independent Industrial Relations Commission."

In Melbourne, Australian Education Union's Mary Bluett said the IR legislation "is not the legacy we want to leave our children." About 12,000 public servants, 10,000 building workers and hundreds of nurses are also expected to join the protest, but workers operating road, train, tram and bus services will remain on duty to allow commuters to travel free to the rally.

Sky News estimated the number attending the rally in Melbourne as 175,000.

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry labelled the rally "a tired union stunt".

Despite a drop in violence in the country over the past weekend, the &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; cabinet has agreed to ask the parliament for a three-month extension to emergency powers. Ministers agreed on the extension at a meeting chaired by President &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;, and a bill on that effect will be presented on Tuesday to the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20National%20Assembly"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; and on Wednesday to the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;.

The police reported 284 vehicles being torched in &lt;a href="w%3AMolotov%20cocktail"&gt;petrol bomb&lt;/a&gt; attacks on Sunday, the 18th consecutive night of &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;the riots&lt;/a&gt;. The number is lower than the previous night, when 374 cars were destroyed, and considerably below previous week's peak of 1,400.

Chirac, who has been criticized for keeping a low profile during the crisis, prepared to address the nation on Monday night in a television broadcast. Chirac was quoted by a government spokesman as saying that the emergency powers were "strictly temporary and will only be applied where they are strictly necessary."

In spite of all departmental prefects being authorised to impose &lt;a href="w%3ACurfew"&gt;curfews&lt;/a&gt;, in practice only few have. The extension of powers has drawn some criticism from local mayors who have deemed it an overreaction and potentially inflammatory. The pressure group &lt;a href="w%3ASOS%20Racisme"&gt;SOS Racisme&lt;/a&gt; said that events had shown that the prefects already had enough powers.

Since the beginning of the unrest on October 27, more than 8,000 cars have been torched, more than 2,700 people arrested and dozens of buildings wrecked. According to &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Manuel%20Dur%C3%A3o%20Barroso"&gt;José Manuel Durão Barroso&lt;/a&gt;, President of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; is prepared to release 50 million € in aid for damaged areas.

BELLEVILLE, Indiana — A man wanted in a Pennsylvania &lt;a href="w%3AMurder"&gt;double homicide&lt;/a&gt; and apparent abduction of 14-year-old girl was captured Monday after a red Jetta he was driving crashed in Indiana following a police pursuit, State Police said. 

State Police 1st Sgt. Dave Bursten said David Ludwig, 18, was apprehended about 12:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; (1730 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) after a car he was driving crashed about 20 miles west of &lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Indianapolis&lt;/a&gt;, in Belleville. Bursten first attempted to pull Ludwig over, but he sped off, initiating a pursuit by State Police.

Authorities believe that Ludwig was attempting to cross into Minnesota and possibly stay with his relatives, according to information provided by Ludwig's father.

Bursten said Ludwig was found with the missing girl, 14-year-old Kara Beth Borden, a daughter of the slain couple, and that she was unharmed.

"He's in custody and we have the girl," Bursten said.

A radio broadcast heard by a motorist prompted the listener to report sighting the car in which the two were riding.

Whilst a major earthquake, the epicentre was well away from any population centres, and initial &lt;a href="w%3ATsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; warnings predicting half-meter surges were later withdrawn.

Due to its size, the quake was felt in &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, over 300 miles away.

&lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island%20Rail%20Road"&gt;Long Island Rail Road&lt;/a&gt; (LIRR) service was suspended at Pennsylvania Station due to a smoke condition. The fire was in the station ceiling above the entrance to tracks 18 and 19 between the waiting room, and the information and ticket-vending booths.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Transit"&gt;New Jersey Transit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmtrak"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt; trains continued to run without delays during the incident.

The fire, which started at 7:05 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; (Tuesday 0005 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). (the last time shown on the mechanical departures board), continued to fill the 7th Ave. entrance with smoke as late as 8:10 p.m. local time, well after the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Fire%20Department"&gt;FDNY&lt;/a&gt; had the situation under control. TV crews captured footage and passers-by snapped cellphone images of the scene, while confused commuters were moved along to the tune of "Keep movin'" by National Guardsmen and &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;MTA&lt;/a&gt; Police.

The LIRR level of Penn Sta. was sealed off from the Exit Concourse on north, including the escalators leading to the 7th Ave. entrance. A myriad of commuters packed the Exit and West End Concourses, calling and text-messaging their delay on their phones.

By 8:22 p.m. local time the electronic departures board resumed listing trains, the station's shops reopened for business, and limited service was restored. Those who were shoulder-to-shoulder in the concourses found themselves in the same situation, but now on a train bound for home.

LIRR customers are advised that residual delays - and scent of smoke - should be expected for the rest of the night.

The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.

"The rise of our &lt;a href="w%3Adeficit"&gt;deficit&lt;/a&gt; and our ability to finance it appears to coincide with a pronounced new phase of globalization that has emerged in the past decade," the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Greenspan"&gt;Alan Greenspan&lt;/a&gt; said in a speech delivered today to the &lt;a href="w%3ABanco%20de%20M%C3%A9xico"&gt;Banco de México&lt;/a&gt;. "This phase is characterized by a major acceleration in U.S. productivity growth and the decline in what economists call home bias, the parochial tendency to invest domestic savings in one's home country."♡❤

"To date, despite a current account deficit exceeding 6 percent of our &lt;a href="w%3Agross%20domestic%20product"&gt;gross domestic product&lt;/a&gt;, we -- or more exactly the economic entities that comprise the U.S. economy -- are experiencing few difficulties in attracting the foreign saving required to finance it, as evidenced by the recent upward pressure on the dollar," he said. 

"Of course, deficits that cumulate to ever-increasing net &lt;a href="w%3Aexternal%20debt"&gt;external debt&lt;/a&gt;, with its attendant rise in servicing costs, cannot persist indefinitely," he added. "At some point investors will balk at further financing."

"A nation's current account balance thus is essentially a market phenomenon that is not readily subject to rebalance by targeting one or more policy variables such as the exchange rate," Greenspan said. In the speech Greenspan said &lt;a href="w%3Ainterest%20rate"&gt;interest rate&lt;/a&gt; increases nor cuts in the US &lt;a href="w%3Afiscal%20deficit"&gt;fiscal deficit&lt;/a&gt; would result in large reductions in the current account deficit. These are the three standard ways the government controls the economy. 

The deficit last year widened to $665.9 billion from $530.7 billion. It totaled $195.7 billion in the second quarter, or 6.3 percent of gross domestic product. 

Greenspan did say he did not think that the dollar would lose its dominant position in the global economy “any time soon” and that economic flexibility would help the United States should the dollar lose its status.

<h1>Hundreds of thousands rally in Australia against IR legislation</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hundreds%20of%20thousands%20rally%20in%20Australia%20against%20IR%20legislation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
People rallied in 300 locations across Australia today to protest the Federal Government's proposed changes to industrial relations laws, &lt;a href="w%3AWorkChoices"&gt;WorkChoices&lt;/a&gt;. According to police, around 150,000 people congregated in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, from where speeches were broadcast throughout the country. In &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, thirty thousand gathered in Belmore Park and Martin Place to watch the broadcast before marching to Chifley Square. 

&lt;a href="w%3ASharan%20Burrow"&gt;Sharan Burrow&lt;/a&gt;, President of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Council%20of%20Trade%20Unions"&gt;Australian Council of Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt; (ACTU), said that under the changes many working conditions would be under threat, including "penalty rates, public holidays, overtime pay, control over rostered hours, shift penalties, even 4 weeks annual leave." The government has claimed, despite various expert assesment to the contrary, and opposition from major Australian religious and charity organisations and some concern from its own backbench, that the IR changes will improve the economy and ultimately benefit workers, and dismissed the protests as having "little effect".

<h2>Speeches</h2>
Ms Burrow said that the union movement was "standing up for the values that shape the way we care for each other," and criticised the proposed legislation, calling it "an attack on living standards, community, family life and wages."

The IR changes were also criticised by a number of church leaders. , Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, said "I'm not a supporter of the radical weakening of the unions," and Anglican Bishop Phillip Higgins called them "disturbing and unwise."

Ms Burrow also criticised the Government's public relations campaign, calling it a waste of money. "They spent $55 million of our money trying to convince us that everything was okay," she said. 

&lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Combet"&gt;Greg Combet&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary of the ACTU, linked the struggle to past wars in which Australia has fought. "They fought and died in wars for this country. They do not deserve to have their rights taken away." He said that, for many, workplace changes would come quickly, especially for the most vulnerable. He also argued that some employers would be forced by competition to reduce wages and working conditions. "Even the best employers can be driven by competition to lower their labour costs. We will end up with an army of working poor, like the US," he said. 

"We will hold the government to account for the human cost of these laws," Mr Combet said. 

Former Labor Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Hawke"&gt;Bob Hawke&lt;/a&gt; said that the struggle was about what he called "the essence of Australian character - the fair go." Opposition Labor leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beasley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; declared that if returned to government at the next election, Labor would repeal the legislation. "This legislation is gone with the election of a Labor government," he said.

<h2>Government response</h2>

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Winston%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; predicted that the protests would have little effect. "It is my view that after they (the laws) have been implemented for a period of time, most Australians will look back on the criticisms and objections ... with a sense of bewilderment," Howard said.

"The sky will not fall in, weekend barbecues will not be abolished, parents will still be able to spend Christmas Day with their children."

The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Andrews"&gt;Kevin Andrews&lt;/a&gt;, echoed the Prime Ministers sentiments. "Well the Government’s not going to be distracted by rallies and hysterical overreaction," he said. Mr Andrews defended the Government's record, arguing that it has been responsible for an increase in wages over the past ten years. 

"Well what I would say to Australians, whether they were the people on the streets today or the probably 95% of Australians who were in their workplaces today working, is that firstly, look at the record of this Government over the last 10 years. That record speaks for itself. We’ve seen a 15% increase in real wages and we’ve seen a 1.7 million increase in jobs in Australia," he said. Mr Andrews also said that the industrial relations changes were about creating the conditions for a strong economy. 

"So what we’ve been on about is bringing about the economic conditions that we can have a strong economy which ultimately is the only guarantee of jobs and wages in Australia."

<h3>Debate over proposed legislation</h3>
The claims of the Government are highly debated and not supported by some independent expert assesment. Professor Mark Wooden from the Melbourne Institute said, "There is no economic sense in it." A report issued by 17 independent experts in industrial relations from Australian tertiary institutions stated that there "is no convincing evidence that the proposals will generate jobs," and that the "claim that individual contracts deliver a higher productivity is highly questionable."

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;IMF&lt;/a&gt; said in its 2005 review of the Australian economy that "the implementation of this package of reforms to widen employment opportunities and raise productivity by enhancing flexibility in work arrangements" was important for Australia's economic future, contradicting Prof. Wooden's claims.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOrganisation%20for%20Economic%20Cooperation%20and%20Development"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt; also supports reform to the Industrial relations system, claiming in its 2004 Review of the Australian Economy "To further encourage participation and favour employment, the industrial relations system also needs to be reformed so as to increase the flexibility of the labour market, reduce employment transaction costs and achieve a closer link between wages and productivity."

<h2>Melbourne protest</h2>
Before marching to the &lt;a href="w%3ACarlton%20Gardens%2C%20Melbourne"&gt;Carlton gardens&lt;/a&gt;, a live video hook-up was established between the major state capitals of Australia, plus smaller regional centres.
According to police, some 150,000 marched from &lt;a href="w%3Afederation%20Square"&gt;Federation Square&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Exhibition%20Building"&gt;Royal Exhibition building&lt;/a&gt; to protest the proposed IR legislation and voice opinion, vastly in excess of original union estimates of 60,000. Organisers estimated a crowd up to 245,000 while a report from Sky News from aerial observation estimated 175,000 people attending the protest. The crowd spread through &lt;a href="w%3ACategory%3AMelbourne%20streets"&gt;the streets of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; as far as the eye could see - a seemlingly endless mass from the ground. The march stretched eight city blocks; when the first marchers had reached the end at the Carlton Gardens, the tail end was just starting. 

For the marchers, the consensus was that the negatives of the legislation outweigh the benefits; that it will affect the poorer working class and the middle class long into the future unless the legislation is rolled back. One issue of concern was that the Government has not accepted that the minimum wage needs to rise with inflation, rather its position appears to be to allow for the possibility that the minimum wage could fall in real terms. Another was the loss of the safety net protecting workers from contacts offering less than award conditions.

Public transport was stretched to capacity and car parking was almost impossible to find. Inclement weather ultimately became fine.

<h2>Sydney protest</h2>

At 10am the estimated 30,000 protestors moved from Belmore Park down Hay St onto &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Street%2C%20Sydney"&gt;George St&lt;/a&gt;, chanting slogans and waving union banners. 

Led by a fire truck, traditional Korean drummers and the Unions NSW campaign bus, they stretched nearly six city blocks along George Street, chanting their opposition to the changes. 

Meeting with the rally from &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Place%2C%20Sydney"&gt;Martin Place&lt;/a&gt;, the combined march then moved on to Chifley Square, where another stage was set up, and more speakers were heard, including &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Garrett"&gt;Peter Garrett&lt;/a&gt;, Federal member for Kingsford-Smith. 

Garrett spoke mostly about the dispute between &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; and 28 aircraft engineers at its &lt;a href="w%3ARAAF%20Base%20Williamtown"&gt;Williamtown&lt;/a&gt; site. The workers are on strike to obtain the right to enter into a collective agreement negotiated by their union, rather than independent agreements. The strike is now in its fifth month.

Up to 100,000 people in NSW took part in 227 separate stopwork meetings throughout the state, linked by a nationwide Sky Channel hook up. The M4 motorway was also blocked off for nearly an hour, by transport workers and police.

More photographs of the Sydney protest can be seen in the &lt;a href="http%3A//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category%3AAustralian_IR_Protest_2005-11-15_-_Sydney"&gt;Australian Industrial Relations Protest (Sydney) Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Brisbane protest</h2>
In &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Brisbane, Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, organisers have claimed success after more than 15,000 people turned out to protest against the industrial relations laws. Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley joined the workers, including representatives from 40 unions, who rallied at &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Bank%20Parklands%2C%20Brisbane"&gt;South Bank&lt;/a&gt; before marching to the Queensland office of the National party. 

Mr Beazley told the South Bank rally that one of the first things he would do as Prime Minister would be to put in place "a fair system".

Queensland Premier &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; said the State Government will push ahead with its High Court challenge to the Howard Government's proposed changes to industrial laws. 

Rallies were also organised for the Gold Coast, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns.

<h2>Adelaide protest</h2>
In &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide%2C%20South%20Australia"&gt;Adelaide,&lt;/a&gt; the SA Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Rann"&gt;Mike Rann&lt;/a&gt; told a rally, estimated by police at 15,000 workers, that the State Government will fight the proposed new laws all the way to the High Court. "This is the most systematic attack on the values of Australian people that we've seen since the Second World War," Mr Rann said.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Trades%20and%20Labour%20Council%20of%20South%20Australia"&gt;SA Unions&lt;/a&gt; secretary Janet Giles was ecstatic with the response. "40,000 people in a city of one million . . . a sensational turnout. There are people here from every union, from all industries," she said.

<h2>Perth</h2>
In &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20WA"&gt;Perth WA&lt;/a&gt; commuters experienced transport disruptions today as the city came to a halt for the Rally. Police estimates put the crowd at 10,000. UnionsWA secretary Dave Robinson told those assembled near the foreshore of the &lt;a href="w%3ASwan%20River%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Swan River&lt;/a&gt; that it was a historic day. Premier Geoff Gallop, WA Employment Protection Minister John Kobelke and federal Labor industrial relations spokesman Stephen Smith also spoke at the rally.

The government earlier today revealed that Solicitor General Robert Meadows, QC, would lead WA's High Court fight, mounted in conjunction with Queensland and NSW. Mr Kobelke said the action would seek to save 100 years of cooperative Australian industrial relations based on conciliation and arbitration. &lt;a href="http%3A//perth.indymedia.org/index.php%3Faction%3Dnewswire%26amp%3Bparentview%3D14207"&gt;Perth images here&lt;/a&gt;

<h2>Other Cities</h2>
According to the ABC, 4,500 people rallied in the Tasmanian city of Hobart. Unions say 3,000 workers have rallied at Thoroughbred Park in Canberra. In Darwin, nurses, teachers, public servants, construction workers and entire families have turned out to show that not only workers will be affected by the Federal Government's industrial relations reforms. Traffic blocked the roads leading the Fannie Bay Racecourse. Crowds jostled for space to see the satellite fed telecast from the Melbourne rally. 

Wellington, NZ also showed solidarity as some 200 people demonstrated outside the Australian Embassy.

<h1>FDA ruling on emergency contraceptive pill questioned</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=FDA%20ruling%20on%20emergency%20contraceptive%20pill%20questioned&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The independent and nonpartisan US congressional watchdog, the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20Accountability%20Office"&gt;Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt; (GAO) called the &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration's&lt;/a&gt; decision not to allow over-the-counter (OTC) sales of an &lt;a href="w%3AEmergency%20Contraceptive"&gt;Emergency Contraceptive&lt;/a&gt; pill, "unusual". 

Emergency Contraceptive Pills or ECPs ("morning-after" or "next-day" pills ) are used to prevent an unintended pregnancy, following unprotected sexual intercourse. They are objectionable for &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion%20opponents"&gt;abortion opponents&lt;/a&gt; who consider their use to be a form of abortion, though scientific studies (including those by the FDA) classify them as contraceptives. The pill, called Plan B is manufactured by Barr Laboratories and had been approved earlier by the FDA as a prescription drug.

Barr Laboratories requested that the drug be approved for OTC sale for adults and prescription-only sale for minors. The decision to not approve went against the advice given by the FDA's Joint Advisory Committee and its Review staff and led to a GAO investigation into the decision making process. The investigation was requested by 30 House members and 17 Senators. 

The GAO found several anomalies in the decision making process. The rationale used by Dr. Steven Galson, the acting director of the Centre for Drug Evaluation and Research for rejecting the application was novel and did not follow usual FDA practices. The decision was not signed off by the director of the office responsible for the application and the director of the Office of New Drugs, as they disagreed with the "reject" decision. The GAO also found that the FDA's high-level management more involved in reviewing this decision than in other change-to-OTC applications. 

The Plan B decision was the only one of 67 proposed prescription to OTC changes to be disapproved, even after advisory committees approved the changes. FDA review staff told the investigators that they were told early in the review process that the decision would be made by high-level management. E-mail and other documents involving the then-FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan were found to have been destroyed "routinely".

The FDA has disagreed with the GAO's finding that the high-level management was more involved in processing this application and that the rationale offered was novel, despite acknowledging that the adolescent cognitive ability rationale was unprecedented in FDA practice. The accounts as to whether the decision to reject was taken prior to the reviews being completed offered to the investigators were conflicting. 

The acting director cited concerns about the potential behavioral implications for younger adolescents from OTC marketing of Plan-B, given their supposed lower cognitive ability, and that it was not valid to extrapolate data from older to younger audiences. However, the FDA had not considered similar "potential behavioral implications" for younger users for other OTC-switches and had previously considered it appropriate to extrapolate data from older to younger audiences.

In a move aimed at hampering the near-daily bombing attacks in southern &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, all owners of prepaid phones are required to register by midnight local time today or face being blocked.

Originally scheduled for implementation at the end of last year, the move was deferred to allow people more time to register their phones. The policy only applies to the three southernmost provinces that border &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20Province"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; formerly the Malay &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20kingdom"&gt;Pattani kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.

Thais from other parts of the country with prepaid phones will also be required to register should they wish to visit the region. When doing so their calls will be treated as &lt;a href="w%3ARoaming"&gt;roaming&lt;/a&gt;, a feature of &lt;a href="w%3AGSM"&gt;GSM&lt;/a&gt; which allows a user to make and receive calls on a network other than that of their service provider.

Many of the &lt;a href="w%3AImprovised%20explosive%20devices"&gt;bombs&lt;/a&gt; used in the south are believed to be detonated by mobile phone, although most of the more than one thousand casualties in the region have been from drive-by shootings and stabbings.

It is reported that 65% of the near half-million prepaid phones in the region that this would impact have been registered. Prepaid phones are commonplace throughout Thailand and estimates put the number in use throughout the whole country at approximately ten million.

Other efforts to deal with the insurgency in the predominantly &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; area include an announcement yesterday that approximately 20,000 local villagers will be given training and small arms to help defend their villages. Both men and women will be eligible, and those accepted into the programme will be put onto the government payroll.

&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s Chief Veterinary Office, Jia Youling, has announced that the country plans to take drastic steps to counter &lt;a href="avian%20influenza"&gt;avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; by attempting to vaccinate its entire poultry stock of 14 billion birds. The move follows a number of reports of the virus spreading within the country and other &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n countries such as &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; engaging in culls to try and halt the disease's spread. 

Millions of infected birds have been slaughtered in China and despite the spread of the virus it is only today that the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed the first human cases in the country. The cases include at least one fatality, a 24-year-old female poultry worker in the eastern province of &lt;a href="w%3AAnhui"&gt;Anhui&lt;/a&gt;. The other confirmed case is a 9-year-old boy in the central province of &lt;a href="w%3AHunai"&gt;Hunai&lt;/a&gt; who has since recovered.

It should be noted that these cases are the only documented cases reported. Obtaining truly accurate numbers is a challenge in China and elsewhere because bird flu outbreaks tend to occur in rural communities where there are not good hospital or laboratory services. Even if bird flu is suspected, blood samples have to be sent to one of only 200 specialized laboratories around the world. The cost of identifying and transporting to these labs from rural areas can be prohibitive even if the physicians in those areas are aware of such laboratories. There is little incentive for outbreaks to be reported by farmers, because any confirmation of a bird flu infection will results in the farmer's flock being destroyed and that may destroy the farmer's livelihood. 

The officials in &lt;a href="w%3ALiaoning"&gt;Liaoning&lt;/a&gt; have reportedly finished vaccinating all 320 million birds in the northeastern province. David Nabarro, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; coordinator for bird and human flu, says such vaccination programs are "the right thing to do" since slaughtering the animals will not work due to the virus being so entrenched in China's birds.

According to Henk Bedekam, the World Health Organization's representative in China, the time of year is favourable to the continuation of the disease. He said that since the virus can survive in the cold, winter outbreaks are to be expected during cold months.

Avian influenza continues to be a very rare disease in humans, and so far only seems to be transmitted to people through direct contact with infected birds. Experts, however, are afraid that the virus will mutate into a strain that will be easily transmitted between humans.

Elsewhere in Asia, the lethal &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of the avian flu has infected at least 126 people and killed at least 64 since 2003. WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng said, however, that there is no increased risk of an influenza pandemic since there has been no observed genetic change in the virus or spread between humans.

In2TV will be offered exclusively through AOL, and will not be syndicated on TV. Each show will have two minutes of commercials for every thirty of programming. The new AOL service differs from the new iTunes Video service in that iTunes offers only new programming. iTunes also sells shows at $1.99 per episode as opposed to offering programs that are fully advertising supported.

In addition to full-length episodes, In2TV will provide interactive quizzes, games, and trivia. The TV series will be orgainized into genre-themed channels, some of which are:

"This service will bring an unprecedented collection of popular TV series to a totally new platform, revolutionizing the distribution of television programming," said Eric Frankel, President, Warner Bros. Domestic Cable Distribution. 

Many companies are now making efforts to avoid going the way of the music industry, by preemptively providing legal, cheap methods of viewing TV episodes online. The notion that online delivery can be particularly advantageous to vintage television shows was sparked by an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMP3%20Newswire"&gt;MP3 Newswire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; article that appeared a few days after Apple announced its iTunes video service. The essay titled "Can iTunes Resurrect Old Time TV?" made a business case that older television content squeezed out of traditional television delivery schemes can be revived by new online revenue models.

In the lead-up to the &lt;a href="w%3AAPEC"&gt;APEC&lt;/a&gt; forum, thousands of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korean&lt;/a&gt; farmers clashed with police on Tuesday in the capital, &lt;a href="w%3ASeoul"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;, to demand the withdrawal of a bill to open up the country's rice market.

Local police said that about 40 farmers were arrested. Protesters drove back ranks of riot police in full combat gear as they marched towards the national assembly.

Police put the number of protesters and farm activists at about 10,000.The farmers were stopped just short of the assembly and entered in a standoff with the police, who used water cannon to subdue the farmers and disband the protest. 

"No to &lt;a href="w%3AWTO"&gt;WTO&lt;/a&gt;, No to APEC, No to BUSH," the protesters chanted. A representative for the farmers said one activist suffered a severe eye injury. Three police buses were burned in the protest. South Korean media reports that 70 protesters and 10 police were injured in the action.

Busan Mayor, Hur Nam-sik, said the protests should be contained. "I cannot block all the protests and demonstrations at APEC at all," he said. "If the protests and demonstrations happen, it has to be in an orderly way, not to harm the image and progress of APEC."

South Korean farmers regularly take to the streets demanding protection for the domestic rice market from imports. The farmers oppose government's plans for wider liberalization of the nation's rice market. 

"The government must come up with realistic policies for the rice market and the farming industry to allow farmers to live comfortably," said the Korean Advanced Farmers Federation. 

The rally follows the death of a South Korean farmer, who allegedly committed suicide last Friday in protest of APEC policies.

About 2,000 South Korean farm activists plan to travel to &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; next month to protest during a meeting of global trade ministers.

<h2>Highest Security Alert</h2>
Amidst the street clashes, South Korea has taken steps to insure against potential terrorist attacks at the forum. Civil and military forces in Busan are on the highest alert with some 37,000 deployed in the area.

Twenty one international leaders, including &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;US President George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, Chinese &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;President Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt;, Japanese &lt;a href="w%3AJunichiro%20Koizumi"&gt;Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi&lt;/a&gt; and Russian &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;President Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; set to attend.

Trade and foreign ministers have begun two days of talks ahead of the main summit on Friday and Saturday. Authorities have designated security zones that will be off-limits to protesters.

Over 900 foreigners with criminal records have been banned from entering South Korea during the summit period. Police say 400 others will be deported if they engage in illegal demonstrations.

Organizers said they expected thousands of demonstrators to criticize the international trade policies, which they say favors rich countries over poorer ones. An anti-APEC rally in Seoul at the weekend drew around 20,000 people.

The main security focus during the summit is terrorist threats. Although there have been no specific threats, South Korea has sent troops to Iraq and was mentioned as a potential target by al-Qaeda. 

US military declined to comment on whether their 32,500 American troops based in South Korea were helping bolster security for the APEC summit

Ships will be blocked from entering the area, officials said. Anti-aircraft missiles have been deployed around the city, and a no-fly zone designated above the summit venues.

Police have increased security at subway stations, department stores and cinemas. Thousands of volunteers nationwide are monitoring public transport for suspicious activity, and customs and security checks at all international airports have been increased.

The for October report released today shows prices for finished goods increased by 0.7 percent in October, prices rose by 1.9 percent in September. 

Liquid Petroleum Gas climbed 1.4 percent compared with 24.7 percent in September. Gasoline dropped 3.3 percent, it increased 12.7 in September. Diesel fuel climbed 22.7 percent, having advanced 1.5 percent the previous month. 

Prices for foods changed very little, a mere 0.1 percent decline, it increased 1.4 percent the previous month. 

The Producer Price Index is a US government report on prices as seen from the producer of goods. This shows prices before effects such as government subsidies, sales and excise taxes, and distribution costs. The index is used as a leading indicator of consumer inflation in the future as changes in price will eventually flow down to the consumer. 

The index can be found at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bls.gov/PPI"&gt;US Department of Labor&lt;/a&gt; web site.

A documentary aired by Italy's state-run RAI24 television has led to an admission from U.S. military of use of &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20phosphorus%20%28weapon%29"&gt;white phosphorous&lt;/a&gt; munitions during actions in &lt;a href="w%3AFallujah"&gt;Fallujah&lt;/a&gt; The documentary alleged the U.S.A. used the weapons in a "massive and indiscriminate way" against Iraqi civilians, but the military denies the weapons were used against citizens. Embedded Journalist Darrin Mortenson, who was with U.S. troops during the operation in Fallujah, already reported in April 2004 that a mortar team leader "directed his men to fire round after round of high explosives and white phosphorus charges into the city Friday and Saturday".

The U.S. State department initially denied that white phosphorus was used as weaponry, but Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Barry Venable said white phosphorous munitions were used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants. "It was not used against civilians," he said in a Tuesday briefing. Lt. Col. Venable repeated U.S. State department statements that white phosphorous munitions are a standard field artillery element. Up until at least April 2001 it was "against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets" according to the U.S. Army &lt;a href="http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20010430200039/http%3A//www-cgsc.army.mil/ctac/refpubs/ST100-3/c5/5sect3.htm"&gt;Battle Book&lt;/a&gt;.

The Pentagon briefing directed reporters to the March-April 2005 edition of the U.S. Army's Field Artillery magazine, where veterans of the Fallujah action described their use of white phosphorous munitions to "flush [insurgents] out", and it use as a screening agent (providing smoke cover) and as "a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines."

The 1980 &lt;a href="w%3AConvention%20on%20Conventional%20Weapons"&gt;Convention on Conventional Weapons (Protocol III)&lt;/a&gt;, which the USA is not a signatory to, disallows the use of incendiary weapons against civilian populations or air attacks against troops stationed in a civilian population center, but does not outlaw its battlefield use. General George Casey's 8 November 2004 briefing estimated the number of civilians still in Fallujah as between 20,000 and 100,000 civilians.

White phosphorous burns at temperatures near 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2760 C). It is used to start fires and can cause severe burns where it strikes humans. The Italian documentary showed photos of what it said were Iraqis who had been burned by the white phosphorous. The accepted lethal dose of white phosphorous is 1mg/kg.

The smoke raises contentions for its battlefield use. It is primarily used as a "marker", as the high temperature combustion causes "pillaring" of the smoke column. But the smoke does contain phosphoric acid and traces of unburned phosphorous, which is corrosive to human tissue (internally and externally.) The US Army Field Manual cautions "Phosphorous smoke produces phosphoric acid. Soldiers must wear respiratory protection, such as protective masks, if exposed to phosphorous smoke."

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s national soccer team, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Socceroos&lt;/a&gt;, have qualified for the &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20World%20Cup%202006"&gt;2006 Soccer World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, after beating Uruguay in a penalty shoot out in front of 80 000 spectators at &lt;a href="w%3AStadium%20Australia"&gt;Stadium Australia&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first time that Australia has qualified in 32 years and the second time in the history of the FIFA Football World Cup. The Australian team is managed by the Dutchman &lt;a href="w%3AGuus%20Hiddink"&gt;Guus Hiddink&lt;/a&gt;, who led &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; to the semi finals of the &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20World%20Cup%202002"&gt;2002 Soccer World Cup&lt;/a&gt; and is also currently coaching &lt;a href="w%3APSV%20Eindhoven"&gt;PSV Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt;, a Dutch football club.

Australia lost the first qualifier to &lt;a href="w%3AUruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; 1-0 in Montevideo and needed to win by 2 goals in order to guarantee qualification. A goal by Marco Bresciano in the first half had Australia leading 1-0 at the end of regular and extra time - leading to a penalty shoot-out. Goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Schwarzer"&gt;Mark Schwarzer&lt;/a&gt; saved the first Uruguayan penalty attempt and Australia made their first three shots count. However Mark Viduka shot wide and the game was again open. Australia's chance was again alive as Schwarzer saved the next shot. The subsequent shot sealed the win for the Socceroos.

The deadlock held in place by the EU continues after the finish of a 2 day meeting at APEC today. The EU stated that it will not budge on deliberalizing its tariffs on imported agricultural goods unless others provide more on industrial goods and services. The EU has received criticism for not matching an offer by the US widely considered to be generous. EU does not plan to make a further offer on agricultural issues before the next WTO ministerial meeting in December 13-18.
The timetable for the current round of WTO talks requires an outline agreement in place for the December meeting.

Rob Portman, the US Trade Representative, was not able to nail down some better detailed trade proposals. 

"The Doha Development Agenda negotiations are in dire straits," Kim Hyun-chong, South Korean trade minister said. He also believed that APEC members, specifically China and Japan, as well as the US, did not have "specific numbers" to offer as concessions. 

US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice took the meetings as an opportunity to get APEC members to do more on terrorism. "APEC nations must deepen our cooperation in the global fight against terrorism,' Rice said. "In the past year we have seen that the threat of global terrorism is still very real, with vicious new attacks in Indonesia and Russia and the Philippines," 

APEC ministers agreed that by the end of 2006 that all major airports will be safe from attacks by shoulder-fired ground-to-air missiles.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AParliament%20of%20France"&gt;French Parliament&lt;/a&gt; passed a law extending the state of emergency decreed on November 8 by president &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; for a duration of 3 months, the executive being authorized to terminate this period earlier if necessary. The November 8 decision, based on a 1955 statute, could last for a maximum of 12 days only, after which Parliament had to vote on an extension.

The state of emergency allows local authorities (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3Apr%C3%A9fet"&gt;prefects&lt;/a&gt;) to prohibit public meetings and regulate movements of persons, including &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Acurfew"&gt;curfews&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, in certain zones specified by the executive, where riots have recently taken place, local authorities may close meeting halls or bars; detain firearms; and authorize searches inside habitations during the day or the night by administrative order (normally, searches during formal criminal investigations have to be authorized by a judge). The government said that it will not use the power to regulate the media, and that searches will be subject to supervision by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Ajudiciary"&gt;judiciary&lt;/a&gt;.

The law was defended by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMinister%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28France%29"&gt;Interior Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, in charge of law enforcement. Sarkozy spoke before the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20National%20Assembly"&gt;French National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; (which approved the text on November 15) and the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Senate"&gt;French Senate&lt;/a&gt; (which approved it on November 16); he defended the actions of the government and explained why, in his opinion, the law had to be voted. Sarkozy is also the head of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt; party, which holds a majority in both houses, and there was no doubt that the text would be approved.

Sarkozy added that in the forthcoming months, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACompagnies%20R%C3%A9publicaines%20de%20S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9"&gt;CRS&lt;/a&gt; (riot division of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20National%20Police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;) and ♡❤&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20Gendarmerie"&gt;Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt; mobile♡❤ forces would operate daily in difficult suburbs as a "proximity police". He contended that the "proximity police" established by preceding left-wing government was too much concerned with social activities and not enough about arresting criminals. Sarkozy has also contended that some of the riots were orchestrated by drug traffickers, gangsters and other criminals in order to secure lawless zones.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;French Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; opposed the law, claiming it was excessive. Some left-wing members of parliament contended that using a law passed in 1955 to help quashing &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAlgeria"&gt;Algerian&lt;/a&gt; independence movements against children of Algerian immigrants was somewhat insensitive and unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to repeal the 1955 law. On the other hand, right-wing anti-immigrant politician &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APhilippe%20de%20Villiers"&gt;Philippe de Villiers&lt;/a&gt; has contended that the government was far too soft and called for the use of military force. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJean-Marie%20Le%20Pen"&gt;Jean-Marie Le Pen&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime opponent of immigration from poor, Muslim countries, pointed out that the events vindicated what he had long said.

Members of Sarkozy's UMP party blamed the de facto &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Apolygamy"&gt;polygamy&lt;/a&gt; of some African immigrants for the failure of their families to raise and educate children properly. They suggested a more restrictive approach to immigration.

Nicolas Sarkozy is a probable contender for the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20presidential%20election%2C%202007"&gt;2007 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. According to polls, his approval rate jumped by +11 to 63% during the events; he leads the approval opinions for presidential candidates.

<h2>A smoke and incendiary weapon</h2>
Yesterday the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; admitted using &lt;a href="w%3AIncendiary%20device"&gt;incendiary weapons&lt;/a&gt; containing &lt;a href="w%3Awhite%20phosphorus%20incendiary"&gt;white phosphorus&lt;/a&gt; during a major offensive in &lt;a href="w%3AFallujah"&gt;Fallujah&lt;/a&gt;. There is question, however, as to what end the use of these weapon is legal under conventions of war.

The way white phosphorus munitions are used determines if it falls in the category of chemical weapons, says Professor Paul Rodgers from the University of Bradford department of peace studies. "It is not counted under the chemical weapons convention in its normal use but, although it is a matter of legal niceties, it probably does fall into the category of &lt;a href="w%3AChemical%20weapons"&gt;chemical weapons&lt;/a&gt; if it is used for this kind of purpose directly against people." Professor Paul Rodgers is the writer of the book "A War on Terror: Afghanistan and After".

As reported on November 15 in the UK's &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Independent"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;, according to three artillery men writing in the March-April edition of Field Artillery, the magazine of the US Field Artillery based in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Sill"&gt;Fort Sill&lt;/a&gt;, Oklahoma, which is readily available on the internet, white phosphorus was used "as a potent psychological weapon against insurgents in trench lines and spider holes...We fired 'shake and bake' [a combination of white phosphorus and explosives] missions at the insurgents using WP to flush them out and high exposive shells (HE) to take them out." 

A spokesman for the US military, Lt. Col. Barry Venable, said yesterday when US admitted the use of white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon, that "White phosphorus is a conventional munition. It is not a chemical weapon. They are not outlawed or illegal." He added that "it was used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants." 

Robert Tuttle, &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;the American ambassador to London&lt;/a&gt;, wrote "U.S. forces do not use napalm or white phosphorus as weapons," in a letter to the Independent newspaper. When confronted with the US militaries' admission, an embassy spokesperson said "all questions on WP" should be referred to the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;.

Sir , Member of the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;British Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt;), says: "The use of this weapon may technically have been legal, but its effects are such that it will hand a propaganda victory to the insurgency. The denial of use followed by the admission will simply convince the doubters that there was something to hide." 

The Independent article concludes with a quote from Kathy Kelly of the group Voices in the Wilderness. She said: 'If the US wants to promote security for this generation and the next, it should build relationships with these countries. If the US uses conventional or non-conventional weapons, in civilian neighourhoods, that melt people's bodies down to the bone, it will leave these people seething. We should think on this rather than arguing about whether we can squeak such weapons past the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt; and international accords.'

<h2>White phosphorus. A conventional or a chemical weapon?</h2>
Battlefield concentrations of white phosphorus gas are generally considered harmless: there are no documented cases of white phosophorus gases resulting in fatalities. However, its use as an incendiary is under question. The United States reportedly ordered civilians to evacuate areas wherein white phosphorus was going to be used.

But claims that U.S. use of white phosphorus--or 'Whiskey Pete' or 'Willy Pete', as it is called by the military--contravenes the 1993 &lt;a href="w%3AChemical%20Weapons%20Convention"&gt;Chemical Weapons Convention&lt;/a&gt;, are based on its prohibition of any "toxic chemical" weapons which cause "death, harm or temporary incapacitation to humans or animals through their chemical action on life processes." The fact that direct exposure to white phosphorus produces precisely such effects on humans has been substantiated by numerous sources, both medical and military. However, since the effect of white phosphorus is largely incendiary, and incendiaries are specifically not precluded, there is some ambiguity regarding the classification of white phosphorus weapons.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; government will investigate the American use of white phosphorus munitions during the battle of Fallujah. The inquiry will try to determine whether US forces committed war crimes according to international weapons treaties.

<h1>Rumsfeld's Australia visit sparks protests</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rumsfeld%27s%20Australia%20visit%20sparks%20protests&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Defence Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; was confronted with fierce criticism by 500 anti-war demonstrators at a rally on the steps outside South &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; Parliament House today. Mr Rumsfeld and his delegation arrived at Adelaide Airport this morning amid tight security. Mr Rumsfeld and other senior members of the United States government will attend the Australia-United States Ministerial Meeting (AUSMIN), to be hosted by Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Hill%20%28Australian%20politician%29"&gt;Robert Hill&lt;/a&gt; and Foreign Affairs Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;.

The rally, labelling Mr Rumsfeld a war criminal, also called for the freeing of Australian man &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; from Guantanamo Bay jail. 

In a &lt;a href="w%3APress%20conference"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; held on Thursday, Defence Minister Robert Hill said that Hicks would probably be discussed, however he is not on the agenda. When asked why, Mr Hill replied, "Because &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hicks"&gt;the trial of David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, allegations that he breached US law, is not a matter of national security between Australia and the United States. But because he came from Adelaide, I have no doubt that the issue will be raised. And we would say what we have been saying, which is that we would like to see the trial progressed as quickly as possible."

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; SA leader Sandra Kanck said the rally was originally intended to protest at the proposed new terror laws. 

"We would not need terror laws if our Prime Minister had not tied us to the coat tails of George W Bush and Donald Rumsfeld," she said. "I have been delighted to hear much sedition here today and I have been delighted to see placards that are saying seditious things. "But by Christmas this may not be allowed in our democracy."

The government has previously rejected such criticism of the proposed anti-terror laws, arguing that protest and free speech will not be affected. Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock said in an interview last week that "there is very clear protection of fair comment." He also said that criticism of the new legislation is based on a misunderstanding of the role of definitions in legislation. 

"Most of the arguments I've seen ... has been predicated on a view that if you look at the definition of ‘seditious intent' which is for definitional purposes, that that is in fact constituting an offence. It is not one of the offences. And to use ‘seditious intent' as a basis for looking at what people would be prosecuted for misunderstands basic statutory interpretation," Mr Ruddock said. 

Strict security precautions ensured demonstrators could not get near Mr Rumsfeld, who is in Adelaide for ministerial talks between the US and Australian governments. 

South &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; MP Kris Hanna said Mr Rumsfeld was a symbol of that power and money which runs the United States and Australia. "They are willing to kill, they are willing to murder innocent civilians by the tens of thousands to exploit the resources of other countries and sacrifice even their own soldiers for these goals of war and expropriation."

Deputy US Secretary of State Bob Zoellick will also take part. Police in &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; have thrown a tight security net around the conference venue and hotel where the guests will stay, with up to 500 officers involved. 

Yesterday, SA's assistant police commissioner described Mr Rumsfeld as one of the world's top terrorist targets. 

<h2>Arrests</h2>
One man at the rally was removed by police and faces a disorderly conduct charge. South Australian police confirmed the 24-year-old man was removed from the protest outside the state parliament building, about 5pm (CDST). 

"A 24-year-old man has been removed from the parliament house area and reported for disorderly behaviour," Superintendent Neil Smith said tonight. "He will receive a summons to appear in court at a later date." 

Police removed and then later arrested the man who allegedly clashed with a sole pro-US demonstrator.

<h2>Ban on Rumsfeld protest removed</h2>
Parliamentary officials had originally banned the rally, saying demonstrators would be arrested if they went ahead with the protest. But South Australian parliamentary speaker Bob Such yesterday said the protest may proceed.

Dr Such said the initial ban was made on advice from police. But he said he was subsequently advised that he could consider applications from people wanting to protest during the visit.

The Rice Rumsfeld Reception Committee said the decision to lift the ban was a "victory for democracy and the right to dissent". 

Sandra Kanck described the ban as foolish and a dangerous attack on free speech. Police said they would not tolerate violent protests.

A masked man, believed by officials to be &lt;a href="w%3ANoordin%20Mohammed%20Top"&gt;Noordin Mohammad Top&lt;/a&gt;, a key figure in militant &lt;a href="w%3AIslamist%20terrorism"&gt;Islamic terrorist&lt;/a&gt; organization &lt;a href="w%3AJemaah%20Islamiyah"&gt;Jemaah Islamiyah&lt;/a&gt;, threatened &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20world"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; countries in a video broadcast on &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;'s Metro TV on Thursday. The man specifically named the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; as targets of his group’s next attack.

The video was found in a house the Indonesian police raided last week, where Top narrowly escaped being captured. A similar raid on a house in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Java"&gt;East Java&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the death of his associate, Azahari Husin.

The masked man on the video said that "as long as you keep your troops in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and intimidate Muslim people, you will feel our intimidation and our terror." He continued, "America, Australia, England and Italy. You will be the target of our next attack."

The man focused especially on Australia, saying: "We especially remind Australia that you, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Downer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt;, are killing Australia, leading it into darkness and misfortune and &lt;a href="w%3Amujahideen"&gt;mujahideen&lt;/a&gt; terror." Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer dismissed the message by saying that no democratic country should be intimidated by "a fanatic like Noordin Top".

Noordin Mohammad Top is a Malaysian senior operative of Jemaah Islamiyah, a group which is seen as the regional arm of international &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20fundamentalism"&gt;Islamic fundamentalist&lt;/a&gt; campaign &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. Police have been trying to catch Top, an expert in recruiting suicide bombers, and Azahari, Jemaah Islamiyah's bombmaker, since the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Bali%20bombing"&gt;2002 Bali bombing&lt;/a&gt; in which 202 people were killed.

The video also showed three young suicide bombers who killed 20 people in attacks on restaurants on the island of &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; on October 1. One of the men, Muhammad Salik Firdaus, said on the film: "My brother and wife, God willing, when you see this recording I'll already be in heaven." Bali police Chief I Made Mangku Pastika said that three men were currently being questioned over their role in the bombings and that they were "certainly also linked to the Bali bombs."

In a move that is widely viewed as an effort to suppress criticism, the &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister, Thaksin Shiniwatra is suing media tycoon Sondhi Limthongkul and his companies for one billion &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20baht"&gt;Baht&lt;/a&gt; (24.3 million &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;, 20.7 million &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;, 14 million &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;GBP&lt;/a&gt;).

In addition to the civil lawsuit, the Prime Minister is seeking a court order gagging press related to Sondhi from making defamatory comments about him.

Yesterday, the Thai civil court accepted the case submitted by Thaksin's lawyer, Thana Benjathikul, who warned that the media figure could face jail should he not cease his outspoken criticism of the Prime Minister.

The case hinges on Sondhi's accusation that the government illegitimately awarded a contract for a satellite installation to companies controlled by the PM's family.

The government denies that they intend to shut down Manager Media group's website, and stress that they do not plan to try and suppress freedom of the press.

<h1>U.S. government proposes removing Yellowstone grizzlies from endangered species list</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20government%20proposes%20removing%20Yellowstone%20grizzlies%20from%20endangered%20species%20list&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that "The greater Yellowstone area population of grizzly bears ... is now recovered". They propose removing this population from the list of threatened and endangered species.

More than 600 grizzly bears now live in the greater Yellowstone area. This area, which includes &lt;a href="w%3AYellowstone"&gt;Yellowstone National Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Teton%20National%20Park"&gt;Grand Teton National Park&lt;/a&gt;, and several national forests covers 18 million acres. Grizzlies occupy 68% of the suitable habitat within the area. They have been spotted over 60 miles from what was once thought to be the outer limits of their range. The bears' range and distribution has been increasing annually and is now 48% larger than when they were listed.

When &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20and%20clark"&gt;Lewis and Clark&lt;/a&gt; crossed North America in 1804 there were more than 50,000 grizzlies in the west. By the 1970s there were less than 1,000 and they only covered 2% of their historic range. In 1975, when the Grizzly Bear was listed as threatened, biologists estimated the Yellowstone ecosystem had between 220 and 320 bears. Since then, various government agencies and private organizations worked on a conservation plan that involved education, conflict reduction, and monitoring programs.

Four other populations of Grizzly Bear in the lower 48 states will remain on the list.

"It is time for a change in direction." &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House Representative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A%20John%20Murtha"&gt;John Murtha&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3A%20Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;PA&lt;/a&gt;), one of the U.S. Congress' most decorated Vietnam veterans said during a Thursday news conference, and where he called for the withdrawal of all American troops from &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. He estimates it can be done within 6 months.
The holder of two purple hearts continued; "The war in Iraq is not going as advertised. It is a flawed policy wrapped in illusion...Our military is suffering, the future of our country is at risk. We cannot continue on the present course. It is evident that continued military action in Iraq is not in the best interests of the United States of America, the Iraqi people or the Persian Gulf region."

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; and members of his administration and the Republican Party in recent days have been criticizing Democrats who are calling the pre-war intelligence that made the case for the war in Iraq both false and misleading. Republicans, calling a Democrat "cut and run" strategy irresponsible, say abandoning Iraq now would lead to civil war.

Over the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Veterans%20Day"&gt;Veterans Day&lt;/a&gt; weekend just past, the president of Iraq, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Jalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt;, said on British ♡❤ITV’s♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3A%20Jonathan%20Dimbleby"&gt;Jonathan Dimbleby&lt;/a&gt; program, "Within one year - I think at the end of 2006 - Iraqi troops will be ready to replace British forces in the south." But Murtha's heart-felt news conference, where &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt; writer Liz Sidoti said his voice cracked while he told of visiting wounded soldiers at a nearby Washington veterans hospital, was spurred by an obligation to speak for the troops. 

Murtha, who had served as a Marine Corps intelligence officer in Vietnam, angrily denounced Vice President Cheney's recent "stay the course" rhetoric with sarcasm: "I like guys who've never been there that criticize us who've been there. I like that. I like guys who got five deferments and never been there and send people to war, and then don't like to hear suggestions about what needs to be done."

Murtha continued with multiple reasons he says caused him to come forward at this time; "Our military has been fighting this war in Iraq for over two and a half years. Our military has accomplished its mission and done its duty. Our military captured Saddam Hussein, captured or killed his closest associates, but the war continues to intensify. Deaths and injuries are growing, and over 2,079 of confirmed American deaths, over 15,500 have been seriously injured -- half of them returned to duty -- and it's estimated over 50,000 will suffer from what I call battle fatigue. And there have been reports at least 30,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed...Oil production and energy production are below prewar level. You remember they said that was going to pay for the war, and it's below prewar level...Unemployment is 60 percent...And, most importantly -- this is the most important point -- incidents have increased from 150 a week to over 700 in the last year. Instead of attacks going down over a time when we had additional more troops, attacks have grown dramatically. Since the revolution at Abu Ghraib, American casualties have doubled." Murtha said.

Murtha said he would be introducing legislation forcing U.S. troops out of Iraq.

The House Democratic Leader, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, said of Murtha’s statements, "I think it speaks very strongly to the point that the President's policy is not working; two-and-a-half years after the President said, 'mission accomplished,' we still don't know what the mission is. So the focus really shouldn't be on Mr. Murtha, it should be on the President of the United States and his failed policy there."

In new PEW poll released today, public opinion jumped from 30% in 2002, to 42% today who believe that America should “mind its own business” internationally. It is a return to levels that were last seen in the post-&lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20war"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; period.

A string of suicide bombings in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; have killed at least 60 people and injured over 60 more as insurgents attacked a prominent &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; hotel as well as two &lt;a href="w%3AMosque"&gt;mosques&lt;/a&gt; 90 miles (140 kilometres) north-east of the capital.

52 people were killed and 65 wounded when two suicide bombers detonated themselves in &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27ite"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; mosques in the eastern Iraqi town of &lt;a href="w%3AKhanaqin"&gt;Khanaqin&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited mostly by Shi'ite &lt;a href="w%3AKurdish%20people"&gt;Kurds&lt;/a&gt;. The bombers entered the mosques during Friday prayers and blew themselves up, completely destroying the buildings. The attack was the latest in a series of bombings by &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Muslim"&gt;Sunni Muslim&lt;/a&gt; insurgents at Shi'ite mosques.

Earlier on the same day two suicide truck bombs destroyed an apartment block in Baghdad, killing at least eight people and injuring at least 43. The blast was near an interior ministry prison bunker where a torture scandal involving numerous Sunni Arab prisoners has been taking place. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; military and security experts said, however, that the target of the attack was not the bunker but a prominent hotel used by foreign journalists.
US Colonel Ed Cardon said the Baghdad bombing did not go according to plan. He told reporters that the first truck was to pave way for the second truck, but instead both trucks exploded in the same place. Cardon's view was supported by deputy interior minister Hussein Kamal, who said initial reports indicate that the Hamra hotel was the actual target.

Two policewomen were shot in &lt;a href="w%3ABradford"&gt;Bradford&lt;/a&gt; city centre today &amp;mdash; one fatally. The surviving officer has been hospitalized in Bradford Royal Infirmary. The officer who died is believed to have only joined the police force within the past two years. The murdered officer has been named as 38 year old Sharon Beshenivsky. The second officer has been named as 37 year old Teresa Milburn.

The officers are believed to have been responding to an alarm call from a personal attack alarm at "Universal Express Travel Agents" 116 - 120 Morley Street at around 3:25 GMT. 

The murder took place on Morley Street, which is in the University and College part of City, at the crossroads with Great Horton Lane are the main student entertainments and night clubs. The Alhambra theatre is at the bottom half of the street. The area is heavily covered by CCTV, which may help the investigation.

Home secretary &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Clarke"&gt;Charles Clarke&lt;/a&gt; said, "While incidents of this sort are mercifully rare, they serve to remind us of the risks and dangers police officers face every day in their work to uphold the law and protect the public."

Six people are currently under arrest in relation to the murder. Most of the surrounding area in Bradford has been closed off.

The carcasses of two deer, a coyote, and a possum were dumped in the Delta Gamma Iota fraternity house on the campus of &lt;a href="w%3ABall%20State%20University"&gt;Ball State University&lt;/a&gt; in on November 10. The dead animals were apparently placed in the house while members slept. A repairman discovered the prank while working in the house's kitchen.

Members left the house for at least a day while the animals were removed and the house was disinfected by the Delaware County Health Department.

The fraternity house is located off-campus and is recognized by Ball State -- the DGI house is unaffiliated with the intra-fraternity council, however.

The animals were apparently "&lt;a href="w%3Aroadkill"&gt;roadkill&lt;/a&gt;" (struck and killed by automobiles on the road). The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is investigating the incident due to the use of deceased animals in vandalism.

A &lt;a href="Tunisia"&gt;Tunisian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Muslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; academic has called on Muslims to reconcile with &lt;a href="Baha%27i"&gt;Baha'i&lt;/a&gt;s and followers of other religions. He has also called on involved Muslims to apologise to the Baha'is that have been humiliated and denigrated in Muslim coutries.

Dr Iqbal Al-Gharbi, a psychology lecturer at the Al-Zaytouna University in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATunis"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that many peoples across the world were asking for forgiveness for past wrongs, such as the &lt;a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, who asked for forgiveness for its treatment of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJewish"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; people, and &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; which apologised for the complicity of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVichy"&gt;Vichy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; regime. She said that, Muslims, by contrast, usually consider themselves to be the victims and usually innocent of any wrongs.

Al-Gharbi said Muslims should reconcile with Christian and Jewish minorities who lived in Muslim countries, and to &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;ns who suffered in the Arab slave trade. She said they should also reconcile with "small schools of Islamic thought" such as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsmaili"&gt;Ismaili&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Baha'i, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlawite"&gt;Alawite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADruze"&gt;Druze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Baha'is do not consider themselves to be a school of Islam but instead an independent world religion. They protest persecution in Iran (which has the largest Baha'i population of any Muslim-majority country) including execution, imprisonment, torture, deprivation of property and exclusion from education.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Commission%20on%20International%20Religious%20Freedom"&gt;Commission on International Religious Freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stated in its 2005 report that Baha'is are repressed in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and face execution, imprisonment and discrimination. Forum 18, the Norwegian human rights organisation has also reported discrimination against Baha'is in Muslim-dominated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAzerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The Government of Iran maintains that the Baha'i Faith is not a religion but an "espionage establishment", with links to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , British and American governments. Other Muslims consider Baha'is to be apostates &amp;mdash; Muslims who have abandoned their religion &amp;mdash; and this justifies discrimination.

<h1>Australian science organisation discontinues genetically modified pea research</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20science%20organisation%20discontinues%20genetically%20modified%20pea%20research&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20Organisation"&gt;Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (CSIRO) has discontinued research into a type of &lt;a href="w%3AGenetically%20modified%20food"&gt;Genetically Modified (GM)&lt;/a&gt; field &lt;a href="w%3Apea"&gt;pea&lt;/a&gt; that had been shown to be 100% protected against attack by pea weevils, a type of insect. The genetically modified field pea's protein was found to have a slightly altered structure which caused an &lt;a href="w%3Aallergic"&gt;allergic&lt;/a&gt;-style reaction in the lungs of mice and led scientists to believe it could have similar effects on human &lt;a href="w%3Alungs"&gt;lungs&lt;/a&gt;.
"That was enough to alert me to say this research should come to an end," CSIRO Plant Industry Deputy Director TJ Higgins said.

An earlier example of a problem with a GM food was a protein-enhanced &lt;a href="w%3Asoy"&gt;soy&lt;/a&gt; product that was abandoned because the Brazil nut gene transferred to the soy produced a protein that could cause allergic reactions in some people. That 1996 study was conducted and funded by the University of Nebraska and Pioneer Hi-Bred International. 

Environmental activism organizations like &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; were spawned by the &lt;a href="w%3APersistent%20organic%20pollutants"&gt;negative effects of the Petrochemical era&lt;/a&gt;. They are now campaigning against GM research. Greenpeace members have observed that not all reports of possible complications from GM foods found during product development have resulted in a quick end to further research. Rootworm-resistant GM corn caused "serious organ damage" to rats in Germany, but the corn developed by &lt;a href="w%3AMonsanto"&gt;Monsanto&lt;/a&gt; was approved for consumption in Australia by &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20Standards%20Australia%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Food Standards Australia New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; said Greenpeace GM spokesman Jeremy Tager. A scientific review panel of the European Food Safety Authority reviewed the results of a 13-week rat feeding study on rootworm-resistant corn that had been submitted by German authorities. Although the study found some differences in the kidneys of rats fed the GM corn, the scientists concluded that these results were "not considered to pose concerns over the safety of MON 863 maize". Many published studies performed with rats and other test animals have found no danger from the Monsanto rootworm-resistant corn. Within science, it is desirable that all research reports be reproduced and confirmed.

Australia has a $100 million field pea industry, so substantial amounts of chemicals are used to protect the industry's crops against the pea &lt;a href="w%3Aweevil"&gt;weevil&lt;/a&gt; Bruchus pisorum, though some crops use &lt;a href="w%3AOrganic%20food"&gt;organic control options&lt;/a&gt;. The pea weevil can cause yield losses of up to 30 per cent a year if left uncontrolled. So the CSIRO is in search of an alternative to using genetic modification. The CSIRO are not alone in the GM industry. &lt;a href="w%3ABayer"&gt;Bayer&lt;/a&gt; and Monsanto are both privately owned corporations who also operate outside Australia's strict regulatory system. A spokeswoman for Bayer Crop Sciences said the CSIRO's decision had no impact on the firm's GM work. Monsanto has not responded to media inquiries.
Dr Higgins said the findings proved the safety of Australia's strict research &lt;a href="w%3Aregulatory"&gt;regulatory framework&lt;/a&gt;.

"I think that this shows that the regulatory system works," he said.

"The regulations are stringent, they are difficult, but on balance I'm very pleased as a consumer of food myself that these regulations are in place."

The genetically modified pea plants were produced by transfer of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aalpha-Amylase"&gt;amylase&lt;/a&gt; inhibitor-1♡❤ gene from a species of bean. The structure of the ♡❤♡alpha-amylase inhibitor-1♡❤♡ &lt;a href="w%3AProtein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; produced by the pea plants is slightly different from the structure of the same protein when made by bean plants. This structural modification may be due to differences in &lt;a href="w%3APosttranslational%20modification"&gt;posttranslational modification&lt;/a&gt; of the protein. The altered protein from peas was found to predispose mice to a form of food &lt;a href="w%3Aantigen"&gt;antigen&lt;/a&gt;-stimulated &lt;a href="w%3AInflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; response that is mediated by &lt;a href="w%3ACD4"&gt;CD4&lt;/a&gt;-positive &lt;a href="w%3AT%20helper%20cell"&gt;T helper cell&lt;/a&gt;s.

Supporters of convicted &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; drug trafficker, &lt;a href="w%3ANguyen%20Tuong%20Van"&gt;Van Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, gathered outside the State Library in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; yesterday to display thousands of messages of opposition to his &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20sentence"&gt;death sentence&lt;/a&gt;. 

Callers to talkback radio in Melbourne were overwhelmingly against the death penalty of Nguyen, who immediately admitted his guilt and has cooperated with authorities since being caught smuggling heroin into Singapore. Many called for a boycott of Singaporean products.

25-year-old Nguyen was arrested at Changi Airport in 2002 for carrying heroin and sentenced to death in March. Nguyen claims he carried the 396 grams of &lt;a href="w%3Aheroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; strapped to his body in an attempt to pay off his brother Khoa's $30,000 legal debts.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; government have announced they will execute Nguyen at dawn on December 2nd. &lt;a href="w%3ASellapan%20Ramanathan"&gt;Singapore President S. R. Nathan&lt;/a&gt; rejected Nguyen's clemency four weeks ago. The Melbourne salesman was sentenced to death under Singapore law which determines a mandatory death sentence for anyone found guilty of possessing 15 grams of heroin or more.

Nguyen's mother was informed on Thursday by registered mail from the Singapore prisons service of the execution date. The letter stated that she should start making funeral arrangements. She will get to see her son in the three days leading up to the execution.

Despite repeated pleas for clemency from many thousands of supporters; religious groups; human rights organisations; the Pope; and the Australian Government - including Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; - Singapore officials have said Nguyen's execution is irreversible.

Mr Howard had argued that Nguyen should be spared, citing mitigating circumstances in his case which pointed to the fact that he was not a serial drug trafficker but had merely been trying to pay off his brother's debts.

The Victorian Attorney-General, &lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Hulls"&gt;Rob Hulls&lt;/a&gt;, says the Singaporean Government has shown no compassion whatsoever in its treatment of Van Nguyen and his family.

"What's happening is brutal, is inappropriate. I, and the Victorian Government, vehemently oppose the death penalty in any circumstances", he told ABC Radio. "This is a young kid who has assisted the police all the way... In any other country, he would get a discount in relation to the penalty. But because there is a mandatory death penalty for drug offences in Singapore, this young man may well be executed. It is just grossly inappropriate."

"Singapore maintains that capital punishment is a criminal justice issue; it is the sovereign right of every country to decide whether or not to include capital punishment within its criminal justice system," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 

Singapore argues that there was no international consensus that capital punishment should be abolished. At the most recent meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights"&gt;UN Commission on Human Rights&lt;/a&gt;, 66 countries dissociated themselves from a resolution calling for the abolition of capital punishment. 

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Hsien%20Loong"&gt;Lee Hsien Loong&lt;/a&gt; affirmed Singapore's position by saying that it has to "stand firm on drugs to protect its citizens from the scourge and to ensure the country does not become a conduit for the trafficking of illicit drugs."

In reply to a letter appealing for clemency from his Australian counterpart Alexander Downer, Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo said: "Mr Nguyen imported almost 400gm of pure heroin which would have supplied more than 26,000 doses to drug addicts."

No one will be permitted to see Nguyen on the morning of his execution. His body will be released to his mother. 

<h2>Bungle over execution date release</h2>
On Thursday, a letter informing Nguyen's mother of the Dec 2 date was accidentally sent earlier than intended by the Singapore authorities. As a result, Australian Prime Minister John Howard was caught offguard when asked by reporters on Thursday if he knew that Nguyen would be executed on Dec 2.

Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer yesterday admitted he had been told several days ago that a letter would be sent this week to Nguyen's mother. Mr Downer said his Singapore counterpart, George Yeo, had told him on Monday night, when they were both in Busan, that the family would be sent a letter which they would receive yesterday.

"So the Singapore Prime Minister had assumed that the letter would arrive on Friday," Mr Downer said. "The letter arrived a day earlier than they had anticipated." 

Australian Prime Minister John Howard said yesterday the differences between Australia and Singapore over the planned execution of convicted drug smuggler Nguyen Tuong Van would not damage relations between the two countries.

"It is not an issue where we agree but our disagreement on the treatment of Mr Nguyen is not going to contaminate the very good relationship between Australia and Singapore," Mr Howard was quoted as saying in an AAP report.

<h2>Lawyers say: regime should change</h2>
Mr Lex Lasry, QC, who heads Nguyen's Melbourne legal team, recently told Singapore's high commissioner in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; that the "regime" of the mandatory death penalty would have to change.

"At some point, the Singapore Government must realise as a First World country it can no longer continue to impose mandatory death sentences. They simply can't keep doing this to people," he said. He described as an "outrageous injustice" the Singapore law that denies lawyers the chance to argue to a judge why a client should not be hanged.

"Let the rest of the world know we are not prepared to tolerate it and ultimately they will have to change their minds," he said. 

"Even if our client is executed as he probably will be, the campaign against Singapore's mandatory death sentence will continue," Mr Lasry said. 

Mr Lasry said the fight to save Nguyen would continue over the next few weeks.

<h2>Execution methods reviewed</h2>
Nguyen Tuong Van may be the last person to face the &lt;a href="w%3AHanging"&gt;hangman&lt;/a&gt; in Singapore after a review of execution methods in Singapore. The nation's chief hangman, Darshan Singh, has told prison officials he wants to retire, but finding a replacement has been unsuccessful. One of two candidates picked to replace Mr Singh was unable to complete his first execution. A second left the prison service.

Mr Singh, a veteran of over 850 hangings, is reportedly unhappy with the new machinery, which is prone to malfunction. ♡❤The Australian♡❤ newspaper reports that Singapore officials have been studying other methods of execution and are considering the lethal injection technique used in the United States. 

The lethal injection method being considered by Singapore officials as an alternative is modelled on the procedure introduced in 1977 in &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. The prisoner is strapped to a gurney and an intravenous tube is inserted into each arm with a flow of harmless saline solution. At the warden's signal, 5g of sodium pentothal is administered, which renders the prisoner unconscious.

It is followed by &lt;a href="w%3Apancuronium%20bromide"&gt;pancuronium bromide&lt;/a&gt;, a muscle relaxant that paralyses the diaphragm and lungs, and finally potassium chloride, which causes cardiac arrest.

The former director of the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral &lt;a href="w%3AStansfield%20Turner"&gt;Stansfield Turner&lt;/a&gt;, in a frank interview with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AITV"&gt;ITV&lt;/a&gt; has condemned the current &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; administration. His comments indicated that he believed President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; is not being truthful when he states that torture is not employed by the US.

Turner, whose term as CIA director was during the 1977 &amp;ndash; 1981 administration of &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt; said, "I am embarrassed that the USA has a vice president for torture. I think it is just reprehensible. He advocates torture, what else is it? I just don't understand how a man in that position can take such a stance."

Previous statements by both President Bush and Secretary of State, &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, have emphatically stated that torture by US forces is not condoned.

In early October the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; supported Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain's&lt;/a&gt; (R-Ariz) proposed &lt;a href="w%3AMcCain%20Detainee%20Amendment"&gt;amendment on detainees and torture&lt;/a&gt;. The amendment would outlaw coercive interrogations and prohibits cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of detainees and change current US laws. In contrast, Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; has lobbied Republican senators to allow an exemption for those held by the CIA. Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Hagel"&gt;Chuck Hagel&lt;/a&gt; (R-Neb) said, "I think the administration is making a terrible mistake in opposing John McCain's amendment on detainees and torture," That amendment was approved by a 90-9 vote in the Senate and added to a defense spending bill.

Rep. &lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Hunter"&gt;Duncan Hunter&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;CA&lt;/a&gt;) on Friday called a vote in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; on a nonbinding resolution to immediately withdraw troops from Iraq. The one-sentence resolution read: "It is the sense of the House of Representatives that the deployment of &lt;a href="w%3APost-invasion%20Iraq%2C%202003%E2%80%932005"&gt;United States forces in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; be terminated immediately." 

Democrats in the House called the resolution a political stunt, saying that it misrepresented the comments of Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Murtha"&gt;John Murtha&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;PA&lt;/a&gt;), who a day before said "Our troops have become the enemy. We need to change direction in Iraq." Murtha, a decorated &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt; veteran and a retired &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corps"&gt;Marine&lt;/a&gt;, had called for a six-month withdrawal of US forces in Iraq during a news conference on Thursday.

The House chamber debate was highly partisan and emotionally charged. At one point in the debate, Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Schmidt"&gt;Jean Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;OH&lt;/a&gt;) said a Marine colonel in her state of Ohio telephoned and asked her to "send Congress a message: Stay the course." Schmidt said, "He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message: Cowards cut and run. Marines never do." At this, Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AHarold%20Ford%2C%20Jr."&gt;Harold Ford, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ATennessee"&gt;TN&lt;/a&gt;) and other Democrats surged toward the Republican side of the chamber in anger. "You guys are pathetic! Pathetic!" yelled Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AMarty%20Meehan"&gt;Martin T. Meehan&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;MA&lt;/a&gt;).

Many Democrats angrily and repeatedly shouted for Jean Schmidt to "take her words down!" She did, when order was restored to the chamber, rise and say, "My words were not directed at any member of the House," and asked that her comments be retracted from the record. House rules forbid members to impugn the integrity of other members.

The vote failed, 403-3. The three House members who voted for the resolution's passage were &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Serrano"&gt;Jose E. Serrano&lt;/a&gt; (D-NY), &lt;a href="w%3ACynthia%20A.%20McKinney"&gt;Cynthia A. McKinney&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia"&gt;GA&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Wexler"&gt;Robert Wexler&lt;/a&gt; (D-&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;FL&lt;/a&gt;).

In a joint agreement by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the U.S. Air Force will begin regular strategic bomber aircraft training in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Territory"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; early next year. At the recent high-level &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AANZUS"&gt;AUSMIN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; talks between the U.S. and Australia it was announced that the strategic bomber training program would involve &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AB-52%20Stratofortress"&gt;B-52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AB-1%20Lancer"&gt;B-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bombers and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStealth%20aircraft"&gt;B-2 stealth aircraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Under the new arrangements aircraft would fly direct from the United States for bombing operations at the Delamere Air Weapons Range situated about 130km south-west of [[w:Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine}} in the Northern Territory. Delamere is a 211,000ha bombing range used regularly by the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Royal Australian Air Force|Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF)]]&lt;/span&gt; for dropping live weapons. The [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:RAAF Base Darwin|Darwin RAAF base]]&lt;/span&gt; would also be available for the bombers to land and refuel if necessary. The planes will fly to the Northern Territory from the U.S. Pacific Island base of [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Guam|Guam]]&lt;/span&gt; .

<h2>Support</h2>
[[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Robert Hill Australian politician|Defence Minister Robert Hill]]&lt;/span&gt; says Australia is helping in the rebalancing of America's military forces in Asia. Senator Hill said strategic bomber training had been conducted some time ago and that the U.S. had now asked Australia whether it could be resumed. 

"We have said we are happy to assist," Senator Hill told reporters. Mr Hill said some of the aircraft may not even touch down in Australia, while others will land at the Darwin RAAF base. 

The bombers will fly from the major US base on the Pacific island of [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Guam|Guam]]&lt;/span&gt; . "It may be aircraft that come down to Australia from a considerable distance and use our bombing ranges and then return without landing," he said. "There will also be occasions when the aircraft will land and utilise facilities at Darwin. We think it's just another example in which we can be helpful to our ally".

Labor's opposition defence spokesman, [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Robert McClelland (Australian politician)|Robert McClelland]]&lt;/span&gt; , also supports the program. "It's very important to our long-term security that we support the United States alliance as a partner - not being dictated to in anyway - but as a partner," he said. "It is quite reasonable we provide a significant resource we have in Australia, which is open space, to develop the technologies and the skills."

<h2>Concerns</h2>
But the [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Australian Greens|Australian Greens]]&lt;/span&gt; are outraged by the project, saying there has been no consultation in the Territory. "The Australian Government more and more is allowing the Americans to view this country as the 51st state," [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Bob Brown|Greens leader Senator Bob Brown]]&lt;/span&gt; said.

The mayor of Katherine, Anne Shepherd, also has serious concerns about the plan. "I know of the other accidents that have happened there when the Americans were training," Ms Shepherd said. 

In August this year, A U.S. Marine Corps fighter jet dropped a bomb and damaged a building in an accident. The bomb, dropped by an [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]]&lt;/span&gt; , exploded near a control tower and damaged facilities at Delamere Air Weapons Range - attached to the RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine.

At the time, [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:John Howard|Prime Minister John Howard]]&lt;/span&gt; said: "Things like this will always happen; we hope not very frequently and we hope not any more dangerously," he told Melbourne Radio 3AW in August. "But the idea that you can conduct any kind of military exercise without some kind of potential for mishap is unrealistic."

Ms Shepherd is also worried about the possible use of [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:depleted uranium|depleted uranium]]&lt;/span&gt; . "I know that they use the depleted uranium on the warheads for added penetration ... and the weapons can penetrate much more easily with the depleted uranium and I'd be quite concerned if they use those kind of weapons," she said. 

The Northern Territory Environment Center says it is disgusted by the announcement. Co-ordinator Peter Robertson is alarmed about the location of the training. "Only a matter of 100 kilometres or so from one of the proposed [[Category:Pages with defaulting non-local links]]&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;[[w:Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]]&lt;/span&gt; dump sites near Katherine, and it would be extraordinarily alarming and ironic if an American B-52 bomber dropped a live bomb on top of the Commonwealth's nuclear waste dump," he said.

Concerns have also been raised about the environmental impact of the training program. Australia and the United States have agreed to work towards world's best practice in environmental management for the combined military activities. 

But Mr Robertson says world's best practice is simply to stop doing it. "Not to do it in a way that puts at risk communities, the environment... I mean the notion that there are clean green bombs that can be rained down on the Northern Territory, or any other part of the world, is an absolute nonsense," he said.

<h1>French unions march in support of public services</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=French%20unions%20march%20in%20support%20of%20public%20services&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today, a number of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; unions and left-wing parties marched in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; in order to support public services, which they feel are threatened by the current government. Those who demonstrated (unionists, politicians and simple employees) are opposed to the privatization of public companies such as the electrical and gas utility &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEDF"&gt;EDF&lt;/a&gt;, or to the scaling down of public services such as the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALa%20Poste"&gt;national public postal service&lt;/a&gt; in rural areas.

Organizers claim 30,000 protested, as opposed to the 10,000 figure cited by the police. The march was peaceful and uneventful, with a light police escort to open the streets, and City of Paris sanitation vehicles coming just behind to clean the streets of leaflets and other litter. Many of the protesters were under the banners the Communist-influenced &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20du%20Travail"&gt;CGT&lt;/a&gt; union, most others under those of major confederations or parties such as the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20Communist%20Party"&gt;French Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;. A small minority were from radical groups such as the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAnarcho-syndicalism"&gt;anarcho-syndicalist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20nationale%20du%20travail"&gt;CNT&lt;/a&gt; or ♡❤Les Alternatifs♡❤. A group of French scientific researchers and graduate students protested the government's policies with respect to research funding.

Among the personalities who marched are politicians &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMarie-George%20Buffet"&gt;Marie-George Buffet&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFrench%20Communist%20Party"&gt;French Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;), George Sarre (MRC) and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AOlivier%20Besancenot"&gt;Olivier Besancenot&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARevolutionary%20Communist%20League%20%28France%29"&gt;Revolutionary Communist League&lt;/a&gt;), and unionists &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABernard%20Thibault"&gt;Bernard Thibault&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AConf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20du%20Travail"&gt;CGT&lt;/a&gt;), Annick Coupé (♡❤&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASolidaires%20Unitaires%20D%C3%A9mocratiques"&gt;Solidaires&lt;/a&gt;♡❤) and Gérard Aschiéri (FSU).

The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.itu.int/wsis/"&gt;World Summit on the Information Society&lt;/a&gt;, organized by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Telecommunication%20Union"&gt;International Telecommunication Union&lt;/a&gt;, concluded on Friday evening, November 18th, in &lt;a href="w%3ATunis"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the north African nation of &lt;a href="w%3ATunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;. The event's organizers intended for the event to "put into motion" the plan for Internet financing and governance developed at the 2003 WSIS summit in Geneva, &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.

The summit was marred by criticism of Tunisia for allowing attacks on journalists and human rights defenders to occur in the days leading up to the event. A French journalist for "Libération" was stabbed and beaten by unidentified men after he reported on local human rights protesters. A Belgian television crew was harassed and forced to hand over footage of Tunisian dissidents, while local human rights defenders were roughed up and prevented from organising a meeting with international civil society groups. A representative from the French media watchdog &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, Robert Menard, was prevented from disembarking from his Air France flight to Tunis to attend the summit.

During the event, representatives from the Global Voices project were menaced by the Tunisian police as they held their session on "Expression Under Repression." Speaking at the session were Rebecca MacKinnon, Ethan Zuckerman, Nart Villeneuve, Taurai Maduna, Isaac Mao, and Hossein Derakshan, among others. The &lt;a href="http%3A//cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/home%3Fwid%3D10%26amp%3Bfunc%3DviewSubmission%26amp%3Bsid%3D855"&gt;interaction with the Tunisian police&lt;/a&gt; is related by Amanda Michel of the Berkman Center with the description from an attendee as, "[B]efore the break, a phalanx of secret police (ie scary guys in dark suits) showed up. [T]hey filled the hall outside the room, forcing cancellation of the break for fear that we'd not be allowed to re-start."

&lt;a href="w%3ANicholas%20Negroponte"&gt;Nicholas Negroponte&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated the first working prototype of his &lt;a href="w%3A%24100%20laptop"&gt;$100 laptop&lt;/a&gt;.

Police in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; have reported two bomb explosions in the southern province of &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt;. Twelve people are reported to have been injured, including three police officers, a two-year-old boy, and a 58-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysian&lt;/a&gt; tourist.

The two explosions came within a five minute interval around 6:00am local time (23:00 GMT). The target of the attack was a restaurant in a market town, Sungai Golok, which borders with Malaysia. Police Captain Teerapak Sengseng said that the first of the explosive devices was concealed in a fruit basket, and that as the blast was being investigated the second device exploded only metres away.

The ongoing violence which is believed to be the work of insurgents in the predominantly &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; south of Thailand has resulted in over 1,000 deaths since January 2004, with the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; putting the figure at over 1,100. The area remains under Martial law which was recently extended to some areas of neighbouring &lt;a href="w%3ASongkla%20Province"&gt;Songkla Province&lt;/a&gt;. The provinces, &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20Province"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt;, and Narathiwat which were formerly the Malay Sultinate of Pattani are the only Muslim-majority part of the traditionally &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhist"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; country.

There have been some suggestions that residents of the southern provinces are not accorded the same opportunities as those in other parts of the country. Thailand's economic improvements from increases in tourism during recent years have not yielded any benefits to the troubled provinces. Public statements by the Thai Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shiniwatra"&gt;Thaksin Shiniwatra&lt;/a&gt;, have given the impression that areas which have not given support to his &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; political party will not be prioritised by his government; this impacts the south which returned opposition Democrats during elections earlier this year.

The almost daily violence in the provinces bordering Malaysia is expected to be among the subjects discussed at talks between former Malaysian Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AMahathir%20bin%20Mohamad"&gt;Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad&lt;/a&gt; and Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shiniwatra. The former PM is expected to meet Mr Shiniwatra at his official residence in Ban Phitsanulok early next week.

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC 2005 wrapped up this weekend with trade impasse unresolved. Member countries fell short of blaming EU for causing the impasse. The EU has been largely criticized for not opening up its own agriculture market. South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon said "The leaders here ... are basically saying that now the ball is in Europe's court". 

Member countries talked of high oil prices hurting their economies and agreed on energy efficiency, conservation and diversification. Supply and demand issues were not clarified.

The city of &lt;a href="w%3ANuremberg"&gt;Nuremberg&lt;/a&gt; has marked the 60th anniversary of the opening of the &lt;a href="w%3ANuremberg%20trials"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; against Nazi war criminals.

At a ceremony in the Palace of Justice, where the tribunal was located, participants of the trials gathered and remembered. Whitney R. Harris, a member of the U.S. prosecution team, emphazised the importance of Nuremberg for contemporary international law claiming that "the principles of the Nuremberg case have been followed in recent years and the fact that we conducted Nuremberg has given impetus to the establishment of these more recent tribunals". But the president of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court (ICC)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APhilippe%20Kirsch"&gt;Philippe Kirsch&lt;/a&gt;, is frustrated that there is still opposition against modern international tribunals like his court: "The spectre of politically motivated prosecution which is a running theme against the ICC is so unfounded that it is to me intellectually difficult to understand".

On November 20, 1945 the trials began in the courtroom 600 of the Palace of Justice. A total of 24 defendants were tried, among them &lt;a href="w%3AHermann%20G%C3%B6ring"&gt;Hermann Göring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARudolf%20He%C3%9F"&gt;Rudolf Heß&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href="w%3AGeoffrey%20Lawrence%2C%201st%20Baron%20Oaksey"&gt;Geoffrey Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; being chair of the court, the trial took 218 days and ended with 12 death sentences, 7 jail terms and 3 acquittals. One defendant killed himself during the trial, another one was declared unfit to stand trial. 

Some controversy does exist as to whether the &lt;a href="w%3ANuremberg%20Principles"&gt;Nuremberg Principles&lt;/a&gt; have been adhered to in the years following the trials. Noted intellectual author, &lt;a href="w%3ANoam%20Chomsky"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;, has claimed that all &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; presidents since the end of the war would be judged to be war criminals according to these principles.

♡❤Update November 21, 2005: All of the 14 miners missing were confirmed dead on Monday, the official Xinhua News Agency said.♡❤ 

Seven miners have been killed and seven more are missing after a coal mine flooded in north &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AHebei"&gt;Hebei&lt;/a&gt; province. The Xinhua news agency reports the latest coal mine disaster occurred around 5:00 a.m. on Saturday in &lt;a href="w%3AXingtai"&gt;Xingtai&lt;/a&gt; City. 

A reason for the accident has not yet been given. Owners of the coal mine have been detained by local police and the investigation into the cause of the flooding is underway. State media reports say the disaster occurred at a pit in Xingtai City, but gave few other details. 

China's mines, many of them illegal, are considered the world's most dangerous. More than 6,000 miners died in accidents in China last year, according to previously released government figures. Other independent estimates put the real figure at around 20,000. 

Saturday's accident follows a gas explosion at a coal mine in south-western China's &lt;a href="w%3AGuizhou"&gt;Guizhou&lt;/a&gt; province on Friday killing at least ten people.

Xinhua reports that rescue work is underway, according to the local work safety supervision bureau.
A spokesman said Yuanda Coal Mine, a collectively-owned mine in &lt;a href="w%3ANeiqiu"&gt;Neiqiu&lt;/a&gt; county of Xingtai, was flooded and all the 14 miners working down the pit were trapped.

This is the second fatal mine accident in the area in two weeks. Cave-ins at three plaster mines on November 6 caused 33 deaths and left at least four missing.

<h2>Government orders closure of 12,000 mines</h2>

A committee for safe production, under the State Council, on Sunday urged relevant local governments to streamline the operation of mines and close unqualified ones. 

More than 12,000 Chinese mines have been ordered to suspend production, and they will be closed if they fail to pass government assessments at the end of this year, the committee said.
A gas explosion on November 11 at a mine in Wuhai, a city in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, killed 16 miners and wounded three others. The mine lacked a required safety license.

The committee said in a statement that other mines should draw serious lessons from the deadly accident and "steadfastly prevent illegal production and curb the occurrence of big mining accidents." (Source: Xinhua)

A convention of the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20%28Israel%29"&gt;Israeli Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; in Tel Aviv decided on Sunday to pull its ministers out of the coalition government with the &lt;a href="w%3ALikud%20Party"&gt;Likud Party&lt;/a&gt; of prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;.

The decision results from an initative by party chair &lt;a href="w%3AAmir%20Peretz"&gt;Amir Peretz&lt;/a&gt;, who was just elected to that office at the beginning of this month, succeeding &lt;a href="w%3AShimon%20Peres"&gt;Shimon Peres&lt;/a&gt;.

In his speech to the convention, Peretz accused Sharon's government of "humiliating" immigrants and poor people and said it had deepend poverty in the country. He called on Likud voters to switch to Labor because, "Likud has abandoned you".

Officials from both parties agreed that March 28, 2006 would be the date of early elections to the 17th &lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt;.

Earlier today, Sharon thanked Peres for the work in the government and proclaimed, "Shimon, this is the beginning of our joint work". This statement is seen as reaffirming rumors that Sharon may quit Likud and form a new party, due to several disagreements with the Likud in the past.

One of the most important arguments in the run-up to the Iraq war made by Colin Powell in his United Nations speech and President Bush in his State of the Union address was that Iraq had an active biological weapons program and possessed mobile biological weapons labs. According to an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the main source for this information was an Iraqi defector codenamed &lt;a href="w%3ACurveball%20%28informant%29"&gt;Curveball&lt;/a&gt; who was a source for the German central intelligence agency &lt;a href="w%3ABundesnachrichtendienst"&gt;BND&lt;/a&gt;.

Several German intelligence officials responsible for Curveball have now told the LA Times that the Bush administration and the CIA have repeatedly exaggerated his claims and ignored warnings of the BND that the source was unreliable. Recounting his reaction after seeing Powell's United Nations speech one German intelligence officer said: "We were shocked. Mein Gott! We had always told them it was not proven... It was not hard intelligence." This corroborates reporting by the German weekly newspaper &lt;a href="w%3ADie%20Zeit"&gt;Die Zeit&lt;/a&gt; from 2003 and 2004 based on statements of unnamed senior German intelligence officials.

Nine months earlier, in May 2002, a fabricator warning was posted in Curveball's file in U.S. intelligence databases. Powell was never warned that his United Nations speech contained material that both the DIA and CIA had determined was false, even though several people present at Powell's CIA meetings were fully aware of this.

At this time German intelligence officers would not let the CIA meet directly with Curveball, but allowed a CIA doctor to draw blood samples. Questioning the validity of Curveball's information in front of his CIA supervisor, the doctor was advised to "Keep in mind that this war is going to happen regardless of what Curveball said or didn't say and the Powers That Be probably aren't terribly interested in whether Curveball knows what he's talking about."

Shortly after Powell's UN speech and several days before the invasion, United Nations weapons inspectors attempted to directly verify several key claims made by Curveball, but concluded that they were unsustainable. The White House insisted on its WMD claims based on Curveball's information.

Even after the invasion, when more and more of Curveball's accounts were shown to be pure fabrication, the CIA and the Bush administration relied on Curveball's information. When U.S. forces discovered trucks with lab equipment and Curveball claimed that these were identical to the ones he has been reporting about, the CIA rushed to publish a White Paper claiming that these trucks were part of Saddam Hussein's secret biological weapons program and Bush claimed publicly that "We found the weapons of mass destruction." Several days later, twelve of the thirteen WMD experts who analyzed the trucks agreed that the equipment was not suited for biological weapons production, with the only dissenting voice coming from the author of the original White Paper. 

The White Paper remains posted on the CIA website to this date, and President Bush has not yet retracted his statement that Iraq produced "germ warfare agents" made in his State of the Union address or his postwar assertions that "we found the weapons of mass destruction."

&lt;a href="w%3ASachindra%20Chaudhry"&gt;Sachindra Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest son of &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Fiji Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; leader and former &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Fiji"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMahendra%20Chaudhry"&gt;Mahendra Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt;, married &lt;a href="w%3AMarian%20Ma%27afu"&gt;Marian Ma'afu&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of &lt;a href="w%3AFiji"&gt;Fiji's&lt;/a&gt; first ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATui%20Lau"&gt;Tui Lau&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="w%3AEnele%20Ma%27afu"&gt;Enele Ma'afu&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href="w%3AHinduism"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; ceremony at &lt;a href="w%3AWailailai%20Temple"&gt;Wailailai Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABa%20Town"&gt;Ba&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. A &lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; wedding will follow at Sacred Heart Cathedral in &lt;a href="w%3ASuva"&gt;Suva&lt;/a&gt; next week.

Intermarriage between Fiji's &lt;a href="w%3AFijian%20people"&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndo-Fijian"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; communities is uncommon. Speaking for the family, Chaudhry's elder brother, &lt;a href="w%3ARajendra%20Chaudhry"&gt;Rajendra&lt;/a&gt;, said that the union was for love and that nothing political should be read into it. The union was a personal love-match between two who had known each other for more than six years, he insisted, and dismissed media speculation that the wedding was intended as a statement about uniting the two races, whose historical, cultural, religious, and political divisions have defined Fiji for generations. It was a proud day for the family.

Ma'afu's ancestor, Enele Ma'afu, was a &lt;a href="w%3ATonga"&gt;Tongan&lt;/a&gt; prince who was exiled to Fiji following disagreements within the Tongan royal family. He conquered &lt;a href="w%3ATaveuni"&gt;Taveuni&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ALau%20Islands"&gt;Lau Islands&lt;/a&gt;, taking the title of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALau"&gt;Tui Lau&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (King of Lau). He later participated, with the Fijian King &lt;a href="w%3ASeru%20Epenisa%20Cakobau"&gt;Cakobau&lt;/a&gt;, in the ceding of the islands to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in 1874. The Tui Lau title has since been held by such noted individuals as &lt;a href="w%3ALala%20Sukuna"&gt;Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna&lt;/a&gt; (considered modern Fiji's first statesman) and &lt;a href="w%3AKamisese%20Mara"&gt;Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara&lt;/a&gt;, independent Fiji's first Prime Minister and second &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Fiji"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;.

Chaudhry, who traces his ancestry to the state of &lt;a href="w%3AHaryana"&gt;Haryana&lt;/a&gt;, in north &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, became the first of his race &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20election%20of%201999"&gt;to be elected&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister in 1999. He was deposed a year later, in the &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20coup%20of%202000"&gt;Fiji coup of 2000&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Darwin and Sumatra rocked by offshore earthquakes</h1>

An offshore &lt;a href="w%3AEarthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; shook buildings in &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%2C%20Australia"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; in Australia's &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Territory"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt; today, and an earthquake with a magnitude of at least 6.2 struck off the coast of Sumatra yesterday, triggering a tsunami alert.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeoscience%20Australia"&gt;Geoscience Australia&lt;/a&gt; says the offshore quake registered 5.3 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20scale"&gt;Richter scale&lt;/a&gt;. No damage has been reported in the city of Darwin or the community of Port Keats which is the nearest town to the quake's epicentre in a region known for its moderate seismicity. The quake's epicentre was located 500 kilometres west-north-west of Darwin in the &lt;a href="w%3ABanda%20Sea"&gt;Banda Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The earthquake hit at 9.51am (CDT).

Geoscience Australia (the government's geological organisation) says the region may be unstable for a few days and aftershocks or another quake may be felt. Duty &lt;a href="w%3Aseismologist"&gt;seismologist&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Svetan Sinadinovski, says it was a shallow quake and the subterranean make-up of the area allowed the tremor waves to travel to Darwin without losing much energy. He says the quake was on Australia's continental shelf, which is a common place for seismic activity.

"That is the area where &lt;a href="w%3AIndo-Australian%20Plate"&gt;Australian plate collides with Asian plate&lt;/a&gt; and that extends through the Indonesian islands up to &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; in the north and east through &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Guinea"&gt;PNG&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ATonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;," he said. "Preliminary reports point to a 5 to 6 in the Darwin region - this means that the earthquake would have been felt by almost everyone indoors according to the &lt;a href="w%3AMercalli%20Intensity%20Scale"&gt;Modified Mercali Scale&lt;/a&gt; which measures the impact of &lt;a href="w%3ASeismic%20wave"&gt;seismic waves&lt;/a&gt; on structures."

"People would have felt this earthquake up to 500km away from the &lt;a href="w%3AEpicenter"&gt;epicentre&lt;/a&gt;, and we have heard numerous reports of residents in the Darwin area having felt the effects of the event," he said.

Among those who felt the quake were participants involved in the trial of &lt;a href="w%3ABradley%20John%20Murdoch"&gt;Bradley John Murdoch&lt;/a&gt; in the Northern Territory Supreme Court in Darwin - where chairs and TVs shook in the court building. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Meteorology"&gt;The Bureau of Meteorology&lt;/a&gt;'s Darwin office was also shaken, but no reports of damage have been received by police.

"We felt it - I felt the building sway and some of the monitors shook a little," the bureau's duty forecaster, Billy Lynch, said. "We are on the third floor of a three-story building."

<h2>Sumatra Earthquake</h2>

An earthquake with a magnitude of at least 6.2 struck off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, triggering a tsunami alert, officials said. There were no immediate reports of a tsunami, damages or casualties. The quake's epicenter was located off &lt;a href="w%3ASimeulue"&gt;Simeulue&lt;/a&gt;, 160 miles southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AMedan"&gt;Medan&lt;/a&gt; on Sumatra's northwest coast, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;(USGS).

Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency put the quake's magnitude at 6.2, whilst the USGS said the magnitude was 6.5. The quake rocked nearby &lt;a href="w%3ANias"&gt;Nias&lt;/a&gt; island and was felt in Medan, said an official from the Indonesian agency's Jakarta office.

Simeulue island is near the epicenter of the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;December 26 quake&lt;/a&gt; that caused a massive tsunami. The &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; said there was no threat of a tsunami to Pacific coastlines, but quakes of this size can sometimes generate local tsunamis along coasts near the epicenter. 

Sumatra has been affected by strong aftershocks since the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;2004 Indian Ocean earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. Experts say the fault line is unstable and may produce another massive quake soon. 

<h3>Other earthquakes</h3>

The biggest earthquake to strike the region, in 1998, had a magnitude of 6.9. The largest earthquake ever recorded was in Chile in 1960. This magnitude 9.5 earthquake resulted in the death of 5,000 people. In 1976 a smaller 8.0 earthquake in China caused the death of an estimated 255,000 people. More recently, in December 2003 an earthquake in Iran resulted in the death of approximately 50,000 people. 

Geoscience Australia said the 5.3 quake did not generate a &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;2004 Indian Ocean earthquake&lt;/a&gt;, which had a magnitude of 9.0, triggered a series of lethal tsunamis on December 26, 2004 that killed over 270,000 people, making it the deadliest tsunami in recorded history. 

In March 2005 another strong earthquake rocked parts of Darwin, with tremors lasting several minutes felt across the city and rural areas. The quake measured 7.2 on the Richter scale, and its epicentre was 500 kilometres east north-east of East Timor in the Banda Sea.

The recently elected president of &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMahinda%20Rajapakse"&gt;Mahinda Rajapakse&lt;/a&gt;, has upset some with the appointment of a fellow hardliner, Ratnasiri Wickremanayake, as the country's Prime Minister. The Sinhala nationalist, Mr. Wicremanayake, is a former holder of the post during Chandrika Kumaratunga's presidency in 2000 and 2001.

Most noticeably hit by the news were the country's stock markets. Markets in &lt;a href="w%3AColombo"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt; fell 7% on the news, having fallen by the same amount last Friday when Mr. Rajapaskse's election result was announced.

Mr. Rajapakse was elected as the President on an anti Tamil Tiger platform. He formed an alliance with two Sinhala Buddhist extremist parties, JVP and JMU. Civil war in the country between the majority and the Tamil population is claimed to have led to over 65,000 deaths since 1983.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Labour%20Organisation"&gt;International Labour Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (ILO) has warned the generals that make up the military government of &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, more commonly known as Burma, that they may face sanctions should they not improve their record over forced labour.

The call to change policy and attitudes towards forced labour that the ILO issued following a meeting of their governing body in &lt;a href="Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; late last week was countered by promises from the regime that they would not withdraw from the organisation.

The warning issued by the ILO has been followed by calls from the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ASecurity%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20General"&gt;Secretary General&lt;/a&gt; of the UN to get involved in efforts to reform the country. The EU Parliament passed its resolution on Burma by a significant majority, only three members opposed and two abstained.

U.S. forces accidentally fired upon on a civilian vehicle north of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, killing at least one child and 2 other people, a military spokesperson has said. 

The incident occurred when an American soldier spotted the vehicle moving in an erratic fashion outside a base in &lt;a href="w%3ABaqouba"&gt;Baqouba&lt;/a&gt;. American soliders fired warning shots before shooting at the vehicle, according to U.S. military spokesman Maj. Steven Warren.

Dr. Ahmed Fouad, a doctor at the city morgue, later claimed that the death toll was higher, and three children were killed. Military sources claim that the extra casualties may in fact have come from a car bomb targeting American soldiers in the same area at the same time, which killed five civilians and wounded twelve others.

The international entry &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amail%20art"&gt;mail art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; show ♡❤SAT: An Exhibit of Chairs♡❤ was put on display Friday in &lt;a href="Brampton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Brampton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Held in the Fridge Front Gallery at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShoppers%20World%20Brampton"&gt;Shoppers World Brampton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mall, ♡❤SAT♡❤ is a diverse collection of artworks focusing on a generally mundane object, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChairs"&gt;chair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Works in the show range from realism to abstract, dadaism to surrealism, post-modern to collage.

While some of the entries were submitted directly to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVisual%20Arts%20Brampton"&gt;Visual Arts Brampton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , most came from a previous exhibit. Organized by Pati Bristow, ♡❤No place to rest, chairs you can't sit on♡❤ ran at Shopping Trolley Gallery West and Seaman's Library at Foothill College, both in Los Altos Hills, California, earlier in 2005. Guest curator Nicholas Moreau was unaware of the similarly themed exhibit, held so soon before. The theme for ♡❤SAT♡❤ was based on that of a 1987 juried art show organized by Visual Arts Brampton at the now-defunct Chinguacousy Library Gallery.

Works in Visual Arts Brampton's showing of the exhibition are from 17 countries including Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Romania, Spain, Uruguay, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

This is Visual Arts Brampton's third mail art show. In 1999, Susan Williamson created The Great Canadian Mail Art Show for Artway at Bramalea City Centre; the show was so successful that the Art Gallery of Peel adopted it in 2001. The concept of a mail art show was revived in 2004 by Moreau, held at the new Artway Shoppers World. The Snail Mail World Postcard Art Show has been held annually since.

Visual Arts Brampton's Fridge Front Gallery primarily hosts artwork by youth from its kids classes, and from schools in Brampton and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOakville%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Oakville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In contrast, the nearby Artway Gallery hosts artwork by professional and amateur adult artists from across &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARegion%20of%20Peel"&gt;Peel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . VAB has successfully sought permission to create a third display space in Shoppers World, in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZellers"&gt;Zellers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; corridor. The space will host shows of mail art and works on paper year-round. The planned "World Art Gallery" will be the first ever permanent display space for mail art.

<h1>Under-reporting of human Bird Flu infections poses worldwide threat</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Under-reporting%20of%20human%20Bird%20Flu%20infections%20poses%20worldwide%20threat&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Possible under reporting of bird flu infections in China and other Southeast Asian countries may be promoting an illusory sense that human infections are very limited. Common press reports only describe fewer than 130 people as infected with H5N1 avian flu and that fewer than 70 have died worldwide. Yet, there are enormous problems getting accurate data, especially in a country like China with a population of more than a billion.

"Reporting a suspected bird flu infection in bird or humans is a very unlikely event," said Dr. Shoshana Zimmerman of the eHealth Institute. She is also a founder of www.birdflubeacon.com, a site dedicated to bird flu issues. "There are very few incentives to report, and lots of reasons to refrain from reporting. From the viewpoint of local rural small farmers, there is little to be gained and much to be lost by reporting an infection. The worse threat is that their flocks could be killed, leaving them destitute." 

There are many factors which mitigate against reporting bird or human infections of bird flu.

<ul>
BULLET::::- The deaths of chickens, ducks, and birds are common events for farmer. Even when a large number die at one time they may see no purpose in reporting the deaths.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- When a human dies in locations with little or no medical services, the rural farmer’s priority for discerning the cause of death may be low.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- In rural areas most people are not taken to hospitals when they are sick.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Bird flu symptoms are not widely known. If the symptoms are not known, they will not be recognized and reports of possible bird or human infections can not be made.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The expenses required for detection are those of proper collection and shipment of samples to one of approximately 200 laboratories worldwide, as well as the testing procedure that requires a two week period of waiting before results are obtained.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The lack of incentive for countries to report large scale outbreaks as it may lead to widespread panic and economic loss, as occurred with SARS. These factors can be seen at work in the way that the first bird flu death was reported in China," Dr. Zimmerman stated.

</ul>
A young woman, Zhou Maoya, died after returning home to the village of Yantan in Annui province to prepare for her wedding. Her family has stated that they did not take her to the hospital because they thought it would not do any good. Officials also note rural Chinese also often cite relatively expensive medical costs as a reason for not seeking treatment when sick. 

Although initially authorities attributed her death to pneumonia the resulting political pressure prompted China to invite the World Health Organization to send experts to investigate. The authorities then rescinded the previous position and attributed her death to bird flu based on the similarity of the symptoms that she was reported to exhibit with those of bird flu. The village was quarantined and journalists were denied access. It is not known how many others might be infected in the village. Official announcements were made of plans to vaccinate and cull birds. 

A local government official, Fan Qian, told ♡❤AFP♡❤ that it was believed Zhou was infected while she was outside of the province.

Fan Tan, a local official, told ♡❤AFP♡❤ news that 1,000 birds in Yantan had been culled (killed). Plans were announced to vaccinate 2 million poultry in the area, a huge and difficult task.

Zhang, another official, said authorities had met with all villagers to give them flu vaccinations and to tell them how to protect themselves against the bird flu virus, including not consuming poultry products. It is known that flu vaccinations do not protect against bird flu.
Villagers and local officials minimized the threat. In outlying areas of Yantan, residents said that they did not know of any new outbreaks. Other possible infections have been attributed to similar common causes but there have not been any tests performed validating those attributions.
Fan Litan, a peasant woman from Fantu village, about 2 miles from Yantan, lost many of her ducks, and chickens and also a dog; she has attributed these deaths to the acts of hooligans. She said her family had been extremely frightened when her animals suddenly died. "We were scared to death," said Fan, standing next to a red sign posted on the outside wall of her home that said: "Prevention and control by the masses is basic for people." Fan said ducks and chickens are all healthy but she admitted that she had stopped eating poultry. No testing of these birds has been reported yet.

According to a recent ♡❤AFP♡❤ report from Liuchang, 59 miles south of Yantan, the obstacles to identifying infections are enormous.
Like many, one Liuchang villager named Wang Hemin said he was concerned and would keep a closer eye on his ducks and chickens, but felt no immediacy since the infection was not in his province. He learned about bird flu on TV, and is aware that officials have come to his village of 2,700 people to warn residents about the virus. They offered guidelines: they told people that poultry which die suddenly could have contracted bird flu and should not be eaten or sold and that such an incident should also immediately be reported. However, the symptoms of H5N1 bird flu were not directly described.
Residents have not yet been fully informed of what symptoms to look for in ill poultry--they are fever, diarrhea, teary eyes and swelling in the legs of the birds. Though a pledge was made earlier in the week to vaccinate 2 million birds immediately, no bird vaccinations in this area have been reported yet.

In another nearby village, Nazahuang, chickens scuttle in and out of houses. One resident, Fan Jiexu, 73, said no officials had yet warned her village to take precautions. Throughout rural areas, it is customary for chickens to scuttle in and out of homes. Ducks and bird often die and are eaten by villagers when it is believed safe to do so.

China has reported 17 avian flu outbreaks as of this week. Despite the Chinese government issued high alerts, critical information is not being adequately communicated to some rural villages. The size of the poultry population, the common and normal occurrence of poultry death on farms, and status of roughly 70% of the poultry population as being kept in backyards are factors complicating infection control.

The head of World Health Organization's China office, Henk Bekedam, is aware that slow reaction to bird flu threats and difficulty monitoring poultry in the world's most populous country makes control of its spread challenging. 

Testing is required to confirm H5N1 virus, and positive test results lead to the killing of nearby flocks. The incentive for many villagers, officials, and governments to minimize reports of H5N1 virus infections and severe medical and economic complications for making confirmations of infection are obstacles opposing complete and full reporting of the spread and infection rates of the virus.

The &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anon-profit%20organization"&gt;non-profit organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , as well as the Attorney General of &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, has filed a law suit against &lt;a href="Sony"&gt;Sony Computer Entertainment of America&lt;/a&gt; for their controversial use of anti-piracy software.

The EFF claims that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20rights%20management"&gt;digital rights management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; software on the CDs BMG Music (a subsidiary of Sony) produces acts as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aspyware"&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which the EFF claims is against Texas law. The program, known as ♡❤XCP♡❤, is said to install software on one's system when they insert the CD into their computer for purposes such as adding to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; music software.

Sony currently rejects the idea of XCP technology being considered as spyware, however they have agreed to replace CDs with the software and to temporarily discontinue the installation of it on their CDs.

Among the controversy that Sony's moves to counter piracy have raised is the accusation that their software leaves a machine more vulnerable to attacks across the Internet. A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;trojan horse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has already been found in the wild that utilizes one of the anti-piracy software's functions.

He is listed in stable condition.

Late in the first period in a game against the &lt;a href="w%3ANashville%20Predators"&gt;Nashville Predators&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Louis%20Arena"&gt;Joe Louis Arena&lt;/a&gt;, Fischer collapsed on the bench. According to Red Wing &lt;a href="w%3Ahead%20coach"&gt;coach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Babcock"&gt;Mike Babcock&lt;/a&gt;, Fischer suffered a &lt;a href="w%3ASeizure"&gt;seizure&lt;/a&gt;, and went into &lt;a href="w%3ACardiac%20arrest"&gt;cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;. He was revived by team medical staff, who used a &lt;a href="w%3Adefibrillator"&gt;defibrillator&lt;/a&gt; to restart Fischer's heart. He was taken by ambulance to Detroit Receiving Hospital. &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20Sports%20Net"&gt;Fox Sports Detroit&lt;/a&gt; reported that he was awake and talking to hospital staff.

As of Monday night, Fischer's condition was listed as stable.

In &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%202002"&gt;September 2002&lt;/a&gt;, Fischer had an abnormal &lt;a href="w%3AElectrocardiogram"&gt;electrocardiogram&lt;/a&gt; reading, forcing him to miss two days of training camp. A subsequent follow-up test was passed. 

The game, which was officially stopped with 7:30 left in the first period, was cancelled. The game will be made up on &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary%2023"&gt;January 23&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;.

The members of Congress involved in the corruption charges have not yet been named by the prosecutors, but Representative &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Ney"&gt;Bob Ney&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; has acknowledged that he is "Representative No. 1" named in the court papers. The prosecution alleges that Representative No. 1 accepted gifts, including a golf trip to a luxury resort in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, and regular meals in an upscale &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;D.C.&lt;/a&gt; restaurant "in exchange for a series of official acts and influence."

Ney is said to be cooperating with the investigation. According to Ney's spokesperson, Brian Walsh, Congressman Ney was a merely victim of Scanlon's illegal activities.

Australia's &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20immigration%20detention%20facilities"&gt;Immigration Detention Centre&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas%20Island"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt; has been reopened to detain a group of seven Indonesian asylum seekers. The &lt;a href="w%3ADIMIA"&gt;Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA)&lt;/a&gt; said four men, one woman and two infants from &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Timor"&gt;West Timor&lt;/a&gt; were taken from &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; to the remote detention facility, 2,600km north-west of &lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; on November 17. 

The group arrived on a small boat at Honeymoon Beach, near Kalumburu a remote Aboriginal community on the northern coast of &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia's&lt;/a&gt; far north, on November 5. Locals were startled when three of the men waded ashore to ask for directions to the nearest city. After returning to sea with directions to &lt;a href="w%3AWyndham"&gt;Wyndam&lt;/a&gt;, 400km south-east of Kalumburu, the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Australian%20Navy"&gt;Australian Navy&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AHMAS%20Geraldton"&gt;HMAS Geraldton&lt;/a&gt; caught up with the group and tethered their boat alongside. The group were taken into detention in Darwin. 

The Australian government enforces a policy of &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;mandatory detention&lt;/a&gt; of unauthorised arrivals. Christmas Island is an &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20states%20and%20territories"&gt;Australian Territory&lt;/a&gt;, its closest neighbour is &lt;a href="w%3AJava"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;, 360km away.

DIMIA, which had originally planned to deport the group, say the West Timorese will remain on Christmas Island while their claims for refugee protection are assessed. "The group was going to be removed having initially not raised claims or information engaging Australia's protection obligations, but since that initial screening the group raised new issues and so their claims will be further examined now," a DIMIA spokesman said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Bartlett"&gt;Andrew Bartlett&lt;/a&gt; said he was concerned the children were in detention despite a government promise that such an arrangement would be a last resort. "We want to know exactly what the cost has been to unnecessarily fly these people over to Christmas Island and why, seeing that they managed to arrive within the accepted migration zone and should be processed here," he said.

DIMIA said the cost of housing the group in the reactivated Christmas Island facility was not yet known, and that such transfers were standard practice. DIMIA said the children would be in the facility on a short-term basis.

"Once initial processing is complete - a week or two weeks probably - it is planned that the family of four who are within that group of seven ... will live in the Christmas Island community under residents determination arrangements, while the three single men will be accommodated in the centre there," the DIMIA spokesman said.

"Following consultations with their lawyer, they will be interviewed by an experienced protection visa case manager assisted by a qualified interpreter to establish whether they are in need of protection."

In a May 2004 report, the National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) found that children in Australian immigration detention centres have suffered numerous and repeated breaches of their human rights. The report stated that the long-term impact of Australia's immigration detention system meant that these children "will carry the scars of their detention experience throughout their lives." 

The report said, "Despite ten years of a mandatory detention regime, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs' own administrative measures and instructions virtually ignored the special needs of children. There was also little regard paid to obligations arising from the &lt;a href="w%3AConvention%20on%20the%20Rights%20of%20the%20Child"&gt;Convention on the Rights of the Child&lt;/a&gt;."

<h3>First "boat people" in 2 years</h3>
The West Timorese group are the first asylum seekers apprehended in Australian waters since a group of Vietnamese people arrived off &lt;a href="w%3ABroome"&gt;Broome&lt;/a&gt;, on Western Australia's west coast more than two years ago.

The Christmas Island detention centre also was re-opened for the Vietnamese asylum seekers - who are now living in the Australian community under refugee protection status. The 54 Vietnamese people were detained for over two years were fleeing political persecution. The federal government granted &lt;a href="http%3A//www.refugeecouncil.org.au/html/position_papers/TPV_eligibility.html%7Ctemporary"&gt;protection visas (TPVs)&lt;/a&gt; to the Vietnamese detainees in July this year.

In July, West Australian refugee advocate Kaye Bernard, slammed the two-year remote detention as an expensive, unfortunate mess. "It is clear now that this whole sorry mess of two years of unnecessary detention for the Vietnamese kids and their families, costing in excess of $50 million, leaves a bad taste in the mouths of many Australians," she said. "This decision shows that the processing of these people by DIMIA was 100 per cent wrong and requires examination under the scrutiny of a &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20commission"&gt;royal commission&lt;/a&gt;."

<h3>New detention facility</h3>

The Christmas Island detention centre is part of the Australian government's &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Solution"&gt;Pacific Solution&lt;/a&gt;. The federal government is spending over AU$200 million to build a new 800 bed detention centre on the remote island. 

&lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Nettle"&gt;Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle&lt;/a&gt; called on &lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt; the Immigration Minister in April 2005, to explain the government's plans for Christmas Island detention centre following reports that all Australia's immigration detainees will be held on the island. There are plans to shift all detainees to the island, according to the Shire President of Christmas Island, who says that all future unauthorised boat arrivals will be detained there.

"The government should be closing detention centres, not building new ones," Senator Nettle said. "Christmas Island's new detention centre serves no purpose beyond furthering the Coalition's political ends at a cost of over $300 million dollars to the public. If there are no plans to change the role of Christmas Island's detention centre why is the government spending $300 million on an upgrade? "

The Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Jan Party combine under the leadership of &lt;a href="w%3ANitish%20Kumar"&gt;Nitish Kumar&lt;/a&gt; has won 143 of 243 seats in Assembly elections for the state of &lt;a href="w%3ABihar"&gt;Bihar&lt;/a&gt; held this November. The JD(U) legislative party elected Nitish to be Bihar's new Chief Minister. This was the second election in the last eight months; the first was held in February and the resulting house was suspended by the Bihar Governor Buta Singh. The former Chief Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARabri%20Devi"&gt;Rabri Devi&lt;/a&gt; is the wife of &lt;a href="w%3ALalu%20Prasad%20Yadav"&gt;Lalu Prasad Yadav&lt;/a&gt;, who had control of the state for 15 years, either directly or through his wife. Nitish Kumar will be sworn in as the 31st chief minister of Bihar on Thursday November 24, 2005.

After meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his office in Parliament, Nitish left for Patna in order to stake claim to form a government. Nitish will appoint 14 ministers in his National Democratic Alliance government, including deputy chief minister. BJP leaders Sushil Kumar Modi and Shahnawaz Hussain are front runners for the post as deputy chief minister, followed by Ashwani Choubey and Nand Kishore Yadav. Voting turnout in the election was 47 percent of the total electorate numbering 5,13,47,092, which is comprised of 2,75,46,646 male voters and 2,38,00,446 female voters. There were 102 BJP candidates and 139 JD(U) candidates.

&lt;a href="Angela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; has been elected the first female &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor_of_Germany"&gt;chancellor&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Republic%20of%20Germany"&gt;Federal Republic of Germany&lt;/a&gt;; she succeeds &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt; after his seven years as head of government.

Merkel received 397 of the 612 votes cast in the &lt;a href="w%3ABundestag"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;. Schröder was the first to congratulate her before she accepted the election. The &lt;a href="German_Social_and_Christian_Democrats_agree_on_new_government"&gt;newly formed grand coalition&lt;/a&gt; of Social (&lt;a href="w%3ASocial_Democratic_Party_of_Germany"&gt;SPD&lt;/a&gt;) and Christian Democrats (&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20%28Germany%29"&gt;CDU&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AChristian_Social_Union_in_Bavaria"&gt;CSU&lt;/a&gt;) holds a total of 448 seats in the Bundestag.

Later in the day, Merkel took the oath of office and president Horst Köhler officially appointed her along with her &lt;a href="%23The%20new%20cabinet"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt;.

Angela Merkel was born 1954 in Hamburg. After her birth her father was offered a pastorship in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Germany"&gt;East Germany&lt;/a&gt; (GDR) and the family moved there. She studied physics in Leipzig where she earned her PhD. After the fall of the &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%20Wall"&gt;Berlin Wall&lt;/a&gt;, Merkel became involved in the East German democracy movement, joining the &lt;a href="w%3ADemokratischer%20Aufbruch"&gt;Demokratischer Aufbruch&lt;/a&gt;. She was spokeswoman of the first and last freely elected prime minister of the GDR, &lt;a href="w%3ALothar%20de%20Maizi%C3%A8re"&gt;Lothar de Maizière&lt;/a&gt;. After the reunification Merkel served as minister of youth and family in the government of &lt;a href="w%3AHelmut%20Kohl"&gt;Helmut Kohl&lt;/a&gt; during the years 1990 &amp;ndash; 1994 and later as minister of the environment from 1994 &amp;ndash; 1998. In 2000 she became head of the Christian Democrats and in the following Federal election of 2002 she stood aside, letting &lt;a href="w%3AEdmund%20Stoiber"&gt;Edmund Stoiber&lt;/a&gt; of the Bavarian CSU be the failed Christian Democrats candidate for the chancellorship. When Gerhard Schröder called for an early election in May of this year, Merkel received the nomination of her party.

Outgoing Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, was born during 1944 in &lt;a href="w%3ABlomberg"&gt;Blomberg&lt;/a&gt;. His father died in &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, only a few months after Schröder's birth. He initially worked as a sales clerk and earned his high school diploma studying at night. He studied law in Göttingen and worked at the University there, joining the Social Democrats and became chair of the &lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Socialists"&gt;Young Socialists&lt;/a&gt;, the youth organisation of the party. In 1980 he was elected to the Bundestag and later became governor of &lt;a href="w%3ALower-Saxony"&gt;Lower-Saxony&lt;/a&gt;. In 1998 he was the SPD's successful candidate for chancellor, forming a coalition government with &lt;a href="w%3AGerman_Green_Party"&gt;The Greens&lt;/a&gt;. After the resignation of &lt;a href="w%3AOskar%20Lafontaine"&gt;Oskar Lafontaine&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, Schröder also became chair of the SPD, a post he held until 2004. His coalition was re-elected in 2002.

After a humiliating defeat of SPD in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Rhine-Westphalia"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;, Schröder called for an early election. During a tough campaign, Schröder managed to get the SPD nearly as many votes as the CDU, clawing back a significant advantage the party had over his entering the campaign.

Schröder announced that he will give up his seat in the Bundestag and practise as a lawyer again.

Shiite, Kurdish and Sunni leaders issued a communique which calls for a pullout timetable for the U.S.-led coalition forces and also calls the insurgency "legitimate". Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, Shiite and Kurdish lawmakers and leading Sunni politicians were all present to present the declaration.

"An immediate end to arbitrary raids and arrests without a documented judicial order." is also demanded by the statement. The conference of leaders was part of an American-backed Arab league effort. The document included "calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops according to a timetable, through putting in place an immediate national program to rebuild the armed forces ... control the borders and the security situation."

Two of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK's&lt;/a&gt; leading children's charities have announced that they are to merge.

&lt;a href="w%3AChildLine"&gt;ChildLine&lt;/a&gt;, formed in 1986 by the television presenter &lt;a href="w%3AEsther%20Rantzen"&gt;Esther Rantzen&lt;/a&gt;, is to become part of the &lt;a href="w%3ANSPCC"&gt;NSPCC&lt;/a&gt;. The two charities have a combined annual income of over £125 million (213 million USD, 182 million Euro).

&lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Kelly"&gt;Sir Christopher Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman of NSPCC, said: "The NSPCC and ChildLine share the same vision for children and young people - we have always enjoyed a close working relationship. We are joining together now in the best interests of children. There is now an enormous opportunity to develop a more extensive service to help even more children. The two organisations are a natural fit. Esther and I are delighted to be in the position to reassure children and young people that ChildLine will be there for them today and tomorrow as it has been for nearly twenty years."

ChildLine has been in financial difficulties for some time. In July 2005 it launched an emergency appeal for an extra £1 million in order to keep its night service open.

An unverified &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera%20bombing%20memo"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; discovered by the UK tabloid ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Mirror"&gt;The Daily Mirror&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ claiming to have been leaked from &lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street"&gt;Downing Street&lt;/a&gt; has been reported to contain a statement from US President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; about wishing to bomb the headquarters of Arabic TV station &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; in Doha, &lt;a href="w%3AQatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;. According to ♡❤The Daily Mirror♡❤, the President was dissuaded from bombing Al Jazeera's headquarters in Qatar by UK Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;. The newspaper said its story was based on information from an unnamed source with access to the "top secret" memo of the President and Prime Minister's conversation.

♡❤The Daily Mirror♡❤ reports that one of its sources said Bush "made clear he wanted to bomb al-Jazeera in Qatar. Blair replied that would cause a big problem. There's no doubt what Bush wanted to do &amp;mdash; and no doubt Blair didn't want him to do it." ♡❤The Mirror♡❤ is a United Kingdom-based tabloid, which has been under scrutiny in the past for publishing faked photographs depicting British soldiers abusing Iraqi detainees.

The document is said to be a transcript of a conversation between Bush and &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; on the 16th of April 2004, when the second US offensive force enacted on the Iraqi city of &lt;a href="w%3AFallujah"&gt;Fallujah&lt;/a&gt;. 

Bush administration officials have criticized the Qatar-based network for their coverage of the War in Iraq and of other Middle East affairs. Deputy Defense Secretary &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Wolfowitz"&gt;Paul Wolfowitz&lt;/a&gt; had earlier accused the station of "inciting violence against [US] troops". Defense Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; called the network "a mouthpiece for al-Qaeda and a vehicle of anti-American propaganda". In a news conference a day before the document's supposed date, Rumsfeld was quoted as saying the following about the network's coverage of the War in Iraq: "I can definitively say that what Al-Jazeera is doing is vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable."

While a UK Government official was quoted in the report as saying Mr. Bush's remarks were intended as "humorous, not serious", another source with apparent access to the memo told the newspaper that "Bush was deadly serious, as was Blair. That much is absolutely clear from the language used by both men." The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ quoted a senior diplomat saying that Bush's remark as recounted by ♡❤The Daily Mirror♡❤ "sounds like one of the president's one-liners that is meant as a joke", adding that "it was foolish for someone to write it down, and now it will be a story for days."

The authenticity of the documents and its alleged contents have not been verified independently.
The source of the leak, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Keogh"&gt;David Keogh&lt;/a&gt;, 49, a UK civil servant, is charged under Section 3 of the &lt;a href="w%3AOfficial%20Secrets%20Act"&gt;Official Secrets Act&lt;/a&gt;, of passing the memo to MP &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Clarke"&gt;Tony Clarke&lt;/a&gt;'s former assistant &lt;a href="w%3ALeo%20O%27Connor"&gt;Leo O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;. Section 3 concerns "a person who is or has been a Crown servant or government contractor" and who made a "damaging disclosure" of "any information, document or other article" that relates to "international relations" or was "obtained from a State other than the United Kingdom or an international organisation". A document is deemed "damaging" if "(a) it endangers the interests of the United Kingdom abroad, seriously obstructs the promotion or protection by the United Kingdom of those interests or endangers the safety of British citizens abroad; or (b) it is of information or of a document or article which is such that its unauthorised disclosure would be likely to have any of those effects."

Both Keogh and O'Connor are scheduled to appear in court later next week. Clarke has returned the memo to Downing Street and said O'Connor had behaved "perfectly correctly".

The British attorney general &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Goldsmith"&gt;Lord Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt; threatened newspapers with proscecution under the Official Secrets Act if they revealed any further details of the document. The British government has before obtained court injunctions against newspapers, but never prosecuted editors for publishing contents of leaked documents. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ this "is believed to be the first time the Blair government has threatened newspapers in this way". Knowing the legal ramifications, &lt;a href="w%3ATory"&gt;Tory&lt;/a&gt; MP, and editor for the conservative magazine ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Spectator"&gt;The Spectator&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Johnson"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt; has offered to publish the full text of the leaked document and risk a jail sentence, if someone can provide him with a copy in the next couple of days. Arguing for the publication he said: "Sunlight is the best disinfectant. If we suppress the truth, we forget what we are fighting for."

Former British defense minister &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Kilfoyle"&gt;Peter Kilfoyle&lt;/a&gt; called for the full text of the memo to be published. "I believe that Downing Street ought to publish this memo in the interests of transparency, given that much of the detail appears to be in the public domain". He added "If it was the case that President Bush wanted to bomb al-Jazeera in what is after all a friendly country, it speaks volumes and it raises questions about subsequent attacks that took place on the press that wasn't embedded with coalition forces." Al-Jazeera's Kabul office was hit indirectly by two US bombs in 2001 and Al-Jazeera's reporter &lt;a href="w%3ATareq%20Ayyoub"&gt;Tareq Ayyoub&lt;/a&gt; was killed when two US missiles hit the Al-Jazeera office in Baghdad in 2003. The US has denied targeting the al-Jazeera offices deliberately.

Al Jazeera has reacted cautiously to the report, releasing a statement in which it said it was investigating it and urged the US and UK governments to make the documents in question publicly available.

A spokesperson for the White House dismissed the allegations, saying, "We are not going to dignify something so outlandish with a response." Downing Street declined to make a statement, telling &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; that official procedure prevents it from commenting on "leaked documents".

<h1>Bush backtracks over legal status of alleged &quot;Dirty Bomber&quot; Jose Padilla</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%20backtracks%20over%20legal%20status%20of%20alleged%20%26quot%3BDirty%20Bomber%26quot%3B%20Jose%20Padilla&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

President George W. Bush ordered &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Padilla"&gt;Jose Padilla&lt;/a&gt;, detained by the US Military as an alleged terrorist, to be transferred out of military custody in order to face trial in a federal criminal court. He is charged with conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, aiding terrorist groups and other acts against US nationals outside the United States. These actions come six days ahead of a decision by the US Supreme Court on whether it should review the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal's ruling that the president is authorised to hold Padilla as an "&lt;a href="w%3AEnemy%20Combatant"&gt;Enemy Combatant&lt;/a&gt;" without charge. 

Jose Padilla, a US citizen born in Brooklyn, has been held without charge in a military brig at a US Navy detention facility in South Carolina for the three-and-a-half years since his arrest in 2002. The administration had at the time alleged that Padilla was plotting to detonate a Radioactive "dirty" bomb in the US and later, Deputy Attorney General James Comey alleged that he was involved in plots to blow up Hotels and high-rise buildings&lt;a href="http%3A//www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C121431%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The present indictment does not include any charges over these allegations. Instead, Padilla is charged with travelling abroad to train in "violent &lt;a href="w%3AJihad"&gt;Jihad&lt;/a&gt;", providing material support to terrorists by sending money, physical assets, and new recruits to Jihadi groups, and conspiring to murder individuals overseas&lt;a href="http%3A//www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2005/ag_speech_051122.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

The change in custody restores to Padilla a number of rights he had been denied when the administration designated him as an "Enemy Combatant", including the right to access federal courts and be defended by an attorney. That constitutionality of detaining suspects without charge under this designation has been challenged in court, on behalf of Padilla and in September, a 3-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the government's powers to detain Padilla. The Supreme Court was set to decide on whether it will review that decision next week. Padilla's status, for the purpose of this trial, is that of an ordinary criminal indictee, possessing the legal &lt;a href="w%3ARight"&gt;rights&lt;/a&gt; conferred on him by the &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20of%20Rights"&gt;US Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Constitutionality of Padilla's Detention</h2>
The existence of the classification of "enemy combatant" has no precedent in either US or international law, and allows detention without reference to the customary judicial protections for criminal defendants in the US, and also without reference to the acts of congress and the agreements made in the Geneva Conventions regarding the treatment of prisoners of war.

Several precedents exist for the habeas petition put forth by Padilla's attorney, Donna Newman. In June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Yaser Hamdi that enemy combatants captured on foreign battlefields were entitled to some due process determination of their status. Hamdi was released on condition that he remain in his parent's homeland Saudi Arabia. Hamdi is a US citizen who had been captured among Taliban fighters in Afghanistan and who was similarly classified as an enemy combatant. In a case decided around the same time, the high court ruled that prisoners at Guantánamo could seek habeas relief in US courts. It, however, avoided ruling on Padilla’s petition and voted 5-4 that Padilla's initial appeal should have been in Charleston, South Carolina, where he was being held, rather than in New York, where he was first held as a material witness.

Padilla’s attorney, Donna Newman, filed a new habeas petition in South Carolina, where United States District Judge Henry F. Floyd ruled that Padilla was required to be charged with a crime or released. Floyd wrote of the Bush administration’s position that “were ever adopted by the courts, it would totally eviscerate the limits placed on presidential authority to protect the citizenry’s individual liberties”. Floyd is one of the justices appointed by President Bush. Floyd’s decision was reversed in September of 2005 by a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, led by Michael J. Luttig. Luttig claimed that Padilla served as a guard for the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan during the period that US troops were engaged in combat against those organizations, and that he then “traveled to the United States for the avowed purpose of further prosecuting that war on American soil, against American citizens and targets”.

Padilla filed a second petition last month with the Supreme Court that was aimed at appealing Luttig’s ruling. Padilla’s lawyers intend to continue to proceed in the Supreme Court after the release of their client from military custody. Andrew Patel, Newman’s co-counsel, said on the radio show Democracy Now! that “the threat posed by the Bush administration’s invocation of the "enemy combatant" doctrine still exists". Patel further stated in opposition to the claim by Gonzales claim during the Tuesday indictment announcement that the case is moot, "We will ask the Court to consider this very important issue. Not only is it not moot as to Mr. Padilla—for example, suppose he was acquitted of this charge or the case was somehow dismissed, and the government decided that, 'Well, we don’t want him out,' and they just declare him to be an enemy combatant and send him back to the brig again. Until the Supreme Court rules that the president does not have that power, that's an authority, as Justice Jackson said in his dissent to Korematsu [the World War II Japanese-American internment case], that lies around like a loaded gun ready to be used or abused at any time."

<h2>Padilla's detention and present Indictment</h2>
The development of this case began with Padilla's arrest at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport in May of 2002. Former Attorney General John Ashcroft announced in June of the same year that a plot to explode a radioactive dirty bomb in America had been stopped; and described as a goal of several Al Qaeda operatives, including Padilla. On this basis, President Bush declared Padilla to be an “enemy combatant,” and authorized his transfer to a Naval brig, with the requisite limitations on his developing of a defense thus imposed by the classification. By June 2004, court reverses allowed Padilla to meet with legal council. Additional charges of plotting to destroy hotels and apartment buildings were claimed against Padilla by the Justice Department. These charges, however, were not included in the indictment released Tuesday.

This indictment focused on conspiracy charges against Padilla, particularly that he conspired with Adham Amin Hassoun, Kifah Wael Jayyousi, Mohammed Hesham Youssef and Kassem Daher to send funds, physical assets and recruits intended to continue fighting in Afghanistan, Algeria, Bosnia, Chechnya, Lebanon, Libya and Somalia. Further, it is charged that this was done through multiple front groups, including the American Islamic Group, the Islamic Center of the Americas, and Save Bosnia Now. The support for this conspiracy is claimed to have begun in 1993 and continue until November 2001 and consists of conversations obtained by wiretaps including alleged code words including "friends,” “football,” “tourism,” “fresh air,” and “picnics,”. The indictment further includes various payments of ranges from 1,000 to 5,000 USD. Padilla is mentioned as a "recruit" who had traveled to Egypt and Afghanistan where he completed a “Mujahideen Data Form”. He is not alleged to have engaged in any violent activities. 

Gonzales also alleged that the conspiracy advocated "acts of physical violence such as murder, maiming, kidnapping and hostage-taking against innocent civilians," but this was not included in the Tuesday indictment.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouthport%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Southport&lt;/a&gt; Magistrates' Court was told today that Anthony Douglas Donohue, 34 was so annoyed by a helicopter hovering over his home that he telephoned Air Services Australia with a threatening message yesterday.

Donohue allegedly threatened to blow the chopper out of the sky using a home-made bazooka loaded with tomatoes.
Police swung into action searching Donohue's &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; home. A police spokesperson stated that such situations were taken "very seriously", although no weapons had been found.
"Fruit is hardly a weapon of mass terror," Donohue's solicitor Bill Potts said.

Mr Donohue is charged with two counts of threatening to endanger the safety of an aircraft and the case will go to court next month.

&lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; will provide heating oil at a 40% discount to low income families in &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; this winter. According to an agreement signed on Tuesday &lt;a href="w%3ACitgo"&gt;Citgo&lt;/a&gt;, the Houston-based subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, will provide 12 million gallons of discounted home heating oil. The oil will be distributed through two nonprofit organizations, Citizens Energy Corp. and the Mass Energy Consumer Alliance.

In August &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Delahunt"&gt;William Delahunt&lt;/a&gt; (D-Mass) met President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; in Caracas. The meeting between a member of Congress and a head of state so critical of the White House, sparked negotiations that led to the deal. Mr Delahunt said he was simply trying to smooth strained US-Venezuelan relations while helping low-income people in his home state.

Hugo Chávez says he is leading a &lt;a href="w%3ABolivarian%20Revolution"&gt;Bolivarian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and calls his program an act of justice for poor Americans, whom he says have been neglected by their government. Mr Chávez is one of Latin America's harshest critics of U.S.-style capitalism, which he calls a major cause of poverty.
Venezuela has been selling fuel on preferential terms to countries across Latin America and the Caribbean, extending low-interest loans and accepting partial payment in goods ranging from bananas to sugar. 

Critics said Delahunt should not be working so closely with Chávez, an outspoken leftist. Steve Johnson, a Latin American specialist at the conservative oriented &lt;a href="w%3AHeritage%20Foundation"&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, said "Meeting with the leader who calls himself a revolutionary populist is not something I'd like my congressman to be doing."

Representative Delahunt said "This is a humanitarian gesture," and that his constituents' needs for heating assistance trump any political points the Chavez administration can score. Asked if he was subverting State Department policy toward Chávez, Mr Delahunt said, "I don't work for Condoleezza Rice. I don't report to the State Department. I report to the people who elected me in the state of Massachusetts. I belong to an independent branch of government."

Over 10 percent of US oil imports come from Venezuela, and while Mr Chávez seeks to diversify his markets, the US remains his leading trade partner.

When the discounted oil arrives early December Citizens Energy will determine suitable recipients with the help of local organizations that serve the poor. 350 local dealers will then distribute three-fourths of the oil to local families. 

The remaining quarter will be distributed or sold to homeless shelters, food banks, and low-income housing groups by MassEnergyConsumer Alliance. Larry Chretien, the nonprofit group's executive director says home heating oil prices are expected to increase by 30 percent to 50 percent this winter because of rising oil prices. The CITGO agreement could help ease the crunch on some families.

<h1>Workplace reform campaign most expensive in Australian history</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Workplace%20reform%20campaign%20most%20expensive%20in%20Australian%20history&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A senior &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n advertising executive says the Federal Government's campaign to promote its workplace changes is the most costly in Australian history. Harold Mitchell from Mitchell and Partners says the Howard Government spent $26 million on TV advertising in October. The figure is more than any other entity including retailing giant Coles Myer.

In October, 11,000 commercials were part of the campaign to sell its Industrial Relations (IR) reforms. Mr Mitchell said he could not recall a larger single monthly spending spree in Australian advertising history.

"There's never been a campaign in history as big as that," he said. "It followed of course the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Council%20of%20Trade%20Unions"&gt;ACTU&lt;/a&gt; campaign which was something like, maybe one fifth of that size."

He said the Government was the second biggest advertiser in Australia this year, having spent an estimated $117 million from January to the end of October. Only the supermarket and department store group &lt;a href="w%3AColes%20Myer"&gt;Coles Myer&lt;/a&gt; has spent more in the same period – $156 million. Coles Myer spent $19 million last month.

Of the Government's October advertising bill, $15 million went on TV ads, a 168 per cent increase on the bill for October 2004. The advertising blitz followed the ACTU campaign against the changes, which Mr Mitchell says came in at about one-fifth of the government's bill.

The Nielsen Media Research spokesman said the figures are estimates of the cost of placing the advertisements and did not include their production. 

On top of the TV spots, the Federal government spent more than $20 million on outdoor and print advertising. Plus another $4 million to $5 million on a nationwide pamphlet mail-out.

At the current rate spending will overtake the record $211 million spent selling the &lt;a href="w%3AGoods%20and%20Services%20Tax%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Goods and Services Tax (GST)&lt;/a&gt; over four years, and leaves all Australian company spending on advertising in the shade. The Government has earmarked $55 million to the IR campaign. 

The professor of marketing at Australian Graduate School of Management, John Roberts, said the intensity of the advertising had become counterproductive. He said people who disagreed with the policy simply had their feelings reinforced by the endless advertising, while others had become "habituated" by the deluge and ignored the ads.

"It's hard to believe they have done any research on this," he said. "There is this naive belief you get sometimes in management that if a campaign is not working properly you simply open the spigot a bit more, but it doesn't work that way."

Business groups have launched their own campaign supporting the changes too. Yet despite the spending on advertising, two polls this week attributed a sharp drop in the popularity of the Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, and the Government, to the planned IR (WorkChoice) changes.

Australian Democrats workplace relations spokesman Andrew Murray "You just shouldn't as a government be advertising prior to legislation before the Senate. It's immoral," Senator Murray said.

Opposition public accountability spokesman Kelvin Thomson said the campaign had cost taxpayers $1.7 million a day but had flopped, with Australians unconvinced that they would be better off under the changes. "It is an obscene waste of $55 million of public money used to fund a highly political flop," Mr Thomson said.

A large scale environmental accident is causing wide-spread disruptions to water supplies in &lt;a href="w%3AHarbin"&gt;Harbin&lt;/a&gt;, China after an accidental release of toxins two weeks ago at a chemical plant. Water supplies are being shipped in amidst a relative calm, Thursday. Local officials have suggested normal water supplies may resume in some form as early as Sunday.

An explosion at a workshop of the No. 101 Chemical Plant of the Jilin Petrochemical Company in Jilin City on November 13 resulted in the accidental release of benzene and benzene-like organic compounds, including nitrobenzene, into the Songhua River. The upstream position of the plant relative to the &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; city of Harbin made the pollution a risk to the health of its populace; the solution of ceasing public water production will leave more than 3.8 million people without public drinking water for three or more days. Harbin, the capital of the neighboring Heilongjiang province, is located about 380km (230 miles) from the plant and is itself located near the middle of the 1,897&amp;nbsp;km long Songhua River–from which it derives the majority of its water supplies. &lt;a href="w%3ABenzene"&gt;Benzene&lt;/a&gt; is a carcinogen, and the levels initially released into the Songhua River were 108 times the national safety levels for the country. By November 21, the polluted area included roughly 80 kilometers of the Songhua River.

The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) as well as local experts and officials have worked on a pollution-control campaign and emergency schemes have been launched by the two provincial governments to limit the effects of the environmental incidents. Jilin also quickly acted to block the further entry of the pollutants into the river and released large volumes of water from a reservoir in order to dilute them; at this time, Harbin added active carbon powders in quantities reaching 1,400 tons and more in order to purify the water. The densities of the benzene and nitrobenzene substances in the river near Jilin have dropped to levels within the state safety guidelines since the accidental release. The water that will pass through Harbin is expected to contain only small amounts of the toxic pollutants and to pass through Friday morning based upon its current speed. In preparation for the passage of these pollutants, the municipal government of Harbin has established an emergency medical care system composed of 15 hospitals to treat residents that may be exposed to contamination.

Zhang Dingbang, deputy secretary of the municipal government, said, at the first press conference since the incident that was held Wednesday, that Harbin is drilling 100 new wells in order to obtain 80,000 tons of underground water in addition to its current output from 918 wells of 320,000 tons every day. Nevertheless, thousand of tons of purified water have been provided by neighboring regions and enterprise donations, which will further increase this supply. Harbin residents have collected more than 300,000 tons of water as of Tuesday. Liu Yuzhu, a senior official with the municipal water supply and drainage corporation, has said that this supply is expected to provide for the daily average use of 18,600 tons per day for the three days required for the clear passage of the pollutants through the area.

"Give me liberty or give me a ditch" was the sign being held by one protester in Crawford, Texas. A dozen war protesters were arrested Wednesday for camping near President Bush's ranch in defiance of new local bans on roadside camping and parking. The protests have been planned during President Bush's six day Thanksgiving visit to his ranch. 

The protest was an act of civil disobedience, said Hadi Jawad, co-founder of the Crawford Peace House, "We want to challenge the encroachment of our civil rights". It was aimed to contest new regulations established by McLennan County commissioners banning parking and camping around the roads leading to President George W Bush's ranch. The constitutionality of these regulations, effected by a 3-2 vote in September, have been challenged in court by the Texas Civil Rights Project, and the U.S District for Waco refused their motion for a temporary restraining order over the enforcement of these new regulations while the case is heard. The new rules were established following the much larger protests led by &lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Sheenan"&gt;Cindy Sheenan&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. 

Among the protestors were &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Ellsberg"&gt;Daniel Ellsberg&lt;/a&gt;, a former military analyst and political activist, whose exposure of the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon%20Papers"&gt;Pentagon Papers&lt;/a&gt; brought to light the Nixon administration's attempt to "spin" the Vietnam War; Ann Wright, a senior US diplomat who resigned her post over the decision to invade Iraq; and an Iraq war veteran. Ellsberg was among those arrested.

The White House has refused to comment on the return of the protestors.

The U.K. attorney general &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Goldsmith%2C%20Baron%20Goldsmith"&gt;Lord Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt; has warned British media that further reporting of details from an allegedly leaked &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera%20bombing%20memo"&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt; about a dispute between Tony Blair and George Bush "could be in breach of section 5 of the &lt;a href="w%3AOfficial%20Secrets%20Act"&gt;Official Secrets Act&lt;/a&gt;." ♡❤The Guardian♡❤ quoted an unnamed &lt;a href="w%3A10%20Downing%20Street"&gt;Downing Street&lt;/a&gt; source as saying that the decision whether to prosecute was "entirely up to the attorney general", who intended to "draw a line in the sand" to stop further leaks.

Jeremy Dear, secretary of &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Union%20of%20Journalists"&gt;National Union of Journalists&lt;/a&gt;, called it "a heavy-handed attempt to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. It is a double attack on the &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20the%20press"&gt;freedom of the press&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Afreedom%20of%20information"&gt;freedom of information&lt;/a&gt;." Mr. Dear continued, "These sort of attempts to stifle uncomfortable revelations printed in a newspaper, which is only carrying out its proper duty to inform the British public, does the government of what is supposed to be a democracy no credit whatsoever."

According to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; this "is believed to be the first time the Blair government has threatened newspapers in this way". The British government has before obtained court injunctions against newspapers, but never prosecuted editors for publishing contents of leaked documents. 

Former British defence minister Peter Kilfoyle earlier called for the full text of the memo to be published. "I believe that Downing Street ought to publish this memo in the interests of transparency, given that much of the detail appears to be in the public domain". He added "If it was the case that President Bush wanted to bomb &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Jazeera"&gt;al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; in what is after all a friendly country, it speaks volumes and it raises questions about subsequent attacks that took place on the press that wasn't embedded with coalition forces."

Tuesday, the ♡❤Daily Mirror♡❤, a British tabloid, ran a front page story under the headline "Bush plot to bomb his ally", citing the memo in question (&lt;a href="Alleged%20Bush-Blair%20Al-Jazeera%20bombing%20transcript%20leaked"&gt;see previous story&lt;/a&gt;). In response to the attorney general, the ♡❤Daily Mirror♡❤ said it had "essentially agreed to comply". Boris Johnson, MP for Henley and editor of ♡❤The Spectator♡❤ magazine, has condemned the Attorney General's actions and offered to risk jail by printing the memo if he receives it within the next few days.

The ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ cited an unnamed senior Washington diplomat saying that the Bush remark as reported by the ♡❤Daily Mirror♡❤ "sounds like one of the president's one-liners that is meant as a joke." But, the diplomat said, "it was foolish for someone to write it down, and now it will be a story for days."

The meeting between Bush and Blair occurred on April 16, 2004, at the height of the US assault on Fallujah. According to some reports, al-Jazeera was the only major news organisation providing eyewitness reports and video footage from within the city at the time. 

There is a history of enmity between senior U.S. officials and al-Jazeera. Vice President Dick Cheney has said that the network ran the risk of being labeled "Osama [bin Laden]'s outlet to the world", and Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld has called its coverage "outrageous" and "inexcusably biased".

Al-Jazeera's news bureau in Kabul was destroyed by a U.S. missile during the aerial assault on the Taliban. The Pentagon later stated it did not know that the network's offices were in the building. Al-Jazeera's Baghdad bureau was also hit by US forces, resulting in the death of an al-Jazeera journalist during the April 2003 assault on Baghdad. The Pentagon claimed U.S. troops were responding to enemy fire from the building.

Two women were injured today when an &lt;a href="w%3AM%26amp%3BM%27s"&gt;M&amp;M's&lt;/a&gt; balloon in the &lt;a href="w%3AMacy%27s%20Thanksgiving%20Day%20Parade"&gt;Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade&lt;/a&gt; hit a lightpost, causing the lamp atop the pole to fall upon two spectators. Two women, aged 11 and 26 were struck around 11:30 AM local time (1630 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) at West 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue. The women were visiting from &lt;a href="w%3AAlbany%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Albany, New York&lt;/a&gt; to attend the parade. Neither sustained any serious injuries, and were released from the hospital by late afternoon.

Parade organizers were uncertain up to an hour before the parade began whether or not the participation of balloons would be limited. Conditions for the parade were windy, and there was a sprinkle of rain during the event, but it is unclear if the weather played a role in the accident. 

The annual parade had a similar incident in 1997, when a &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Cat%20in%20the%20Hat"&gt;Cat in the Hat&lt;/a&gt; balloon hit a lightpost, making it collapse. Two serious injuries were reported, both of whom recovered.

The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade has occurred every year since 1922, except from 1942 to 1944 during &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.

Hotshot batsman Brian Lara has become the second player in test cricket history to score 11,000 runs. Brian achieved the milestone while delivering a characteristic century to his West Indies team score sheet during day one of the final Test against Australia in Adelaide. Lara scored an unbeaten 106 by tea and cucumber sandwich time and is now only 107 runs behind Test record holder Allan Border, who plundered and pillaged 11,174 runs in 265 innings.

Lara already holds the records for the highest Test and first-class scores, 400 not out and 501 respectively.

&lt;a href="ESPN"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; recently named the basketball rivalry between Calvin College and Hope College fourth greatest across all divisions of the NCAA, although fans had &lt;a href="http%3A//proxy.espn.go.com/chat/sportsnation/polling%3Fincomming%3D1%26amp%3Bevent_id%3D1194%26amp%3Bquestion8217%3D32233"&gt;a different perspective&lt;/a&gt;. Now when the rivalry makes its way to Holland, the teams will have a new facility in which to square off.

Hope College has put the finishing touches on the new 102,000 sq ft Richard and Helen DeVos Fieldhouse, whose foundation contributed the $7.5 million anchor gift. Designed by sports architectural firm Ellerbe Becket, the fieldhouse will hold about 3,400 fans for basketball, volleyball and will also be used as a venue for college and community events.

The state of the art facility will also house Hope’s department of kinesiology which includes athletic training, exercise science and physical education. In addition to the construction of the fieldhouse, Hope added a new science center in 2003 and renovated the Peale Science Center for ’04-05.

Ellerbe Becket has designed nearly 20 arenas for NBA and NHL teams, including the new facility for the Charlotte Bobcats.

Calvin visits Hope &lt;a href="http%3A//events.grnow.com/events/index.php%3Fcom%3Ddetail%26amp%3BeID%3D13304"&gt;Saturday, 14 January 2006&lt;/a&gt;, and hosts the Flying Dutchman 8 February 2006.

<h1>Confidential EU report about Israels annexation of East Jerusalem</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Confidential%20EU%20report%20about%20Israels%20annexation%20of%20East%20Jerusalem&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A confidential report, prepared by top diplomats representing the 25 &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; governments, has been leaked to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Independent"&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;. European Foreign Ministers put in a veto when publication of the report was planned. They will not risk its relationship with &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time, Israel has given its blessing to the EU to play a key security role in the region. 

According to The Independent, the report provides the most detailed and remorselessly critical account yet produced by a Western international body of Israel's policy in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Jerusalem"&gt;East Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;. The 11-page page document concludes that European governments should consider direct intervention in an attempt to curb the systematic measures being undertaken by Israel to increase its control and population in the historically - and legally - Arab eastern sector of Jerusalem. 

During discussions at last Monday's meeting, EU foreign ministers decided to express "deep concern" over Israel's activities in East Jerusalem and its surroundings, including establishing settlements, constructing the &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20West%20Bank%20barrier"&gt;West Bank barrier&lt;/a&gt; and demolishing homes. 

Israel's policies in Arab East Jerusalem are hurting the prospects of a final agreement on the city with the Palestinians. A major expansion of Ma'ale Adumim, the largest Israeli West Bank settlement, will be joined to Jerusalem and this threatens to complete the encircling of the city by Jewish settlements, dividing the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; into two separate geographical areas.

In the 1967 &lt;a href="w%3ASix-Day%20War"&gt;Six-Day War&lt;/a&gt; Israel seized East Jerusalem, along with the rest of the West Bank and Gaza, and claims the city as its "united and eternal capital". Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state of their own.

In Friday's &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; contest between the &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Flyers"&gt;Philadelphia Flyers&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Bruins"&gt;Boston Bruins&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ATD%20Banknorth%20Garden"&gt;TD Banknorth Garden&lt;/a&gt; in Boston, Massachusetts. Peter Forsberg almost netted his first "hat trick" in a Flyers uniform. At one point during the game, he had been given credit for three goals, however an official review took his first goal away, and officially he scored his eighth goal of the season at 13:06 in the second period with assists from Simon Gagne and former Hartford Whaler Sami Kapanen.

To date, there have been 24 hat tricks (3 or more goals in one game) in this NHL season.

Forsberg, a 32 year old native of Sweden, recently joined the Flyers for the 2005-2006 season after spending the NHL lockout season with Modo, Sweden. 

The Flyers ended up winning the game 5-3, adding yet another loss to an already disappointing Bruins season.

Before the McIntire family of &lt;a href="w%3AAustin%2C%20Texas"&gt;Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt; sat down for their Thanksgiving dinner Thursday, the family discovered something unusual: a live turkey buried in their front yard. 

The eldest child of the family, Sean, was returning from work yesterday when he stumbled upon the patch of fresh dirt in his yard. He called his father out to look at the patch, then proceeded to examine its contents. The family then discovered the thirteen pound (6 kg) turkey buried in the hole; the turkey was still breathing. They kept the turkey in a dog cage, ate thanksgiving dinner, then took the turkey to a veterenarian where it died during examination.

"The turkey must have been alive in the ground for at least 2 days" said Bill Rogers, the McIntires' veterinarian, "It takes at least that long for a turkey to starve to death." No legal assistance has been given to the McIntires to find the person who buried the turkey, although the McIntires say the act violates animal cruelty laws.

The European Union agreed to reform its sugar subsidies Thursday. The EU has been under pressure by other members of the World Trade Organization to change its agriculture sector. The EU has been blamed for stalling trade talks at the recent APEC convention. 

The EU offered a guaranteed price, paid by consumers, with Brussels buying at about three times the average world market price. The WTO ruled the EU's sugar prices to be illegal earlier this year after following complaints from Australia, Brazil, and Thailand. The reform package, going into effect in 2006, drops the guaranteed price by 36% and will make 6.3 billion euros (about $10 billion US dollars) available to EU sugar farmers and refiners.

This reform package will help the EU's negotiations in the WTO.

&lt;a href="w%3ATatenda%20Taibu"&gt;Tatenda Taibu&lt;/a&gt;, the captain of the &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; cricket team, has announced that he will stand down from international cricket, after further threats were made against him by controversial Zimbabwean cricket figure &lt;a href="w%3AThemba%20Mliswa"&gt;Themba Mliswa&lt;/a&gt;.

Taibu alleges that he was threatened by Mliswa at a meeting with Zimbabwe Cricket Board chairman Peter Chingoka at a meeting earlier this week. He claims that Mliswa said to him "If you thought it is over it is not. Your time is coming and I will get you". 

Taibu had earlier gone into hiding when he received a telephone call, allegedly from Mliswa, in which threats were made against him and his wife and child. He says he is now considering his options, and a move to playing provincial cricket in South Africa, or county cricket in England appears likely. The largely state-controlled Zimbabwean media has largely attempted to portray the defection as a money issue, or a racial issue, and has not aired Taibu's allegations publicly.

Zimbabwe cricket has lurched from crisis to crisis recently, as political appointees from the &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Mugabe&lt;/a&gt; regime infiltrate the sport's governing structure. Many of the country's top players have either fled the country or turned their backs on the game, including &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Olonga"&gt;Henry Olonga&lt;/a&gt; who fled into exile after having an arrest warrant issued in his name for treason, after stating that democracy was dead in Zimbabwe at the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

The Philippines will host the 23rd edition of the Southeast Asian Games starting Sunday. The host nation is not just hoping to gain the overall championship, but also seeking to boost its tourism industry. With the venues of the Games spread around the tropical country, officials were taking advantage of the 10-day sporting event to showcase some of the Philippines' best tourist destinations. Some events will be held in the cities of Bacolod and Cebu, and suburbs near Metro Manila. It is also for the first time in the history of the Southeast Asian Games, the opening ceremony will be held in an open-air park instead of in a stadium. Philippine President &lt;a href="Gloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;, will lead the nation in welcoming more than 7,000 athletes, officials and members of the participating countries – Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, East Timor, Vietnam and the host.

Cebu opened the 23rd Southeast Asian (SEA) Games yesterday with pomp and pageantry. The SEA Games welcome ceremony, served as the "appetizer" for the formal opening in Manila.

Security is tight with a 17,000-strong police force on alert to ensure the safety of the thousands of athletes and officials taking part, amid the threat of possible attacks by militants.

The government is also determined to impose a strict smoking ban throughout the duration of 23rd Southeast Asian Games. No one will be allowed to smoke within a 50-meter radius from venues in Metro Manila, Bacolod City, Cebu City, the Subic freeport in Zambales province, Angeles City in Pampanga province, Tagaytay in Cavite province, and Los Baños and Calamba in Laguna province. The ban also covers any form of advertisement of tobacco companies.

A total of 41 events, 441 gold medals are up for grabs, with the Philippine martial art arnis as well as ballroom dancing making their debuts.

The basketball event was cancelled after a dispute involving the Philippines Olympic Council (POC) and Basketball Association of Philippines (BAP), which saw the former expelling the latter. POC and BAP were later embroiled in a court case, which apparently ruled in favour of BAP's reinstatement. 

In an unexpected move, representatives of the Philippines' largest Muslim separatist group will attend the opening of the SEA Games as a "goodwill measure", a rebel spokesman said yesterday. 

Eid Kabalu, spokesman for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), said he and four other rebel officials would attend the event to show his group's sincerity in seeking peace in the strife-torn southern region of Mindanao. 

However, in the capital, there are hardly any banners to herald the 23rd SEA Games. There is no excitement and even the mascot, the eagle, is nowhere in sight. Inconvenienced and incensed by the treatment, the ten visiting countries blasted hosts Philippines for poor arrangements before the start of the 23rd SEA Games.

The &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Aerospace%20Exploration%20Agency"&gt;Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency&lt;/a&gt; has achieved the primary goal of the &lt;a href="w%3AHayabusa"&gt;Hayabusa&lt;/a&gt; probe's mission by touching down on the surface of an asteroid in an attempt to collect a sample of what is thought to be the oldest material in the solar system.

Despite an earlier aborted attempt, and the apparent loss of an exploratory "micro rover", Hayabusa's achievement is significant. No other mission has attempted to bring back material from an asteroid which is believed to be a remnant from the formation of the solar system.

The actual success of the mission to the &lt;a href="w%3A25143%20Itokawa"&gt;Itokawa asteroid&lt;/a&gt; cannot actually be known until 2007 when the probe returns to Earth. Only at that time can it be established if firing a metal pellet into the surface of the asteroid disturbed it enough to allow a sample to be obtained.

Despite heavy snowing, tens of thousands of workers and supporters marched today in &lt;a href="w%3ALjubljana"&gt;Ljubljana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASlovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; in the largest demonstration since the country's independence in 1991 to protest against the government programme of economic reforms, including privatisation of public services, tax cuts for businessmen and the abolition of the lower &lt;a href="w%3Avalue%20added%20tax"&gt;value added tax&lt;/a&gt; rate for items like food and books.

The protests, jointly organized by several trade union federations and attended by representatives of almost all Slovenian trade unions, began with an hour-long march from Ljubljana's Tivoli park to the Congress Square (♡❤Kongresni trg♡❤). Workers and trade unionists were joined by supporters from &lt;a href="w%3ACroatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, as well as students, &lt;a href="w%3Aanarchism"&gt;anarchist&lt;/a&gt; groups, and general population. Several politicians from the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20democracy%20of%20Slovenia"&gt;Liberal democracy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20democrats%20%28Slovenia%29"&gt;Social democrats&lt;/a&gt; were seen in the crowd. Noisy protesters armed with whistles, rattles and even some flares, marched through the snow waving trade union flags and carrying banners denouncing government policies. There were even a couple of old &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Slovenia"&gt;socialist flags&lt;/a&gt; with red stars. Riot police were seen on side streets and guarding accessess to government buildings, but they did not intervene.

The protest continued at the Congress Square with speeches of the representatives of trade unions and student organizations who denounced the government policy as leading into greater inequality and decreased standard of living for ordinary people. The loudest boos of the audience were drawn by the remarks about blaming the unemployed for being unemployed, introduction of university fees, and government's waiving of taxes and health and pension fund contributions for church officials. The speeches were followed by a musical program, but the crowd soon started dispersing to escape the weather. Trade unions organized transport for 40,000 people to attend, but many buses were stuck in traffic jams on snowy roads and arrived too late for the protest. The police estimated the number of protesters to 25,000.

<h2>Banners and posters</h2>

Canadian community art group &lt;a href="w%3AVisual%20Arts%20Brampton"&gt;Visual Arts Brampton&lt;/a&gt; is looking for entries for its international entry mail art exhibit "Control".

The exhibit's entry information discusses the theme of the show: "Are you a control-freak, or more happy-go-lucky? What do you think of corporations' control on the media and governments? Is your life quickly spinning out of control? Always hitting &lt;a href="w%3AControl-Alt-Delete"&gt;Ctrl-Alt-Del&lt;/a&gt;?"

The exhibition dates have yet to be scheduled, but the show will run in early 2006 at either the Fridge Front Gallery or upcoming World Art Gallery in &lt;a href="w%3AShoppers%20World%2C%20Brampton"&gt;Shoppers World Brampton&lt;/a&gt;, a mall in suburban Toronto.

While it prefers 4 x 6 inch artworks, VAB asks that entries are no larger than 6 x 6 inches. VAB's address is "Snail Mail Central / 1 Bartley Bull Parkway, Suite 10 / Brampton ON / L6W 3T7". Entries must be received by January 31, 2006.

This show will help Visual Arts Brampton to continue to build up a reputation in the mail art world. The non-profit community art group is in the process of opening up the World Art Gallery, which will be the first permanent display space to solely exhibit mail art. Over the past few years, the club has organized three general no theme exhibits, and "SAT: An Exhibit of Chairs", which is running currently.

E-mails containing the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASober%20worm"&gt;Sober X&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ worm are being sent around the Internet disguised as an e-mail from either the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;, both organizations of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government. Opening the e-mail on a system running on the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; operating system should be avoided at all costs, experts say.

The e-mail claims that the recipient has been caught visiting illegal websites, and asks the user to open an attachment to answer some questions. Once this virus is opened, a variety of system-damaging events may occur. It is reported that anti-virus and other security measures are disabled, and accessing websites for said assistance is disabled, and that your contacts on your address book can be sent this e-mail, and that your privacy may be invaded.

BBC News reported the virus was unleashed on November 22. &lt;a href="w%3AMessageLabs"&gt;MessageLabs&lt;/a&gt; caught at least three million copies within 24 hours after the breakout, and &lt;a href="w%3AMcAfee"&gt;McAfee&lt;/a&gt;, a system security research firm, reports over 70,000 cases of the virus on consumer computers. This is also the 25th variant of the ♡❤Sober♡❤ worm, the first of which was released in October 2005.

The FBI and the CIA claim on their website that they did not send out the e-mail, and they discourage opening the e-mail. The ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ names this worm as the "worst computer worm of the year". 

A similar e-mail circulated in Germany last week. Claiming to be sent by the &lt;a href="w%3ABundeskriminalamt"&gt;Bundeskriminalamt&lt;/a&gt; the e-mail told its readers that they were caught downloading pirated software. An attachment also included the Sober worm.

&lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3ABarnaby%20Joyce"&gt;Barnaby Joyce&lt;/a&gt; looks set to complicate Australian prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;'s plans to pass his IR reform bill before Christmas.

The powerful Queensland &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party"&gt;Nationals&lt;/a&gt; management committee has urged that changes be made to the bill, including guarantees that penalty rates on "iconic" public holidays such as Christmas Day and &lt;a href="w%3AANZAC%20Day"&gt;ANZAC Day&lt;/a&gt; be protected. The proposed changes were slammed by Peter Hendy, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as being "not acceptable" and "inflexible".

Nationals Senate leader Ron Boswell stated that he thought that the Government would eventually accept Senator Joyce's amendments to the bill, and Federal Nationals leader Mark Vaile said that any changes demanded by the Queensland branch of his party should be minor and achievable. John Howard and workplace relations minister &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Andrews"&gt;Kevin Andrews&lt;/a&gt; have previously said that "commonsense" amendments to the bill would be possible, but no changes to the overall substance of the bill would be permitted.

The Queensland Nationals have provided John Howard with plenty of headaches on IR in the past week, with the Queensland Nationals siding with Labor premier &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday in a motion calling on Queensland senators to oppose the new changes. 

Labor groups are campaigning hard against the workplace reforms, which they say will cause workers to be exploited, and tip the balance of workplace power in favour of powerful bosses. Employer groups, however, claim that the changes will allow business to become more flexible and reduce unemployment.

At his death, Morita had over 100 screen credits, including ♡❤The Karate Kid♡❤ sequels, and also as a voice character in the Disney films ♡❤Mulan♡❤ and ♡❤Mulan II♡❤. Morita was beloved by many children of the 80s, and remains a popular icon.
