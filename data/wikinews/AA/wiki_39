<h1>More allegations filed against Oral Roberts University</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=More%20allegations%20filed%20against%20Oral%20Roberts%20University&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Friday three fired professors filed more charges in their lawsuit against &lt;a href="Oral%20Roberts%20University"&gt;Oral Roberts University&lt;/a&gt;, University president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Roberts%20%28evangelist%29"&gt;Richard Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and his wife, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALindsay%20Roberts"&gt;Lindsay Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In addition to previous allegations of illegal political contributions, financial wrong-doing, and wrongful firings, the plaintiffs also added the ORU &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoard%20of%20Regents"&gt;Board of Regents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Lindsay and Richard are both members of the board) to the lawsuit claiming regents did not oversee the university and its president Richard Roberts. One example cited in the lawsuit was that ORU allowed a man with three convictions of sexual abuse, including "exposing himself to a 15-year-old boy in a school locker room," to mentor ORU college students.

Also cited was that three days after the original lawsuit, Richard Roberts fired the ORU financial comptroller who had been with the school for 26 years and then proceeded to shred and destroy "voluminous materials and documents ... constituting spoilation of evidence."

In addition, the report attached to the lawsuit contained fresh allegations that Lindsay Roberts, 51, stayed overnight nine times with an "underage male" at a ORU "guest home". This "underage male" moved in with Lindsay and prompted her daughters to have locks added to the doors on the home. The filing also said she was photographed alone with that boy after Tulsa curfew 29 times, and this includes a picture of her and the boy smoking at the ORU guest house.

Friday's updated lawsuit also had an attachment of the document Stephanie Cantees, Lindsay's sister, wrote which contained the original document that the plaintiffs claim spawned their dismissals. This contains more details about the Roberts family than the previous document. Among other charges, Cantees' document says that Mrs. Roberts invites ORU athletes on her ♡❤Make Your Day Count♡❤ television show and gives them gifts, which is listed on the document as an "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association"&gt;NCAA violation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

Previously on October 9th, Roberts and his wife appeared on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20King%20Live"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and denied all the accusations. On Friday ORU released a two sentence statement denying all allegations, and Lindsay released an email that said, "I live my life in a morally upright manner and throughout my marriage have never, ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage as the accusations imply." She continued: "Allegations against me in a lawsuit yesterday are not true. They sicken me to my soul."

&lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; opened their 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification campaign with a 0-0 draw.

Despite inexperienced squad, Colombia had most of the chances and Brazil became less of a threat as the game went on.

The match started 45 minutes late after a torrential downpour left the pitch temporarily unplayable. But the water drained away quickly.

Colombia pressed forward after for the majority of the game. However, they couldn't take any of their chances and ended with a 0-0 scoreline.

Brazil could find themselves in trouble with an accumulation of yellow cards as 4 of their players picked up their 1 yellow cards.

&lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; have beaten &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; 37 - 13 in the second semi-final of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AStade%20de%20France"&gt;Stade de France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaint-Denis"&gt;Saint-Denis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

The first try of the match came in the seventh minute when &lt;a href="w%3AFourie%20du%20Preez"&gt;Fourie du Preez&lt;/a&gt; gave South Africa the lead after a seventy metre run. &lt;a href="w%3APercy%20Montgomery"&gt;Percy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; added the conversion and South Africa led 7 - 0. &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Contepomi"&gt;Felipe Contepomi&lt;/a&gt; kicked a penalty to score Argentina's first points in the fifteenth minute, but Percy Montgomery restored South Africa's seven point lead with a penalty two minutes later. A second penalty from Felipe Contepomi brought the score to 10 - 6. However tries from &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Habana"&gt;Bryan Habana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADanie%20Rossouw"&gt;Danie Rossouw&lt;/a&gt; gave South Africa a 24 - 6 lead at half time.

Soon after the interval &lt;a href="w%3AManuel%20Contepomi"&gt;Manuel Contepomi&lt;/a&gt; scored a try for Argentina to reduce the deficit to eleven points. Neither side could find a breakthrough for the next 25 minutes, but two &lt;a href="w%3APercy%20Montgomery"&gt;Percy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; penalties and a second try from &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Habana"&gt;Bryan Habana&lt;/a&gt; secured the match for South Africa.

South Africa, champions in &lt;a href="w%3A1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt;, will face defending champions England in the final, a repeat of an earlier pool match which South Africa won . Meanwhile, Argentina will play hosts France in the third place match. Argentina previously defeated France in the opening match of the tournament.

<h1>Report says Israeli air strike targeted Syrian nuclear reactor</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Report%20says%20Israeli%20air%20strike%20targeted%20Syrian%20nuclear%20reactor&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s air strike on &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; last month was an attempt to knock out a partially constructed nuclear reactor, according to officials with access to &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; and Israeli intelligence reports, the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reported on Sunday. Syria's President &lt;a href="w%3ABashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt; previously said that Israeli jets had dropped bombs on an unused military building.

Although Syria has signed the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, it has a legal right to build a nuclear reactor for the purposes of generating electricity, and it is not obligated to disclose work on such a reactor during the early stages of construction. 

According to The New York Times sources, the Bush administration was divided at the time over whether to support the Israeli attack. The article quotes an American official as saying that "[t]here wasn’t a lot of debate about the evidence [of the reactor's existence]", but that "[t]here was a lot of debate about how to respond to it." 

The attack is reminiscent of a 1981 Israeli raid that destroyed the Osirak nuclear reactor in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; shortly before it was scheduled to come online. Bush administration officials have stated that the 1981 attack set back Iraq's nuclear program by many years. The New York Times article quotes an Israeli official as saying that the purpose of the strike was to "re-establish the credibility of our deterrent power."

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; has received information from his special services regarding a possible plot to assassinate him during his visit to &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; later this week, say &lt;a href="w%3AKremlin"&gt;Kremlin&lt;/a&gt; officials.

A "credible" source within the Russian national security services told the Russian &lt;a href="w%3AInterfax"&gt;Interfax&lt;/a&gt; news agency that multiple security agencies have received reports from various international sources warning of assassination attempts by several terrorist groups. According to the official, Russian intelligence has reason to believe that the terrorist groups have already been assembled and include individuals training to &lt;a href="w%3Akidnap"&gt;kidnap&lt;/a&gt; the Russian President, and to sacrifice their lives during a &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20bombing"&gt;suicide bombing&lt;/a&gt;.

Kremlin deputy spokeman &lt;a href="w%3ADmitry%20Peskov"&gt;Dmitry Peskov&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;♡❤Reuters♡❤&lt;/a&gt; that there were currently no plans to cancel Putin's historic trip, the first visit to Iran by a Kremlin leader since &lt;a href="w%3AJosef%20Stalin"&gt;Josef Stalin&lt;/a&gt; during a wartime summit in 1943. The Russian president is planning to visit &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; to attend a summit of the five states which border the &lt;a href="w%3ACaspian%20Sea"&gt;Caspian Sea&lt;/a&gt;. He will arrive in Iran on Wednesday.

Putin is also expected to meet with Iranian President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; to discuss a peaceful solution to the questions regarding &lt;a href="w%3AIran%27s%20nuclear%20program"&gt;Iran's nuclear program&lt;/a&gt;, specifically its desire to acquire an &lt;a href="w%3Aatomic%20bomb"&gt;atomic bomb&lt;/a&gt;. Although Russia has supported two rounds of restrictive &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; sanctions against Iran, the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20government"&gt;Russian government&lt;/a&gt; says publicly that it believes that direct engagement is the most effective way to handle the situation. Russian officials have told ♡❤Reuters♡❤ privately that they do not support Ahmadinejad's radical ideas, and that visiting Tehran could very well widen the gap of differences with the West over how to handle Iran.

Russia has sold weapons to Iran in the past, despite &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; protestation. The Russian government is currently helping to build a &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20power%20facility"&gt;nuclear power facility&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ABusehr"&gt;Busehr&lt;/a&gt;, Iran, on the &lt;a href="w%3APersian%20Gulf"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt;. 

Analysts say that delays in finishing the Bushehr power station are an indication that, regardless of what it says publicly, the Kremlin is uncomfortable with the Ahmadinejad administration. &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; says the delays have been caused by technical problems.

♡❤♡Are the Reports Reliable?♡❤♡

Mohammed Ali Hosseini, the Iranian &lt;a href="w%3Aforeign%20ministry"&gt;foreign ministry&lt;/a&gt; spokesman, denied the reliability of the reports.

"Reports published by some media are totally baseless and are in line with the &lt;a href="w%3Apsychological%20war"&gt;psychological war&lt;/a&gt; launched by enemies who want to harm Iran and Russia's relationship...Such erroneous reports will have no effect on the program already decided upon for Mr. Putin's visit to Tehran," he said. He seemed to indicate that the report was a creation of Iran's western enemies. 

Conversely, a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20parliament"&gt;Russian parliament&lt;/a&gt;'s security committee has said that the report is likely reliable.

"For me this report has not come as a big revelation, because, unfortunately, today there are enough radical organisations, forces and movements of an &lt;a href="w%3Aextremist"&gt;extremist&lt;/a&gt; nature, oriented against Russia, which would like to settle a score with the Russian president," &lt;a href="w%3AGennadiy%20Gudkov"&gt;Gennadiy Gudkov&lt;/a&gt; told the state-owned Russian news channel, Vesti TV. 

"There are certainly organisations of this kind in Tehran, which in recent times has unfortunately been a stronghold of &lt;a href="w%3Aradical%20Islamic"&gt;radical Islamic&lt;/a&gt; organisations," he said. 

The Moscow correspondent for the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Science%20Monitor"&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Weir"&gt;Fred Weir&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; that assassination plots against the Putin had previously been uncovered in the &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Azerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, both believed to be connected to the &lt;a href="w%3Aseparatist%20movement"&gt;separatist movement&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt;. 

"It could be some international scheme, perhaps connected with Russia's enemies like the &lt;a href="w%3AChechens"&gt;Chechens&lt;/a&gt;," he said. 

"Or it could be some elaborate rumor, in Russia we have this transitional phase, we are not sure if Putin is leaving his job or changing his job next year. All of this sort of thing excites power struggles and rumors are a major weapon in that."

So far, three people (including a baby) have been killed, and at least ten others were injured when two semi trucks collided in a tunnel on &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%205"&gt;Interstate 5&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANewhall%20Pass"&gt;Newhall Pass&lt;/a&gt;) between &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clarita%2C%20California"&gt;Santa Clarita&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in the late evening of October 12, setting off a chain reaction pileup that involved between 28 and 30 semi trucks and one passenger car. The wreck caused a massive fire that burned for over six hours. It was previously believed that only 13 semi trucks were involved.

"The fire burned in a very intense state for approximately four hours and basically consumed everything that was burnable," said John Tripp the Fire Chief for L.A. county. 

As a result of the crash, the Governor of California, &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; issued a declaration of a state of emergency for &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/a&gt;.

The debris has been removed and officials say that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because the structure of the tunnel has been compromised. The tunnel passed inspection in June of 2006.

"The walls of the tunnel are fairly heavily damaged. None of the rebar appears to be melted, damaged at this point in time. But it's completely separated from the walls in a number of areas, so we lose vertical support when that happens," said &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Department%20of%20Transportation"&gt;California Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; official, Doug Failing.

Tripp added that more bodies could be buried in the wreckage, saying "...we're going to have to do a very methodical search. There could be unfortunately more people that were not able to escape." So far authorities have yet to identify the three people who were killed.

A full investigation is being conducted into what caused the crash.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
After losing their bid to host &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikimania%202008"&gt;Wikimania 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Wikimedians from the &lt;a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28US%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; bid proposal are now working to host a conference focusing on Wikimedia in the Americas. 

&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AMike%20Halterman"&gt;Mike Halterman&lt;/a&gt;, a student at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20South%20Florida"&gt;University of South Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and unpaid intern at the &lt;a href="Wikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (WMF) offices in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, is helping to plan the ♡❤Conference of the Americas♡❤ which will be held at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta, Georgia on May 15-18, 2008. Several others who helped in the conference's creation include: &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ADisavian"&gt;Andrew Guyton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ASwatjester"&gt;Dan Rosenthal&lt;/a&gt;, Geoff Swanstrom, &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ALaMenta3"&gt;Hillary Lipko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ANiayre"&gt;Jessica Gibson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AMatt%20Britt"&gt;Matt Britt&lt;/a&gt;, and ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ administrator and contributor .

"We went forward after Wikimania because we felt that we had a good idea on our hands, and all the organization and manpower should not go to waste. We can still make a difference here in our own hemisphere, which as far as Wikimedia goes, has been overlooked in favor of the world picture. We want to show the work done by people here, and how it impacts people here," said Halterman in an exclusive interview with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.

The conference is focused on "discussions of Wikimedia and the free culture movement and how they relate to communities (national/regional, social, linguistic); discussions about the impacts free culture movements have in these communities, and by the work done in said movements in everyday life," says the announcement. The discussion includes &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, along with the countries of Latin America. Wikimedia &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and the WMF have also been given a proposal, but decisions on endorsement are still pending for both.

There will also be a journalism segment that will be held inside the Turner Broadcasting building on Techwood Drive in Midtown Atlanta.

After the location of Wikimania 2008 was announced to be in &lt;a href="Alexandria%2C%20Egypt"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="LGBT"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt; community spoke out, wondering if the jury, a group of Wikimedians who selected the location, took into account &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALGBT%20rights%20in%20Egypt"&gt;LGBT rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , safety of all attending, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20rights%20in%20Egypt"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , or free speech in the country before making their decision. There has since been discussion and controversy over the location posted on several public mailing lists.

Despite that, Halterman, who was on the bidding team to have Wikimania 2008 in Atlanta, states that the ♡❤Conference of the Americas♡❤ was not formed in retaliation, revenge or to "out maneuver" Wikimania 2008 and that the discussion for the COTA was taking place long before the location of Wikimania was announced. He also states that the conference's purpose is not to compete with it, but to give those who are in the western hemisphere a chance to attend a Wikimedia event for the Americas.

"This was never something that was supposed to be 'the American solution.' We aren't trying to compete with Wikimania at all. We're not out to make a statement against Wikimania. This isn't done out of anger, it's done out of a drive to unite, not to divide. We have over 100 interested parties all over the United States who want to volunteer and/or attend in some fashion or another. Reaching out to the other communities is high on our list of priorities and we really do want to make this a hemispheric effort" as "it's more expensive for people to go to Egypt over something in their own country or something close enough to it," said Halterman to Wikinews.

The conference is sponsored by Georgia Tech, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill"&gt;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Public Journalism Network (pjnet), &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIbiblio"&gt;Ibiblio.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the Carolina Open Source Initiative.

<h2>Death toll, vehicle count rise in California truck pileup</h2>

So far, three people (including a baby) have been confirmed killed, and at least 10 others were injured when two semi trucks collided in a tunnel on Interstate 5 between Los Angeles and Santa Clarita California in the United States. The incident occurred last Friday evening, setting off a chain reaction pileup that involved more than 29 vehicles, six being semi trucks and one passenger car. The wreck caused a massive fire that burned for over six hours. It was previously believed that only 13 semi trucks were involved.

As a result of the crash, the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a declaration of a state of emergency for Los Angeles County.

The debris has been removed and officials say that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because the structure of the tunnel has been compromised. The tunnel passed inspection in June of 2006 and a full investigation is being conducted into what caused the crash.

<h2>More allegations filed against Oral Roberts University</h2>

Last Friday three fired professors filed more charges in their lawsuit against Oral Roberts University, University president Richard Roberts, and his wife, Lindsay Roberts. In addition to previous allegations of illegal political contributions, financial wrong-doing, and wrongful firings, the plaintiffs also added the ORU Board of Regents to the lawsuit claiming regents did not oversee the university and its president Richard Roberts. One example cited in the lawsuit was that ORU allowed a man with three convictions of sexual abuse to mentor ORU college students.

In addition the report attached to the lawsuit contained fresh allegations that Lindsay Roberts, 51, stayed overnight nine times with an "underage male" at a ORU "guest home". The filing also said she was photographed alone with that boy after Tulsa curfew and includes a picture of her and the boy smoking at the ORU guest house

Previously on October 9th, Roberts and his wife appeared on Larry King Live, and denied all the accusations.

<h2>Putin warned of assassination plot</h2>

Russian President Vladimir Putin has received information from his special services regarding a possible plot to assassinate him during his visit to Iran later this week, say Kremlin officials.

A "credible" source within the Russian national security services told the Russian Interfax news agency that multiple security agencies have received reports from various international sources warning of assassination attempts by several terrorist groups including suicide-bombings.

Russia has sold weapons to Iran in the past, despite the U.S. protesting. The Russian government is currently helping to build a nuclear power facility at Busehr, Iran, on the Persian Gulf.

Analysts say that delays in finishing the Bushehr power station are an indication that, regardless of what it says publicly, the Kremlin is uncomfortable with the Ahmadinejad administration. Moscow says the delays have been caused by technical problems.

Mohammed Ali Hosseini, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, denied the reliability of the reports.

<h2>US Crude Oil reaches new high</h2>
Over the weekend, oil prices in the United States briefly hit a new all-time high at US$84.05, but later fell to just under that to $83.69. Brent Crude also rose to $80.55, up 40 cents in the United Kingdom.

The high prices are amid fears that Turkey is planning to attack Iraqi Kurdish militants that killed 13 Turkish soldiers last Sunday. 60,000 Turkish troops are stationed at the Iraq-Turkey border.

<h2>Report says Israeli air strike targeted Syrian nuclear reactor</h2>

Israel's air strike on Syria last month was an attempt to knock out a partially constructed nuclear reactor, according to officials with access to American and Israeli intelligence reports, The New York Times reported on Sunday. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad previously said that Israeli jets had dropped bombs on an unused military building.

Although Syria has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has a legal right to build a nuclear reactor for the purposes of generating electricity, and it is not obligated to disclose work on such a reactor during the early stages of construction.

The attack is reminiscent of a 1981 Israeli raid that destroyed the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq shortly before it was scheduled to come online. Bush administration officials have stated that the 1981 attack set back Iraq's nuclear program by many years.

In late September, the &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government announced that it would fund a AU$20 million engineering study into the construction of a &lt;a href="w%3ABells%20Line%20of%20Road"&gt;Bells Line&lt;/a&gt; expressway across the &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Mountains"&gt;Blue Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, linking &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; to the Central West of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;NSW&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the announcement, Federal opposition transport minister, &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Ferguson"&gt;Martin Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; accused the federal government of "pork-barreling" on the issue.

In an interview with ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the shadow transport minister warned that a Bells Line expressway could not be built for many years, regardless of the outcome of any study and that people in the Central West want "better roads now". Mr Ferguson said that a &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Rudd&lt;/a&gt; Labor government would upgrade the Great Western Highway now and spend up to $5 million investigating the Bells Line expressway proposal as part of a broader study into the transport needs of Central Western NSW in the medium to long term. He said that $200 million had already been promised by the opposition to upgrade the Great Western Highway between &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Victoria%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Mount Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALithgow%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Lithgow&lt;/a&gt;.

When questioned about other possible road projects a Rudd government would embark upon, Mr Ferguson promised to retain the current &lt;a href="w%3AAuslink"&gt;Auslink&lt;/a&gt; projects and to upgrade highways which form the national highway network. Mr Ferguson said "When it comes to the national network, we are committed to the ongoing progressive upgrade of the Hume, Pacific and Bruce Highways and other highways identified in the corridor strategies that have been agreed between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories."

Mr Ferguson attacked the Howard government's recent transport announcements, claiming that they are based merely on marginal seat politics and promised that a Labor government would base funding on economic priorities, relying upon the advice of experts.

Mr Ferguson also commented on the government's $1 billion funding announcement for the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Highway%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Pacific Highway&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Ferguson criticised the announcement claiming it to be without substance. "This announcement came with no details about where the money is coming from, what specific projects will be delivered or when."

"It’s almost as if John Howard has plucked a number out of the air without any consultation with the NSW Government on the details of the project," said Mr Ferguson.

Mr Ferguson said that drivers who used the Pacific Highway "just want the project completed". He recalled that the upgrade program was initiated in 1995 by a &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Keating"&gt;Keating&lt;/a&gt; Labor federal government and NSW government partnership.

&lt;a href="w%3AMenzies%20Campbell"&gt;Menzies Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; political party, has resigned.

&lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Hughes"&gt;Simon Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, the President of the Liberal Democrats, and deputy leader &lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Cable"&gt;Vincent Cable&lt;/a&gt; announced the resignation outside the Liberal Democrats headquarters in London, saying that he had made the decision "in the interests of the party". 

Vincent Cable will become acting leader while a &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20leadership%20election%2C%202007"&gt;leadership election&lt;/a&gt; takes place. Home Affairs spokesman &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Clegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt; and environment spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Huhne"&gt;Chris Huhne&lt;/a&gt; are considered to be possible candidates.

Campbell, 66, was &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats%20leadership%20election%2C%202006"&gt;elected leader&lt;/a&gt; in January 2006 after &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; stood down. Since then he has faced criticism over his leadership and poor poll results.

In his resignation letter, he wrote: "It has become clear that following the prime minister's decision not to hold an election, questions about leadership are getting in the way of further progress by the party. Accordingly, I now submit my resignation as leader with immediate effect."

&lt;a href="w%3AStockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; – 
The &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize%20in%20Economics"&gt;2007 Nobel Prize in Economics&lt;/a&gt; has been awarded to three &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="w%3ALeonid%20Hurwicz"&gt;Leonid Hurwicz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20S.%20Maskin"&gt;Eric S. Maskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20B.%20Myerson"&gt;Roger B. Myerson&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; "for having laid the foundations of &lt;a href="w%3Amechanism%20design%20theory"&gt;mechanism design theory&lt;/a&gt;."

The Nobel Prize, which includes ten million Swedish Crowns (US$1.54 million), was assigned by the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Sweden"&gt;Bank of Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, which instituted the prize in 1968 in memoriam of &lt;a href="w%3AAlfred%20Nobel"&gt;Alfred Nobel&lt;/a&gt;.

"Mechanism design theory, initiated by Leonid Hurwicz and further developed by Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson, has greatly enhanced our understanding of optimal allocation mechanisms in such situations, accounting for individuals' incentives and private information," said the jury while assigning the prize.

Furthermore, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences added that the theory "allows us to distinguish the situations in which the markets work fine from those in which they work bad."

The attribution of this Nobel Prize closes the 2007 Nobel Prize awarding; prizes will be handed on December 10, 2007, in Stockholm, Sweden, on Alfred Nobel's death anniversary.

The game does not affect Group D as both Germany and the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; have already qualified for next summer's tournament.

The victory for Germany keeps them tied in first position in Group D. Germany finishes off its Euro 2008 qualification games against &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.

&lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; held &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; to a goalless draw in their final match of &lt;a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008"&gt;UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommerzbank%20Arena"&gt;Commerzbank Arena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Frankfurt%20am%20Main"&gt;Frankfurt am Main&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite starting strongly, Wales had few chances on goal with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Fletcher"&gt;Carl Fletcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; sending a shot wide of the post. The best opportunities for Germany came when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Borowski"&gt;Tim Borowski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's attempt hit the post after fourteen minutes and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMario%20Gomez"&gt;Mario Gomez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's header went just wide. However Wales' defence held and the match remained goalless.

The result of this match had no effect on qualification, as the fates of both teams had been sealed beforehand. Germany had already secured qualification from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying%20Group%20D"&gt;Group D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , while Wales could not qualify. Germany finish second in the group, behind the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; who claimed first place after a 2-0 victory in &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;. Wales finished fifth in the group, behind &lt;a href="Slovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; and ahead of Cyprus.

There are at least 60,000 Turkish troops along the Iraq-Turkey border.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) a &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 4.2 &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; with a depth of just under two miles, has struck &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; approximately 3 miles (5 kilometers) northeast of &lt;a href="w%3AWrightwood%2C%20California"&gt;Wrightwood&lt;/a&gt;. The quake was reported at 1:53 a.m. (&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20time%20zone"&gt;pacific time&lt;/a&gt;).

The USGS states that there could be some damage, but that it would likely be "very light," but so far the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Bernardino%20County%20Fire%20Department"&gt;San Bernardino County Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; says that no damage has been reported.

There are no reports of any injuries, but witnesses say that they were awoken from their sleep as far away as Los Angeles.

<h1>Australia Votes 2007: Liberals promise personal income tax cuts</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australia%20Votes%202007%3A%20Liberals%20promise%20personal%20income%20tax%20cuts&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

With the election campaign just beginning, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has promised AU$34 billion in personal income tax cuts over the next three years. That is on top of $31.5 billion announced in May, and $36.7 billion announced in 2006.

The new tax cuts are based on new projections for growth in the Australian economy. The Treasury estimates that the economy will expand by 4.25% in the 12 months to June 2008, up from growth of 3.75% predicted in May.

The Government has challenged the Labor opposition to announce their tax policy immediately. 

"The biggest, boldest tax plan that we've seen in a long time is presented yesterday, it deals with participation, competitiveness, building capacity in the Australian economy, and what does &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; say? Nothing," treasurer &lt;a href="Peter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; said. "He better have an answer today."

Costello described the government tax policy as "very responsible" and said Rudd was a "Nothing Man" because he has not revealed Labor's tax policy.

The Shadow Treasurer, &lt;a href="Wayne%20Swan"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt;, replied "The only responsible course of action here is to study the detail. We've said we'll put out all our policies well before the election and we'll do that".

"But in terms of what the Government's put forward, we will take our time to study the detail. That's the only responsible and reasonable thing to do."

Economists from Access Economics, the ANZ Bank, HSBC and Macquarie Bank noted that the tax cuts will boost demand at a time when the Reserve Bank is trying to slow the economy. The Reserve Bank has been raising interest rates to keep the inflation rate within its target range. Households with substantial mortgages could end up worse off.

Rudd has said the Opposition will reveal its tax policy in its own time - mimicking John Howard's approach when he was Opposition Leader in 1996.

"We're only two days in and we're already fucking tired," says Sune Rose Wagner to as he walks into the dressing room at the &lt;a href="w%3ABowery%20Ballroom"&gt;Bowery Ballroom&lt;/a&gt;. Wagner and &lt;a href="w%3ASharin%20Foo"&gt;Sharin Foo&lt;/a&gt; comprise the Raveonettes, a group made for "nostalgists who long for Everly Brothers 45's and diner jukeboxes, the Raveonettes tweak "American Graffiti"-era rock with fuzzed-out surf-guitar riffs," said ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. They recently left &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20Records"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and signed with &lt;a href="w%3AFierce%20Panda"&gt;Fierce Panda&lt;/a&gt; because they felt constrained by their Columbia contract: "The major label system sometimes doesn't allow for outside "help" to get involved, meaning that we don't get to choose who we wanna work with. That can be a pretty terrible thing and bad things will surely come of it," said the band on their &lt;a href="MySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; site. Originally from &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, both musicians live in the United States now.

Their first &lt;a href="w%3AEP"&gt;EP&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChain%20Gang%20of%20Love"&gt;Chain Gang of Love&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, was a critical and commercial success. "Few albums provoke such amazing imagery," said the BBC. "♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APretty%20in%20Black"&gt;Pretty in Black&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is virtually fuzz-free," said ♡❤Rolling Stone♡❤ of their next album, "highlighting the exquisite detail in the Raveonettes' gift for pastiche: the prowling, garage-surf guitars in ♡❤Love in a Trashcan♡❤; the ghost dance of ♡❤Red Tan,♡❤ wrapped in Phil Spector-style sleigh bells." Of their current album, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALust%20Lust%20Lust"&gt;Lust Lust Lust&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, set to be released on November 5th (although Amazon says March 4, 2008), Sune told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANME"&gt;NME&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that, "There are a lot of songs that deal with desire, restlessness and the tough choices you have to make sometimes." Fans can hear some of the new material at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.myspace.com/theraveonettes"&gt;MySpace.com/TheRaveonettes&lt;/a&gt;.

Below is ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter David Shankbone's interview with Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo.

<h2>On influences</h2>

♡❤♡: No, I drank so much &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20tea"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt; today I am worried I am going to need to pee throughout the interview.

♡❤♡DS: ♡❤I♡❤ used to. How is the tour going?

♡❤♡DS: You guys played in Southpaw right; how was that?

♡❤♡DS: This interview may be something different than you guys are used to, because although the questions will be about your music, they will be more about the both of you. They are surveys of the landscape. For instance, in the last week I have interviews the proprietors and mistresses of an S&amp;M dungeon; Evangelical Christian Presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Brownback%20on%20running%20for%20President%2C%20gay%20rights%2C%20the%20Middle%20East%20and%20religion"&gt;Sam Brownback&lt;/a&gt;, the President of the ACLU, &lt;a href="w%3AAugusten%20Burroughs%20on%20addiction%2C%20writing%2C%20his%20family%20and%20his%20new%20book"&gt;Augusten Burroughs&lt;/a&gt;, and the High Priest of the Church of Satan, and now you.

♡❤♡DS: A lot of the questions might be a little different than what you are typically used to; maybe that will make it more interesting for you, or less pleasant. One of the first questions I like to ask musicians is about the challenge to be innovative when so much has already been done. How do you not let that affect your output? 

♡❤♡DS: Was that your &lt;a href="w%3ADogme95"&gt;Dogme&lt;/a&gt; influence?

♡❤♡DS: You embrace it.

♡❤♡DS: It's too self-aware?

♡❤♡DS: Since you are so upfront about your influences, you do still have unique sound. Do the constant comparison in the music media grow tiresome?

♡❤♡DS: Did you guys follow the &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Spector"&gt;Phil Spector&lt;/a&gt; trial?

♡❤♡DS: Knowing &lt;a href="w%3ARonnie%20Spector"&gt;Ronnie Spector&lt;/a&gt; it must have been an interesting perspective to see it from.

♡❤♡DS: Dogme influenced you guys early on, does it still?

♡❤♡DS: Are you more inspired by things in nature or man made things?

♡❤♡DS: Sure; made by man.

♡❤♡DS: It's an open question.

♡❤♡DS: Like cities vs. mountains.

<h2>On America</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Sune, you went through a period where you got really tired of LA and New York and traveled around the United States. What did you find when you traveled across the country?

♡❤♡DS: How did you react to that?

♡❤♡DS: Did you find the &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20states"&gt;blue states more hospitable than the reds states&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think the religion adds an element of beauty or a fearful element to the culture?

♡❤♡DS: The kind practiced here, the kind of &lt;a href="w%3AChristianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; found here. 

♡❤♡DS: They just aren't in &lt;a href="w%3AMadrassah"&gt;madrassahs&lt;/a&gt;...

<h2>On death</h2>
♡❤♡DS: If you could choose your own &lt;a href="w%3ADeath"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, how would you die?

♡❤♡DS: You wouldn't want to experience it?

♡❤♡DS: What is fearful about it?

♡❤♡DS: Especially at a young age, but if you are creative and have an imagination, it makes it that much scarier.

♡❤♡DS: Sharin, did you ever have a moment where you confronted your own death?

♡❤♡DS: What was it?

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Laughs♡❤] That would have made a great end to the interview! 

♡❤♡DS: What's your favorite curse word?
<h2>On war</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What do you think is the greatest depth of human misery?

♡❤♡DS: Famine?

♡❤♡DS: Starving to death?

♡❤♡DS: Slow.

♡❤♡DS: And seemingly so few people are paying attention.

♡❤♡DS: Has the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; affected either of you as artists at all?

♡❤♡DS: How about as people?

♡❤♡DS: How so?

♡❤♡DS: Why do you have such a particular interest in Chechnya?

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3ABeslan"&gt;Beslan&lt;/a&gt; was it?

♡❤♡DS: But it was ideology and not oil...

♡❤♡DS: Why do you think it's not talked about?
♡❤♡DS: You're forced to choose between having either &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; blown off the face of the Earth, and if you don't choose, they both go. They are equal in population according to the 2000 census in each country, with each having roughly 1.2 billion people. Which do you choose, and why? 

♡❤♡DS: You would go with China too, then?

♡❤♡DS: Really? They'll all go?

<h2>On love</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Sharin, you have a choice between either dating a man who is losing it hair and he tries to style the remaining hair artistically to cover it up, or you have a choice of dating a man with &lt;a href="w%3AGynecomastia"&gt;man boobs&lt;/a&gt;--

♡❤♡DS: Breasts

♡❤♡DS: Who would you go for more?

♡❤♡DS: Isn't every question?

♡❤♡DS: You'd go for the hair?

♡❤♡DS: You'd go for the man boobs?

♡❤♡DS: Like a masectomy bra?

♡❤♡DS: Oh! He went through an operation?

♡❤♡DS: When I was in college I had a couple of friends who were rave kids--they also went to my college--and the guy walked around with very large breasts, and our friend Koo would follow him on the street and after he passed people who noticed his large breasts she would go up and say, "Would you let that man babysit your children?" to see the reactions from people. "Do you trust him?" It was surprising, because the people who looked the most uptight generally responded with things like, "Yeah, sure, he doesn't seem so bad." But the people who looked the most &lt;a href="w%3AHippie"&gt;hippie&lt;/a&gt; and free--this was in Boulder--would say things, "I don't know! What's wrong with him, why does he have breasts?"

♡❤♡DS: What would bother you more in bed, somebody who is overly &lt;a href="w%3AFlatulence"&gt;flatulent&lt;/a&gt;, or somebody who speaks in a little baby voice?

♡❤♡DS: The baby voice?

♡❤♡DS: Creep you out a bit?
♡❤♡DS: Sharin do you find it difficult dating?

♡❤♡DS: How do you try to circumvent those problems?

<h2>On themselves</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What traits do you deplore in other people?

♡❤♡DS: Any certain type of ignorance?

♡❤♡DS: Which traits do you deplore in yourselves?

♡❤♡DS: Are you really all those things?

♡❤♡DS: And you deplore that about yourself?

♡❤♡DS: Do you do anything to get over those things?

♡❤♡DS: But I've read interviews with you where you talk about the wild party scene in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;...

♡❤♡DS: Yeah, in preparation for this I read where you talked about that in an interview...

♡❤♡DS: Is that the trait that you deplore in him?

♡❤♡DS: Is there a trait that you deplore in Sharin?

♡❤♡DS: Are you late a lot?

♡❤♡DS: What do you most value in your friends?

♡❤♡DS: Do you keep a large circle of friends or do you tend to keep it close?

♡❤♡DS: How many friends do you have that if you were to self-destruct, they would be there for you?

♡❤♡DS: Close friends like I asked you about?

♡❤♡DS: I keep it pretty close or I find it too overwhelming because I am always working on projects and I need to concentrate. But in terms of self destruct? If I was to self destruct I would say four people that would be there.

♡❤♡DS: No, I didn't, either. How about you? If you self-destructed how many people could you count on to stay by you?

♡❤♡DS: Did you include Sune in your count?

♡❤♡DS: As your fame has increased, have you found it more difficult to trust people?

<h2>On touring</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you guys see an end to the band, a day when you can see yourselves feeling done with it?

♡❤♡DS: You couldn't imagine being &lt;a href="w%3A867-5309/Jenny"&gt;867-5309&lt;/a&gt; guy?

♡❤♡DS: Are there venues that you guys haven't played that is your dream venue?

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Laughs♡❤] You made it!

♡❤♡DS: Do you have a venue, Sharin?

♡❤♡DS: Are there any bands you guys would love to play with?

♡❤♡DS: Why?

♡❤♡DS: Are you more worried about him being intimidating or disappointing?

<h2>On metaphysics</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you believe in a &lt;a href="w%3AHigher%20power"&gt;higher power&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: Do you really?

♡❤♡DS: How do you think that is possible?

♡❤♡DS: Not including any time in the &lt;a href="w%3A20th%20Century"&gt;20th Century&lt;/a&gt;, what time would you go back to?

♡❤♡DS: Can you go ahead in your time machine?

♡❤♡DS: What if you walked out and it was ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APlanet%20of%20the%20Apes"&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤?

♡❤♡DS: What if you could only use it one time, and once you are there, you're stuck, would you go ahead in time?

♡❤♡DS: Really? That's a big ambition there with your time machine.

The first &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;A380 superjumbo&lt;/a&gt;, made by &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, was delivered today to &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Airlines"&gt;Singapore Airlines&lt;/a&gt; (SIA) 18 months behind schedule.

After the plane was delivered in &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, it was flown to Toulouse, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; for the ceremony of about 500 guests.

The plane is built with four &lt;a href="w%3ARolls-Royce%20plc"&gt;Rolls-Royce&lt;/a&gt; Trent 900 engines.

The first flight will take off for a "special charity-flight" from Singapore and land in Sydney on October 25. Special services will continue from October 28.

"This is a major milestone for the A380 programme, and I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all parties concerned. I want to thank our teams and all those who worked hard, days, nights, and week-ends, for their dedication and commitment," said Airbus President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Enders.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aexecution"&gt;execution&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href="w%3Aprisoner"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; was suspended just 90 minutes before the execution was to be carried out due to arguments from &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20rights"&gt;civil rights&lt;/a&gt; activists who believe that the state should wait until the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; determines the &lt;a href="w%3Aconstitutionality"&gt;constitutionality&lt;/a&gt; of death by&lt;a href="w%3Alethal%20injection"&gt;lethal injection&lt;/a&gt;.

34-year-old William Castillo was sentenced to death after beating 86-year-old Isabel Brendt to death in 1995. He was convicted of murdering the retired Las Vegas schoolteacher in 1996.

Mr. Castillo was due to be executed at 8:30 p.m. PDT (0330 GMT) but was granted a reprieve after an 11th hour appeal by the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ANevada%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Nevada Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;.

Castillo chose not to file any &lt;a href="w%3Aappeals"&gt;appeals&lt;/a&gt; on his own behalf and prison officials say that he was prepared for death. The ACLU of Nevada had appealed to halt all executions in the state.

An overwhelming legal uproar over death by lethal injection has compelled the U.S. Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of a method of execution for the first time since 1878, while also halting &lt;a href="w%3Acapital%20punishment"&gt;capital punishment&lt;/a&gt; throughout the country. 

Almost all of the 38 states which employ the death penalty rely on the same three-drug combination to execute inmates, including Nevada. In &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, opposition to lethal injection has halted executions for nearly two years. The U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision to determine the constitutionality of &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky's&lt;/a&gt; lethal injection procedure has ensured a near-abeyance on executions until the justices make their ruling next year.

Howard Skolnik, the &lt;a href="w%3ANevada%20Corrections"&gt;Nevada Corrections&lt;/a&gt; Director, said Castillo was disappointed when he told him about the delay.

"He asked if it would be possible to get a little more medication to calm him down and take the edge off," the director said.

When speaking of the two members of Brendt's family hoping to witness the execution, Skolnik said "They were hoping for some kind of closure today which they did not get."

One of the ACLU &lt;a href="w%3Alawyers"&gt;lawyers&lt;/a&gt; who pleaded the case Monday in front of the Supreme Court supported the decision, which had been signed by all seven &lt;a href="w%3Ajustices"&gt;justices&lt;/a&gt;.

"Clearly, this was the right thing to do, &lt;a href="w%3Alegally"&gt;legally&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Amorally"&gt;morally&lt;/a&gt;," Lee Rowland said. She added "...We are heartened that this decision will bring Nevada in line with the rest of the country, which has decided to await guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court."

<h1>China 'furious' at U.S. over Dalai Lama award</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=China%20%27furious%27%20at%20U.S.%20over%20Dalai%20Lama%20award&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Chinese Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;'s 17th National Congress gave cause for party officials to condemn a planned awards ceremony for the &lt;a href="Dalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;, who is to receive the &lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Gold%20Medal"&gt;Congressional Gold Medal&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. President Bush receives him at the White House today. "We are furious," &lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;'s Communist Party boss, &lt;a href="w%3AZhang%20Qingli"&gt;Zhang Qingli&lt;/a&gt;, told reporters during the congress. "If the Dalai Lama can receive such an award, there must be no justice or good people in the world." 

In 1950, the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;People's Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; invaded Tibet and continues to occupy the territory. In January 2007 the Dalai Lama, in an interview on a private television channel, said "What we demand from the &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; authority is more autonomy for Tibetans to protect their culture." He added that he had told the Tibetan people not to think in terms of history and to accept Tibet as a part of China.

"The presence of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; president at this congressional ceremony for the Dalai Lama greatly offends China," Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said.

China's foreign minister, &lt;a href="w%3AYang%20Jiechi"&gt;Yang Jiechi&lt;/a&gt;, said Bush should not attend. "We solemnly demand that the US cancel the extremely wrong arrangements," Mr Yang told reporters in Beijing.

Bush told &lt;a href="w%3AHu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese president, that he planned to attend the ceremony when they met in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in August. He made an overture to Jintao to assuage any perceived snub by saying he would attend the &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing%20Olympics"&gt;Beijing Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in 2008.

"We understand the concerns of the Chinese," White House deputy press secretary &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Fratto"&gt;Tony Fratto&lt;/a&gt; said. "This is a meeting with a spiritual leader. It is not a meeting with a head of state."

<h2>Oil prices at new high on fears of Turkish attack in Iraq</h2>
Crude oil has risen to an all-time high during trading in Asia to close at US$86.13 a barrel, up $2.44. In the U.S., crude stock futures were nearing $90.00 a barrel.

The spike is being blamed on fears that Turkey will launch an attack on Iraqi Kurdish Militants of the Kurdistan Workers Party after they killed 13 Turkish soldiers on October 7. On Monday, the Turkish military asked Parliament for permission to lead a mission into Iraq to hunt down militants.

There are at least 60,000 Turkish troops along the Iraq-Turkey border.

<h2>China 'furious' at U.S. over Dalai Lama award</h2>
The Chinese Communist Party is furious over an awards ceremony for the Dalai Lama, who is to receive the Congressional Gold Medal today. President Bush received him at the White House on Tuesday. 

In 1950, the People's Liberation Army invaded Tibet and continues to occupy the territory. However in a January 2007 television interview, the Dalai Lama demanded more autonomy for the Tibetan people but added that they should accept Tibet as a part of China.

<h2>Nevada man's execution halted at 11th hour</h2>
In the U.S. on Tuesday, the execution of a prisoner in Nevada was suspended just 90 minutes before the execution was to be carried out due to arguments from civil rights activists who believe that the state should wait until the U.S. Supreme Court determines the constitutionality of death by lethal injection.

34-year-old William Castillo was sentenced to death after beating 86-year-old Isabel Brendt to death in 1995. He was convicted of murdering the retired Las Vegas schoolteacher in 1996.

An overwhelming legal uproar over death by lethal injection has compelled the U.S. Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of a method of execution for the first time since 1878, while also halting capital punishment throughout the country.

<h2>Putin promises to complete Iran's nuclear reactor</h2>
Russian President Vladimir Putin has assured Iran that Moscow would not back out of a 1 billion U.S. dollar contract to complete a nuclear power plant in the Iranian port of Bushehr. Putin's remarks followed talks with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at a summit of Caspian Sea nations in Tehran. 

The United States and other Western nations oppose the construction of the reactor, and believe that it is part of an effort by Iran to develop nuclear weapons.

<h2>Australia Votes 2007: Liberals promise personal income tax cuts</h2>
With the election campaign just beginning, Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has promised $34 billion in personal income tax cuts over the next three years. That is on top of $31.5 billion announced in May, and $36.7 billion announced in 2006.

The new tax cuts are based on new projections for growth in the Australian economy. The Treasury now estimates that the economy will expand by 4.25% in the 12 months to June 2008, up from growth of 3.75% predicted in May.

The Government has challenged the Labor opposition to announce their tax policy immediately. Australian economists underlined that the tax cuts will boost demand at a time when the Reserve Bank is trying to slow the economy.

<h2>Studies: raw fish risky</h2>
Studies presented at the 72nd Annual Meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology show that eating raw or undercooked fish, such as sushi or sashimi, can lead to severe intestinal problems caused by parasitic roundworms called anisakis. Symptoms of the infestation include sudden abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and can be severe enough to warrant a visit to the emergency room.

It was a milestone in aviation history: the first &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;Airbus A380&lt;/a&gt; landed at &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Changi%20Airport"&gt;Changi International Airport&lt;/a&gt; at 6:40 p.m. (GMT+8) after a 12-hour flight from Airbus' Delivery Center. The aircraft was greeted by some 400 guests, including the Prime Minister of Singapore, &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Hsien%20Loong"&gt;Mr. Lee Hsien Loong&lt;/a&gt;, at the soon-to-open Terminal 3 of Changi International Airport.

In his speech, the Prime Minister applauded &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Airlines"&gt;Singapore Airlines&lt;/a&gt; (SIA) - the recipient carrier - and cited its success as a source of pride for all Singaporeans. He also said that the landing was a milestone not only for SIA, but also for Changi International Airport, the country's main airport. All existing terminals are currently A380-ready, and the SGD1.75-billion Terminal 3 will open its doors in January next year.

The A380 will make a special charity flight on October 25 from Singapore to &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and will begin regular service on the Singapore-Sydney route on October 28.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVernon%20Bellecourt"&gt;Vernon Bellecourt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , once the primary spokesperson for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Indian%20Movement"&gt;American Indian Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , died recently at age 75. Bellecourt, an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOjibwa"&gt;Ojibwa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who fought for Native rights, was perhaps best known for his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANative%20American%20mascot%20controversy"&gt;opposition to Native names and mascots for sports teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

First in the headlines in 1972, Bellecourt organized a cross-country caravan of the Movement, to Washington. Once there, members of the group occupied the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs"&gt;Bureau of Indian Affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; offices. His goal of international recognition for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAboriginal"&gt;Aboriginal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; nations and their treaties found him meeting with figures like &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;n Colonel &lt;a href="Muammar%20el-Qaddafi"&gt;Muammar el-Qaddafi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYasir%20Arafat"&gt;Yasir Arafat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In 1977 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeonard%20Peltier"&gt;Leonard Peltier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive life terms for the murder of two FBI Agents during a 1975 shoot-out on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation; Bellecourt led the campaign to free him.

Most recently, he visited &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;, to discuss getting free or cheap heating oil for reservations.

His work as president of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Coalition%20on%20Racism%20in%20Sports%20and%20Media"&gt;National Coalition on Racism in Sports and Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; made a much wider known mark, though. Bellecourt emphasized that he believed such names perpetuated racial stereotypes, clouding the real identities and problems facing natives.

Teams with native-related names could almost guarantee on Bellecourt showing up at major games. He twice burned an effigy of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Wahoo"&gt;Chief Wahoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Indians"&gt;Cleveland Indians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; baseball team mascot, and both times was arrested. When the Washington Redskins of the &lt;a href="National%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; made the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl"&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Vernon was there to protest. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Commission%20on%20Civil%20Rights"&gt;United States Commission on Civil Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was critical of such names by 2001, calling them "insensitive in light of the long history of forced assimilation". Some newspapers have stopped using the names of teams with Native origins.

None of his "big four" targets have shown any indication of changing: the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Redskins"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20City%20Chiefs"&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Cleveland Indians or the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Braves"&gt;Atlanta Braves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Post-season use of American Indian mascots were banned by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association"&gt;National Collegiate Athletic Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2005, suggesting the names are "hostile or abusive". Bellecourt was pleased with the NCAA sanctions, but suggested such actions were only going "half way".

The Florida State Seminole and the Illinois Illini were among the 18 colleges affected by the ban. Florida president T.K. Wetherell threatened legal action in response. The &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeminole"&gt;Seminole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tribes have endorsed the University's usage of the name, but some out-of-state tribes were "not supportive", according to the NCAA vice president for diversity and inclusion.

Born WaBun-Inini, Bellecourt died from complications of pneumonia on October 13, in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;'s qualification for &lt;a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008"&gt;UEFA Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; is in doubt after a 2-1 defeat to &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Pavlyuchenko"&gt;Roman Pavlyuchenko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored two goals in the second half today, although both sides had their chances.

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; had a penalty appeal turned down by the &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; referee after eleven minutes, while Konstantin Zyrianov saw his drive pushed onto the goalposts by England's goalkeeper Paul Robinson. Needing to win on an artificial pitch in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; to be certain of qualification, England took the lead after 29 minutes when &lt;a href="Wayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt; opened the scoring with a volley.

Both Steven Gerrard and Micah Richards missed chances to seal victory for England, and Russia equalised with a Roman Pavlyuchenko penalty after Wayne Rooney brought down Konstantin Zyrianov. England manager Steve McClaren said the penalty shot was a 'disgraceful' decision, as the offence appeared to have happened just outside the penalty area. Pavlyuchenko scored Russia's winner just four minutes later.

England have one match remaining against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying%20Group%20E"&gt;Group E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leaders &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; on November 21, but the defeat to Russia means that other results must go their way if they are to qualify for next year's tournament in &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. Russia will qualify ahead of England if they defeat both &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Andorra"&gt;Andorra&lt;/a&gt; in their final two matches.

Under fire for illegal political and financial wrongdoing, &lt;a href="Oral%20Roberts%20University"&gt;Oral Roberts University&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Roberts%20%28evangelist%29"&gt;Richard Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stepped down from his position and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABilly%20Joe%20Daugherty"&gt;Billy Joe Daugherty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was named acting-president. Richard and his wife, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALindsay%20Roberts"&gt;Lindsay Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , are also members of the ORU Board of Regents, and it is not mentioned if Richard and/or Lindsay stepped down from the board. 

On October 12 the plaintiffs of the original lawsuit amended it adding the university's Board of Regents, which includes &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Pearsons"&gt;George Pearsons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKenneth%20Copeland"&gt;Kenneth Copeland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACreflo%20Dollar"&gt;Creflo Dollar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20A.%20Hammer"&gt;Michael A. Hammer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hagee"&gt;John Hagee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarilyn%20Hickey"&gt;Marilyn Hickey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts"&gt;Oral Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Lindsay Roberts, Richard Roberts, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Savelle"&gt;Jerry Savelle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Watson"&gt;Charles Watson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the suit. ORU Board member Kenneth Copeland was Oral Roberts airplane pilot in the 1960s, and current Board chairman, George Pearsons, is married to Copeland's oldest daughter.

The plaintiffs cited that three days after the original lawsuit was filed, Roberts fired the university's financial comptroller (who had been employed by ORU for 26 years) and "witnesses have reported voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoilation of evidence." The lawsuit argued that the Regents were a party to the suit due to negligence in failing to handle the issue as well as allowed a convicted child molester "mentor" students.

Also ORU recently admitted to the press that the IRS had warned ORU against the illegal nature of ORU's political activity. That political campaign is what the plaintiffs alleged caused the wrongful dismissal of Tim Brooker. While the university declined to offer the IRS' letters, a spokes-person confirmed the IRS sent two letters in 2006 about the political involvement.

&lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; were defeated 2-0 by &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying%20Group%20B"&gt;Group B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="%3AUEFA%20Euro%202008"&gt;:UEFA Euro 2008&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying"&gt;qualifying&lt;/a&gt;.

Seventeen-year-old &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALevan%20Mchedlidze"&gt;Levan Mchedlidze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in his second match for Georgia, gave the home side the lead after 16 minutes with a header. Scotland could not convert any of their opportunities, and Georgia sealed the victory in the 64th minute with a goal from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Siradze"&gt;David Siradze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Georgia are already eliminated from qualification and lie sixth in Group B. Scotland are second in the group, behind France and one point ahead of world champions Italy. However &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; have a game in hand over Scotland, who may need to beat Italy in their final match to qualify.

&lt;a href="w%3Amethicillin-resistant%20staphylococcus%20aureus"&gt;Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus&lt;/a&gt; (MRSA), a drug-resistant strain of bacteria, killed nearly 19,000 Americans in 2005 alone, according to a new study in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJournal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. That is more people than were killed by &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. More than 94,000 Americans were afflicted with MRSA infections in 2005. 

Although the &lt;a href="w%3ASupergerm"&gt;supergerm&lt;/a&gt;, or superbug, is primarily found in hospitals, a growing number of cases have been contracted at public gyms and schools. In &lt;a href="w%3AMoneta%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Moneta, Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, a high school senior died from an infection that spread to his kidney, liver, lungs and heart. In &lt;a href="w%3ABedford%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Bedford County&lt;/a&gt;, where Moneta is located, school officials have reported five cases of the &lt;a href="w%3AMethicillin"&gt;Methicillin&lt;/a&gt;-resistant strain of the &lt;a href="w%3AStaphylococcus%20aureus"&gt;Staph&lt;/a&gt; bacteria. County officials closed the schools to clean them.

"Certainly, MRSA now has to be viewed as a very important target for prevention and control," said Dr. David A. Talan, an &lt;a href="w%3AInfectious%20diseases"&gt;infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; specialist at &lt;a href="w%3AOlive%20View%E2%80%93UCLA%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Olive View-UCLA Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="Dalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt; spoke today as he accepted the &lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Gold%20Medal"&gt;Congressional Gold Medal&lt;/a&gt; in front of the World's leaders and press. After spending some time fixing his formal robes he explained how despite learning English from 1947 he still felt like he was at kindergarten level but would not speak in &lt;a href="w%3ATibetan%20language"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt; as it would be long and boring.

The Dalai Lama called it a great honour to receive the medal and that it would bring joy and encouragement to the &lt;a href="w%3ATibetan%20people"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt; people. He accepted responsibility for his people and spoke about how he was always thinking of them and looking after their welfare. The medal would be a powerful symbol to promote peace.

He was personally touched that a monk from such humble beginnings should be awarded this honour and he regretted the tension it was causing between the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

After saying that both China and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; were deserving of a role in the world's arena he went on to give more specifics on his stance with China. He claimed China would need more transparency, rule of law and more freedom of information. He showed concern at how the Chinese government would manage to integrate such a wide range of cultures without losing their diversity and was worried about Tibetans becoming a minority in &lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;.

Then he explained the future was not an independent Tibet but for an autonomous state as China could offer many economic benefits. He reiterated past comments of wanting no future political role in an independent Tibet and that he had no hidden agenda.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apreservationist"&gt;preservationists&lt;/a&gt; breathed a sigh of relief in August as the &lt;a href="w%3AFarnsworth%20House"&gt;Farnsworth House&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ALudwig%20Mies%20van%20der%20Rohe"&gt;Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&lt;/a&gt; designed house widely considered a masterpiece of modern architecture, was spared by flooding along the Fox River in Plano.

Storms deluged much of the &lt;a href="w%3AMidwestern%20United%20States"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt;, causing rivers throughout the region to overflow their banks. At the &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20River%20%28Illinois%29"&gt;Fox River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APlano%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Plano&lt;/a&gt; flood waters spilled over four acres of the 58-acre Farnsworth House site. Waters continued to rise through August 24, until they were just 18 inches from the front door.

According to the reporting of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Tribune"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ preservationists developed a disaster management plan on the spot. Staff used boats to access the house and once inside raised the vulnerable furnishings to higher levels atop crates.

Flooding along the &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20River%20%28Illinois%20River%20tributary%29"&gt;Fox River&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 caused a large plate glass window in the steel and glass home to break, resulting in $250,000 damage and preservationists feared a repeat of that incident.

"We really lucked out and can look at this as a drill," Barbara Campagna, architect for &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20National%20Trust%20for%20Historic%20Preservation"&gt;National National Trust for Historic Preservation&lt;/a&gt;, told ♡❤Preservation Online♡❤.

The Farnsworth House was completed in 1951 and designed by internationally famous architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for Chicago doctor Edith Farnsworth. The house is a &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Historic%20Landmark"&gt;National Historic Landmark&lt;/a&gt; and a nationally significant example of &lt;a href="w%3Amodern%20architecture"&gt;modern architecture&lt;/a&gt;. As one of the most famous examples of such architecture, the Farnsworth House was unprecedented at the time of its completion.

On Wednesday, &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20National%20Assembly%20of%20Turkey"&gt;Grand National Assembly&lt;/a&gt; voted 507-19 to authorize sending troops into northern &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; to pursue &lt;a href="w%3AKurd"&gt;Kurd&lt;/a&gt;ish rebels. Although the authorization is valid for one year, Turkish officials made clear that it would not necessarily result in military action. Both the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and Iraq have recently warned Turkey against such an incursion. 

Turkish Prime Minister &lt;a href="Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&lt;/a&gt; said that although the motion does not indicate that a military operation is imminent, it is necessary for Turkey to be able to respond to bomb attacks which have been blamed on &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Workers%20Party"&gt;Kurdistan Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; (PKK) rebels in Iraq. Turkey has been asking for help in dealing with the PKK for months, and the Turkish public has grown frustrated with America's perceived lack of action on the issue. 

Both the United States and Iraq have recently warned Turkey against an incursion into Iraq. "The Iraqi government calls on the Turkish government to pursue a diplomatic solution and not a military solution to solve the [problem] of terrorist attacks which our dear neighbor Turkey has witnessed from the PKK," Iraq government spokesperson Ali al-Dabbagh said earlier this week. White House National Security Council spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Johndroe"&gt;Gordon Johndroe&lt;/a&gt; called on Turkey "to continue their discussions with us and the Iraqis and to show restraint from any potentially destabilizing actions." 

Responding to the motion, U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; urged Turkey not to carry out an attack, saying "[we are] making it clear to Turkey it is not in their interest to send more troops in... there is a better way to deal with the issue."

&lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href="w%3ABashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt; defended Turkey's decision and criticized the U.S. position, saying "It is important to note that the powers that have invaded Iraq are those primarily responsible for the terror activities and attacks because they control the country." "We certainly support and back the decisions by the Turkish government in combat against terror and terror activities," he said.

Murat Karayilan, the leader of the armed wing of the PKK, warned Turkey of the consequences of an attack in an interview with The Times. "If the Turkish Army attacks Iraqi Kurdistan we will struggle and resist against this until the end," he said. Karayilan nevertheless said he hoped that the crisis could be resolved peacefully but continues attacks on Turkish soldiers, killing 12 in an ambush yesterday.

U.S.-Turkish relations have been strained recently after a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; resolution passed committee, labeling the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20I"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; era &lt;a href="w%3AArmenian%20Genocide"&gt;killings of up to 1.5 million Armenians&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3AOttoman%20Empire"&gt;Ottoman Empire&lt;/a&gt; as "genocide". Turkey strongly disputes these claims. &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Majority Leader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; says the US House of Representatives will vote on the resolution "soon."

President Bush criticized the resolution at a press conference on Wednesday, saying "One thing Congress should not be doing is sorting out the historical record of the Ottoman Empire."

<h2>'Large-scale attack' against ex-Prime Minister Bhutto leaves more than 100 dead in Pakistan</h2>
Former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was the target of a bombing which has killed at least a hundred people, including police within her motorcade. Bhutto was apparently not harmed in the attack.

Bhutto's arrival in the country, breaking eight years of self-imposed exile, was met by more than 20,000 police and military troops. Security was tight, after a warning that al-Qaeda militants could attempt to assassinate the former leader, who is disliked by many traditionalist Pakistanis who consider her rule to have brought the country too close to the United States.

<h2>Turkish Parliament approves military action in Iraq</h2>
On Wednesday, Turkey's Grand National Assembly voted 507-19 to authorize sending troops into northern Iraq to pursue Kurdish rebels. Although the authorization is valid for one year, Turkish officials made clear that it would not necessarily result in military action. Both the United States and Iraq have recently warned Turkey against such an incursion.

<h2>Brownback to drop out of Presidential race on Friday, says AP</h2>
The Associated Press is reporting that Kansas Senator Sam Brownback is expected to drop out of the Presidential race on Friday in a speech scheduled in Topeka, Kansas. "I know Senator Brownback enjoyed campaigning and meeting new people in talking about ideas for the future of America, but I think it came down to money," an anonymous source told AP. "It's just time," said a source to Reuters. "He is not going to endorse anyone else right away."

In an interview with Wikinews, Brownback confirmed money was an issue. He reported raising only $800,000 in the third quarter of this year, his lowest since entering the race. 

<h2>First A380 enters commercial service</h2>
It was a milestone in aviation history: the first Airbus A380 landed at Singapore's Changi International Airport at 6:40PM (GMT+8) on Wednesday after a 12-hour flight from Airbus' Delivery Center. The aircraft was greeted by some 400 guests, including the Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong, at the soon-to-open Terminal 3 of Changi International Airport.

<h2>American Indian Movement spokesperson dies, age 75</h2>
Vernon Bellecourt, once the primary spokesperson for the American Indian Movement, died recently at age 75. Bellecourt, an Ojibwa who fought for Native rights, was perhaps best known for his opposition to Native names and mascots for sports teams.

<h2>Satirist Stephen Colbert runs for U.S. President</h2>
The American satirist Stephen Colbert has announced that he will run for the Presidency of the United States. He made his announcement on his mock news show The Colbert Report.

However, Colbert said that he would only run in his home state of South Carolina as a favorite son. He also said that he would represent both major political parties: the Republicans and the Democrats. It is not known how far Colbert will go with his character during his electoral run.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;♡❤Associated Press♡❤&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that Republican &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Brownback"&gt;Sam Brownback&lt;/a&gt; is expected to drop out of the presidential race on Friday in a speech scheduled in &lt;a href="w%3ATopeka%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Topeka, Kansas&lt;/a&gt;.

He reported raising only &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$800,000 in the third quarter of this year, his lowest since entering the race. Brownback said he was baffled by how poorly candidates appealing to the Christian right were doing in the Republican party primaries. "Why we haven't gotten more traction," Brownback said, "I don't know." Originally Brownback said that he would pull out if he did not finish better than fourth in the &lt;a href="w%3AIowa%20caucus"&gt;Iowa caucus&lt;/a&gt;; ♡❤AP's♡❤ report anticipates a sooner-than-expected announcement. 

"That a guy can grow up on a farm in Eastern Kansas and run for President of the United States," Brownback reflected, "I love a country like that."

For the first time in 14 years, an &lt;a href="w%3AAvro%20Vulcan"&gt;Avro Vulcan&lt;/a&gt; heavy bomber has taken to the skies over &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The newly-restored aircraft took off from &lt;a href="w%3ABruntingthorpe%20Aerodrome"&gt;Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALeicestershire"&gt;Leicestershire&lt;/a&gt;. 

The craft flew for about 25 minutes in the first of three planned test flights from Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome, meant to prove that the craft is officially "airworthy", the only Vulcan to hold such a distinction. It has taken £6 million to return the aircraft to service.

The aircraft, XH558, bombed the &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentinian&lt;/a&gt;-held &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Stanley"&gt;Port Stanley&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AFalkand%20Islands"&gt;Falkand Islands&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="w%3AFalklands%20War"&gt;1982 conflict&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ATorture%20and%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Torture proliferates American headlines&lt;/a&gt; today: &lt;a href="w%3AEthical%20arguments%20regarding%20torture"&gt;whether its use is defensible&lt;/a&gt; in certain contexts and the morality of the practice. ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter was curious about torture in American popular culture. This is the first of a two part series examining the BDSM business. This interview focuses on the owners of a dungeon, what they charge, what the clients are like and how they handle their needs.

When Shankbone rings the bell of "HC &amp; Co." he has no idea what to expect. A &lt;a href="w%3ABDSM"&gt;BDSM&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤♡B♡❤♡ondage ♡❤♡D♡❤♡iscipline ♡❤♡S♡❤♡adism ♡❤♡M♡❤♡asochism) dungeon is a legal enterprise in New York City, and there are more than a few businesses that cater to a clientèle that wants an &lt;a href="w%3Aenema"&gt;enema&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AErotic%20spanking"&gt;spanking&lt;/a&gt;, to be &lt;a href="w%3AParaphilic%20infantilism"&gt;dressed like a baby&lt;/a&gt; or to &lt;a href="w%3ACross%20dressing"&gt;wear women's clothing&lt;/a&gt;. Shankbone went to find out what these businesses are like, who runs them, who works at them, and who frequents them. He spent three hours one night in what is considered one of the more upscale establishments in Manhattan, Rebecca's Hidden Chamber, where according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Village%20Voice"&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "you can take your girlfriend or wife, and have them treated with respect—unless they hope to be treated with something other than respect!" 

When Shankbone arrived on the sixth floor of a midtown office building, the elevator opened up to a hallway where a smiling Rebecca greeted him. She is a beautiful forty-ish &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Long Island&lt;/a&gt; mother of three who is dressed in smart black pants and a black turtleneck that reaches up to her blond-streaked hair pulled back in a bushy ponytail. "Are you David Shankbone? We're so excited to meet you!" she says, and leads him down the hall to a living room area with a sofa, a television playing an action-thriller, an open supply cabinet stocked with enema kits, and her husband Bill sitting at the computer trying to find where the re-release of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABlade%20Runner"&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is playing at the local theater. "I don't like that movie," says Rebecca.

Perhaps the most poignant moment came at the end of the night when Shankbone was waiting to be escorted out (to avoid running into a client). Rebecca came into the room and sat on the sofa. "You know, a lot of people out there would like to see me burn for what I do," she says. Rebecca is a woman who has faced challenges in her life, and dealt with them the best she could given her circumstances. She sees herself as providing a service to people who have needs, no matter how debauched the outside world deems them. They sat talking mutual challenges they have faced and politics (she's supporting &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary&lt;/a&gt;); Rebecca reflected upon the irony that many of the people who supported the torture at &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt; would want her closed down. It was in this conversation that Shankbone saw that humanity can be found anywhere, including in places that appear on the surface to cater to the inhumanity some people in our society feel towards themselves, or others. 

"The best way to describe it," says Bill, "is if you had a kink, and you had a wife and you had two kids, and every time you had sex with your wife it just didn't hit the nail on the head. What would you do about it? How would you handle it? You might go through life feeling unfulfilled. Or you might say, 'No, my kink is I really need to dress in women's clothing.' We're that outlet. We're not the evil devil out here, plucking people off the street, keeping them chained up for days on end." 

Below is David Shankbone's interview with Bill &amp; Rebecca, owners of Rebecca's Hidden Chamber, a &lt;a href="w%3ADungeon%20%28BDSM%29"&gt;BDSM dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Meet Bill &amp; Rebecca, owners of a BDSM dungeon</h2>

♡❤♡David Shankbone: What first attracted you to this business?
♡❤♡DS: You would provide start-up costs and get it going?
♡❤♡DS: What makes you atypical?
♡❤♡DS: You don’t a have personal interest in S&amp;M?
♡❤♡DS: How is it that you're able to run a business that's centered around S&amp;M and caters to those clients, when you don't have that inclination for yourselves?

<h3>Their home life</h3>
♡❤♡DS: What do your kids feel about this as a business?
♡❤♡DS: What would they think?
♡❤♡DS: What do they think you do?
♡❤♡DS: Do you have a practice?
♡❤♡DS: Kids just don’t care what their parents do.
♡❤♡DS: Is that taxing on you?
♡❤♡DS: How do you handle that?
♡❤♡DS: So when people bring problems into work, which happens in any workplace, you're the one that they probably turn to.
♡❤♡DS: Do either of you think ever of leaving this business?
♡❤♡DS: But your kids know you work nights. What do you tell them when you're leaving?
♡❤♡DS: But what do they think that you're doing?
♡❤♡DS: Work. Just--generic work?
♡❤♡DS: I got you. So it's just we're going to work on the business. 
♡❤♡DS: Yeah.

<h2>Operating the business</h2>
<h3>The costs</h3>

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤chuckles♡❤]
♡❤♡DS: What are the startup costs involved?
♡❤♡DS: What's your greatest non-fixed cost?
♡❤♡DS: Where do you advertise?
♡❤♡DS: In the back of the paper?

<h3>Hiring employees</h3>

 &lt;span style="display:none"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
♡❤♡DS: Why not?
♡❤♡DS: How can you tell whether they will or will not? Just by talking to them?
♡❤♡DS: Could I have a sample, not necessarily one that's filled out, but just one that you-- 
♡❤♡DS: [♡❤laughs♡❤] You'd be scared. You wouldn't hire me. Is it only girls you hire?
♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Looking at list of questions♡❤] What would a question like "the greatest woman in the world" reveal to you?
♡❤♡DS: Sure.
♡❤♡DS: How did you originate these questions?
♡❤♡DS: And it's an amalgamation of questions.
♡❤♡DS: Yeah, I see O.J. Simpson. What would that be an indicator of?
♡❤♡DS: Do you ask for references?

<h3>The prices</h3>

♡❤♡DS: What does it typically cost for a session?
♡❤♡DS: And there's lower, and there's higher?
♡❤♡DS: Depending on what they want to do?
♡❤♡DS: What would be the most expensive thing that someone would ask for?
♡❤♡DS: Multi-girl? And what would they do in that?
♡❤♡DS: Three girls would be eight hundred dollars an hour?
♡❤♡DS: And does it vary based upon what they're asking for?
♡❤♡DS: What would be an expensive, and what would be a cheap thing?
♡❤♡DS: Sure.
♡❤♡DS: And for an expensive thing? What would be something that's--
♡❤♡DS: What kind of an experience would that be that someone asks--?
♡❤♡DS: But what would they do--multi-girls, just . . . . Like some--
♡❤♡DS: Intercourse is completely off.
♡❤♡DS: What about orgasms?
♡❤♡DS: They're allowed orgasms.
♡❤♡DS: And that's typical?

<h2>The clients</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What are your clients like?
♡❤♡DS: And he didn't like that?
♡❤♡DS: It was acceptable to him.
♡❤♡DS: And you don’t want that to be a slippery slope. That's not the kind of clientèle that you really want…
♡❤♡DS: What's your typical client? 
♡❤♡DS: For typical client "John." Who is John? What is his background, what is he coming here for, what's he looking for?
♡❤♡DS: So each person that approaches you at first, you don't really know what they're going to look for? Do you have ideas like, "Mmm--I bet this is this kind of guy"? Or is it just completely difficult to tell?
♡❤♡DS: They choose one?
♡❤♡DS: How many girls typically work on one night?
♡❤♡DS: And whoever's not currently engaged will be there.
♡❤♡DS: How large is your client base? 
♡❤♡DS: Of repeat people.
♡❤♡DS: How many times would a regular be considered?
♡❤♡DS: Which is not what the clients are coming for.

<h3>What happens when a client walks through the door</h3>

♡❤♡DS: So I'm that person, and I walk in the door, and I'm nervous as anything--what do you do?
♡❤♡DS: Holding it and didn't realize it.
♡❤♡DS: So then I go to the bathroom.
♡❤♡DS: So you'll introduce me to the girls first.
♡❤♡DS: You're going to talk to me first. Out there, or in a room?
♡❤♡DS: [♡❤laughs♡❤] Sure, sure.
♡❤♡DS: What if I'm not ready--too much, too soon. So Rebecca's going to sit down or Alex or whoever's running the place that night is gonna sit down--
♡❤♡DS: And I'm just-- I'm here, and I'm nervous.
♡❤♡DS: And how do they typically react? How does the conversation usually go?
♡❤♡DS: Is it important to have body contact, touching them on the knee or hand, to form a bond?
♡❤♡DS: What if I shrinked away when you did that? 
♡❤♡DS: A bit more discreet.
♡❤♡DS: So they get to the point where they feel comfortable.
♡❤♡DS: What do they say?

<h3>Motivations of the clients</h3>
♡❤♡DS: Is it important to establish the motivations of the clients at the outset, such as whether they're looking for something that's a sheer thrill or whether it seems that they are maybe depressed and looking for self-abuse?
♡❤♡DS: What if they want it to be abusive, though?
♡❤♡DS: Well, that's the idea: I don't know. I think it would be the motivation of the person who's on the receiving end. But there must be people out there who do want abuse--
♡❤♡DS: Frying pans?
♡❤♡DS: So it's not really possible to establish why they're coming in here.
♡❤♡DS: What if a guy wants a guy? Is it only male clientèle that you have?
♡❤♡DS: You have couples. Do you ever have just female?
♡❤♡DS: And you have just male, too.
♡❤♡DS: What if they want another male involved, that's not a couple?
♡❤♡DS: It's not one of the things that you--

<h3>Typical requests</h3>

♡❤♡DS: It's typical that they will orgasm during a session, but do it themselves.
♡❤♡DS: Mostly?
♡❤♡DS: Got you. Just more of a psychological thing than it is [related to the] experience. What's typical? Something you would say, ‘Ahh, this is just a standard--‘
♡❤♡DS: I read that recently.
♡❤♡DS: Yeah, I recently saw that foot fetish is like the number one fetish.
♡❤♡DS: Is it licking feet? Is it &lt;a href="w%3ATickling%20fetishism"&gt;tickling&lt;/a&gt; them? Do the girls lick feet?
♡❤♡DS: They won't lick the feet?
♡❤♡DS: The guys will lick the feet.
♡❤♡DS: Do girls ever act as &lt;a href="w%3AProfessional%20submissive"&gt;bottoms&lt;/a&gt; in the rooms?
♡❤♡DS: Ever act as the bottoms.
♡❤♡DS: Well, I did my research. [♡❤laughs♡❤]
♡❤♡DS: Yeah, subs.

<h3>What is not typical</h3>

♡❤♡DS: Are there some girls who will not act as a sub?
♡❤♡DS: And that girl's not for you?
♡❤♡DS: But that probably also attracts a certain clientele that you may not want to have…the bruisers…

<h2>The environment</h2>
 
♡❤♡DS: Are your employees allowed to meet clients outside of the dungeon?
♡❤♡DS: How do you control that?
♡❤♡DS: In the workplace.
♡❤♡DS: Is this one of the rooms that's typically used [♡❤We are seated in the yellow room found in the photographs♡❤]?
♡❤♡DS: This one seems very plain, there's a few things in the corner over there--
♡❤♡DS: All over. I've lived in 17 cities, six states and three countries.
♡❤♡DS: Yeah, I had many, I had neighborhoods.

♡❤♡DS: But some people would, right?
♡❤♡DS: Of course. But those people wouldn't also have a desire to come here, right? You're meeting a particular need for a particular segment of the population.
♡❤♡DS: What's the blue room, first? Can you describe it?
♡❤♡DS: Got you. Why is it popular?
<h3>Is an S&amp;M dungeon dangerous?</h3>

♡❤♡DS: If you introduce the girls and you don't know what the clients want, how do you know that it's going to be a safe situation for one of your employees?
♡❤♡DS: No.
♡❤♡DS: Never been to a topless bar.
♡❤♡DS: What if they don't? What if they're just a mental case? What if they're a wild card?
♡❤♡DS: You've never had one problem
♡❤♡DS: Can you give me an example of a problem that you've had and how you handled it?
♡❤♡DS: What happens when that's the case?
♡❤♡DS: And you've never had a dangerous situation?
♡❤♡DS: Instead of dangerous, let's say threatening, where there was concern for either your safety or--
♡❤♡DS: I would say that the nature of the desire between eating and the desire for some sort of sexual pleasure, gratification, that there's always more of a chance for a threatening situation. Someone who wants to go for a taco versus someone who wants to go for a BDSM session--
♡❤♡DS: I would say that my notion would be yes, I would think that there is more of a likelihood of a threatening situation. Now, if you're talking about a Taco Bell in the middle of the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Bronx"&gt;South Bronx&lt;/a&gt;, versus this place, I would say they're probably equal in danger.
♡❤♡DS: A Taco Bell on &lt;a href="w%3APark%20Avenue"&gt;Park Avenue&lt;/a&gt; versus here, I would say that there's more likelihood of a threatening situation occurring in a place like this than in a Taco Bell on Park Avenue.
♡❤♡DS: I would make an assumption that yes, all things equal, that there might be more of a chance of a dangerous situation happening here. You are rooting around in people’s psychology here.
♡❤♡DS: Where they didn't feel safe. And that's part of the main business model at Rebecca’s, right? That it needs to be a safe environment for the client?
♡❤♡DS: Is it usually appointments, or is it walk-ins?
♡❤♡DS: You make exceptions for certain clients.
♡❤♡DS: Is that because their desire--when they have a desire to come here--it's usually something that they plan out?
♡❤♡DS: If I went to a Taco Bell and I said, "Can you name a dangerous situation?" they would say, "Oh, that time I got held up." So I guess I'm curious about a threatening situation that you might encounter or have encountered.
♡❤♡DS: Sure. Sure. But all that aside, what would be a threatening situation that you've had to handle?
♡❤♡DS: Have you ever had to kick somebody out?
♡❤♡DS: Why have you had to ask people to leave?
♡❤♡DS: It's preventative.

<h3>On S&amp;M burnout</h3>

♡❤♡DS: The &lt;a href="w%3A%20The_Divine_Comedy%23The_Circles_of_Hell"&gt;seven circles of Hell&lt;/a&gt; . . . .
♡❤♡DS: Why would it not be good for the girls or the guys?
♡❤♡DS: --need a break?
♡❤♡DS: Give me a smooth one.
♡❤♡DS: Are there people who would not be attracted to this kind of an environment, that want the crazier--
♡❤♡DS: And probably so you wouldn't see them, but you'd probably have an idea about the--
♡❤♡DS: Yeah, I'd love to talk to them, too. What's their average length of employment?
♡❤♡DS: Is it usually a temporary job, until they move on to something else?
♡❤♡DS: Like "I'm putting myself through school." 
♡❤♡DS: Paying debts down?

<h2>Criticism of BDSM</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Some critics of BDSM say that it encourages domestic violence.
♡❤♡DS: And you don't think it does.
♡❤♡DS: Yes, some.
♡❤♡DS: Yeah, sure.

<h1>'Large-scale attack' against ex-Prime Minister Bhutto leaves more than 100 dead in Pakistan</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27Large-scale%20attack%27%20against%20ex-Prime%20Minister%20Bhutto%20leaves%20more%20than%20100%20dead%20in%20Pakistan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Former &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABenazir%20Bhutto"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt; was the target of a bombing which killed at least 136 people Thursday night, hours after landing at &lt;a href="w%3AKarachi%20Airport"&gt;Karachi Airport&lt;/a&gt;. 

Bhutto's arrival in the country with more than 100 supporters, breaking eight years of self-imposed exile, was met by more than 20,000 police and military troops. Security was tight, after a warning that militants could attempt to assassinate the former leader. 

Bhutto is disliked by many traditionalist Pakistanis who consider her rule to have brought the country too close to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Bhutto had told reporters she was "not scared" and was concentrating on her mission, only hours before the attack.

Bhutto, who was traveling from the airport to a rally atop an armoured truck, was unharmed and taken back to her ancestral home of Bilawal House by police and security forces. At least 20 police were killed in the bombing.

Sources indicate there may have been multiple explosions, with a smaller blast preceding the main one, in what CNN's &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Rivers"&gt;Dan Rivers&lt;/a&gt; described as a "large-scale attack". Two other men were taken into custody following the attacks, one carrying a belt of explosives and another carrying a pistol.

Pakistani Minister of Information &lt;a href="w%3ATariq%20Azim%20Khan"&gt;Tariq Azim Khan&lt;/a&gt; has stated that the attack, which injured another 150 people, was believed to be a suicide bombing. Manzur Mughal, a Karachi police officer, reported that a skull believed to belong to one of the bombers had been found, and taken to a forensics lab.

Bhutto was in the country, having been waived of any corruption charges by President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; last week, to discuss the possibility of a joint government dedicated to fighting extremism in the volatile country. Bhutto had told reporters that she did not want the country associated with the training of terrorists.

<h1>John Reed on Orwell, God, self-destruction and the future of writing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=John%20Reed%20on%20Orwell%2C%20God%2C%20self-destruction%20and%20the%20future%20of%20writing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

It can be difficult to be &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reed%20%28novelist%29"&gt;John Reed&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Hitchens"&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/a&gt; called him a "Bin Ladenist" and &lt;a href="w%3ACathy%20Young"&gt;Cathy Young&lt;/a&gt; editorialized in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Boston%20Globe"&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that he "blames the victims of terrorism" when he puts out a novel like ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASnowball%27s%20Chance"&gt;Snowball's Chance&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a biting send-up of &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Orwell"&gt;George Orwell&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20Farm"&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ which he was inspired to write after the terrorist attacks on &lt;a href="w%3A9/11"&gt;September 11&lt;/a&gt;. "The clear references to 9/11 in the apocalyptic ending can only bring Orwell's name into disrepute in the U.S.," wrote William Hamilton, the British literary executor of the Orwell estate. That process had already begun: it was revealed Orwell gave the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Foreign%20Office"&gt;British Foreign Office&lt;/a&gt; a list of people he suspected of being "crypto-Communists and fellow travelers," labeling some of them as &lt;a href="w%3AJews"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHomosexuals"&gt;homosexuals&lt;/a&gt;. "I really wanted to explode that book," Reed told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. "I wanted to completely undermine it."

Is this man who wants to blow up the classic &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20canon"&gt;literary canon&lt;/a&gt; taught to children in schools a menace, or a messiah? went to interview him for ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and found that, as often is the case, the answer lies somewhere in the middle.

Reed is electrified by the changes that surround him that channel through a lens of inspiration wrought by his children. "The kids have made me a better writer," Reed said. In his new untitled work, which he calls a "new play by &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Shakespeare"&gt;William Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;," he takes lines from &lt;a href="w%3ABard"&gt;The Bard&lt;/a&gt;'s classics to form an original tragedy. He began it in 2003, but only with the birth of his children could he finish it. "I didn't understand the characters who had children. I didn't really understand them. And once I had had kids, I could approach them differently." 

Taking the old to make it new is a theme in his work and in his world view. Reed foresees new narrative forms being born, Biblical epics that will be played out across print and electronic mediums. He is pulled forward by revolutions of the past, a search for a spiritual sensibility, and a desire to locate himself in the process. 

Below is 's conversation with novelist &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reed%20%28novelist%29"&gt;John Reed&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>On the alternative media and independent publishing</h2>

[♡❤Conversation in progress...♡❤]

♡❤♡: How is that?

♡❤♡DS: All the &lt;a href="w%3AAlternative%20media"&gt;alternative media&lt;/a&gt; is either becoming a conglomerate, like the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AVillage%20Voice"&gt;Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, or it's dying, like the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Press"&gt;New York Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="An%20interview%20with%20gossip%20columnist%20Michael%20Musto%20on%20the%20art%20of%20celebrity%20journalism"&gt;I interviewed Michael Musto&lt;/a&gt;, and that was one area that I wanted to touch on, but we got involved in so many other things. I don't even know how much I could really get out of somebody who's working there, but--

♡❤♡DS: How does the ♡❤Rail♡❤ make its money in order to operate?

♡❤♡DS: What about this theory that the drop in &lt;a href="w%3Aadvertising"&gt;advertising&lt;/a&gt; for the print media, even though it's going to go through a period of growing pains, in the end might actually be better for the literary press like the ♡❤Brooklyn Rail♡❤, because people who have keys to funding will see more of a need to do grants, which will allow them to be more experimental as opposed to worrying about, "Are we going to offend our advertisers?"

♡❤♡DS: , and off-the-record he talked about how the mainstream music press has almost lost all influence--♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASpin%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Spin&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARolling%20Stone%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;♡❤; those kinds of magazines. He said that whenever he did some small blog interview his web site jumped up in hits. But when he got a favorable review in ♡❤Rolling Stone♡❤ he said, “I barely heard a word about it.” 

♡❤♡DS: Do you think it's becoming like the pharmaceutical industry? There the really big drug companies don't have a lot of drugs in the pipeline, but there are all these like little drug companies that are existing for one-or-two-drug clinical trials, and the big drug companies are watching them. Once they have a seller, &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Pharma"&gt;big pharma&lt;/a&gt; goes in and snaps up the little companies.

♡❤♡DS: How does the business model for small presses make up for a lack of blockbuster books? 

♡❤♡DS: It's more of an idealistic enterprise, then?

♡❤♡DS: But they're not like that anymore, are they?

<h2>On Christopher Hitchens, Orwell and 9/11 as inspiration</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Why did you decide to take on &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Orwell"&gt;Orwell&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: How it reads in general?
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AChristopher%20Hitchens"&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/a&gt; called you an "Osama bin Ladenist.” How do you react to that label?

♡❤♡DS: I photographed many of the New York academics who are featured in the &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Horowitz"&gt;David Horowitz&lt;/a&gt; book, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Professors%3A%20%20The%20101%20Most%20Dangerous%20Academics%20in%20America"&gt;The Professors: The 101 Most Dangerous Academics in America&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and every single one of them held it up as this badge of honor. They all received emails like, "How did you get in there?" It gave them stature that they may not have had before. Is it the same?

♡❤♡DS: He coined a philosophy for a terrorist. Like ‘&lt;a href="w%3ATrotskyite"&gt;Trotskyite&lt;/a&gt;’--there never really existed this phrase "Osama bin Ladenist." Do you think it elevated &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: But the thinking is there. Right after the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; ended--you could sense it, you could feel it in the air--this "Who do we set our sights on?" I think that all of us felt that way to a degree, if not just because we were socialized to think that way.

♡❤♡DS: Denouncing ‘&lt;a href="w%3AIslamofascism"&gt;Islamofascism&lt;/a&gt;’...

♡❤♡DS: Do you think it's a little bit trying to fit a square peg through a round hole, like the old paradigm of the Soviet Union as the evil empire, and now the evil empire is this very disparate range of peoples from Indonesia to Iran and trying to make them into a ‘Soviet Union?’

♡❤♡DS: It's worked. It's sold.

♡❤♡DS: They are going to be spending a lot more; it'll be a trillion dollar war.

♡❤♡DS: Was there a moment where your switch was flicked, where you were like, "I've had enough." Was there a breaking point?

♡❤♡DS: [chuckles]

♡❤♡DS: Did you really?

♡❤♡DS: Is he dead?

♡❤♡DS: Or suffering--

♡❤♡DS: Orwell forms such a fundamental basis for so much &lt;a href="w%3ANeoconservative"&gt;neoconservative&lt;/a&gt; thinking, almost as an ideological text. Like &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Outsiders%20%28novel%29"&gt;The Outsiders&lt;/a&gt; forms our sense of what a rebel is to a degree, and Orwell gives us a worldview of--

♡❤♡DS: What about &lt;a href="w%3A1984%20%28novel%29"&gt;1984&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: All of a sudden you'll be in an Orwell genre: Orwell criticism--

♡❤♡DS: 1984 is used by both liberals and conservatives to attack each--each in different ways--

<h2>On the future of the narrative</h2>
♡❤♡DS: As a writer there's always a desire to be innovative and original, but you can't be original anymore in writing. It's very difficult. Almost everything has been done. I think that I read somewhere that the only genre of art that hasn't fully been mined is maybe poetry.

♡❤♡DS: How do you handle the challenge with wanting to be--

♡❤♡DS: What are they?

♡❤♡DS: Can you conceptualize that to an example?

♡❤♡DS: On an Internet forum.

♡❤♡DS: Once you can envision it, the technology will follow, though. Once you can start seeing it.

♡❤♡DS: A very common thing for a writer is to be riddled with self-doubt, and that can often ruin a lot of inspiration and creativity and make you lose your way in what you're doing. How do you handle a challenge like that?

<h2>On changing the literary canon</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you have a memory that has stuck with you that--where you continually turn back to it to learn new lessons?

♡❤♡DS: Is there one that stands out?

♡❤♡DS: She smells like a street urchin?

♡❤♡DS: And that brings back a lot--the olfactory memories?

♡❤♡DS: No, I'd love to hear your dream.

♡❤♡DS: Sure.

[♡❤both chuckle♡❤]

♡❤♡DS: Do you do dream analysis?

♡❤♡DS: Like Animal Farm?

♡❤♡DS: What's a book that every kid in high school reads that you think should be removed?

♡❤♡DS: Clearly a lot can be gained from literature, and as you've have shown talking about Shakespeare here. But you think there might be a problem with building a new generation of readers, in that we train people to read things that they can't relate to? It would be like raising kids to watch &lt;a href="w%3ABette%20Davis"&gt;Bette Davis&lt;/a&gt; movies, and then you get to watch the &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter%20films"&gt;Harry Potter film&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡DS: Is there at all a movement for that? 

♡❤♡DS: But can't you see such a reaction against that change?

♡❤♡DS: [laughs]

♡❤♡DS: There's a magical thing that happens when people feel they discover things that went to the wayside--think about bell bottoms! I remember in the early 90s, the idea of bell bottoms, or even just large pants at the bottom, was just anathema.

♡❤♡DS: And then all of a sudden it's like people get bored with the same thing, and boom! Bell bottoms are back.

♡❤♡DS: People who are raised watching "&lt;a href="w%3ADie%20Hard"&gt;Die Hard&lt;/a&gt;" and &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;, all of a sudden they discover old &lt;a href="w%3AJoan%20Crawford"&gt;Joan Crawford&lt;/a&gt; films.

<h2>On belief in a higher power</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you believe in a higher power?

♡❤♡DS: How do you raise your children?

♡❤♡DS: How do you circumvent that in the rearing of children, then?

♡❤♡DS: Why would you be afraid to have it published that you're part Jewish?

♡❤♡DS: [chuckles] As a big "Fuck you" to Judaism, or--?

♡❤♡DS: So you're going to be baptized into the Gnostic church?

♡❤♡DS: It's an odd concept.

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Baptist"&gt;Southern Baptist&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: They're one of the least intolerant.

♡❤♡DS: I went through a Southern Baptist phase when I lived in Georgia.

♡❤♡DS: Yeah, yeah. The Southern Baptist convention is probably the most conservative out there.

<h2>On politics</h2>

♡❤♡DS: If you were forced to choose, which war would you prefer to fight in, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan%20War"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: On the side of the United States.

♡❤♡DS: Afghanistan? 

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: If you remain that lean on the campaign trail, when they're having all those--

♡❤♡DS: [♡❤laughs♡❤]

<h2>On self-destruction and survival</h2>
♡❤♡DS: How would you choose to die?

♡❤♡DS: You think that most men, pre-parenthood, lose their sense of mortality and their fear of it?

♡❤♡DS: Were you ever afraid of it?

♡❤♡DS: Did that affect your behavior?

♡❤♡DS: "Where does it go?"

♡❤♡DS: An afterlife?

♡❤♡DS: What's a trait you deplore in yourself?

♡❤♡DS: Isn't that always the case?

♡❤♡DS: How is it your best trait?

♡❤♡DS: Is that also how it's one of your worst, then?

♡❤♡DS: What’s a time that this trait screwed you over.

♡❤♡DS: How so? Typical drug, alcohol problems, or--

♡❤♡DS: Like Joseph Grand in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Plague%20%28novel%29"&gt;The Plague&lt;/a&gt; where he was rewriting the same sentence over and over?

♡❤♡DS: What do you think it is that drives many artists to sink their own ships?

♡❤♡DS: Do you think that &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%20Rockwell"&gt;Norman Rockwell&lt;/a&gt; had that inclination?

♡❤♡DS: I don't know, either. No by his popular image.

♡❤♡DS: What's your most treasured possession? You can't include kids, because they're not really possessions.

♡❤♡DS: Is it your most treasured?

♡❤♡DS: Yeah, definitely.

♡❤♡DS: Mmm. I feel that, yeah.

♡❤♡DS: What makes it a scraper?

♡❤♡DS: You could be scraping meat off bones.

♡❤♡DS: I have treasured possessions, but I also have treasured memories. I found a suicide in the woods when I was thirteen: a kid my age, who was probably fourteen. It's a treasured memory in some ways, one that’s lasted my whole life, and it's come back in a lot of ways. On my MySpace profile, I make an allusion to that in my narrative. I don't think people actually read that. I think that people look at pictures, and then they move on. But that's not really true. I have been contacted by both that individual's younger sister, who was eight when he killed himself, and the girlfriend he killed himself over. Separately.

<h2>On raising children</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Really?

♡❤♡DS: Gives it depth and also maybe opens you up to a new audience.

♡❤♡DS: Especially based in New York.

♡❤♡DS: Do you find that when you have friends outside the city, and they know you're raising kids here, they bate their breath? So many people still have this vision of New York from like "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Warriors%20%28film%29"&gt;The Warriors&lt;/a&gt;,"; from the &lt;a href="w%3AAbe%20Beame"&gt;Abe Beame&lt;/a&gt; days of New York.

♡❤♡DS: So many parents think that--my sister would be one--the preference of that controlled atmosphere is better for the kids. They don't realize what they lose not living in an urban center.

♡❤♡DS: People creating this thriving environment where we can influence each other, and kids --

♡❤♡DS: --have more stimulus. When you see news reports that on the discovery of an Earthlike planet does that affect your perspective or does it go unnoticed?

♡❤♡DS: If you had to choose, and you had to choose or both would be devastated and destroyed, which continent would you have blown up, &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡DS: Or they both go.

♡❤♡DS: So it would be a sum total of human life, as opposed to your judgement of cultural significance, or--?

<h2>On paedophilia and the death penalty</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What do you regard as the lowest depth of misery?

♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="Augusten%20Burroughs%20on%20addiction%2C%20writing%2C%20his%20family%20and%20his%20new%20book"&gt;Augusten Burroughs made the exact same point&lt;/a&gt;; the death penalty came up when we were talking, too.

♡❤♡DS: He's a very dynamic person to talk to. He was like, ‘I'm not one of those people who cares about the whole taking another life. I feel like when you damage a child, you've damaged them. You've given up your right to be here amongst us.’

♡❤♡DS: I'm pretty ambivalent on the death penalty. It doesn't bother me on some philosophical level, like the death, you know? But I think that the argument that makes me ambivalent as opposed to pro- what worries me is the idea that there's innocent people being put to death.

♡❤♡DS: They're still out there. Just recently, there was some 15-year-old girl who was--

<h2>On personal relationships</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What do you value most in your friends?

♡❤♡DS: Loyalty?

♡❤♡DS: Before you got married, what would have been a bigger turnoff for you with your wife, her speaking in a baby voice, or her being overly flatulent?

♡❤♡DS: Say, both scenarios in bed.

♡❤♡DS: Than a baby voice.

♡❤♡DS: Like what?

♡❤♡DS: Is there a lot of brainy pillow talk in your household?

In a "fireside chat" at &lt;a href="w%3AYale%20University"&gt;Yale University&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, prominent naturalists &lt;a href="w%3AE.%20O.%20Wilson"&gt;Edward O. Wilson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20H.%20Raven"&gt;Peter H. Raven&lt;/a&gt; predicted dire consequences for the planet's biodiversity and habitability unless current trends in consumption and environmental degradation are reversed. The two scientists were awarded the &lt;a href="w%3AAddison%20Emery%20Verrill"&gt;Addison Emery Verrill Medal&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3APeabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History"&gt;Peabody Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; for their contributions to natural science before a capacity crowd at Yale's Sprague Hall. Both are known for their environmental activism as well as extensive research and popular writing.

Wilson, known for his contributions to &lt;a href="w%3Aisland%20biogeography"&gt;island biogeography&lt;/a&gt; as well as the controversial field of &lt;a href="w%3Asociobiology"&gt;sociobiology&lt;/a&gt;, said that humans&amp;mdash;like all earth species&amp;mdash;are adapted to ♡❤this♡❤ world. But most people have the dangerous attitude that this world is "a waystation for a better world", warned Wilson. Humans could cause the extinction of half of all species by the end of the next century, he stated.

The event was billed as a debate between the two scientists, but they found little to disagree about. (Raven quipped that he did not care for Wilson's tie, the extent of their disagreement for the evening.) Raven pointed to unsustainably high levels of consumption, especially in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, that will lead to ecological disaster if left unchecked. Levels of consumption have to be cut drastically, he argued. But Wilson claimed that it would be possible to maintain and even improve quality of life even while significantly reducing the population's &lt;a href="w%3Aecological%20footprint"&gt;ecological footprint&lt;/a&gt;. Current models, he said, predict that human population will peak at around 9 billion, and that "if we use what we have" intelligently, the world could be a sustainable paradise by the 22nd century.

Raven and Wilson both argued for the compatibility of Christian and environmentalist viewpoints. According to the second chapter of Genesis, said Raven, man was put on the earth in order to preserve it. Wilson said that we need to "form an alliance" to save life on earth&amp;mdash;an alliance including both religious and non-religious people&amp;mdash;and that one can be a "conservative right-wing Christian" ♡❤and♡❤ an environmentalist. His recent work, including the &lt;a href="w%3AEncyclopedia%20of%20Life"&gt;Encyclopedia of Life&lt;/a&gt;, has focused on creating such an alliance.

The most important thing, Raven said, is to expose children to nature. Invoking the argument of &lt;a href="w%3ARachel%20Carson"&gt;Rachel Carson&lt;/a&gt;'s 1965 ♡❤A Sense of Wonder♡❤, Raven said that children between the ages of four and ten are extremely impressionable, and that teaching them to appreciate the natural world will be the most effective way to ensure environmental consciousness in the next generation. But although Raven was a naturalist from a young age, he said that he "didn't give a thought to conservation" while in graduate school in the 1950s. Carson's 1962 book on the dangers of pesticides, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASilent%20Spring"&gt;Silent Spring&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, was Raven's introduction to dangers of environmental degradation. Wilson also emphasized Carson's legacy for the environmental movement; he proudly noted that Carson biographer Linda Lear had recently called him the "only surviving person who actually helped Rachel Carson" put together ♡❤Silent Spring♡❤.

Raven and Wilson were only the 16th and 17th, respectively, to receive the Verrill Medal, which is the highest honor awarded by the Peabody Museum. Before a sympathetic crowd, Wilson tactfully avoided any mention of his own institution, Yale's rival &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="YouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; announced that Taiwan Traditional Chinese website has been released yesterday in Taipei City, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, and the unique web address will be shown as "www.youtube.com♡❤♡.tw♡❤♡" or "♡❤♡tw.♡❤♡youtube.com". Users from YouTube Global Sites can access Taiwan Site. This site launch will be a benefit for users preferring reading Chinese more than other languages.

In the press conference, co-founder Steve Chen explained the reason choosing ".tw" address, "With lots of good experiences using Traditional Chinese Site in Hong Kong, I think Taiwan should also be. We improved search functions to find more in Taiwan." He remarked. "YouTube has lots of international sites in many countries including Taiwan, with a keyword, you can find lots of different results in different sites." YouTube International Manager Sakina Arsiwala said.

Not only the launch by the performance of Eight Generals and Steve Chen, YouTube also invited &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Television"&gt;China Television Co.&lt;/a&gt;, CommonWealth Magazine, Lion Travel Co., Ltd., and &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan%20Broadcasting%20System"&gt;Taiwan Broadcasting System&lt;/a&gt; to share experiences of partnership. "We should learn some conceptions on sharing and public service needed in this networking era." Yuan-hui Hu (President and CEO of Public Television Service, Taiwan) remarked at the Partner Panel of the Press Conference.

After the Press Conference, YouTube held launch and site experience activities at Xinyi Plaza of Shin Kong Mitsukoshi and invited registered users participating in "Beautiful Taiwan" online video competition.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; has released its tax plan, following the announcement from the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; coalition that they would provide tax cuts costing AU$34 billion if re-elected. The government has placed pressure on Labor since their announcement on Monday, urging Mr Rudd to release the opposition's tax plan.

Under Labor's system, the government's planned tax cuts for &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australians&lt;/a&gt; earning more than $180,000 per year would be scrapped, saving $3 billion. The savings would be spent on health and education for working families.

Speaking in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; today, Mr Rudd announced that if elected he would spend $2.3 billion on tax rebates for parents with children in primary and secondary schools. The refunds would be available to those who are eligible for Family Tax Benefit A. Mr Rudd claims the plan would be available to around two million children.

A Rudd government would offer a 50 percent education rebate to parents, up to $750 per child for primary school aged children and up to $1500 for children in secondary school. The rebate could be used for a variety of purchases but not for school fees. Mr Rudd said the rebate would help to equip children for the digital age.

"If mum and dad are spending money on buying a laptop, spending money on buying a home computer, spending money on ... purchasing internet connection, education software printers and books, those expenditures, (they) will be eligible to claim the 50 per cent education tax refund that we are putting forward," Mr Rudd said.

"We need to equip our young people with the skills necessary to participate in the digital economy of the 21st century."

Mr Rudd vigorously denied that he rushed the plan out after the government's announcement. "We have been working on this education tax refund for the better part of four, five months," Mr Rudd told reporters.

Labor would spend $400 million of the savings on Labor's national health reform plan, while the remaining $200 million would go to the budget surplus.

Under the health reform plan, an elective surgery strategy would be implemented with the aim of reducing waiting times. Mr Rudd said the waiting times experienced by some Australians were unacceptable.

"We intend ... to establish through the use of other funds as well a plan which would create a national elective-surgery strategy to reduce waiting times across the nation," Mr Rudd said.

About 25,000 Australians are on waiting lists for elective surgery despite having passed the clinically acceptable waiting period, he said.

"That's unacceptable," he said.

Mr Rudd also said that Labor would embrace tax reform by flattening the number of tax rates from four to three, at 15, 30 and 40 percent by 2012-13. This contrasts to the government's planned tax cuts bringing rates to 15, 30, 25 and 40 percent.

If Labor is elected, those paying the highest tax rate would pay around $10 a week more than they would under a &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government. Mr Rudd said that he was not waging a class war and believed those paying the top tax rate wouldn't mind investing in the country.

"If you're on $180 grand and more, as people like myself are, I don't think you really need it just now," said Mr Rudd.

"What I say instead is that most people in that bracket wouldn't mind an investment going into bridging the digital divide for the whole country."

"If we were waging some sort of class warfare, we wouldn't be in the business of outlining the long term goals that we've put forward – a flattening, prospectively, of the tax system down to three rates rather than four with a top marginal tax rate of 40."

The government has criticised the plan, with Treasurer Peter Costello claiming that Mr Rudd copied "91.5 percent" of their tax policy. He accused the opposition of never having a tax plan.

"Mr Rudd talks about education - if he'd have brought his exam paper in after copying 91.5 per cent of the answers from the student sitting next to him, he would have got an F for fail."

The Treasurer said that it would be unlikely that a Rudd government could deliver tax cuts as it could not manage the economy well enough to deliver them.

"Unless you can manage the Australian economy, these tax cuts will not be deliverable," he said.

"Mr Rudd and Mr Swan do not understand the Australian economy. This is entirely clear from the fact they have spent four days copying 91.5 per cent of our tax plan."

Mr Costello said that a Rudd government would have a dilemma if elected, in that he could not follow the coalition's policies.

"He never had a tax policy," Mr Costello said.

"He hadn't done the work, five days after our tax policy, his great contribution to the tax debate in this country is to say 'me too, but'."

"The trouble with 'me too, but' is, it's OK for Mr Rudd to say 'me too, I'll be like Howard and Costello and adopt their policies', but if he gets in Howard and Costello won't be there writing the policies."

Mr Costello said that when Kevin Rudd runs out of ideas, the union movement would step in to provide guidance. "So who is going to say 'me to, but' to them? I think the union movement will be giving him a few ideas," said Mr Costello.

&lt;a href="FC%20Bayern%20M%C3%BCnchen"&gt;Bayern Munich&lt;/a&gt; remained undefeated in all competitions after a 0-0 draw against &lt;a href="Borussia%20Dortmund"&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/a&gt;. The draw leaves Bayern at the top of the table with 27 points. However, the lead is down to four points after Hamburg's 1-0 win against Duisburg.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFranck%20Ribery"&gt;Franck Ribery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; didn't pass a late fitness test and didn't make the 18-man strong matchday squad. Luca Toni, Martin Demichelis an Jose Ernesto Sosa replaced &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALukas%20Podolski"&gt;Lukas Podolski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilipp%20Lahm"&gt;Philipp Lahm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Hamit Altintop. Jose Ernesto Sosa returned after being sidelined for almost two months after ankle surgery.

Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund exchanged plenty of chances and almost had a 50/50 possession between them.

Bayern Munich plays Borussia Mönchengladbach at home in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADFB-Pokal"&gt;DFB Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; while Borussia Dortmund plays Eintracht Frankfurt in the same competition.

An explosion rocked an upscale mall in the main financial district of the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippine&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;. The explosion damaged the &lt;a href="w%3AGlorietta"&gt;Glorietta Mall&lt;/a&gt; in the financial district of &lt;a href="w%3AMakati%20City"&gt;Makati&lt;/a&gt; and killed at least eight people and injured at least 126 people, 98 of those needed hospitalization and the other 28 were given first aid at the blast site for minor injuries.

The explosion happened past 1:30 p.m. just after employees of the different companies in Makati finished their lunch breaks.

Police investigators initially said the cause of the explosion was from a leaking liquefied petroleum gas tank, but after a few hours the Chief of the Philippine National Police, Director General Avelino Razon Jr., ruled out the possibility of a gas tank leak and stated the bomb could be the cause of the explosion because ground investigators say the blast site smelled of gunpowder. Some police intelligence sources say they found traces of C4 explosives at the blast site.

Philippine president &lt;a href="w%3AGloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; meanwhile is on her way to the blast site. Currently, the explosion is still under investigation and the PNP bomb squad are inside the mall to check if there is still any bomb debris or any human remains.

Today, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office"&gt;United States Patent and Trademark Office&lt;/a&gt; (USPTO) issued an &lt;a href="w%3Aoffice%20action"&gt;office action&lt;/a&gt;, which confirmed the patentability of claims 6 to 10 of the Amazon &lt;a href="w%3A1-Click"&gt;1-Click&lt;/a&gt; patent, US 5,960,411. The &lt;a href="w%3Apatent%20examiner"&gt;patent examiner&lt;/a&gt;, however, rejected claims 1 to 5 and 11 to 15. Amazon now has up to six months to amend the rejected claims to overcome the examiner's rejection, provide arguments to demonstrate that the examiner is in error and/or provide evidence to demonstrate the patentability of their claims. During this period, the entire patent is still considered valid under US patent law.

The USPTO is reconsidering the patentability of the claims due to a &lt;a href="w%3Arequest%20for%20reexamination"&gt;request for reexamination&lt;/a&gt; filed by &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealander&lt;/a&gt; Peter Calveley. Mr. Calveley used internet archives to show that defunct company Digi Cash used a similar technique prior to Amazon. Despite costing a substantial sum of cash and requiring donations to prepare and file the request for reexamination, Calveley said he did it as a game and hopes that his success inspires others to play the same game.
"One Click" shopping is an ecommerce technique, which allows a customer to purchase products via the Internet without repeatedly entering personal information such as name and address. At the time it was introduced it eased the frustration of on-line shopping. 

Amazon filed the patent application for 1-click shopping in early 1997 and was granted the patent in September 1999. 23 days later Amazon sued rival &lt;a href="w%3ABarnes%20%26amp%3B%20Noble"&gt;Barnes &amp; Noble&lt;/a&gt; for alleged infringement by its "Express Lane" ordering which was introduced in 1998. In December 1999 Amazon won an interim injunction against Barnes &amp; Noble but the USA &lt;a href="w%3ACourt%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Federal%20Circuit"&gt;Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit&lt;/a&gt; lifted this injunction in February 2001. The parties then settled their dispute for undisclosed terms. Amazon has since successfully licensed the technique to other e-sellers such as &lt;a href="Apple%20Inc."&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Cousins"&gt;Ben Cousins&lt;/a&gt;, the former &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Coast%20Eagles"&gt;West Coast Eagles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Football%20League"&gt;AFL&lt;/a&gt; team captain has been forcedly removed from the West Coast Eagles and is 'no longer a registered player', according to an AFL spokesperson. 

Cousins was pulled over by police on Tuesday for erratic driving. Police charged the player with one drug charge and failing to provide a blood test. The drug charge was dropped today but the blood test charge still lingers, after police had found the drug &lt;a href="w%3AValium"&gt;Valium&lt;/a&gt; solely in pill form - the drug is only illegal in the liquid form (for injection).

Cousins had already been temporarily suspended by the West Coast Eagles prior to the 2007 season but has never actually tested positive to illicit drugs. Cousins then underwent rehabilitation in the USA in early 2007 and agreed to return to the club under a number of conditions, including a 'zero-tolerance clause', according to The Sunday Times this morning.

West Coast still stands in its decision to sack Cousins.

An attempted carjacking Thursday evening in &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; has left famous &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3Areggae"&gt;reggae&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href="w%3ALucky%20Dube"&gt;Lucky Dube&lt;/a&gt; dead. He was dropping his children off in the suburb of Rosettenville when he was attacked.

Police said that three gunshots were fired through the car window, injuring Dube. His children were out of the car at the time. An injured Dube then attempted to drive his car away from the area, but hit a tree soon after. He died at the scene. The police suspect that three people were responsible for the attack.

There has been an outrage in South Africa and around the world over the killing. Many radio stations were flooded with calls from tearful fans condemning the attack.

Lucky Dube was one of the most prominent reggae artists of all times - often remembered alongside &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Marley"&gt;Bob Marley&lt;/a&gt; for his songs on social issues. He began his career singing in Zulu and released his first album in 1982. He later moved to reggae and released is album 'Rastas Never Die'. This album was banned by the apartheid government. His other albums include Slave, Prisoner and Together As One and Respect - his most recent album which he released in April of this year.

The leadership election for the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;'s third party, is looking increasingly likely to be between two candidates. Environment spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Huhne"&gt;Chris Huhne&lt;/a&gt;, who launched his leadership bid on Wednesday 17 October, has been joined in the race today by his &lt;a href="w%3Afrontbencher"&gt;frontbench&lt;/a&gt; colleague &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Clegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt;, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman. All other likely contenders have ruled themselves out.

&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Webb"&gt;Steve Webb&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the party's manifesto group and considered to be on the left wing of the party, gathered enough support from Liberal Democrat &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt;s to stand. But he withdrew from the contest and gave his support to Mr Clegg, citing the "huge cost" to his family if he became leader and his confidence in Mr Clegg's abilities.
&lt;a href="w%3ABackbencher"&gt;Backbencher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hemming%20%28politician%29"&gt;John Hemming&lt;/a&gt;, who had stated his intention to stand, ruled himself yesterday, saying that he has been unable to gather the necessary seven nominations from Liberal Democrat MPs. Mr Hemming, MP for &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham%20Yardley%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Birmingham Yardley&lt;/a&gt;, wrote on his blog: "I will, however, not decide for now who I will support and I will announce that in the future when I have discussed matters with the other candidates and colleagues in Birmingham."

<h1>At least 31 dead and 35 missing after loss of Indonesian passenger ferry</h1>

At least 31 people have died and 35 more are missing after wooden passenger ferry ♡❤Acita III♡❤ sank off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ASulawesi"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. At least 125 more have been rescued.
The vessel capsized and sank at approximately 9 p.m. local time last night, going down near the port town of &lt;a href="w%3ABau%20Bau"&gt;Bau Bau&lt;/a&gt;. It has been suggested that bad weather was the cause of the disaster, but Bau Bau mayor Amirul Tamin has told reporters that he believes overcrowding was a much more likely cause.

An alternative explanation was offered by local police chief Mochammad Badrus, who says that the ship capsized after large numbers of passengers clambered onto an upper deck in attempts to gain mobile phone signals as the ferry neared land. Local residents and fisherman say they could hear people screaming for help as the accident unfolded.

Passenger manifests are rare and usually inaccurate when they are available in Indonesia, so passenger numbers are unconfirmed, but the ship was thought to have been carrying 150 - 200 people. However, Tamin has said that the ferry should only have been carrying a maximum of 30 passengers.

It is Indonesia's most serious ferry accident since the &lt;a href="w%3ALevina%201"&gt;Levina 1&lt;/a&gt; caught fire in February, which, in turn, came after &lt;a href="w%3AMV%20Senopati%20Nusantara"&gt;MV ♡❤Senopati Nusantara♡❤&lt;/a&gt; sank during a storm in late December.

Wikinews reporters interviewed , an employee of the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the project that runs &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and several other projects, including &lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;.

Before coming to Wikimedia, she ran &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;.CA, the website of Canada's national public broadcaster. She was also a radio and television journalist for 10 years.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡: Hi Sue, could you explain what you do for the Wikimedia Foundation?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: What was your job position for &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cbc.ca"&gt;cbc.ca&lt;/a&gt;, and what did you work on while you were there?♡❤♡

♡❤♡: Please do♡❤♡

♡❤♡Dodge: How did you come to work for the Wikimedia Foundation? Were you asked to join by someone? And if so, who?♡❤♡

♡❤♡: In joining WMF was there anything you brought from CBC.ca's policies that you feel have influenced your contributions to the foundation? Can you give Wikinews any tips? I am assuming their similar balance/neutrality policies as the BBC's♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: Have you had much to do with Wikinews during the course of your work for the Wikimedia Foundation?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: Sure.♡❤♡

♡❤♡Dodge: When the Foundation moves to San Fransisco ♡❤[sic]♡❤, will you be going with it?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: Do you believe that citizen journalism sites like Wikinews should have an editorial review process?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: Yeah.♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: Gawker sounds like what we do, only a lot less cautious.♡❤♡

♡❤♡Mike: Sue, the community initiative "Conference of the Americas" is getting support from &lt;a href="w%3ATurner%20Broadcasting%20System"&gt;Turner Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; for the citizen journalism unconference. How do you feel about the community partnering with such a big name in journalism?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Mike: The proposal is basically that Turner will give us a venue for the conference and bring in industry people to speak, in addition to more citizen-oriented speakers and our own from Wikinews. I know personally I didn't believe such a media conglomerate would want to partner with free culture, so it was surprising to me. Does it surprise you, or do you see a good working relationship between "free" and "for profit" journalism outlets?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: we had a reporter with the beeb for a week♡❤♡

♡❤♡Dodge: And the BBC used some of our content earlier♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: Do you think the fact that they can reuse what we make in partnership with them is one of the reasons for people wanting to partner with us, whereas a lot of traditional media want to retain copyright on work?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: If they don't understand GFDL, is CC-BY (per Wikinews) better for their legal folks?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: Do you believe that (at least for non-profit news sources), releasing material into the public domain makes it simpler for them to manage/handle?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: or do they not understand PD?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: For wikinews all they have to do is credit us with the story to comply with the license♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: Yes, a link to us would be nice too♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: Yeah, as long as they state its CC-BY-2.5 and give our name, they can use it. Can users who have edited Wikinews be respected around real journalists? Will they be turned down because they have written for an online website like Wikinews, which is not particularly fond of the mainstream media, and not traditional media?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: Although you have an account on the English wikinews (), you have never edited. One would assume that as a journalist you would use this project. Is there any main reason you don't edit here or do you just not have time?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: If you could interview anyone for Wikinews who would you like to interview?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: Not yet, although we reported on her though (see &lt;a href="Doris%20Lessing%20wins%20Nobel%20Prize%20for%20Literature"&gt;Doris Lessing wins Nobel Prize for Literature&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤♡

♡❤♡Dodge: Do you use Wikinews as a primary source for news, or do you use other mainstream sources, and then look to Wikinews?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: Wikinews may become comprehensive but it will be a difficult process in my opinion.♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: Do you think the reason for this is &lt;a href="w%3Awikigroaning"&gt;wikigroaning&lt;/a&gt;, such as more topics are written in focused areas rather than things of interest to the most people?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: It is a "faster" project than Wikipedia.♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: You may be interested in , the first point, Wikinews is not Paper♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: We got great cooperation on some big stories like the UK attacks, did big media notice? (&lt;a href="Major%20explosions%20at%20UK%20oil%20depot"&gt;Major explosions at UK oil depot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;Coordinated terrorist attack hits London&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: A lot of attention has been given to improving Wikipedia. Do you think more attention is needed for the other projects? If so, which ones do you think need more attention?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Dodge: What advice can you give to aspiring journalists, based on your experiences at the CBC?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Brian: "Above all, the central question about the Wikinews effort is its credibility. "Making a newspaper is hard... Someone who wants to do it but doesn't really know how hasn't solved the problem by gathering a lot of other people who don't know, either." This is a quote from a former editor of &lt;a href="w%3AEncyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/a&gt;, have we proven him wrong?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Matt: If you were the interviewer here, what else would you have asked yourself?♡❤♡

were to create something (a conference, or conversation); I'd be interested in doing that with you. I am really interested in this project.

♡❤♡Matt: Thank you for your time.♡❤♡

&lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; defeated tournament hosts &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; 34-10 to finish third in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AParc%20des%20Princes"&gt;Parc des Princes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.

France made the first breakthrough after eighteen minutes when &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Baptiste%20Elissalde"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Elissalde&lt;/a&gt; scored a penalty to give them a 3-0 lead. However soon afterwards &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Contepomi"&gt;Felipe Contepomi&lt;/a&gt; equalised with a penalty, which was followed by tries from Contepomi and &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Hasan"&gt;Omar Hasan Jalil&lt;/a&gt; as Argentina took a 17-3 lead at half time.

Argentina extended their lead thirteen minutes into the second half when &lt;a href="w%3AFederico%20Martin%20Aramburu"&gt;Federico Martin Aramburu&lt;/a&gt; scored a try, and &lt;a href="w%3AIgnacio%20Corleto"&gt;Ignacio Corleto&lt;/a&gt; added another in the 65th minute. &lt;a href="w%3ACl%C3%A9ment%20Poitrenaud"&gt;Clément Poitrenaud&lt;/a&gt; scored a consolation try for France, but Felipe Contepomi scored his second try of the match to complete Argentina's victory.

Both teams had met previously in the opening match of the tournament, where Argentina completed a over France. Argentina continued their strong performance at the World Cup with victories against Ireland and Scotland to reach the semi-finals, where they were by South Africa. 

Defending champions England face 1995 champions South Africa in Saturday's final at the &lt;a href="w%3AStade%20de%20France"&gt;Stade de France&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>US stock markets tumble on 'Black Monday' anniversary</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20stock%20markets%20tumble%20on%20%27Black%20Monday%27%20anniversary&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Some say history tends to repeat itself. Today marked a day in history, when 20 years ago, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; market crashed, on what is known as '&lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Monday%20%281987%29"&gt;Black Monday&lt;/a&gt;'. The crash sent the market tumbling down 508 points, losing nearly 24%. On Friday, the Dow Jones nearly broke that record when the market closed at -366.94 points, down almost three percent.

Several factors could be to blame for the loss, one being &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;'s government approving a measure on October 18 to send Turkish troops into &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to take out militants of the &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Workers%20Party"&gt;Kurdistan Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; (PKK). This sent oil prices skyrocketing to the highest prices in history, with the highest record being just over &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$89.00, which was set on October 18.

Fears that the housing market in the U.S. has come to a standstill has also lead &lt;a href="w%3ACaterpillar%20Inc."&gt;Caterpillar Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, which manufactures and sells construction equipment to issue a warning that the standstill would cause profits to drop, and the American economy to be severely hurt. On Friday their stocks lost nearly six percent to close at $73.57.

Investors and experts of the markets are disturbed by the losses calling the situation ugly.

"It's pretty ugly. A company like Caterpillar should be a poster child for global growth and benefits of the weak dollar. It makes you question: Is global growth really that strong? Has the earnings kick from the weak dollar played itself out?" said Bell Curve Trading chief strategy expert, Bill Strazzullo.

Others believe that the losses were a way of emotionally responding to the events of 'Black Monday.'

"Some of the earnings reports were a little disappointing but not that bad. I think we're responding emotionally to the 20th anniversary of the October 1987 stock market crash. I'd like to laugh except it hurts," said T Rowe Price Head trader, Andy Brooks.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANASDAQ"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/a&gt; also took heavy losses to close down 74.15 points or -2.64%, closing at 2,725.16. The &lt;a href="w%3AS%26amp%3BP%20500"&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt; was also hit hard, losing 39.45 points, or -2.56%, closing at 1,500.63.

One person was killed and two were injured when a small plane crashed into a residential tower shortly after taking off from &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20International%20Airport"&gt;Vancouver International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. 

The twin engine &lt;a href="w%3APiper%20Seneca"&gt;Piper Seneca&lt;/a&gt; hit the ninth floor of the 15-storey building in &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;, where the airport is located, but it did not cause a fire.

The male pilot of the plane was killed, while two people in the building were hurt -- one seriously, the other suffering minor injuries.

The plane appears to have hit the building at an angle, with damage spread between the eighth and ninth floors.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board"&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/a&gt; is investigating the cause of the crash.

According to &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; officials, nearly 70 &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; personnel and high ranking officials have been relieved from command and or duty after an &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20United%20States%20Air%20Force%20nuclear%20weapons%20incident"&gt;incident on August 30&lt;/a&gt; when a U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AB-52%20Stratofortress"&gt;B-52H bomber plane&lt;/a&gt; flew from &lt;a href="w%3AMinot%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Minot Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="North%20Dakota"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; with six armed &lt;a href="w%3AAGM-129%20ACM"&gt;AGM-129 ACM&lt;/a&gt; nuclear missiles attached to its wings.

Twelve unarmed missiles were supposed to be taken to &lt;a href="w%3ABarksdale%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Barksdale Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; to be taken out of commission. Instead, live missiles were placed on the planes wings, along with six of the "dummy missiles," before it took off from Minot AFB. The air force says that this was a "serious error" on the part of the military, and is launching a formal and ongoing investigation. 

So far, the investigation states that the missiles loaded onto the plane were supposed to be inspected by looking through a portal on each missile, where a code would determine whether or not the missile was armed or a dummy. The inspector who loaded the missiles onto the plane only looked under the wing where the armed missiles were located and the plane's navigator also failed to perform a proper inspection.

The numbers on an out-dated piece of paper were also not checked prior to the missiles being loaded on the plane despite the fact that the air force already had a system which is supposed to track the missiles.

"[The incident is an] erosion of adherence to weapons-handling standards. In the countless times our dedicated airmen have transferred weapons in our nation's arsenal, nothing like this has ever occurred. This was an unacceptable error that resulted in an unprecedented string of procedural failures," said Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Major General Richard Newton who also said that the plane's crew did not know that the missiles were on board the plane.

U.S. air force officials state that there was no threat of a nuclear explosion had the plane crashed, but that a radiation leak was possible.

Officials said that they want to make sure they "hold ourselves accountable to the American people and want to ensure proper corrective action has been taken."

At least four colonels and at least one lieutenant were suspended from duty. At least 66 other personnel were also relieved including Colonel Bruce Emig, the commander of the B-52 &lt;a href="w%3A5th%20Bomb%20Wing"&gt;5th Bomb Wing&lt;/a&gt; team and two other members. Officials say that criminal charges have not yet been filed against anyone involved in the incident, but did not rule them out.

At least six people are confirmed murdered inside a high rise apartment located in &lt;a href="w%3ASurrey%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Surrey&lt;/a&gt; just outside of &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="British%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, in what is being called a "graphic mass-murder". The bodies were discovered on October 19 at approximately 4:30 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20time%20zone"&gt;PT&lt;/a&gt;).

Residents living near the house called authorities when they reported the smell of what they believed to be &lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt;, coming from inside the house and that there were possibly several people inside. The fire department and police arrived in full force and told nearby residents to evacuate, shutting down the roads and stopping train service surrounding the property. When police later entered the home, they discovered the six individuals. The murder is still under investigation, along with the reports of a gas-like smell.

"We're looking at perhaps a very dramatic homicide scene with as many as six dead. Initially, it was [a report of] a gas leak. A very large area was cordoned off for fear of an explosion. As to how this [call] comes in as a gas leak, that's going to come out in the investigation", said &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; spokesman, Sgt. Roger Morrow.

The identity, race and sex of the individuals are not known. Police also have not yet determined if the mass murder was a result of a murder-suicide. Police have not stated the form of murder and there are no reports of any suspects being in custody.

"It's hard to say whether its gang-related, some sort of attack on a group of individuals, or whether it's a murder-suicide. Certainly it's a concern to us and we understand it's a concern in the community", said Integrated Homicide Investigation Team member, Cpl. Dale Carr.

To protest the &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;15 million budget of the RomeFilmFest, a man yesterday threw a bucket of red paint into the famous &lt;a href="w%3ATrevi%20Fountain"&gt;Trevi Fountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, before fleeing the scene. The water in the fountain turned complete red for a while, before technicians were able to cut off the water supply, let the dye wash out, and then replace it with fresh water.

Pamphlets by a previously unknown group called ATM Azionefuturista 2007 were found near the fountain, protesting the budget the festival was awarded. The red fountain was meant as a reference to the red carpet of the festival, which opened last Thursday, October 18. "You wanted just a red carpet - we want a city entirely in vermilion. We who are vulnerable, old, ill, students, workers, we come with vermilion to colour your greyness," the leaflet read.

There is no permanent discoloration of the Baroque fountain or the marble statues depicting the Roman Sea God &lt;a href="w%3ANeptune%20%28mythology%29"&gt;Neptune&lt;/a&gt; on a chariot. &lt;a href="w%3AFrancesco%20Rutelli"&gt;Francesco Rutelli&lt;/a&gt;, Minister of Culture and Tourism in &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, called the action "an unacceptable and irresponsible act of vandalism" and said that new anti-vandalism laws were needed.

On April 22, 2007, a 40-year-old woman from &lt;a href="w%3AMilan"&gt;Milan&lt;/a&gt; swam naked in the fountain, getting her picture into international newspapers. Tourists throw roughly 3000 euro into the Trevi fountain each day, for good luck. The coins are removed at night and have been used to sponsor a supermarket for Rome's needy citizens.

Soon after the restart &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Cueto"&gt;Mark Cueto&lt;/a&gt; crossed South Africa's try line out wide, but television replays showed that he had just gone in to touch.

Both teams had met in the pool stages, where South Africa . However England regained their form to reach the final with victories over Australia and France. South Africa had little trouble reaching the final, with comfortable victories over Fiji and Argentina.

The first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Firm"&gt;Old Firm Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Premier%20League%202007-08"&gt;2007-08 Scottish Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ended in a 3-0 victory for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARangers%20F.C."&gt;Rangers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;a href="Celtic%20F.C."&gt;Celtic&lt;/a&gt;.

The result brings the two clubs level on points at the top of the table, although Rangers are ranked second on goal difference.

The first chance of the match fell to Celtic when Scott McDonald, who played as a lone striker, tried an overhead kick which went wide. However Rangers took the lead when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANacho%20Novo"&gt;Nacho Novo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; headed a goal just inside the half hour mark. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Ferguson"&gt;Barry Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored Rangers' second goal soon after half time, while Novo scored a penalty to add their third with ten minutes remaining.

Rangers manager Walter Smith had claimed last season's derby victories over Celtic meant nothing, because Celtic were already &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; champions in theory. This result could determine if Rangers win the championship, but Smith said that there was a "long way to go" before the title could be decided. Celtic manager Gordon Strachan said that his side had failed to take the chances they made.

It has been announced that &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; is planning to open an official embassy in &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, to signify continuing improvement in relations between the two countries.

&lt;a href="w%3ATeemu%20Tanner"&gt;Teemu Tanner&lt;/a&gt;, director general of &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, said to reporters concerning Finnish President Tarja Halonen’s first visit to Saudi Arabia on Sunday, “One indication of this visit is that you (Saudi Arabia) are planning to open an embassy here in &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;," adding that “We regard this as extremely important for relations,” and that it is only a matter of time before the facility is made available.

Another act set to strengthen diplomatic relations is the planned visit of a trade delegation headed by Saudi Minister of Trade and Commerce &lt;a href="w%3AHashim%20Yamani"&gt;Hashim Yamani&lt;/a&gt;, which will arrive in Finland next month.

“Our relationship is no longer in relation to trade,” said Tanner. “More broadly, we will discuss regional and global issues. It is extremely important for us to know Saudi Arabia’s views on Iraq, Iran, but also issues such as Somalia... One objective of the visit is to convey notes on international questions, as we enter a very interesting phase in the Middle East peace process,” adding that the presidential visit is a relational "landmark" that will "crystallize" Finland’s image to Saudi Arabia.

Despite the comment that the international cooperation is no longer entirely a trade issue, he did point out Saudi Arabia's important role in the Finnish economy as one of the five largest importers of Finnish products. Finland's main exports to Saudi Arabia are mobile phones, paper, wood and machinery, while Saudi Arabia exports large quantities of raw materials for use in manufacturing plastics. The total volume if this trade is estimated to be worth over €840 million.

Other topics on the table for the two nations to discuss during Halonen's visit include &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20energy"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;, the role of science, environmental issues and combating terrorism, as well as other global issues. Tanner has also suggested tourism may be a future area of attention, with a possibility of package holidays for Finnish tourists being organized to Saudi Arabia.

Finland and Saudi Arabia have been officially involved in diplomatic relations since 1969. Finland has maintained an embassy in Saudi Arabia since 1974.

Thousands of civilians fled their homes on Saturday amid fierce fighting between local militias and &lt;a href="w%3ATutsi"&gt;Tutsi&lt;/a&gt;-dominated rebels in the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Mission%20in%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;U.N. peacekeeping mission&lt;/a&gt; there. 

Congolese Army Colonel Delphin Kahimbi said that "very violent attacks" had been reported, and that the fighting was between local militia known as &lt;a href="w%3AMai-Mai"&gt;Mai-Mai&lt;/a&gt; and rebels loyal to renegade &lt;a href="w%3ATutsi"&gt;Tutsi&lt;/a&gt; general &lt;a href="w%3ALaurent%20Nkunda"&gt;Laurent Nkunda&lt;/a&gt;. Major P.K. Tiwari, a military spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission, said the fighting "started early this morning and ended late this afternoon." Tiwari said it was not clear who had attacked first. 

Sylvie Van Den Wildenberg, a spokeswoman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission, described the suffering of civilians caught in the fighting as "unbearable". "What I saw was horrendous. It was raining. They didn't know where to go. Three women gave birth while they were fleeing," she said. "The humanitarian consequences of whatever is happening there are very serious."

Since the beginning of the year, 370,000 people have already fled their homes in the province of &lt;a href="w%3ANord-Kivu"&gt;Nord-Kivu&lt;/a&gt; amid fighting between Congo's army, Rwandan &lt;a href="w%3AHutu"&gt;Hutu&lt;/a&gt; rebels, and rebels loyal to Nkunda. Nkunda accuses Congo's army of supporting the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Forces%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Rwanda"&gt;Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, a primarily Hutu rebel group that includes soldiers responsible for the 1994 &lt;a href="w%3ARwandan%20Genocide"&gt;Rwandan Genocide&lt;/a&gt;. The Congolese army consistently denies this charge.

In a press conference on Wednesday, Congolese President &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Kabila"&gt;Joseph Kabila&lt;/a&gt; said the army had been authorized to prepare military operations to disarm Nkunda's rebels, of which there are approximately 5,000. Kabila has ruled out the possibility of negotiating with Nkunda.

<h2>Thousands flee renewed violence in Congo</h2>

Thousands of civilians fled their homes on Saturday amid fierce fighting between local militias and Tutsi-dominated rebels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the U.N. peacekeeping mission there.

Congolese Army Colonel Delphin Kahimbi said that "very violent attacks" had been reported, and that the fighting was between local militia known as Mai-Mai and rebels loyal to renegade Tutsi general Laurent Nkunda. Major P.K. Tiwari, a military spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission, said the fighting "started early this morning and ended late this afternoon." Tiwari said it was not clear who had attacked first.

<h2>Blast kills 8, injures 126 at a mall in Manila, The Philippines</h2>
Friday's explosion which rocked an upscale mall in the main financial district of the Philippine Capital Manila is under investigation. The explosion damaged the Glorietta Mall in the financial district of Makati and killed at least 8 people and injured at least 126 people.

Authorities ruled out the possibility of a liquid petroleum gas leak and said that a bomb could be the cause of the explosion because the ground investigators say the blast site smelled of gunpowder. Some police intelligence sources say they found traces of C4 explosives at the blast site.

<h2>Mass suspensions and relief of duties after US B-52 flew with armed nuclear missiles</h2>

According to Pentagon officials, nearly 70 United States Air Force personnel and high ranking officials have been relieved from command and or duty after an incident on August 30 when a U.S. B-52H bomber plane flew from Minot Air Force Base located in North Dakota to Louisiana with six armed AGM-129 ACM nuclear missiles attached to its wings.

The missiles were to be taken to Barksdale Air Force Base to be taken out of commission, but were not supposed to be transported on the plane. Instead, the missiles were placed on the planes wings, along with six "dummy missiles," before it took off from Minot AFB. The air force says that this was a "serious error" on the part of the military, and is launching a formal and ongoing investigation.

So far, the investigation states that the missiles loaded onto the plane were supposed to be inspected by looking through a portal on each missile, where a code would determine whether or not the missile was armed or a dummy. The inspector who loaded the missiles onto the plane only looked under the wing where the armed missiles were located and the plane's navigator also failed to perform a proper inspection.

U.S. air force officials state that there was no threat of a nuclear explosion had the plane crashed, but that a radiation leak was possible.

<h2>Half of life could go extinct by century's end, warn eminent biologists</h2>

In a "fireside chat" at Yale University on Wednesday, prominent naturalists Edward O. Wilson and Peter H. Raven predicted dire consequences for the planet's biodiversity and habitability unless current trends in consumption and environmental degradation are reversed. The two scientists were awarded the Addison Emery Verrill Medal by the Peabody Museum of Natural History for their contributions to natural science before a capacity crowd at Yale's Sprague Hall. Both are known for their environmental activism as well as extensive research and popular writing.

<h2>US stock markets tumble on 'Black Monday' anniversary</h2>
Some say history tends to repeat itself. Saturday marked a day in history, when 20 years ago, the United States Dow Jones Industrial Average market crashed, on what is known as 'Black Monday'. The crash sent the market tumbling down 508 points, losing nearly 24%. On Friday, the Dow Jones nearly broke that record when the market closed at -366.94 points, down almost three percent.

Several factors could be to blame for the loss, one being Turkey's government approving a measure on October 18 to send Turkish troops into Iraq and the fears over the U.S. housing market which has caused Caterpillar Inc, a leading construction equipment company to issue a warning that the standstill would cause profits to drop, resulting in the American economy to be severely hurt. On Friday their stocks lost nearly six percent to close at $73.57.

<h2>South African reggae star Lucky Dube shot dead in attempted carjacking</h2>
An attempted carjacking Thursday evening in Johannesburg has left famous South African reggae star Lucky Dube dead. He was dropping his children off in the suburb of Rosettenville when he was attacked.

Police said that three gunshots were fired through the car window, injuring Dube. His children were out of the car at the time. An injured Dube then attempted to drive his car away from the area, but hit a tree soon after. He died at the scene. The police suspect that three people were responsible for the attack.

There has been an outrage in South Africa and around the world over the killing. Many radio stations were flooded with calls from tearful fans condemning the attack. Lucky Dube was one of the most prominent and influential reggae artists of his time - often remembered alongside Bob Marley for his songs on social issues. 

<h2>Man throws red paint in Roman Trevi fountain to protest film festival</h2>
To protest the 15 million euro budget of the RomeFilmFest, a man on Friday threw a bucket of red paint into the famous Trevi Fountain in Rome, before fleeing the scene. The water in the fountain turned complete red for a while, before technicians were able to cut off the water supply, let the dye wash out, and then replace it with fresh water.

Pamphlets by a previously unknown group called ATM Azionefuturista 2007 were found near the fountain, protesting the budget the festival was awarded which the group protested as inadequate to merely a red carpet event. 

<h2>South Africa defeats England 15 - 6 to win the 2007 Rugby World Cup</h2>
And finally in sports, South Africa has beaten England 15-6 in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final at the Stade de France or Stadium of France in Saint-Denis, France.

On Saturday, it was announced that the first non-white Governor had been elected for the State of &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in over 100 years. He is also the youngest Governor ever elected in Louisiana.

&lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Jindal"&gt;Bobby Jindal&lt;/a&gt;, 36, an &lt;a href="w%3AIndian-American"&gt;Indian-American&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;, won the election receiving 54% of the votes, with the nearest opponent, Walter Boasso having only 18% of all votes.

"Let's give our homeland, the great state of Louisiana, a fresh start. They can either go quietly or they can go loudly, but either way, they will go," said Jindal during his victory speech. He plans to improve education throughout the state and cut taxes.

The local and statewide results from Louisiana's primary election yesterday have cast doubt upon the theory that the Republican Party was injured politically from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

Jindal will be sworn in as the fifty-sixth Governor of Louisiana on &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary%2014"&gt;January 14&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2008"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;.

After "Taiwan Orbis &amp; &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20Chartered%20Bank"&gt;Standard Chartered Bank&lt;/a&gt; Charity Walking" last week at &lt;a href="w%3AGuandu%20Nature%20Park"&gt;Guandu Nature Park&lt;/a&gt;, the main organizer &lt;a href="w%3AAlcon"&gt;Alcon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; held a hiking activity with "Love Your Eyes Without Computing" topic at Taipei Municipal Fude Elementary School and Tiger Mountain Trail in Taipei City, Taiwan. This is the third year Alcon Taiwan held a similar activity after hiking last year and 5KM running around Taipei City Hall two years ago.

At the Press Conference two weeks ago, Alcon Taiwan announced a questionnaire about "Acknowledgment on Eye-Caring and Eyes for PC Screen in Taiwan". According to the questionnaire, lots of people especially younger people watched PC screen more than seven hours and caused a bad phenomenon in Taiwan. That's why Alcon Taiwan named this hiking activity slogan as "Love Your Eyes Without Computing". Alcon Taiwan hoped people in Taiwan can reduce computing hours and rest appropriately.

The main organizer invited Taiwanese famous entertainer Sun Peng and Di Ying supporting and named as "Eye-Caring Ambassadors". Sun mentioned on restrictions and policies with his family to keep a good eyesight at their family. He hoped his children have a bright future with a good eyesight.

"With a serious condition on red-eye symptom in Taiwan, lots of people may have a worse result without correct treatments and acknowledgments, if anyone affected this symptom, that one should go to hospital for the treatment with medical professionals", Sheng-mou Ho (Minister of Department of Health, Executive Yuan of R.O.C., Taiwan) remarked. "The ages of nearsightedness people is progressively decreasing, it caused diopters of younger people increasing progressively. Parents should tell their children about correct acknowledgments on eye-caring for their future."

After the hiking activity, organizers and sponsors set gaming and eye checking-up booths for participants and also held seminars to provide the how-to with good eyesight keeping. In the main stage, not only shows and performances, the organizer also held a creative modeling show to encourage participants absorbing good nutritions for a good eyesight.

<h1>Wildfires burn in southern California</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wildfires%20burn%20in%20southern%20California&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

<h3>Los Angeles Area:</h3>
Wildfires in &lt;a href="w%3AMalibu%2C%20California"&gt;Malibu, California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; have forced the evacuation of the campus of &lt;a href="w%3APepperdine%20University"&gt;Pepperdine University&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several celebrity homes, and more than 250,000 people in San Diego County; after more than 250,000 acres burned in Southern California. High winds and low humidity in the area have only helped to strengthen the fire.

Additionally, firefighters are currently having a difficult time getting in to Malibu, as the only road that leads in to the area is the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Route%201"&gt;Pacific Coast Highway&lt;/a&gt;, which often sees heavy traffic, although it has been closed between Kanan Road and Topanga Canyon Boulevard. Currently, 700 firefighters are working on fighting the blaze. The fire has burned about 4400 acres so far and 15 homes have been lost, however there have been no reported injuries or deaths. The Los Angeles County Fire Department reports the blaze is 15% contained, with 100% containment predicted by Friday, October 26.

Other Los Angeles County wildfires are burning in Agua Dulce (~10,000 acres), Chatsworth, and Castaic. 

<h3>San Diego County:</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego, California, USA&lt;/a&gt; fires are burning at Witch Creek and at Potrero in San Diego County. The Witch Creek fire, as of 5:50 AM PDT Monday, has burned 8000 acres, and has merged with another fire near the San Diego Wild Animal Park. The city of &lt;a href="w%3ARamona%2C%20California"&gt;Ramona, California, USA&lt;/a&gt; is under mandatory evacuation and authorities have ordered evacuations in &lt;a href="w%3ARancho%20Bernardo%2C%20California"&gt;Rancho Bernardo, California, USA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APoway%2C%20California"&gt;Poway, California, USA&lt;/a&gt; as the fires surge west. So far, over 250,000 people have been evacuated in San Diego County.

Additional fires are now being reported in &lt;a href="w%3AFallbrook%2C%20California"&gt;Fallbrook, California, USA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Marcos%2C%20California"&gt;San Marcos, California, USA&lt;/a&gt;. The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services (OES) advised residents north of state Route 56, south of Del Dios Highway, west of Interstate 15 and east of Interstate 5 to evacuate, as of 8:32 AM PDT Monday. Since Del Dios Highway is a short north-south segment, it is not clear what OES' intended northern boundary was. &lt;a href="w%3AQualcomm_Stadium"&gt;Qualcomm Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in Mission Valley is opening as an evacuation center.

As of 7:32 a.m. PDT Monday, authorities are reporting 18,000 acres burning in San Diego County, with 0% containment.

As of 10:16 a.m. PDT Monday, 250,000 people have been evacuated from their homes. &lt;a href="w%3ARancho%20Santa%20Fe%2C%20California"&gt;Rancho Santa Fe, California, USA&lt;/a&gt; was ordered emptied, while dozen of homes were on fire in &lt;a href="w%3ARanch%20Bernardo%2C%20California"&gt;Ranch Bernardo, California, USA&lt;/a&gt;.

As of 10:32 a.m. PDT Monday, the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia_Highway_Patrol"&gt;CHP&lt;/a&gt; advises that &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2015"&gt;Interstate 15&lt;/a&gt; is still closed in both directions between state Route 78 and state Route 56

As of 1:45 p.m. PDT Monday, evacuations were ordered for &lt;a href="w%3AScripps%20Ranch"&gt;Scripps Ranch, California, USA&lt;/a&gt;, specifically "Everything south of Scripps Poway Parkway, North of MCAS Miramar, East of Interstate 15, West of Highway 67." This evacuation comes almost four years to the day after the &lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20Fire"&gt;Cedar Fire of 2003&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Orange County:</h3>

In Orange County, a 3800-acre fire is burning in Silverado Canyon.

California governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; has declared a state of emergency.

Finally, the highly &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Formula%20One%20espionage%20controversy"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; and enthralling &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Formula%20One%20season"&gt;2007 season&lt;/a&gt; came to an unexpected close. It was Ferrari who catched the Constructors' championship at &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Belgian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren team&lt;/a&gt; and now ended their drivers domination.

The weekend starts by &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; won the pole position, proving himself able to win his home race for the second time since &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Hamilton"&gt;Lewis Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; showed second result aiming to secure his first place in the championship.

Still, the start became just a first nuisance for Lewis, when Massa and Kimi together closed the gate for him and in the next turn his teammate &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; obviously denied Lewis to pass him, and the English driver went out in the field. Lewis rolled back, but after eight laps suffered a bigger problem with his gearbox losing even more positions.

It became clear by that time that not only Fernando, but even Kimi, has a chance to win the season. The possibly last word was said by Massa, who returned from second pit stop to give up the lead to Kimi. Some flying laps by the Finn and he secured his win of the race.

Lewis was also flying though. Like &lt;a href="Massa%20wins%202006%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix%2C%20Alonso%20and%20Renault%20win%20championships"&gt;Michael Schumacher chasing Alonso&lt;/a&gt; in 2006 he overtook a number of drivers as McLaren changed his flight plan to three pit stops. But this was actually not enough to prevent Kimi of winning the season with 110 points, only ♡❤♡1♡❤♡ crucial point ahead both Alonso and Hamilton (109 pts).

The closing stages of the race saw a battle of &lt;a href="w%3ANico%20Rosberg"&gt;Nico Rosberg&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamsF1"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AToyota%20F1"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; car with both &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt;, German driver stayed in front of &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt;.

Lewis finished only 7th in one lap behind the leader. Top eight closed by &lt;a href="w%3AJarno%20Trulli"&gt;Jarno Trulli&lt;/a&gt;'s Toyota, last driver who was overtaken by no more a rooky Hamilton.

<h1>Bush and Putin suggest potential for World War III</h1>

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; have been in a war of words this week, with Bush suggesting that the &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian nuclear program could be the lynchpin for launching &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20III"&gt;World War III&lt;/a&gt;.

"So I’ve told people that, if you’re interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon" and "we got a leader in Iran who has announced that he wants to destroy &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. My intent is to continue to rally the world, to send a focused signal to the Iranian government that we will continue to work to isolate you in the hopes that at some point somebody else shows up and says it’s not worth the isolation," said Bush during a press conference.

The Tehran Times responded to Bush reporting that "either Bush has gone totally mad and now makes statements without consulting his advisors, or the neo-conservatives are dreaming of a new world order and no longer feel compelled to hide their goal and U.S. officials should put a muzzle on Bush to prevent him from giving people the impression that the United States is the main threat to world peace."

Putin in a telephone question and answer session advises that Russia is developing a "big, grandiose" plan to boost the country's defenses with new types of nuclear weapons to defeat the U.S. anti-missile system based in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.

"Our plans are not simply considerable, but huge. At the same time they are absolutely realistic. I have no doubts we will accomplish them. I can assure you that such steps are being prepared and we will take them," stated Putin.

Analysts said Mr Putin's latest remarks were designed to reassure his public that Russia still had an effective nuclear deterrent. But they were also a message to Washington: that its new and costly missile shield was effectively useless against the latest Russian technology.

Putin even suggested that the U.S. might be after Siberia’s resources and the U.S. has considered invading Russia. One thing Putin was certain of is that there are quite a few politicians in the United States who engage in what he described as "political erotica," something that "may or may not give pleasure to people, but is unlikely to generate any results," Putin added.

Fans of the &lt;a href="America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3AAerosmith"&gt;Aerosmith&lt;/a&gt; have launched legal action against the band in response to a late cancellation of a scheduled concert on the &lt;a href="w%3AHawaiian%20Islands"&gt;Hawaiian Island&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMaui"&gt;Maui&lt;/a&gt;.

Attorney Brandee Faria filed a &lt;a href="w%3Aclass%20action%20suit"&gt;class action suit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii%20State%20Circuit%20Courts"&gt;Hawaii Circuit Court&lt;/a&gt; on October 19. The suit alleges that the band's cancellation cost fans between US$500,000 (€349,944) and $3 million (€2.1 million) in travel and accommodation costs, as well as other related expenses.

The sold-out September 26 Maui concert - originally planned months before as the final show of a world tour that began in &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; in April - was canceled by the band on the basis that they could not make it to the island in time after a September 24 concert in &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. The Chicago concert, which attracted 18,000 people, was rescheduled at the last minute after the original September 10 concert date had been postponed due to illness.

The band canceled the show at Maui's &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Hawaii%29"&gt;War Memorial Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, which was set to be attended by 9,000 people, and apologized to fans. The band's management company, HK Management Inc., gave no initial reason when they canceled on September 20, but blamed logistical reasons by the next day. 

However, just days later, on September 29, the band traveled to the neighbor island of &lt;a href="w%3AOahu"&gt;Oahu&lt;/a&gt; to play a corporate event in &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; for car dealers and private guests. An audience of 6,000 people celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Japanese automobile manufacturer at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Hawaii"&gt;University of Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, with Toyota paying $500,000 (€349,944) to hire the campus. Aerosmith received $1 million (€700,000) to perform at the event. Faria alleges that Aerosmith abandoned the scheduled public concert on Maui in favor of the more lucrative corporate event on Oahu.

"...Defendants simply canceled the only public performance by Aerosmith in favor of the larger Chicago venue and the lucrative, private concert for the Toyota car dealers," the complaint states.

Local officials had hoped the concert would attract other big names to the island.

Faria said that "I've had people contact me being out of pocket at much as $800 or $900," adding that if the cancellation is found to be deceptive ticket holders may be eligible for a minimum of $1,000 each. The complaint also says that those aged 62 or over should receive at least $5,000 each. Currently about a dozen ticket holders are involved with the suit. If the action is approved by a judge, steps will be taken to contact everyone who purchased a ticket.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Turkey%20preparing%20for%20incursion%20into%20Iraq%20after%20PKK%20militants%20kill%2017%20soldiers&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

As many as 17 &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; soldiers were killed and 16 were injured in an ambush after &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Workers%20Party"&gt;Kurdish militants&lt;/a&gt; (PKK) attacked the patrol in Hakkari Province on the Iraq-Turkey border. As a result, a large battle erupted and at least 32 Kurdish militants were killed.

"Although it respects Iraq's territorial integrity, Turkey will not tolerate that terrorism be aided and abetted and will not be afraid to pay, whatever the price may be, to protect its rights, its indivisible unity and its citizens. The fight against the separatist terrorist organization will be waged with determination until the very end," said Turkey's top officials in a statement issued to the media, after an emergency meeting was held in regards to the battle.

Turkey has been building up troops along its border with Iraq with reports suggesting as many as 60,000 are currently stationed there. On Wednesday, Turkey approved a measure that authorized sending troops into Iraq to take out PKK militants, but on Sunday an official said that the incursion into Iraq was not urgent.

"There are plans to cross the border, but not urgently. We'd like to do these things with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt;," said Turkish defense minister, Vecdi Gonul.

The U.S. has stated repeatedly that they are against any military action against the PKK and believe that it would cause even more instability in the region.

"These attacks are unacceptable and must stop now. Attacks from Iraqi territory need to be dealt with swiftly by the Iraqi government and Kurdish regional authorities," said a spokesman for U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, Gordon Johndroe.

Iraq has spoken out against the attacks by the PKK and has condemned any such attacks on Turkish soldiers saying "Iraq's parliament unanimously votes to condemn the threat of using force to solve the dispute. It feels that the Turkish parliament's decision to use force does not boost bilateral relations."

Leaders in the Kurdish controlled areas of Iraq state that any attack on them would be met with retaliation.

<h1>Teacher sexual misconduct rampant in American schools, says AP</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Teacher%20sexual%20misconduct%20rampant%20in%20American%20schools%2C%20says%20AP&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;♡❤Associated Press♡❤&lt;/a&gt; investigation published Sunday revealed findings of more than 2,500 cases of &lt;a href="w%3Asexual%20misconduct"&gt;sexual misconduct&lt;/a&gt; by educators in the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20educational%20system"&gt;American educational system&lt;/a&gt; over a five year period. 

The cases reported in the investigation ranged from the merely strange, with cases involving &lt;a href="w%3Averbal%20abuse"&gt;verbal abuse&lt;/a&gt;, to the barbarous, with cases involving &lt;a href="w%3Amolestation"&gt;molestation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Arape"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt;.

Investigations suggest that many cases of &lt;a href="w%3Asexual%20abuse"&gt;sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt; are never reported, and those that are reported often do not lead to punishment for the offender. The cases do not always include enough evidence, and for this as well as other reasons the schools, courts, &lt;a href="w%3Astate%20government"&gt;state government&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href="w%3Afederal%20government"&gt;federal government&lt;/a&gt;s cannot be sure that they are keeping sexual deviants out of teaching.

Certain academic studies estimate that only about ten percent of victimized children report sexual abuse of any kind to a person who can take action to help them. When sexual misconduct is reported, teachers, &lt;a href="w%3Aadministrators"&gt;administrators&lt;/a&gt; and some parents frequently cannot, either subconsciously or consciously, recognize the warning signs of a crime.

After examining records in all 50 states and the &lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20of%20Columbia"&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, the AP found that 2,570 educators had their &lt;a href="w%3Ateaching%20licenses"&gt;teaching licenses&lt;/a&gt; taken away, denied, surrendered voluntarily or restricted from the period of 2001 through 2005, all as a result of sexual misconduct allegations.

&lt;a href="w%3AMinors"&gt;Minors&lt;/a&gt; were the victims in at least 1,801 of the cases, and more than 80 percent of those minors were students of the accused criminals. More than half of the educators who were disciplined by their state governments were consequently convicted of crimes related to the allegations of misconduct.

The cases that the AP found were those of all types of educators -- teachers, school &lt;a href="w%3Apsychologists"&gt;psychologists&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="w%3Aprincipal"&gt;principal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3Asuperintendent"&gt;superintendent&lt;/a&gt;s. The accused are often popular with students and parents, and are widely perceived as good teachers. In nearly 90 percent if the cases, the offenders are male. While certain educators were accused of sexual misconduct in school, others were cited for abuse that occurred after hours and did not always involve one of their own students. At least 446 of the cases uncovered by the AP involved educators with multiple victims.

A preponderance of cases involved teachers in &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20schools"&gt;public schools&lt;/a&gt; since many &lt;a href="w%3Aprivate%20schools"&gt;private schools&lt;/a&gt; do not require their teachers to be licensed and most private schools do not allow their disciplinary records to be publicly viewed.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Federation%20of%20Teachers"&gt;American Federation of Teachers&lt;/a&gt; (AFT) and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Education%20Association"&gt;National Education Association&lt;/a&gt; (NEA), two large teaching unions, each decried sexual abuse while pinpointing the importance of considering educators' rights.

"If there's one incident of sexual misconduct between a teacher and a student that's one too many," Kathy Buzad of the AFT told the Associated Press.

"Students must be protected from sexual predators and abuse, and teachers must be protected from false accusations," said NEA President Reg Weaver in a press release.

However, while the AP found attempts to stop particular offenders, it also discovered a firm resistance towards identifying and preventing abuse. In schools, fellow teachers often ignore the abuse or feel they cannot help. School administrators cut backdoor deals to sidestep &lt;a href="w%3Alawsuits"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; or bad press. And in state governments and &lt;a href="w%3ACongress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;, lawmakers are weary to impose harsher punishments or any national policy in fear of harming an important profession. 

For example, in the state of &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; some of the most &lt;a href="w%3Asadistic"&gt;sadistic&lt;/a&gt; sex abuse is flagged, but state law allows a multitude of offenses to remain confidential in disciplinary records, even when teachers are sentenced to imprisonment and become &lt;a href="w%3Aregistered%20sex%20offender"&gt;registered sex offender&lt;/a&gt;s. 

The dearth of information is evidence of a system of disciplining teachers that, nationwide, is often cloaked in secrecy. It is difficult for states to share necessary information about those accused of misconduct and allows some to find classroom jobs in other states.

An additional problem is that while the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20State%20Directors%20of%20Teacher%20Education%20and%20Certification"&gt;National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification&lt;/a&gt; maintains a listing of educators who've been disciplined for any reason, it only shares this information with other state agencies. Also, many teachers do not appear on the list because they resign before losing their licenses.

"(Schools) might deal with it internally, suspending the person or having the person move on. So their license is never investigated," says Charol Shakeshaft, an expert in educational sexual abuse who leads &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Commonwealth%20University"&gt;Virginia Commonwealth University&lt;/a&gt;'s educational leadership department.

"There is the possibility that one of these people could move to another jurisdiction, most likely another state, and you wouldn't be able to find out their history," says Todd Spitzer, a Californian &lt;a href="w%3Aassemblyman"&gt;assemblyman&lt;/a&gt;, former prosecutor, and former high school English teacher. 

Another disturbing trend is that cases of misconduct seem to be on the rise in many places. According to a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20State%20Education%20Department"&gt;New York State Education Department&lt;/a&gt; report, the number of "moral misconduct" accusations against educators in New York has doubled in five years. In 2005, 134 cases of “moral misconduct” were reported involving teachers and other school employees, as compared to just 70 cases in 2001. According to an overview of the cases, almost 75 percent of the “moral conduct” cases involved sexual acts or an improper relationship. In all, 485 misconduct cases occurred over the five year period in New York state.

The AP's national analysis shows &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and California with the most sexual misconduct cases, each with two to three times as many cases as New York. &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; proved about the same as New York.

Mary Green, a parent in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20County%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Washington County&lt;/a&gt; who rallied against a teacher she suspected of misconduct, says the key to stopping the abuse is listening. 

“If a child says such-and-such a person, teacher, coach or neighbor is `weird,' the parent should not simply dismiss this comment, but have the child explain why the person is weird,” she said. “Often we simply shush them without finding out why the child feels that way. People tend to think it won't happen to them.”

In a speech on Sunday, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; warned that &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; will face "serious consequences" if it refuses to stop enriching uranium. In his speech, Cheney also accused Iran of being "the world’s most active sponsor of state terrorism," and called Iran's government "a growing obstacle to peace in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;."

"The Iranian regime needs to know that if it stays on its present course, the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences," Cheney said in a speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Studies, without specifying whether those consequences would include military action. "The United States joins other nations in sending a clear message: We will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon," he said.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Ali%20Hosseini"&gt;Mohammad Ali Hosseini&lt;/a&gt; said today that Iran's nuclear policies are "unalterable" and that terminating Iran's nuclear program "isn't on the agenda and won't be." Iran maintains that it is developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, a position that has been backed by &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;.

In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;♡❤CNN♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. Representative &lt;a href="w%3AJane%20Harman"&gt;Jane Harman&lt;/a&gt; (D-Calif.) said the language being used by the Bush administration is "very dangerous" and recommended stronger U.N. sanctions as an alternative to "war-mongering threats." "We heard about mushroom clouds and other images before the military action in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. I wish the president would avoid that," she said.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Red%20Sox"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; are once again headed to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Series"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; after being down three games to one. The Red Sox were most recently in the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20World%20Series"&gt;2004 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, which they won.

Last night's game ended with the Red Sox winning 11-2 over the Cleveland Indians. The $103 million rookie import from Japan, &lt;a href="w%3ADaisuke%20Matsuzaka"&gt;Daisuke Matsuzaka&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANickname"&gt;nicknamed&lt;/a&gt; "Dice-K"), pitched five innings for Boston, allowing two runs on six hits. Cleveland's &lt;a href="w%3AJake%20Westbrook"&gt;Jake Westbrook&lt;/a&gt; started and took the loss. This proved to be a much better showing for Boston's "Dice-K" than his previous outing, which Boston lost.

The Sox jumped out to a quick lead, scoring a run in each of the first three innings on a single by &lt;a href="w%3AManny%20Ramirez"&gt;Manny Ramirez&lt;/a&gt;, a sacrifice ground-out by &lt;a href="w%3AJulio%20Lugo"&gt;Julio Lugo&lt;/a&gt;, and a sacrifice fly by &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Lowell"&gt;Mike Lowell&lt;/a&gt;. The Indians scored their first run on a &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Garko"&gt;Ryan Garko&lt;/a&gt; double in the fourth inning, and a &lt;a href="w%3AGrady%20Sizemore"&gt;Grady Sizemore&lt;/a&gt; sacrifice fly in the fifth made the score 3-2 in favor of the Sox.

In the sixth inning, &lt;a href="w%3AHideki%20Okajima"&gt;Hideki Okajima&lt;/a&gt; came in to relieve "Dice-K" and pitched two scoreless innings before &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Papelbon"&gt;Jonathan Papelbon&lt;/a&gt; came in to close in the eighth. He entered the game with runners on first and second and no outs, but quickly retired the side and in the ninth managed to maintain the nine run lead, once again giving fans a performance of his &lt;a href="w%3ARiverdance"&gt;Riverdance&lt;/a&gt; style victory dance. 

In the seventh inning, Red Sox rookie second baseman &lt;a href="w%3ADustin%20Pedroia"&gt;Dustin Pedroia&lt;/a&gt; hit a two-run home run off of &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Betancourt"&gt;Rafael Betancourt&lt;/a&gt; that drove Boston's Fenway Park wild. Boston scored a total of 6 runs in a crazy eighth inning, on a single by J.D. Drew, a three-run double by Pedroia, and a two-run &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Youkilis"&gt;Kevin Youkilis&lt;/a&gt; home run which bounced off a large &lt;a href="w%3ACoca-Cola"&gt;Coke bottle&lt;/a&gt; advertisement. Betancourt gave up the first four runs, with the home run allowed by &lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Lewis"&gt;Jenson Lewis&lt;/a&gt;. Youkilis was the first batter he faced in relief of Betancourt.

The Sox will go on to face the &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%20Rockies"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt;, the surging &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20League"&gt;National League Champions&lt;/a&gt;. The series will begin October 24th, with the first game at &lt;a href="w%3AFenway%20Park"&gt;Fenway Park&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Cheney warns of 'serious consequences' of Iran's nuclear ambitions</h2>

In a speech on Sunday, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney warned that Iran will face "serious consequences" if it refuses to stop enriching uranium. In his speech, Cheney also accused Iran of being "the world’s most active sponsor of state terrorism," and called Iran's government "a growing obstacle to peace in the Middle East."

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said today that Iran's nuclear policies are "unalterable" and that terminating Iran's nuclear program "isn't on the agenda and won't be." Iran maintains that it is developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, a position that has been backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

<h2>Turkey preparing for incursion into Iraq after PKK militants kill 17 soldiers</h2>

As many as 17 Turkish soldiers were killed and 16 were injured in an ambush on Sunday after Iraqi Kurdish militants (PKK) attacked the patrol in Hakkari Province on the Iraq-Turkey border. As a result, a large battle erupted and at least 32 Kurdish militants were killed.

Turkey has been building up troops along its border with Iraq with reports suggesting as many as 60,000 are currently stationed there. On Wednesday, Turkey approved a measure that authorized sending troops into Iraq to take out PKK militants, but on Sunday an official said that the incursion into Iraq was not urgent.

The U.S. and Iraq have stated repeatedly that they are against any military action against the PKK and believe that it would cause even more instability in the region.

Leaders in the Kurdish controlled areas of Iraq state that any attack on them would be met with retaliation.

<h2>First non-white Governor elected in Louisiana in over 100 years</h2>

On Saturday, it was announced that the first non-white Governor had been elected for the State of Louisiana in the United States in over 100 years. He is also the youngest Governor ever elected in Louisiana.

Bobby Jindal, 36, an Indian-American and Republican, won the election receiving 54% of the votes, with the nearest opponent, Walter Boasso having only 18% of all votes. Jindal plans to improve education throughout the state and cut taxes.

Interestingly, the local and statewide results from Louisiana's primary election yesterday have cast doubt upon the theory that the Republican Party was injured politically from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

<h2>Teacher sexual misconduct rampant in American schools, says AP</h2>

An Associated Press investigation published Sunday revealed findings of more than 2,500 cases of sexual misconduct from minor to extreme types, by educators in the American educational system over a five year period.

Investigations suggest that many cases of sexual abuse are never reported, and those that are reported often do not lead to punishment for the offender. The cases do not always include enough evidence, and for this as well as other reasons the schools, courts, state governments, and federal governments cannot be sure that they are keeping sexual deviants out of teaching.

Certain academic studies estimate that only about 10 percent of victimized children report sexual abuse of any kind to a person who can take action to help them but when reported, teachers, administrators and some parents frequently cannot recognize the warning signs of a crime.

The full report is available online.

With &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; facing off in a leader's debate on Sunday night, political analysts and body language experts declared Mr Rudd the clear victor. Experts said that Mr Rudd came across as believable and enthusiastic while Mr Howard appeared too negative.

The focus of the debate was on the economy, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt;, leadership and climate change.

On the economy, the Labor leader said that the cost of living had increased in Australia and that increasing the childcare rebate to 50 percent would help struggling families.

"That's putting several thousand dollars extra into the family budget," he said.

The Prime Minister tried to reassure voters on industrial relations, one of the key topics of the election, saying that despite his &lt;a href="w%3AWorkChoices"&gt;WorkChoices&lt;/a&gt; legislation being controversial it has largely achieved what the government aimed it to do. "Our whole design with WorkChoices was to underpin further growth in the Australian economy. It wasn't easy. It was heavily criticised, but the general evidence is WorkChoices has been good for the Australian economy," said the Prime Minister.

Mr Howard also ruled out making further changes to Australia's industrial relations system saying that the government had "gone far enough".

Mr Howard also dismissed claims that his planned AU$34 billion of tax cuts would cause inflation and a rise in interest rates.

"They will dampen wage demands that might otherwise be much stronger because of those cost of living pressures," he said.

The leaders debated over who the genuine economic conservative was. Mr Howard said that Mr Rudd's voting record in parliament seemed to contradict his claim. The Prime Minister warned that a Labor government would run budget deficits. "Being an economic conservative is more than a slogan in a TV advertisement, it is believing in things," he said.

"Everyone knows Labor governments equal budget deficits and Liberal governments mean budget surpluses."

Mr Rudd said there was now consensus between both sides of politics on economic issues and took the opportunity to remind voters of Mr Howard's performance as treasurer in the &lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Fraser"&gt;Fraser&lt;/a&gt; government of the late 1970s to early 1980s. Mr Rudd said that the prime minister was a treasurer at a time of high interest rates and ran four out of five budgets with deficits. "Let's have some honesty on the table here. Let's get the record straight," said Rudd.

Mr Howard dismissed his record attacking Labor's record of interest rates in the 1980s under &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Hawke"&gt;Bob Hawke&lt;/a&gt;. "There is one interest rate figure that is seared in the memory of most Australian families - the level of 17 per cent," he said.

The Prime Minister attacked the Opposition's front bench saying that there were far too many former union members. Mr Rudd hit back by saying that Mr Howard's frontbench was disproportionate in its make up. "If something's out of whack in terms of an unrepresentative group in the community, a cocktail of lawyers and former Liberal Party staffers would have to be high up the list," he said.

The Prime Minister also used the forum to announce new climate change initiatives and an update of the role Australia is playing in Iraq. Mr Howard promised that low-income earners would be compensated for the "inevitable" rise in costs for electricity that moving to cleaner production would bring. By comparison the Labor leader reiterated his support for the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20protocol"&gt;Kyoto protocol&lt;/a&gt; and promised to ratify it if elected.

Mr Howard said that Australian commanders in Iraq would this week start discussing taking on a broader training role in Iraq to help train Iraqi soldiers.

Rudd questioned Howard on the shift of policies in Iraq and asked the Prime Minister why Australians should believe him after ruling out an increase in troop numbers before the last election, only to double them when elected. The comments sparked an argument between the two leaders with Mr Howard accusing Mr Rudd of involving the military in politics.

"You chose to use it in a very political fashion. I was providing some information to the Australian people and I was pointing out the evolving nature of the commitment of our ground forces in Iraq," said Howard.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AA-League"&gt;A-League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20FC"&gt;Sydney FC&lt;/a&gt; has sacked manager &lt;a href="w%3ABranko%20%C4%8Culina"&gt;Branko Čulina&lt;/a&gt;, nine rounds into the &lt;a href="w%3A2007-08%20A-League%20season"&gt;2007-08 season&lt;/a&gt;.

Čulina was appointed following &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Butcher"&gt;Terry Butcher&lt;/a&gt;'s sacking at the end of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006-07%20A-League%20season"&gt;2006-07 season&lt;/a&gt;, after Sydney played unattractive football and only managed to finish fourth in the eight-team competition.

Čulina began his managament career at the &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Albans%20Saints"&gt;St Albans Saints&lt;/a&gt; in 1989, following a successful career as a player which concluded at the same club. He has since managed seven other major teams, including the very successful &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20United"&gt;Sydney United&lt;/a&gt;, before his appointment to Sydney FC.

According to reports, he was summoned to Sydney FC headquarters on the afternoon of October 22 (&lt;a href="w%3AAEST"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt;), before being told his services were no longer required. Čulina, having been appointed prior to Sydney's first incursion into &lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20Football%20Confederation"&gt;Asian club football&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20AFC%20Champions%20League"&gt;2007 AFC Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, only served six months of his two year contract.

His former team sit in sixth place, having won just two of a total of nine A-League games this season. They currently sit four points from the top four, which grants entry into the &lt;a href="w%3AA-League%23Format"&gt;final series&lt;/a&gt;, after nine of twenty-one rounds.

In &lt;a href="Bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, two unnamed &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Navy"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt; sailors were killed and one other was seriously injured when they were shot inside their &lt;a href="w%3Abarracks"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; at around 5:00 a.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC%2B3"&gt;UTC+3&lt;/a&gt;) at a naval base located in Bahrain. The Navy has stated that the incident is isolated and is not considered an act of terrorism.

The injured sailor was taken to a hospital to receive medical attention, while the two dead sailors were pronounced dead at the scene of the crime.

So far reports say that all involved parties are American and that the incident was a "domestic" dispute between at least two female U.S. Navy sailors.

Bahrain is home to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Fifth%20Fleet"&gt;Fifth Fleet&lt;/a&gt; which is part of the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Naval%20Forces%20Central%20Command"&gt;U.S. Naval Forces Central Command&lt;/a&gt;. At least 3,000 sailors are stationed there, but that number does not include the troops on ships currently docked at the Mina Sulman pier.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; Treasurer, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; has attacked the opposition &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; party's tax cuts saying they contain a "basic error". The error Mr Costello claims could cost 45 percent of Australians an additional AU$600 a year in tax.

Speaking at a joint press conference with the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Costello accused Labor of failing to increase tax thresholds. "In order to meet the goal of having 45 per cent of taxpayers on a 15 cent threshold or less you have to keep lifting those thresholds ... and they made a basic error," said the Treasurer.

"They understood you had to keep lifting the low income tax offset because they adopted that but they made a fundamental and basic error in not lifting those other thresholds."

Mr Costello said Mr Rudd has ignored the problem by admitting the error and adjusting his tax thresholds. "He refused to admit the error and as a consequence 45 per cent of Australians will be worse off," he said.

Mr Costello accused Mr Rudd of using his announcement of an increased childcare rebate to distract voters from errors in his tax policy. "He went on to announce changes to the childcare rebate to draw attention away from his blunder," the treasurer said.

Mr Costello accused Labor of copying it's policy and says that the parts the government didn't release are those on which Labor made errors.

Labor has dismissed the claims, saying that voters only needed to look at Mr Costello's history on tax.

He said Mr Costello is desperately trying to kick the tax debate along, but should have a good look at his own record.

"It's time Mr Costello got real about tax reform," said Mr Rudd.

"If he was a reforming Treasurer after 11 years he would have taken a meat axe to rates, what has he always done? Fiddle faddled, and fiddle faddled around on the whole question of thresholds, that's all he's ever done."

A final report released today has found &lt;a href="w%3Apilot%20error"&gt;pilot error&lt;/a&gt; to be the cause of the crash of &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; on March 7, 2007. 21 people were killed when the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737&lt;/a&gt; airliner, carrying 140 people, overshot the runway at &lt;a href="w%3AAdisucipto%20International%20Airport"&gt;Adisucipto International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;. It crossed a road and then struck an embankment, bursting into flames, before stopping in a rice field, some 252m from the end of the runway.

The pilot is found to have been singing as he began the final descent, in direct contradiction to the Garuda Basic Operations Manual, which calls for activation of the &lt;a href="w%3ASterile%20Cockpit%20Rule"&gt;Sterile Cockpit Rule&lt;/a&gt; at 10,000 feet and below.

The pilot was probably emotionally aroused because his conscious awareness moved from the relaxed mode “singing” to the heightened stressfulness of the desire to reach the runway by making an excessively steep and fast, unstabilised approach,” the report continued. However, it does say that he was fully aware that something was wrong during the approach, as he is recorded as having said “Oh, there is something not right.”

The report found that that the aircraft was flown by the pilot in command at a speed far exceeding that at which the &lt;a href="w%3AFlap%20%28aircraft%29"&gt;wing flaps&lt;/a&gt; were able to operate properly. The report continues to criticise the pilot further, saying that a cockpit alert by the &lt;a href="w%3AGround%20Proximity%20Warning%20System"&gt;Ground Proximity Warning System&lt;/a&gt; informing the pilot he was flying too fast sounded no less than 15 times, but the pilot failed to abort the landing. He also ignored the co-pilot telling him to execute a '&lt;a href="w%3Ago-around"&gt;go-around procedure&lt;/a&gt;' after the aircraft struck the runway at speed and bounced back into the air.

The co-pilot is himself found to be at error by the report, which points out that he should have taken over the controls from the pilot when it became clear the aircraft was being flown in a dangerous manner. However, the report did note that Garuda Indonesia had failed to give him any simulator training replicating a situation whereby the co-pilot would take over control duties from the pilot in charge due to unsafe handling of the plane; in fact, training was found to be inadequate for both members of the cockpit crew.

In the report's own words: "During the approach, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times, and the copilot called for the pilot in command to go around. 

"The aircraft was flown at an excessive air speed and steep flight path angle during the approach and landing, resulting in an unstabilised approach. 

"The pilot in command did not follow company procedures that required him to fly a stabilised approach, and he did not abort the landing and go around when the approach was not stabilised. 

"His attention was fixated or channelised on landing the aircraft on the runway and he either did not hear, or disregarded the GPWS alerts, and warnings, and calls from the copilot to go around." 

Authorities were also found to be at fault, with the Indonesian Director General of Civil Aviation criticised for failing to identify inadequacies in pilot training procedures. he was also criticised for the fact that the aircraft had managed to go virtually un-inspected, with only two safety checks in a decade.

The report adds that the &lt;a href="w%3AAircraft%20Rescue%20and%20Firefighting"&gt;Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting&lt;/a&gt; facilities at the airport were also lacking on the day of the accident, for struggling to access the crash site and for not having the appropriate fire suppressant upon their eventual arrival. The report says these delays likely had an impact on the survivability factors on board the plane in the moments after crashing, when the aircraft was in flames. It ultimately took more than two hours before the fire was put out. Another criticism leveled at the airport was that it failed to comply with international runway safety regulations.

The report has triggered a call from Caroline Mellish, sister of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Financial%20Review"&gt;Australian Financial Review&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Morgan Mellish, one of five &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;ns killed in the accident, for greater co-operation between different Indonesian authorities. "I think not working together as different departments in a government shows a lack of any sort of system," She said from , to which she had travelled for the release of the final report.

"If they can't work together in different departments, I don't know how they are going to run a country and make any difference investigating this sort of accident and ensuring the recommendations do get carried forward to ensure that no more accident happen."

However, she did have some sympathy to spare for the pilot who was in control of the plane that day when the possibility of his prosecution was raised: "I think having 21 deaths on your conscience is probably enough. I don't think prosecuting the man is going to make any difference."

&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transport%20Safety%20Committee"&gt;National Transport Safety Committee&lt;/a&gt; chairman Tatang Kurniadi said that no information from the report would be used in any criminal or civil liability investigations. "I would like to go back to the objective of this, the report was made by NTSC for safety purposes only, not for blaming,♡❤ he said. 

"If any institution wants to ... follow up that accident, that's their own decision.

"The report contained the results from the &lt;a href="w%3Acockpit%20voice%20recorder"&gt;cockpit voice recorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aflight%20data%20recorder"&gt;flight data recorder&lt;/a&gt;, but according to international regulations on aviation these black boxes are not allowed to be used for... liability purposes.

"We will not give police or any institution (information) other than for safety purposes only - it's in international regulations and we want to follow those regulations.♡❤

Kyle McDevitt, a seven-year-old, second grade boy at &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Dennis Township&lt;/a&gt; Primary School in &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, was suspended for one day after drawing an image of one stick figure person shooting another.

The drawing depicted two stick figures, one labeled as 'me' by McDevitt and the other was labeled with the name of another student, with McDevitt smiling while shooting the other student. While on a school bus, the child gave the drawing to another student who took it home and showed it to his parents. The parents then filed a complaint with the school's district.

According to the boy's mother, Shirley McDevitt, the gun was a squirt gun filled with water. She also said that the boys are friends with each other. She has asked school officials to "expunge" her son's permanent school record of the incident.

"When a child draws at that age, they're not drawing with thought," stated McDevitt.

She also stated that officials for the school district said that the boy was suspended because of the schools policy on "zero-tolerance" for guns.

Other sketches are reported to have been drawn such as a skateboarder, a &lt;a href="w%3Acyclops"&gt;cyclops&lt;/a&gt; and a ghost.

The leader of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;, has released a new audiotape which was broadcast through ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The tape is entitled ♡❤Letter to the people of Iraq.♡❤

On the tape, he reportedly calls for unity among insurgents in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, but also says that insurgents have been "lax" in their duties. In the tape, bin Laden's main focus is on Iraq.

"Some of you have been lax in one duty, which is to unite your ranks. Beware of division ... The Muslim world is waiting for you to gather under one banner. The interest of the Islamic nation surpasses that of a group. The strength of faith is in the strength of the bond between &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; and not that of a tribe or nationalism. Beware of your enemies, especially those who infiltrate your ranks. I advise myself and the Islamic nation not to follow individuals and countries. Everything should be seen in the light of &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;," said bin Laden on the tape.

The voice on the tape has yet to be confirmed to be that of bin Laden's and it is not known how the network received the tape.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; writer &lt;a href="w%3ADoris%20Lessing"&gt;Doris Lessing&lt;/a&gt;, recipient of the 2007 &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature"&gt;Nobel Prize in Literature&lt;/a&gt;, has said in an interview that the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;terrorist attack on September 11&lt;/a&gt; "wasn't that terrible" when compared to attacks the &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; (IRA) made on Britain.

"September 11 was terrible, but if one re-examines the history of the IRA, what happened in the United States wasn't so bad," Lessing told leading &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; daily publication &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Pais"&gt;El Pais&lt;/a&gt;. "Some Americans believe I'm crazy. Many people died, two prominent buildings fell, but it was neither as terrible nor so extraordinary as they think.

"Do you know what people forget? That the IRA attacked with bombs against our government; it killed several people while a Conservative congress was being held and in which the prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Thatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;, was (attending). People forget," She says, adding a comment that the Americans are "a very naive people, or they pretend to be."

The IRA spent decades in armed guerrilla warfare against the United Kingdom, but officially ended its militaristic practices in 2005, after a lengthy peace process. The violence in &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; killed approximately 3,700 people and horrendously injured tens of thousands. By way of comparison, about 3,000 people were killed during 9/11.

She goes on to criticize former &lt;a href="w%3Aprime%20minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;prime minister of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and his ally current &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America"&gt;President of the United States of America&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. "I always hated Tony Blair, from the beginning. Many of us hated Tony Blair, I think he has been a disaster for Britain and we have suffered him for many years. I said it when he was elected: This man is a little showman who is going to cause us problems and he did." 

"As for Bush, he's a world calamity," Lessing continues "Everyone is tired of this man. Either he is stupid or he is very clever, although you have to remember he is a member of a social class which has profited from wars."

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; also comes in for criticism. Lessing's parents currently reside in &lt;a href="w%3ABakhtaran"&gt;Bakhtaran&lt;/a&gt;, Iran. "I hate Iran, I hate the Iranian government, it's a cruel and evil government. Look what happened to its president in New York, they called him evil and cruel in Colombia University. Marvelous! They should have said more to him! Nobody criticizes him, because of oil."

Former &lt;a href="w%3Afaith%20healer"&gt;faith healer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Atelevangelist"&gt;televangelist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts"&gt;Oral Roberts&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts%20University"&gt;Oral Roberts University&lt;/a&gt; (ORU) on October 22 as President. His son &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Roberts%20%28evangelist%29"&gt;Richard Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, who served as president since 1993, stepped down last week amid allegations of illegal political and financial wrongdoing. 

Oral said that all allegations made in the ORU lawsuit and an attached report are false and "said the university will begin mediation this week with the three former professors." However according to &lt;a href="w%3ATulsa%20World"&gt;Tulsa World&lt;/a&gt;, an attorney for the professors who sued ORU said, "Right now, we're a bit disturbed about attempting any type of a settlement as long as they're so adamant they haven't done anything wrong," and "We would prefer to move forward and develop the information and develop the case."

On Monday night alumni, clergy from around the U.S., and the people fired held a rally at Morningstar Baptist Church asking for Richard to permantly resign. They say Robert's temporary leave of absence "isn't enough."

Hoping to reach the final tournament for the 1 time in 24 years, &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n champions &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; 7-0 in the 1 leg of the 1 round of the Asian qualifying zone for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Nashat Akram opened the scoring in 19 minute before Karim netted his 1 of four goals six minutes later. Iraq would go onto score five goals into the 2 half.

The win was the first for new coach Egil Olsen. He took Norway to the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World CUP final and to 2 place in the FIFA/Coca-Cola world ranking.

Iraq will play their 1 round home leg in &lt;a href="w%3AAleppo"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; due to security concerns in Iraq.

The concentration of &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; (CO) in the atmosphere is increasing faster than expected, according to a new study published in Tuesday's edition of the &lt;a href="w%3AProceedings%20of%20the%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. The study said that rising levels of CO, the main &lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; blamed for climate change, threaten to accelerate &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;. The study attributes the change in CO levels to increased use of fossil fuels and a decline in the amount of gas being absorbed by the oceans and land.

CO emissions have increased by an average of 3.3 percent per year since 2000, compared with 1.1 percent per year in the 1990s. The rate has increased 35 percent more than scientists had anticipated based on economic growth, according to Corinne Le Quere, one of the paper's authors.

"The causes of the acceleration are surprising," Le Quere said. "One is that we are not as efficient at using CO as we had anticipated, and the second cause is that it appears that the CO sinks are weakening." The main natural &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20dioxide%20sink"&gt;CO sinks&lt;/a&gt; are the oceans and plants.

The study attributed approximately half of the unexpected growth to an increase in the &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20intensity"&gt;carbon intensity&lt;/a&gt; of the global economy, a measure of the amount of carbon emissions per unit of economic activity. "For 30 years we were becoming more efficient at using CO for producing energy and wealth, and this has completely stalled since 2000," Le Quere said, adding that increased use of coal by developing countries such as &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; was partially to blame.

The remaining unexpected growth was attributed to a decline in the ability of the oceans and land to absorb CO. Most climate models do not account for a weakening of CO sinks, Le Quere said. Alan Robock, associate director of the Center for Environmental Prediction at &lt;a href="w%3ARutgers%20University"&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt;, called the reduction of the oceanic CO sink "really shocking".

The study "raises some very important issues that the public should be aware of: Namely that concentrations of CO are increasing at much higher rates than previously expected and this is in spite of the Kyoto Protocol that is designed to hold them down in western countries," said &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20E.%20Trenberth"&gt;Kevin Trenberth&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the Climate Analysis Section at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20for%20Atmospheric%20Research"&gt;National Center for Atmospheric Research&lt;/a&gt; and a lead author of the &lt;a href="w%3AIPCC%20Fourth%20Assessment%20Report"&gt;2007 assessment report&lt;/a&gt; of the U.N. &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC).

The IPCC predicted in February of this year that temperatures would rise by up to 6.4 degrees Celsius over the next century. However, Le Quere suggested that this scenario might be overly optimistic. "There’s quite a significant difference from what was forecast,” she said. "It’s rather scary and the IPCC scenarios are, therefore, rather too optimistic — as if they weren’t bleak enough already. The whole thing is likely to mean mitigation is rather more difficult than was thought."

A huge fire set the Armando museum in &lt;a href="w%3AAmersfoort"&gt;Amersfoort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in flames around 1:00pm (local time). The museum was having a special exhibition and had borrowed many paintings from other museums and individuals. The museum was being worked on by painters, though there is no evidence that that was the cause.

&lt;a href="w%3AArmando%20%28artist%29"&gt;Armando&lt;/a&gt; is a Dutch artist currently living in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The collection of his work in the museum is estimated to have been worth roughly &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;3 million. The collection consisted mostly of paintings and statues.

The people living near the museum had been evacuated in case the fire spread beyond the buildings which had already caught fire. They were able to spend the night in the local city hall.

During the 2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase and Conference, WiMAX Forum announced the highlights from WiMAX Forum PlugFest in Grand Hyatt Taipei last week and announced that WiMAX Forum will endorse the M-Taiwan WiMAX Application Lab (MTWAL) in Hsinchu Science Park at the Press Conference yesterday and the General Assembly of the WiMAX Forum Taipei Member Conference today. With this laboratory located in Hsinchu, the WiMAX infrastructure in &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; will be enhanced more with the cooperation between academics (especially National Tsing Hua University and National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan), governmental organization, and companies in networking industry.

This laboratory provided an open environment where world-wide innovators can experiment and test WiMAX-related products and the stability of application solutions at Hsinchu Science Park. Currently, equipment and application developers will have the 1st priority in testing for the quality evaluation and knowing the sanctification of consumers before bringing them to market.

"Members of WiMAX shows the latest innovations at this showcase (WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase), I believed that MTWAL will provide a complete product testing environment and applications in the WiMAX access area with the support from governmental and industrial organizations in Taiwan."

"WiMAX is a brand new wireless network different from other similar industries, this service must be dominated with lots of different operators to maintain the basic infrastructure of WiMAX." Ron Resnick (Chairman of WiMAX Forum) remarked at the Press Conference.

"WiMAX Forum chose Hsinchu Science Park as the development basis of WiMAX with a unique characteristic in networking industry in Taiwan. We held a PlugFest last week for brand new WiMAX products with 200 engineers participating this test to evaluate the performance and test the quality. With this PlugFest, participants experienced rich services and good quality of new products. The PlugFest also had numbers of milestones including testing the leading advanced antenna technologies delivering the fastest speeds and broadest coverage."

"MIMO setups aren't achieved until mid-week historically, but in this PlugFest, lots of vendors completed this high-risk testing and demonstrated the data flow ability between different matrices, as well as several beam-forming IOP set ups." Ed Agis (Chairman of the WiMAX Forum Certification Working Group) said.

According to WiMAX Forum, lots of vendors also participated the exhibition of 2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase and demonstrated WiMAX technology solutions. Ron Resnick also remarked this information at the 2nd day Keynote of 2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Conference. Mei-yueh Ho (Chairman of Council for Economic Planning and Development, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. Taiwan) also looked this MTWAL set up as a bright idea, and Steve Ruey-long Chen (Minister of Economic Affairs, R.O.C. Taiwan) praised this set up as a boost of WiMAX infrastructure in Taiwan.

About two hours before the scheduled launch, NASA discovered and assessed the threat posed by a 4 by 1.5-inch (10.16 by 3.81-cm) chunk of ice that had formed on a pipe that connects the external tank and the space shuttle main engines. A strike from debris at launch was responsible for the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20Disaster"&gt;loss&lt;/a&gt; of the in February 2003.

The &lt;a href="Moscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; club took the game to Inter with 18 shots and a 1 half lead. However, CSKA Moscow will look at this as a lost opportunity as only five of those shots hit the target.

The rematch comes in Matchday 4 in 15 days With Inter being the home club at San Siro.

Nearly 330,000 people in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20County%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; are being ordered to evacuate after massive wildfires started to spread and grow. As a result, U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has declared a state of emergency in California clearing the way for federal aid assistance.

"All of us across this nation are concerned for the families who have lost their homes and the many families who have been evacuated from their homes. We send the help of the federal government," said Bush in a statement to the press.

Almost 1,500 houses have been burned to ashes and fires continue to threaten nearly 60,000 more. Firefighters now fear that the fires could merge into one giant blaze if the &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Ana%20Winds"&gt;Santa Ana Winds&lt;/a&gt; continue sending close to if not over 500,000 people running for safety. One person has died as a result of the fires with 42 injured. 16 of those are reported to be firefighters who were battling the blazes.

"It will not end ... until it reaches the ocean or the winds turn around," said San Diego County Fire Battalion Chief, Bruce Cartelli. At least 13 wildfires have burned more than 356,000 acres (142,400 hectares) in areas stretching from San Diego, near the border with &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="w%3AMalibu%2C%20California"&gt;Malibu&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.
Air Station Miramar for the U.S. Air Force is also being evacuated with the base's planes and other military equipment being transported away from the raging fires to &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and places far north of the fires in California.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Calls%20made%20for%20prosecution%20in%20light%20of%20Garuda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200%20report&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; is calling for criminal charges to be made in light of the final report into the &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt; disaster, which was published yesterday. Five Australians were among the 21 killed when the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737&lt;/a&gt; jetliner overshot the runway at &lt;a href="w%3AAdisucipto%20International%20Airport"&gt;Adisucipto International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; on March 7 this year.

Australian Minister for Foreign affairs, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;, said that the "very credible report" made it clear the two-man cockpit crew were responsible for the accident. The report found that alarms sounded no less than 15 times to warn the pilot in command that he was flying at an excessive speed for proper operation of the &lt;a href="w%3AFlaps%20%28aircraft%29"&gt;flaps&lt;/a&gt;, and that the co-pilot had also been ignored when he asked for a &lt;a href="w%3Ago-around"&gt;go-around&lt;/a&gt; to be made. The co-pilot was criticised for not taking control of the aircraft. The pilot was found to have ignored 15 emergency activations of the &lt;a href="w%3AGround%20Proximity%20Warning%20System"&gt;Ground Proximity Warning System&lt;/a&gt; telling him to slow down. Other criticisms were leveled at the inadequate training provided by the airline, the inadequate inspections by authorities, the lack of a mandatory runoff area at the runway and improper fire suppressants and slow response from the &lt;a href="w%3AAircraft%20Rescue%20and%20Firefighting"&gt;Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting&lt;/a&gt; facilities at the airport.

"I've asked our ambassador today to make it absolutely clear to the Indonesians that we want people prosecuted for this accident," said Downer. "I want to see people who have negligently allowed Australians … to be killed, I want to see those people brought to justice," he added. He has also expressed a pledge to discuss plans for a class action suit with survivors and relatives of victims, but he commented that "you're dealing with the Indonesian system here, it's a different system from our own, so it's not necessarily going to be very easy." Bill Madden from the law firm Slater and Gordon, who have a speciality in class actions, disagreed: "It would seem as though the families and people injured would have a fairly strong case," he said. "You'd be holding an airline responsible for the negligence of a pilot and that's a fairly standard approach that the law can follow."

Meanwhile, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Morning%20Herarld"&gt;♡❤Sydney Morning Herarld♡❤&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ spoke with Ari Sapari, head of operations at Garuda Indonesia. He told reporters that the pilots, who remain grounded after the crash, may be sacked next week, when any disciplinary action is expected to be announced. However, if they are charged over the crash, he has promised the airline will assist in their defence, saying "They are still our employees, up to now. They have the right to be assisted." Police say they are examining closely the possibility of charging both with manslaughter, which could see them sent to prison for up to five years if convicted. When queried about the fact that the report found the crew had not received adequate simulator training from the airline, he defended the company, saying "Nobody is perfect in this entire world." Since the suspension of the pilots, all other Garuda pilots have undergone the appropriate training missed out by Garuda.

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement made after the report came out "I am quite astonished. I can understand how people who are still grieving, both in Indonesia and Australia, might feel." 

The Opposition Leader, Kevin Rudd, has said he has telephoned secretary-general of Indonesia's foreign affairs department and former ambassador to Australia Imron Cotan, telling him that he wanted those responsible "prosecuted to the absolute full". "This is a serious matter, many Australians visit Indonesia, Garuda is an often used airline and there is a basic national interest at stake here as well," he said.

It is, however, stipulated in the &lt;a href="w%3AConvention%20on%20International%20Civil%20Aviation"&gt;Convention on International Civil Aviation&lt;/a&gt; that accident reports and related material, specifically transcripts of interviews, communications with crew and &lt;a href="w%3Acockpit%20voice%20recorder"&gt;cockpit voice recorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aflight%20data%20recorder"&gt;flight data recorder&lt;/a&gt; (collectively known as black boxes) readouts, must not be used for any purpose other than determining the cause of an &lt;a href="w%3Aaviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents"&gt;accident or incident&lt;/a&gt;. The only possible exception to this is where potential benefit would outweigh the "adverse domestic and international impact" on the investigation in question or any other either in progress or in the future. This legislation is in place to provide protection to witnesses on the basis that without it they may be less likely to cooperate with investigational procedures.

Downer's response to this law was to comment that "I think our first priority is to make sure those who are responsible - who survived the accident - are brought to justice." Aridono Sukman, the police member in charge of the criminal investigation, has said that the contents of the black box are vital evidence. Officials have commented that some relatives have expressed their frustration over the legal challenges involved in the prosecution effort.

Tatang Kurniadi, chairman of the Indonesian &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Committee"&gt;National Transportation Safety Committee&lt;/a&gt;, has already confirmed that investigators cannot speak to the police, with the only permitted testimony under the legislation being to testify at a court hearing. He also pointed out that the document does not actually appoint any blame. "The investigation determined the flight crews' compliance with procedures was not at the level to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. That's enough," he said. However, Sisno Adiwinoto, a police spokesperson, told reporters the police would attempt to summon the investigators to court as &lt;a href="w%3AExpert%20witness"&gt;expert witnesses&lt;/a&gt; on aviation, rather than as the actual investigators involved with the disaster.

Another fact that has become apparent is that the runway at Adisucipto International will not be lengthened to meet international standards despite assurances that work would begin shortly. The airport claims it cannot build the mandatory 90-metre runway end safety area because, says a small-print comment by the state-owned airport operator, the airport does not have the land." It has, however, promised to bring other airports under its jurisdiction up to standard, with work initialising next year. The company has also stated that a study of engineering methods providing alternative solutions could be completed by June.

It turns out that dogs may not be the only 'man's best friend.' A parrot in &lt;a href="w%3AMuncie%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Muncie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; is being credited with saving the lives of its owners.

According to the owner 33-year-old Shannon Conwell along with his 9-year-old son were watching television when they both fell asleep on the living room couch when a fire began to spread through the house around 3:00 a.m. on Friday October 19.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon%20parrot"&gt;Amazon, yellow-headed Parrot&lt;/a&gt; named Peanut reportedly imitates the sounds of several objects and began to emit one very similar to a fire alarm, waking the family from their sleep.

"He was really screaming his head off. I grabbed my son and my bird and got out of the house," said Conwell who also said that the fire alarm was also going off, but the bird woke her and her son. Conwell said that there were several pieces of medical equipment inside the house that also make a lot of noise. The equipment was there due to an accidental finger amputation which occurred only a few hours prior to the fire.

A bedroom, the kitchen and the dining room were all severely damaged in the fire, but no one was injured or killed. The fire department says that they are currently investigating the incident and have not said what the cause was.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;First Lady&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALaura%20Bush"&gt;Laura Bush&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; today to promote &lt;a href="w%3Abreast%20cancer"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; awareness. In the United States and other countries, October is &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Breast%20Cancer%20Awareness%20Month"&gt;National Breast Cancer Awareness Month&lt;/a&gt;.

Bush, on her first visit to the Saudi kingdom, was greeted by &lt;a href="w%3AFaisal%20bin%20Abdullah"&gt;Prince Faisal bin Abdullah&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href="w%3ACustodian%20of%20the%20Two%20Holy%20Mosques"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Abdullah bin Abdulaziz&lt;/a&gt; and honorary president of the Saudi Cancer Society.

She also attended the signing the U.S.-Saudi Arabia Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research agreement at a crowded auditorium at the King Fahad Medical City. This new program "will help build lasting friendships between Saudis and Americans [and] give hope to women across the Middle East," according to Bush.

Saudi Arabia is the third country in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; to join such a program. Other organizations involved include: &lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20G.%20Komen%20for%20the%20Cure"&gt;Susan G. Komen for the Cure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20University%20of%20Texas%20M.%20D.%20Anderson%20Cancer%20Center"&gt;The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJohns%20Hopkins%20University%20School%20of%20Medicine"&gt;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.

Laura Bush also visited with women affected by breast cancer at the Abdullatif Cancer Screening Center. "The cure for breast cancer can come from a researcher in Washington or a young doctor in Riyadh," she said.

Bush was scheduled to meet with King Abdullah in &lt;a href="w%3AJeddah"&gt;Jeddah&lt;/a&gt; later. The visit to Saudi Arabia is part of a four-nation tour, during which she visited the &lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; and will soon visit &lt;a href="Kuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;.

In a speech on Tuesday, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said that deploying a missile shield in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; is necessary to counter an emerging nuclear threat from &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. The planned missile shield is strongly opposed by &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, which sees it as a threat to its security.

"The need for missile defense in Europe is real and I believe it's urgent. Iran is pursuing the technology that could be used to produce nuclear weapons, and ballistic missiles of increasing range that could deliver them," Bush said in a speech at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Defense%20University"&gt;National Defense University&lt;/a&gt;. "Today, we have no way to defend Europe against the emerging Iranian threat, so we must deploy a missile defense system there that can."

In his speech, Bush emphasized the threat posed by the range of Iran's missiles. "Last November, Iran conducted military exercises in which it launched ballistic missiles capable of striking Israel and Turkey," Bush said. He warned that, with "continued foreign assistance", Iran could develop an &lt;a href="w%3AIntercontinental%20ballistic%20missile"&gt;ICBM&lt;/a&gt; capable of reaching the United States by 2015.

Russian &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Russia"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that the United States and the West could rely on Russian-operated early warning radar in &lt;a href="Azerbaijan"&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt; to counter missile threats from Iran.

The U.S. &lt;a href="w%3Amissile%20defense"&gt;missile defense&lt;/a&gt; plan includes 10 ground-based interceptors in &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and a radar system in the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Russian Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASergey%20Lavrov"&gt;Sergey Lavrov&lt;/a&gt; said previously that the shield was seen a "potential threat" by Russia and that Russia could take measures to "neutralize" it. In his speech, Bush said that the missile shield was not designed to intercept missiles from Russia and "would be easily overwhelmed by Russia's nuclear arsenal."

Also on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt; proposed delaying the activation of part of the missile shield if Russia cooperates with the project. "We continue to encourage the Russians to partner with us in missile defense and continue our efforts to reassure them that these facilities are not aimed at Russia and could benefit Russia," Gates said. He also suggested that the missile shield could remain inactive until "definitive proof" of a threat arose. "We would consider tying together the activation of the sites in Poland and the Czech Republic with definitive proof of the threat, in other words, Iranian missile testing and so on," he said.

<h2>Space Shuttle Discovery launches for mission STS-120</h2>

Space Shuttle Discovery successfully launched Tuesday morning from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:38 EDT (UTC-4).

During the two-week mission, the shuttle will deliver the Harmony Module to the International Space Station as well as preparing the space station for future additions.

<h2>Thousands more evacuated in California, USA</h2>

Nearly 330,000 people in San Diego County, California located in the United States are being ordered to evacuate after massive wildfires started to spread and grow. As a result, U.S. President George W. Bush has declared a state of emergency in California clearing the way for federal aid assistance. Satellite photos by NASA reveal the extent to which the fire has grown.

Almost 1,500 houses have been burned to ashes and fires continue to threaten nearly 60,000 more. Firefighters now fear that the fires could merge into one giant blaze if the Santa Ana Winds continue sending close to if not over 500,000 people running for safety. One person has died as a result of the fires with 42 injured. 16 of those are reported to be firefighters who were battling the blazes.

Air Station Miramar for the U.S. Air Force is also being evacuated with the base's planes and other military equipment being transported away from the raging fires to Arizona and places far north of the fires in California.

Reports say that the amount of people fleeing from their homes in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; due to wildfires has reached the 1,000,000 mark as the fires continue to grow. More than 500,000 people have been ordered to evacuate areas of Southern California as firefighters have began to realize that they may not be able to put all the fires out.

45 people have been injured, 21 of those being firefighters battling the blazes. At least one person was reported to have been killed earlier, but so far those reports cannot be confirmed.

"If it's this big and blowing with as much wind as it's got, it'll go all the way to the ocean before it stops ... We can save some stuff but we can't stop it," said captain of the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt; fire department, Kirk Humphries.

Yesterday, U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; declared a state of emergency in California, clearing the way for the state to begin receiving federal aid assistance.

"All of us across this nation are concerned for the families who have lost their homes and the many families who have been evacuated from their homes. We send the help of the federal government," said Bush in a statement to the press.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Ana%20wind"&gt;Santa Ana winds&lt;/a&gt; have been blowing for three days and they are not forecast to stop for the next day or so.

Close to 2,000 homes are burned to ashes and nearly 70,000 more are believed to be at a high risk of catching fire. Almost 400,000 acres of land have been scorched with 18 fires burning.

<h2>Turkey launches airstrikes against Kurdish rebels</h2>
According to reports, Turkey has today launched airstrikes against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) bases near the border to Iraq. F-16 fighter jets and helicopter gunships are said to have bombed targets on both sides of the border.

Turkish officials said that a major incursion was not implemented at this time to give diplomacy a final chance. An Iraqi delegation, headed by defense minister Qadir Obeidi (aka Abdel Qader Jassim), is scheduled to visit Turkey on Thursday.

<h2>7.1 earthquake strikes Indonesia</h2>
According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 7.1 quake struck Sumatra in Indonesia just after 4:00 a.m. local time.

The epicenter was located 135 kilometers (85 miles) west of Bengkulu, Sumatra, Indonesia in the Indian Ocean, with a depth of 30 k.m. (18.6 miles).

The NOAA issued a tsunami alert that was later lifted saying "no destructive widespread tsunami is expected," but that "local tsunamis can affect locations no more than 100 kilometers from the epicenter." They also state that lack of "sea level data" may delay the center's determination of whether or not a tsunami was generated.

The USGS states that damage may be "light to moderate" but so far there are no reports of injures, deaths or damage.

<h2>China launches space probe to the moon</h2>
At 18:00 hours local time (10:00 UTC) the rocket Chang'e 1 lifted off from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwestern China. The name of the probe refers to the Chinese goddess of the moon.

The 2350 kg probe is expected to enter a lunar orbit on November 5. On its year-long mission, Chang'e 1 will obtain threedimensional images of the Moon's surface and gather information related to the chemical and physical properties of the lunar soil. It will do so circulating at about 200 kilometers above the lunar surface. On its way to the Moon the spacecraft will register data regarding the solar winds, or space weather, on the way there. It will also broadcast 30 patriotic Chinese songs when orbiting the Moon.

From October 22 to 25, Taipei Computer Association (TCA) promoted three organized or sponsored expositions including "2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase &amp; Conference", "Exhibition of the First 5-year Period of the National Science &amp; Technology Program of e-Learning", and "2007 IP Comm Asia" showing great determination on improving the IT industry in Taiwan. With Computex Taipei 2008 will add Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall (TWTC Nangang) area, how TCA transform their ways and goals with operating their IT shows? It will be affected on the notibility of domestic or trade shows. For the three expos status and TWTC Nangang topics, ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Reporter interviewed TCA Secretary General Enoch Du for some important questions that should be respected by organizers and governments.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡Brock♡❤♡: We saw three expos continuously appeared this week and witnessed the determination from TCA. But before the three expos, with the 2008 Computex Taipei Local Exhibitors' Coordination by TAITRA last month for the exhibition hall usage, what should TCA face on the twin halls (TWTC Hall 1 and TWTC Nangang) problem? How to solve the problem with TWTC Nangang? Because more than ten years before, when Computex Taipei exhibited at Sungshan and TWTC halls, the show didn't have a good work, and I've asked Commissioner of Department of Transportation in Taipei City Hsiao-hsien Lou for the traffic issue with TWTC Nangang, he looked it as a pessimistic way.

♡❤♡Enoch♡❤♡: We still contact with TAITRA currently for the twin halls issue, The advantage for TWTC Nangang is exhibition spaces, but to the opposite way, traffic is surely a great headache for governments, organizers, and exhibitors. We still try to solve problems with this. Even though Computex Taipei will be located at TWTC Exhibition Hall and TWTC Nangang same time with the plan of TAITRA, but without solving problems, Computex Taipei will still be in a trouble even though we want to challenge the World's 1st scale against CeBIT.

♡❤♡Brock♡❤♡: It's apparently that lots of organizations care about the traffic near TWTC Nangang. By the way, for the 1st time TCA holding 2007 IP Comm Asia, why should it be transformed from a long-historical trade show - Taipei Telecom by TAITRA, suspended from this year?

♡❤♡Enoch♡❤♡: TCA explained some reasons for the transformation in the starting of 2007. In fact, lots of famous local participants (exhibitors) usually promoted their products with show-girls (models) so the quality of Taipei Telecom went from bad to worse in past 2 to 5 years. This is surely a damn bad demonstration in Taiwan's society. With suspending Taipei Telecom and promoting IP telecommunication industry in Taiwan, TCA finally decided to hold this professional trade show and named "IP Comm Asia" for the global market opportunity this year.

♡❤♡Brock♡❤♡: Continued with "IP Comm Asia", how this show connect with "2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase &amp; Conference"?

♡❤♡Enoch♡❤♡: Communication and networking (including WiMAX) industries should be complementaries. In Taiwan, IP telecommunication infrastructure shouldn't be looked down, with the trendy change of telecommunication industry, even though traditional telecommunication (fax and phone) industry is currently in a prior position, but IP telecommunication will be a new industry besides of communication and networking with computing technology. If consumers can communicate via Internet including Wi-Fi, its development will take advantage. Currently, some of telecommunication companies tried to change the quality of VoIP and experiment related applications for the market preparation, if the wireless network contained broadly and WiMAX infrastructure improved rapidly in Taiwan, I think that IP telecommunications will be the main stream in the future.

♡❤♡Brock♡❤♡: Something interesting. Some of electronic trade shows held by TAITRA had a great transformation with combinations and changes such as a 3-in-1 show (TaiwanRFID, TAITRONICS, PV Taiwan) held past 2 weeks. Recently, TAITRA set "Broadband Communications Pavilion" at 2007 TAITRONICS Autumn to promote "Broadband Taiwan 2008" at TWTC Nangang and recruit companies with Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association. How the TCA think about this idea?

♡❤♡Enoch♡❤♡: With trendy changes of electronic industry in Taiwan, several (electronic) trade shows suspended or transformed to other industry shows. As of TAITRA, they should fill up vacancies with some specified trade shows by some grown up industries. With their idea, they successfully transformed a simple electronic show to a grand combination with multiple industries' show. As you talked about the pavilion at TAITRONICS, this was a great chance for TAITRA to reposition and restart. Every show organizer always hopes their (international) show can keep good images for international buyers. Hope TWTC Nangang can bring a bright future and have a good start, and TAITRA can complete solutions for TWTC Nangang to keep TWTC Exhibition Hall in a steady position.

♡❤♡Brock♡❤♡: Nice thanks. Hope I can visit some good shows by TCA.

<h2>Summary</h2>
TCA surely worked hard with promoting IT industry by executing governmental plans and holding trade shows at TWTC or outside of Taiwan. That's why the IT industry in Taiwan can market to the world. TCA usually reposition some IT trade shows from quantity (factor) to quality with holding shows. Exhibition organizers in Taiwan should respect quality of exhibitions and conventions so that Taiwan can be visible world-wide in the future. With Du's words, if Computex Taipei should use twin halls, then TAITRA should solve the main issue of Nangang's traffic as Commissioner Luo said to keep them in a steady position, origins and quality.

Patricia Parete, 42, a &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; police officer who was shot two times and nearly killed by a fleeing suspect in December of 2006, has returned to her Buffalo home after being transferred to a specialized rehabilitation hospital in &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; to recover from her injuries. Another officer, Carl Andolina who was also responding to the scene, was also shot twice.

Parate is able to speak, but still is not able to walk, or move her arms because of one of the bullets severely damaged her &lt;a href="w%3Aspinal%20cord"&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt;. The other bullet hit her bullet proof vest and did not cause any damage. Andolina was shot once in the neck and once in the shoulder.

The two officers were responding to a call at about 9:00 p.m. on December 5, that a male and female were fighting inside a Valero gas station located on West Chippewa and Elmwood Avenues in Downtown Buffalo when one of the suspects, Varner Harris, 18 and lives in Buffalo, fled police. When the officers began to chase Harris, he turned and fired several shots at the officers, wounding both of them. Despite being shot two times, Andolina still managed to give a short chase to apprehend the suspect, tackling him to the ground. 

Neither officer fired any shots. Both officers were shot by a .38-caliber revolver. At least 5 shots total were fired in total by the suspect.

Harris was convicted for the attempted murder of the officers, and could face 30 years in prison.

On Monday, October 22, as the latest &lt;a href="Wikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt; fundraiser began, ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter thought his own small donation could be turned into a bigger donation by his buying some advertising on a popular website and encouraging others to contribute. With this in mind he approached Howard Tayler, creator of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASchlock%20Mercenary"&gt;Schlock Mercenary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awebcomic"&gt;webcomic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Tayler's response was not as McNeil expected, prompting a ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ investigation. Tayler refused to help the foundation raise money although he conceded that he does sometimes use the site. Instead he explained that some members of the webcomic community feel slighted by &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; because over 50 articles on webcomics were deemed not to meet their &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3ANotability"&gt;notability guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and were deleted during January and February of 2007. Some members of the webcomics community considered this unacceptable. Whilst some of the comic related articles deleted did not qualify for inclusion in the encyclopedia under Wikipedia guidelines, the deletion of a large number of articles in such a short time period struck some webcomics writers and fans as a selective purge.

Much of the criticism has been focused on Wikipedia editor &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ADragonfiend"&gt;Dragonfiend&lt;/a&gt;, who has described notability as "whether a topic has been noted by independent reputable sources". She has said that "If we include every article that anyone wants to write, then the encyclopedia becomes useless because nobody can find the actual needle of worthwhile information on a topic hidden in that hay stack of trivia." She has said Wikipedia should only have articles on webcomics like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APenny%20Arcade%20%28webcomic%29"&gt;Penny Arcade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGet%20Your%20War%20On"&gt;Get Your War On&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFetus-X"&gt;Fetus-X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAchewood"&gt;Achewood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

This deletion of numerous webcomic articles has not sat well with some in the webcomic community. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AModern%20Tales"&gt;Modern Tales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; editor and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWebsnark"&gt;Websnark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; blogger Eric Burns has written that "There are people -- and Dragonfiend is clearly one of them -- who are clearly going through Wikipedia looking for articles that should be weeded out as non-notable. and they're doing it in fields they clearly -- I mean, clearly -- have no interest, experience or knowledge." 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AErfworld"&gt;Erfworld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APartiallyClips"&gt;PartiallyClips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; writer Rob Balder has expressed similar viewpoints, calling the deletion of the webcomics articles a "goddamned crime" and describing a "deletionist jihad" by "the politest bunch of book-burning assholes on the planet". Balder also labelled "" as a form of "naughtymancy" magic in Erfworld. Deletionism refers to the Wikipedia ideology that favours relatively rigorous standards for maintaining access to articles, as opposed to which favours keeping and amending problematic articles.

There is concern among some webcomic groups that the notability guidelines are too rigorous for the typical webcomic. The standards usually require significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject, which is rare since even comics with dedicated followings do not always attract mainstream book publishers or reviews from mainstream journalists. It seems that this policy has alienated webcomic artists and fans and discouraged them from contributing to Wikipedia. 

Conflicts such as this are not uncommon. Members of a Wikimedia Foundation mailing list pointed to other examples where the application of the rules has been perceived to be selective, leaving other communities disgruntled with a variety of Wikimedia projects, not just Wikipedia.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20State%20University"&gt;San Diego State University&lt;/a&gt; (SDSU) and &lt;a href="w%3ABrigham%20Young%20University"&gt;Brigham Young University&lt;/a&gt; (BYU) football game, originally scheduled for October 27, 2007 in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, has been postponed until December 1. &lt;a href="w%3AQualcomm%20Stadium"&gt;Qualcomm Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20State%20Aztecs"&gt;SDSU Aztecs&lt;/a&gt;, is currently housing 12,000 evacuees from the Southern California &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20wildfires%20of%20October%202007"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition to the housing of evacuees at the stadium, the decision to postpone the game was made for several other reasons. Federal and state declarations of a state of emergency; air quality; transportation considerations; closure of SDSU; student-athlete well-being; fan safety; and competitive equity, all played a role. &lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20West%20Conference"&gt;Mountain West Conference&lt;/a&gt; commissioner Craig Thompson said, "There is a far greater priority than sporting events in the San Diego area at this time. The focus should be on emergency response and resources, and getting the community back on its feet. Our thoughts are with our colleagues at San Diego State University, as well as everyone who has been affected by this disaster."

The win also brings them 1 point behind &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOlympiacos%20F.C."&gt;Olympiacos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Werder Bremen, who held the majority of the possession throughout the game, broke through in the 28 minute through Sonago. Almeida gave the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germans&lt;/a&gt; a two-goal cushion nine minutes into the second half. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClemens%20Fritz"&gt;Clemens Fritz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; sent a long low cross to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Almeida"&gt;Hugo Almeida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who then doubled the lead. Lazio managed to pull 1 back before the final whistle.

The 2 clubs match up again in 13 days from now with both teams needing to pick up points to have a shot for 2 place in Group C.

"This was when I was very very young, living in &lt;a href="w%3AParis%2C%20France"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, penniless, unable to get any kind of working permit," said Lipton. "I had a friend who worked in what is called the Milieu, which is that world and she suggested to me one night, `Look, you'll be my mec... We would translate it perhaps... as pimp. We were earning our living together, this young woman and I, we made a rather good living, I must say."

He had spoken about it before on his show, when he interviewed &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Roberts"&gt;Julia Roberts&lt;/a&gt; and mentioned his familiarity with prostitutes.

"I had to set the record straight," he said. "God, it was awful that night with Julia. I was dying. And those were my students laughing at me!"

Scientists say that floating inside &lt;a href="w%3ASaturn"&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt;'s rings are pieces of what they believe to be a "shattered moon," according to images captured by &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s spacecraft &lt;a href="w%3ACassini%E2%80%93Huygens"&gt;Cassini–Huygens&lt;/a&gt;.

The scientists from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder"&gt;University of Colorado at Boulder&lt;/a&gt; looked at the images which were captured in 2004, and found what they call "&lt;a href="w%3Amoonlet"&gt;moonlet&lt;/a&gt;s" or large pieces ranging from the size of a stadium to a semi truck, of what they say are the remains of a large moon which was likely destroyed when a comet or asteroid slammed into it.

"This is the first evidence of a moonlet belt in any of Saturn's rings. We have firmly established these moonlets exist in a relatively narrow region of the "A" ring, and the evidence indicates they are remnants of a larger moon that was shattered by a meteoroid or comet," said one of the researchers, Miodrag Sremcevic.

The Cassini spacecraft captures eight new propeller-like features within Saturn's A ring in what may be the propeller "hot zone" of Saturn's rings. Propeller features form around small moonlets that are not massive enough to clear out ring material, but are still able to pull smaller ring particles into a shape reminiscent of an airplane propeller. Scientists believe that propellers represent moonlet wakes, which are denser than the surrounding ring material and appear bright in the images. The length of the belt in which the moonlets were discovered is almost 2,000 miles long.

Scientists estimate that the size of the moon was relative to the size of &lt;a href="w%3APan%20%28moon%29"&gt;Pan&lt;/a&gt;, the innermost moon of Saturn. It only measures 20 miles wide at its widest point.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) a &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 7.1 quake struck &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; just after 4:00 a.m. local time.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; was located 135 kilometers (85 miles) west of &lt;a href="w%3ABengkulu"&gt;Bengkulu&lt;/a&gt;, Sumatra, Indonesia in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, with a depth of 30 k.m. (18.6 miles).

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; issued a &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; alert that was later lifted saying "no destructive widespread tsunami is expected," but that "local tsunamis can affect locations no more than 100 kilometers from the epicenter." They also state that lack of "sea level data" may delay the center's determination of whether or not a tsunami was generated.

The USGS states that damage may be "light to moderate" but so far there are no reports of injures, deaths or damage.

The &lt;a href="China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; today launched its first &lt;a href="w%3Amoon"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; orbiter as part of the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Lunar%20Exploration%20Program"&gt;country's lunar exploration program&lt;/a&gt;.

At 18:05 hours &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Standard%20Time"&gt;local time&lt;/a&gt; (10:05 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) the rocket &lt;a href="w%3AChang%27e%201"&gt;Chang'e 1&lt;/a&gt; lifted off from &lt;a href="w%3AXichang%20Satellite%20Launch%20Center"&gt;Xichang Satellite Launch Center&lt;/a&gt; in southwestern China. The name of the probe refers to the &lt;a href="w%3AChang%27e%20%28mythology%29"&gt;Chinese goddess of the moon&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Central%20Television"&gt;state television network&lt;/a&gt; broadcast live footage of the countdown and launch, which took place in the presence of Chinese officials and some 2,000 Chinese who paid around &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;100 to attend the event, but without any international press.

The 2350 &lt;a href="w%3AKilogram"&gt;kg&lt;/a&gt; probe is expected to enter a lunar orbit on November 5. On its year-long mission, Chang'e 1 will obtain three dimensional images of the Moon's surface and gather information related to the chemical and physical properties of the lunar soil. It will do so circulating at about 200 kilometers above the lunar surface. On its way to the Moon the spacecraft will register data regarding the solar winds, or space weather. It will also broadcast 30 patriotic Chinese songs when orbiting the Moon.

The officially-&lt;a href="w%3ASocialism%20with%20Chinese%20characteristics"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; nation which hosts &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;next year's Olympics&lt;/a&gt; hopes to put a &lt;a href="w%3AAstronaut%23China"&gt;taikonaut&lt;/a&gt; on the moon in ten to 15 years. Last month, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; launched a lunar probe while &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; hopes to achieve the same next April. In 2003, China used one of their own rockets to get the astronaut &lt;a href="w%3AYang%20Liwei"&gt;Yang Liwei&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="space"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;. Yang told the &lt;a href="w%3AXinhua%20News%20Agency"&gt;Xinhua News Agency&lt;/a&gt; last week that once China has a manned &lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20station"&gt;space station&lt;/a&gt;, he and his fellow taikonauts could form a new branch of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; in space.

Last January, China used a rocket to &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Chinese%20anti-satellite%20missile%20test"&gt;blow up one of its own satellites&lt;/a&gt;, sparking fears from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and other countries that China might have a military agenda in space, besides the problems of space pollution and danger to other satellites the explosion caused. China says the goals of its space program are scientific and peaceful.

According to reports, &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; has today launched airstrikes against &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Workers%20Party"&gt;Kurdistan Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; (PKK) bases near the border to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AF-16%20Fighting%20Falcon"&gt;F-16&lt;/a&gt; fighter jets and &lt;a href="w%3Ahelicopter%20gunships"&gt;helicopter gunships&lt;/a&gt; are said to have bombed targets on both sides of the border.

Turkish officials said that a major incursion was not implemented at this time to give &lt;a href="w%3Adiplomacy"&gt;diplomacy&lt;/a&gt; a final chance. An Iraqi delegation, headed by defense minister &lt;a href="w%3AQadir%20Obeidi"&gt;Qadir Obeidi&lt;/a&gt; (aka Abdel Qader Jassim), is scheduled to visit Turkey on Thursday.

"We do not accept in any way... the use of Iraqi territories, including the territories of the Kurdistan region, as a base to threaten the security of neighbouring countries," &lt;a href="w%3AMassoud%20Barzani"&gt;Massoud Barzani&lt;/a&gt;, president of the &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Regional%20Government"&gt;Kurdistan Regional Government&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement condemning the PKK.

"We are concerned about the continuing skirmishes that are happening up there, and terrorist attacks that are being launched by the PKK against the Turks," &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Press%20Secretary"&gt;White House Press Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt; said.

<h2>Bus explosion in Mogadishu, Somalia kills many civilians</h2>
At least 15 civilians, including women and children, have been killed in a bus explosion in Mogadishu's northern district of Yaqshiid in Somalia. The explosion occurred when the bus drove over an IED (improvised explosive device) or landmine while traveling to the Suuqa Holaha district in northern Mogadishu on Wednesday.

It is not known who was behind the latest bomb attack but it appeared to be aimed at the government or Ethiopian soldiers. In Mogadishu, the insurgency by militants linked with the ousted Islamic Courts Union has been going on since the Ethiopian invasion in December 2006-January 2007

<h2>UN report: climate change and food shortage major problems for Earth's future</h2>

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has released a comprehensive report on the current state of the global environment. Climate change, food and water shortage and a decline in biodiversity threaten humanity's survival, so urgent action is necessary, the report warns.

UNEP's Global Environment Outlook: environment for development (GEO-4) report involved the work of about 390 experts in various fields from around the world.

Key findings include: 

Rising sea-levels threaten the 60 percent of the population living within 100 kilometres of coastal lines.

Increasing irrigation demands will eventually cause 1 of every 10 major rivers to dry up.

And in terms of biodiversity, species are becoming extinct a hundred times faster than the rate shown in the fossil record.

<h2>Garuda Indonesia Flight 200's pilot's marital problems may have affected judgement</h2>

A new theory has emerged as in to why the pilot of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 attempted to land at a hugely excessive speed, despite 15 automated warnings he was flying too quickly and the co-pilot's call for a 'go-around' procedure to be performed. 21 people were killed in the March 7 crash of the Boeing 737-400 passenger jetliner.

Stephanus Geraldus, head of the Garuda pilots association, said that problems at home and a lack of sleep may have affected Marwoto Komar's judgement. The news comes as Indonesian authorities announce they are pressing ahead with a possible prosecution.

The final report into the disaster, released on Monday, found that Komar, 45, had exhibited what was described as a "fixation" to land the plane, resulting in the excessively fast approach.

It won't take effect on current registration system, and we'll announce the 1,500 athletes after a draw on November 1.

"With good reviews of the Enterprise Group since last year and a trial at 2005, we'll invite companies from Taipei 101 Skyscraper and outside of Taipei 101.

Hamburg consistently played in Brann's half of the field and managed to get 16 shots which 9 hit the target. Hamburg's attack proved effective when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Kompany"&gt;Vincent Kompany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scored in the 62 minute.

Hamburg has Matchday 2 off while Brann is away to Rennes.

Ari scored in the 20 minute to only to be sent off in the 39 minute and to see Zenit St. Petersburg equalize in the 43 minute. Both teams had their chances up to the red card.

Both teams are tied with 1 point after Matchday 1, with Everton being in 1 place after their 3-1 victory over Larissa.

This move comes in addition to ridding foods of trans fats at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADisneyland"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Walt%20Disney%20World"&gt;Walt Disney World&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, by the end of this calendar year. The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; parks began to take action a year ago, as a response to nutritionists. Healthier options such as low-fat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amilk"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and baby &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acarrots"&gt;carrots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have been added to the menu, to increase guest choices.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADisney%20Consumer%20Products"&gt;Disney Consumer Products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has already licensed the company's brands to healthy prepared food products in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASobey%27s"&gt;Sobey's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; grocery stores' ♡❤Compliments♡❤ label, while &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; supermarkets will start offering similar foods next month.

As concern over &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Achildhood%20obesity"&gt;childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; grows, many companies are taking steps to cleanup their act, and gain the trust of customers. Trans fats have been linked to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acoronary"&gt;coronary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; diseases.

&lt;a href="w%3ABritney%20Spears"&gt;Britney Spears&lt;/a&gt; will not appear on the legendary &lt;a href="America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;n children's program ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASesame%20Street"&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

When contacted today, &lt;a href="w%3ASesame%20Workshop"&gt;Sesame Workshop&lt;/a&gt; press representative Ray Hammerman replied that the rumours were, "not true, there are no plans to have her on as a guest."

Sesame Workshop Vice President of Corporate Communications Ellen Lewis backed up this statement, adding that the show is "not in production until Feb. 2008".

Published reports in British tabloid newspaper ♡❤The Daily Star♡❤ suggested Spears was to improve her image by appearing on the show. She was to perform a "dumbed-down" version of her hit single "&lt;a href="w%3AToxic%20%28song%29"&gt;Toxic&lt;/a&gt;", with &lt;a href="w%3AOscar%20the%20Grouch"&gt;Oscar the Grouch&lt;/a&gt;, a character that lives in a trash can. "Toxic" was released in 2003.

Spears faces losing complete custody of sons two-year-old Sean Preston and one-year-old Jayden James.

♡❤The Daily Star♡❤ did not respond to Wikinews about their reasoning for the story.

♡❤Sesame Street♡❤ has featured well over &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20celebrity%20guest%20stars%20on%20Sesame%20Street"&gt;300 celebrity guest stars&lt;/a&gt; in its 38 seasons.

<h1>UN report: climate change and food shortage major problems for Earth's future</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UN%20report%3A%20climate%20change%20and%20food%20shortage%20major%20problems%20for%20Earth%27s%20future&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Environment%20Programme"&gt;Environment Programme&lt;/a&gt; (UNEP) has released a comprehensive report on the current state of the global environment. &lt;a href="Climate%20change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;, food and water shortage and a decline in biodiversity threaten humanity's survival, so urgent action is necessary, the report warns.

UNEP's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Environment%20Outlook"&gt;Global Environment Outlook&lt;/a&gt;: environment for development (GEO-4)♡❤ report involved the work of about 390 experts in various fields from around the world.

While the GEO-4 report salutes some improvements, for example the increased public awareness of environmental issues and political interest, it also warns that "There are no major issues... for which the foreseeable trends are favourable." Although the report sets out a gloomy scenario, its main aim is to call for action.

<h2>Climate change</h2>
The report finds that despite "visible and unequivocal" evidence of climate change caused by human activity, the global response is "woefully inadequate" and shows "a remarkable lack of urgency". It criticizes highly-polluting countries that refused to ratify the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, and the industrial sectors that lobbied against it. Negotiations for a new Protocol to curb climate changes will start in December.

Although the emission of &lt;a href="w%3Aozone%20layer"&gt;ozone-layer&lt;/a&gt; damaging chemicals has decreased by 95 percent, the spring hole in the ozone layer is larger than ever. UNEP calls the way &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; have dealt with the problem of acid rain "one of the success stories of recent decades", while the challenge remains in countries like &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Food and water</h2>
As far as water is concerned, the report warns that "The escalating burden of water demand will become intolerable in water-scarce countries." Contaminated water and lack of sanitation services already affect 2.6 billion people, being the single leading cause of death in developing countries with 3 million deaths annually, mostly in children younger than five. Although agricultural efficacy has increased, up to a third of the global population is affected by soil erosion, nutrient depletion and water scarcity.

<h2>Priorities per continent</h2>
This is the first UNEP report which addresses specific problems in individual continents. In &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, desertification and declining food production are key problems, while agricultural subsidies in developing countries decrease trade profits. &lt;a href="w%3ABushmeat"&gt;Bushmeat&lt;/a&gt; trade is also mentioned, for example in the &lt;a href="w%3ACongo%20Basin"&gt;Congo Basin&lt;/a&gt;, where the trade is at six times its sustainable rate. In &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, urban air quality, fresh water and increasing waste problems are among the priorities. The illegal traffic in electronic and hazardous waste worldwide is mentioned separately as an emerging challenge.

Overconsumption, high energy use and transport problems cause concern in Europe, while North America is, according to the report, struggling to address climate change. Urban growth is a particular concern in &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt;. 2007 is reported as being the first year in history when more than half of all people lived in cities. The Polar regions are already feeling the impact of climate change, ozone layer effacement and pollution.

<h2>Wake-up call</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AAchim%20Steiner"&gt;Achim Steiner&lt;/a&gt;, Under-Secretary General of the U.N. and director of UNEP, said that "There continue to be 'persistent' and intractable problems unresolved and unaddressed. ... Meanwhile, institutions like UNEP, established to counter the root causes, remain under-resourced and weak."

"There have been enough wake-up calls ... I sincerely hope GEO-4 is the final one. The systematic destruction of the Earth's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged and where the bill we hand on to our children may prove impossible to pay," Mr Steiner warned.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Garuda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200%27s%20pilot%27s%20marital%20problems%20may%20have%20affected%20judgement&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A new theory has emerged as in to why the pilot of &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20200"&gt;Flight 200&lt;/a&gt; attempted to land at a hugely excessive speed, despite 15 automated warnings he was flying too quickly and the co-pilot's call for a '&lt;a href="w%3Ago-around"&gt;go-around&lt;/a&gt;' procedure to be performed. 21 people were killed in the March 7 crash of the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737-400&lt;/a&gt; passenger jetliner.

Stephanus Geraldus, head of the Garuda pilots association, said that problems at home and a lack of sleep may have affected Marwoto Komar's judgement. The news comes as &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n authorities announce they are pressing ahead with a possible prosecution.

The final report into the disaster, released on Monday, found that Komar, 45, had exhibited what was described as a "fixation" to land the plane, resulting in the excessively fast approach.

"If you look at his long flying experience, it's impossible that he would try to land at that speed," Captain Geraldus said, adding that marrital problems with wife Norma Andriani, a former air hostess, were "common knowledge". This was backed up by Dudi Sudibyo, an analyst at Angkasa magazine (translated: 'Airspace').

"I understand he was arguing with his wife until late that night," said Sudibyo, who went on to express concern at the lack of addressal of potential mental problems on the part of the pilot in the report. Sudibyo is himself a licensed pilot.

Lack of sleep may also have contributed. Both Komar and Gagam Rochmana, the flight's co-pilot, reported for duty at 4:30 a.m., with the flight departing &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt; as scheduled at 6 a.m. "What I want to know now is: why he didn't report that lack of sleep and ask to be shifted to the next flight, or maybe he felt extremely confident he could fly - overconfident," Sudibyo specualted. The report did not find any explicit evidence that they were unfit to fly, but did comment that "they did not provide the investigation with information about (their) activities during the 72 hours prior to commencing duty".

Police officials have commented that a prosecution is likely with the only personnel required to complete the case against the pilot and co-pilot being &lt;a href="w%3Aexpert%20witness"&gt;expert witnesses&lt;/a&gt;, and that the pilots had been grounded since the accident. "We're looking to prosecute under criminal negligence causing death and serious injury," Inspector-General Adiwinoto said.

"We need witnesses who can prove there was negligence, and since this was an aviation matter, that could be someone from the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Transportation%20Safety%20Committee"&gt;National Safety Transportation Committee&lt;/a&gt;, or it could also be a medical doctor because of the deaths and injuries.

"We have been proceeding with this investigation all along, but we needed enough preliminary evidence, which we now do have, with the report that says, yes, there was human negligence." He also said that the airline may itself be prosecuted for failing to provide necessary training to the flight crew. This new development comes at the same time as six Garuda Boeing 737-400s are grounded for failure to comply with import regulations.

<h1>News briefs:October 26, 2007</h1>
<h2>ISIS says target of Israeli airstrike in Syria was a nuclear facility</h2>

Researchers at the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) have stated that a building that was located inside Syria at the site where Israel launched an airstrike on, has not only been completely removed, but that it was also a nuclear reactor under construction.

The researchers obtained the images from DigitalGlobe and released the satellite images of the site before the airstrike and according to them, the building is a nuclear reactor. They also state that the images show a facility much like the on in North Korea at Yongbyon. Another image taken on October 24, shows a site where a large building used to be, the ground being wiped clean of its existence. A water-pumping station located on the Euphrates River was believed to be used for cooling the reactor, claim the ISIS.

Syria denies that they are building any kind of nuclear facility stating "the main point is that is that the Israeli fighter jet violated the airspace of a member state of the United Nations... and (should) assume the consequences."

Currently, the United States denies that the satellite photos show any site inside Syria and have not commented on the images. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also refused to release a statement.

<h2>Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan</h2>

Matthew Locke, an Australian special forces soldier with the Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) has been shot and killed while taking part in a 300-man special operatives attack against the Taliban in Afghanistan. The death, Australia's third combat soldier death since the Vietnam War, is the second to occur in October.

The soldier, believed to be employed in Perth, Australia in the State of Tasmania and married with an unknown amount of children, was immediately lifted from the scene by the aero-medical helicopter evacuation team and was pronounced dead early this morning after suffering critical wounds throughout his chest. It is reported that he had received "high bravery honors" just before the battle.

<h2>Leaked emails show UK RAF were aware of Nimrod problems prior to fatal crash</h2>

Leaked emails have revealed that the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force (RAF) were aware of a dangerous problem with fuel leaking from Nimrod MR2 surveillance aircraft long before one exploded in midair during a mission in Kandahar, Afghanistan. All 14 people on board were killed in the crash in September last year.

A board of inquiry has recently completed deliberating the cause of the accident, with a final report expected in about two weeks time. It is expected by many that the report will find a fuel leak was to blame. The crash was the largest loss of life from any UK service in a single incident since the Falklands war. Although the report will determine the cause of the crash and make recommendations to prevent its reoccurence, it will not attempt to establish blame for the disaster.

<h2>FEMA employees pose as fake reporters during press conference</h2>

The United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is under fire after the agency held a fake press conference with fake news reporters in regards to individuals effected by the California wildfires and the assistance they could receive.

The agency called a press conference on Tuesday, giving the press only 15 minutes to show up. When many did not, FEMA brought in agency officials to pose as fake reporters and ask questions. The option for reporters to call into the conference was also available, but the ones who did call-in only got to listen to the press conference, and could not ask questions. No reporters were actually present during the conference.

FEMA apologizes for the mishap and says that their intentions were only to get the information to the citizens of California. FEMA is currently deciding whether or not any officials should face punishment for the incident.

This is not the first time that the Bush administration has come under fire for planting reporters at press conferences. In February of 2005, White House reporter Jeff Gannon was accused of being planted to ask softball questions to President Bush.
<h2>Oil prices reach all-time high; pass US$91.00 per barrel</h2>
Oil has risen to a new all-time record high during trading in Asia, passing US$91.10 at 10:23 p.m. on October 25 (eastern time).

NYMEX Crude closed at $91.86, while ICE Brent closed at $88.69, at the conclusion of Friday's trading.

The raise come when the United States announced that it had an "unexpected loss" in the nation's stockpile of oil. The fear that Turkey may launch a large scale attack on Kurdish Militants inside Iraq is also being blamed for the raise in prices and the U.S. imposed more sanctions on Iran for continuing to enrich uranium.

It is reported that he had received "high bravery honors" just before the battle.

Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston was quoted saying fine details of the operation, which took place in the &lt;a href="w%3AOr%C5%ABzg%C4%81n%20Province"&gt;Orūzgān Province&lt;/a&gt;, would not be released as it would "aid the Taliban [and] ... add to the dangers already facing our special operations troops."

"The soldier's mates reacted to the incident by extracting the soldier from further danger and providing immediate first aid. Their courage under fire and their determination to help a fallen mate is to be commended," added Houston who also stated that no other soldiers were injured or wounded during the fighting.

Researchers at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInstitute%20for%20Science%20and%20International%20Security"&gt;Institute for Science and International Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ISIS) have stated that a building that was located inside &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; at the site where &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; launched an airstrike on, has not only been completely removed, but that it was also a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20reactor"&gt;nuclear reactor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; under construction.

The researchers obtained the images from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADigitalGlobe"&gt;DigitalGlobe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and released the satellite images of the site before the airstrike and according to them, the building is a nuclear reactor. They also state that the images show a facility much like the one in &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYongbyon%20Nuclear%20Scientific%20Research%20Center"&gt;Yongbyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Another image taken on October 24, shows a site where a large building used to be, the ground being wiped clean of its existence. A water-pumping station located on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuphrates%20River"&gt;Euphrates River&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was believed to be used for cooling the reactor, claim the ISIS.

"The length of the outer walls of the structures are approximately the same. From the image, the Syrian building is similar in shape to the North Korean reactor building, but the Syrian building is not far enough along in its construction to make a definitive comparison," said the institute of the study.

Syria denies that they are building any kind of nuclear facility stating "the main point is that is that the Israeli fighter jet violated the airspace of a member state of the United Nations. This is the only fact that we should focus on. The Israelis have undertaken a provocative action and they should assume the consequences."

Despite Syria's claims, the ISIS states that "dismantling and removing the building at such a rapid pace dramatically complicates any inspection of the facilities and suggests that Syria may be trying to hide what was there."

Currently, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; denies that the satellite photos show any site inside Syria and have not commented on the images. The &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (IAEA) also refused to release a statement.

<h1>FEMA employees pose as fake reporters during press conference</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=FEMA%20employees%20pose%20as%20fake%20reporters%20during%20press%20conference&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; (FEMA) is under fire after the agency held a fake press conference with fake news reporters in regards to individuals affected by the &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20wildfires%20of%20October%202007"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt; and the assistance they could receive.

The agency called a press conference on Tuesday, giving the press only 15 minutes to show up. When many did not, FEMA brought in agency officials to pose as fake reporters and ask questions. The option for reporters to call into the conference was also available, but the ones who did call in only got to listen to the press conference, and could not ask questions. No reporters were actually present during the conference, parts of which were carried live on &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News%20Channel"&gt;♡❤Fox News♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;♡❤MSNBC♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

During the briefing, FEMA employees asked Deputy Administrator &lt;a href="w%3AHarvey%20E.%20Johnson%2C%20Jr."&gt;Harvey Johnson&lt;/a&gt; a series of what &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;♡❤The New York Times♡❤&lt;/a&gt; called "decidedly friendly questions" such as "What type of commodities are you pledging to California?", "What lessons learned from Katrina have been applied?" and "Are you happy with FEMA's response so far?". The briefing followed the format of a press conference, with FEMA's press secretary at one point cautioning that he would allow just "two more questions", then calling later for a "last question". Officials who posed as fake reporters included the deputy director of public affairs Cindy Taylor and Director of External Affairs John "Pat" Philbin. 

&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; officials said that they do not condone FEMA's actions and also state that they had no idea that the conference was taking place.

"FEMA has issued an apology, saying that they had an error in judgment when they were attempting to get out a lot of information to reporters, who were asking for answers to a variety of questions in regard to the wildfires in California. It's not something I would have condoned. And they — I'm sure — will not do it again," said &lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt;, the White House's press secretary in a statement.

FEMA apologizes for the mishap and says that their intentions were only to get the information to the citizens of California.

"[The purpose was] to get information out as soon as possible, and in trying to do so we made an error in judgment. Our intent was to provide useful information and be responsive to the many questions we have received. We can and must do better," said Harvey E. Johnson, the agency's vice administrator. "The real story -- how well the response and recovery elements are working in this disaster -- should not be lost because of how we tried to meet the needs of the media in distributing facts," a FEMA statement said.

FEMA is currently deciding whether or not any officials should face punishment for the incident. One of the officials responsible, Pat Philbin, is going on to be the new head of public relations for the &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20the%20Director%20of%20National%20Intelligence"&gt;Office of the Director of National Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. 

This is not the first time that the Bush administration has come under fire for planting reporters at press conferences. In February of 2005, &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Gannon"&gt;Jeff Gannon&lt;/a&gt; was accused of being planted to ask softball questions to &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;. FEMA itself had earlier undergone criticism during &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; for using disaster workers for public relations in 2005.

<h1>Leaked emails show UK RAF were aware of Nimrod problems prior to fatal crash</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Leaked%20emails%20show%20UK%20RAF%20were%20aware%20of%20Nimrod%20problems%20prior%20to%20fatal%20crash&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Leaked emails have revealed that the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Air%20Force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (RAF) were aware of a dangerous problem with fuel leaking from &lt;a href="w%3ANimrod%20MR2"&gt;Nimrod MR2&lt;/a&gt; surveillance aircraft long before one exploded in midair during a mission in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. All 14 people on board were killed in the crash in September last year. 

Graham Knight, father of Sergeant Ben Knight, who died in the accident aged 25, told reporters that he had received internal RAF emails detailing prior concerns about the fuel leak problems on the Nimrod. One email originally sent on December 2, 2005 commented that “&lt;a href="w%3AXV230"&gt;XV230&lt;/a&gt; [the tail number of the Nimrod that would go on to crash] has fuel-leak issues which need to be rectified before the aircraft can be deployed.” Another, from February 2006, had the following to say: “The age of the airframe, combined with the aggressive tempo with which we are flying the jets in stark temperature shifts, is contributing to our leak headache.” 

Another email later the same month highlighted the serious nature of the problem: “Fuel leaks on the Nimrod MR2 aircraft now pose a significant threat to the force being able to meet commitments and operational tasking.” 

The emails were quietly forwarded to Knight, who has gone public with them via &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt;. “I have evidence that a fuel leak caused the crash and the Service was fully aware of the risk months beforehand. I believe the RAF killed my son,” he said.

He said that the emails were all written by senior members of the RAF, adding “there are so many people within the organisation who are not happy with what has been going on.”

"The more I have dug, the deeper the conspiracy gets - essentially, I think the major failures have been down to communication problems."

A board of inquiry has recently completed deliberating the cause of the accident, with a final report expected in about two weeks time. It is expected by many that the report will find a fuel leak was to blame. The crash was the largest loss of life from any UK service in a single incident since the Falklands war. Although the report will determine the cause of the crash and make recommendations to prevent it's recurrence, it will not attempt to establish blame for the disaster.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) had previously admitted they were experiencing Nimrod fuel leaks, saying in January that in the six months proceeding there had been no less than 25 fuel leaks in RAF Nimrod aircraft. Nimrods were grounded after the crash, but were subsequently phased back into operation, and are currently back in full service flying regular reconnaissance missions in Afghanistan.

The MoD's response to these recent allegations was as follows: "RAF Nimrod aircraft are designed and certified to strict airworthiness and safety standards. 

"If we didn't have confidence in the aircraft, we would not continue to fly them. 

"Nimrod has a good safety record and remains a potent and respected aircraft. 

"The Board of Inquiry to establish the cause of the accident last September is continuing and it would be unhelpful to speculate on the outcome until the board's findings are published."

All 12 of the crewmembers on board were from 102 Squadron at &lt;a href="w%3ARAF%20Kinloss"&gt;RAF Kinloss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. The loss was so large as in to have an adverse affect on the air base. The other two personnel on board were a marine and a solider.

"An aircraft should not suddenly burst into a ball of flames in mid-air,” Knight commented. He has been conducting his own investigation based on documentation obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. One important document is a recommendation made by &lt;a href="w%3ABAE%20Systems"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 following a safety audit that concluded that it would be impossible to extinguish a fire on a Nimrod. The recommendation was to install a fire detection system. It was never acted upon.

Bodies of an elderly couple have been found in Barlows scrapyard in &lt;a href="w%3AUttoxeter%2C%20Staffordshire"&gt;Uttoxeter, Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤BBC♡❤ reports the bodies were found on Friday night.

A 29-year-old man was the only person at the scrapyard when police and ambulance crews arrived and has now been arrested as a suspect.

The scene has been cordoned off by police.

"The bodies remain &lt;a href="w%3Ain%20situ"&gt;in situ&lt;/a&gt; and the scene has been cordoned off and a forensic examination has begun," a police spokesman said at 17:30 &lt;a href="w%3ABST"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt;, "It is expected that post-mortem examinations will be carried out (Saturday)."

&lt;a href="w%3AGay%20Talese"&gt;Gay Talese&lt;/a&gt; wants to go to &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Zone%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. "It so happens there is someone that's working on such a thing right now for me," the 75-year-old legendary journalist and author told . "Even if I was on &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Jazeera"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; with a gun to my head, I wouldn't be pleading with those bastards! I'd say, 'Go ahead. Make my day.'"

Few reporters will ever reach the stature of Talese. His 1966 profile of &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Sinatra"&gt;Frank Sinatra&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Sinatra%20Has%20a%20Cold"&gt;Frank Sinatra Has a Cold&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, was not only cited by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Economist%20%28magazine%29"&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as the greatest profile of Sinatra ever written, but is considered the greatest of any celebrity profile ever written. In the 70th anniversary issue of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEsquire%20Magazine"&gt;Esquire&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in October 2003, the editors declared the piece the "Best Story Esquire Ever Published."

Talese helped create and define a new style of literary reporting called &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Journalism"&gt;New Journalism&lt;/a&gt;. Talese himself told &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Public%20Radio"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt; he rejects this label ("The term new journalism became very fashionable on college campuses in the 1970s and some of its practitioners tended to be a little loose with the facts. And that's where I wanted to part company.") 

He is not bothered by the &lt;a href="w%3ABancroft%20family"&gt;Bancrofts&lt;/a&gt; selling ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Wall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤—"It's not like we should lament the passing of some noble dynasty!"—to &lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;, but he is bothered by how the press supported and sold the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; to the American people. "The press in Washington got us into this war as much as the people that are controlling it," said Talese. "They took information that was second-hand information, and they went along with it." He wants to see the Washington press corp disbanded and sent around the country to get back in touch with the people it covers; that the press should not be so focused on--and in bed with--the federal government. 

&lt;a href="Augusten%20Burroughs%20on%20addiction%2C%20writing%2C%20his%20family%20and%20his%20new%20book"&gt;Augusten Burroughs once said&lt;/a&gt; that writers are experience junkies, and Talese fits the bill. Talese--who has been married to &lt;a href="w%3ANan%20Talese"&gt;Nan Talese&lt;/a&gt; (she edited &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Frey"&gt;James Frey&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤Million Little Piece♡❤) for fifty years--can be found at baseball games in Cuba or the gay bars of Beijing, wanting to see humanity in all its experience.

Below is ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter David Shankbone's interview with Gay Talese. 

<h2>On Gay Talese</h2>

♡❤♡David Shankbone: Does it bother you that your name has come to mean 'homosexual'? 
♡❤♡DS: [♡❤Laughs♡❤] "Sports Gay-zing"?
♡❤♡DS: Is your ancestry Sicilian or Northern?
♡❤♡DS: Southern, not &lt;a href="w%3ASicily"&gt;Sicilian&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: Do you ever pay any attention to Italian politics and the happenings with the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20League%20%28Italy%29"&gt;Lega Nord&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: They can't seem to do anything politically. They &lt;a href="w%3AVenice%23Sinking%20of%20Venice"&gt;can't save Venice&lt;/a&gt; ...

<h2>On a higher power and how he'd like to die</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Do you believe in a &lt;a href="w%3AHigher%20power"&gt;higher power&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: What do you think happens when we die?
♡❤♡DS: Do you have religion?
♡❤♡DS: Do you pray?
♡❤♡DS: In certain moments more than others?
♡❤♡DS: When do you feel out of control?
♡❤♡DS: What did the letter say?
♡❤♡DS: How many times have you seen your own death?
♡❤♡DS: You wouldn't want to be a &lt;a href="w%3ATerri%20Schiavo"&gt;Terri Schiavo&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤♡DS: You're quite sprite.
♡❤♡DS: Doing what you love

<h2>On the media and Iraq</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What do you think is the reason there is this collective idea to give Americans a certain view of a place or a people that is not necessarily accurate? I think Iran is another good example, where we are consistently fed images and notions about a people and a culture that aren't really accurate.
♡❤♡DS: Or fair minded. But the reality is far more interesting than the same stories we are consistently fed.
♡❤♡DS: And Americans are the donkeys as well?
♡❤♡DS: But people are still consuming what they're throwing out there though.
♡❤♡DS: It's dangerous to actually go out there and hit the pavement. 
♡❤♡DS: How could there not be?
♡❤♡DS: Sure.
♡❤♡DS: Have you been there?
♡❤♡DS: Why haven't you?
♡❤♡DS: That shouldn't be too hard for you.
♡❤♡DS: ♡❤Esquire♡❤?
♡❤♡DS: ♡❤Esquire♡❤ does political reporting.
♡❤♡DS: What would be the difficulties for you in achieving that? It seems like you would just have to make a phone call.
♡❤♡DS: I think you're underrating your stature.
♡❤♡DS: I always wanted to know what the cemeteries are like there. What the funerals are like there. Are they like town meetings in a place where there is so much death? 
♡❤♡DS: It fits a template.
♡❤♡DS: The press is often cited for it's laziness and for reporting any source without checking its accuracy.

<h2>On the Iraq War</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Has the war affected you as a person?
♡❤♡DS: It hasn't affected you then? 
♡❤♡DS: It's affected me.
♡❤♡DS: Every single person I interview I ask about the war because I think it's important and it has affected me.
♡❤♡DS: That's what &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Rangel"&gt;Charles Rangel&lt;/a&gt; says.
♡❤♡DS: That's the only thing that does seem to motivate people to be against the war is to be paying more at the gas pump.
♡❤♡DS: Does it bother you that there's a lack of outrage?
♡❤♡DS: Or really much about anything.
♡❤♡DS: It doesn't get better as you go higher
♡❤♡DS: No, that was one of the things that stood out to me at &lt;a href="w%3AFordham%20Law%20School"&gt;Fordham Law&lt;/a&gt;. It's a top 25 law school in a very vibrant city with a lot of thinkers. I told this anecdote to &lt;a href="w%3AFloyd%20Abrams"&gt;Floyd Abrams&lt;/a&gt;: I was in a &lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20Law"&gt;Constitutional Law&lt;/a&gt; class right after &lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20Alito"&gt;Alito&lt;/a&gt; was nominated to be on the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;. The professor asked 120 law students on the first day of class how many of them thought he should be confirmed. About five students raised their hands. "New York," I thought. Then he asked how many of them thought Alito should ♡❤not♡❤ be confirmed. About ten students raised their hands. Then he asked how many did not feel they had enough information to know. about another five students raised their hands. What is that? 100 students in a Constitutional Law class at a top school can't proffer an opinion on a Supreme Court nominee? Is that apathy...confusion...fear...? What is it?
♡❤♡DS: After &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; there was a lot of debate on whether we would rebuild one of our own cities as we were over in Iraq demolishing their cities. How did you feel about that?
♡❤♡DS: Yeah, the high areas; the rich areas--
♡❤♡DS: More than it used to be?
♡❤♡DS: Every year you go to Selma? Why?
♡❤♡DS: There was a ♡❤Times♡❤ report, I think, about Selma and they say that it is very changed.
♡❤♡DS: Recently Obama and Clinton were down there marching...
♡❤♡DS: And that's going.
♡❤♡DS: Did you see the election in Alabama when the Christian Coalition defeated the ballot measure to remove the segregation language from the Alabama Constitution that said nobody is guaranteed a right to an education?
♡❤♡DS: Have you changed?
♡❤♡DS: When you were 25 did you look at black people the same way as you look at them now?
♡❤♡DS: Do you think Joel Klein has improved it?

<h2>State of Journalism</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What do you think about &lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Murdoch&lt;/a&gt; buying ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Wall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤?
♡❤♡DS: It's painted that way.
♡❤♡DS: Not any more?
♡❤♡DS: Did you see Stephen Colbert roast the Washington Press Corp and Bush at the White House Press Correspondence dinner? Nobody laughed, because they were all coming from the same place.
♡❤♡DS: Because nobody reported about it, or they just said he bombed. Then it went out on the internet and took on a life of its own and people said, "This isn't bombing, this a roasting of the entire power structure and the power structure decided they didn't like it."
♡❤♡DS: A view of the federal government from the national scene? "Here in &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; the reaction to Washington..."
♡❤♡DS: Reporting?
♡❤♡DS: The way it is now, they don't get an interview with so-and-so if they write something, or they don't get to go to someone's party!
♡❤♡DS: Do you think &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Woodward"&gt;Bob Woodward&lt;/a&gt; is still an intrepid Washington reporter? He's often been accused of being too close to the people he covers.

<h2>On travel to &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;</h2>
♡❤♡DS: When I was in my teens and early twenties my travels were very Europe-centric. But as an adult I have been drawn to places either seemingly "dangerous" to me or places that I don't feel like I know because I've read so much about them or seen so often in books and magazines. So Europe is off my map now, though I did sneak into &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤♡DS: In 2002.
♡❤♡DS: Through the &lt;a href="w%3ACaymans%20Islands"&gt;Caymans Islands&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡DS: Just took a flight on &lt;a href="w%3AAero%20Caribbean"&gt;Aero Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. Now they've stopped using the dollar. But back then, they were very much encouraging American tourists to come via &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤♡DS: 2002.
♡❤♡DS: They stopped using the dollar.
♡❤♡DS: You have the Cuban pesos. 
♡❤♡DS: I'm not really sure now because when I was there they had the system where you could actually just use dollars. That's what we used. The local currency was called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACuban%20convertible%20peso"&gt;pesos convertibles&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that were convertible into dollars. Of course they have no value anywhere else in the world except in Cuba, but then they stopped doing that. Castro has kind of created &lt;a href="w%3AFulgencio%20Batista"&gt;Batista&lt;/a&gt;'s society in some ways; not in every way. The poor are certainly a lot better off than they were under Batista. But with the &lt;a href="w%3ACuban%20embargo"&gt;embargo&lt;/a&gt;, the economy is now very tourist-based, which creates this tourist class. We didn't stay in the hotels. We wanted to stay in what they call ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACasa%20particular"&gt;casa particulars&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and I remember talking to a woman who made $30 a month as a doctor. But running this ♡❤casa particular♡❤, she was making around $300, $500 a month, which made her very rich.
♡❤♡DS: Like a rooming house. Exactly.
♡❤♡DS: That's probably the best analogy. Staying at those the money goes more to the people. The other thing they tell you when you go to Cuba is to bring aspirin and all these things that are in short supply there. The people who run these Bed and Breakfasts, if you will, make out with all the stuff the tourists give them to be dispersed in their communities. I went to &lt;a href="w%3AEcuador"&gt;Ecuador&lt;/a&gt;. I went camping in the &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon%20basin"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. These are the places that interest me now. Do you find it similar in your own travels to really seek out things underneath, to pull up rocks and try and find places off the beaten path. Going to &lt;a href="w%3ATimbuktu"&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/a&gt; or wherever. Do you have a travel philosophy?
♡❤♡DS: And talk to the people.
♡❤♡DS: And a happy society. At least I found a lot of people who were very content. They may not have an easy life, but they were quite content.
♡❤♡DS: People dancing in the streets at night.
♡❤♡DS: And friendly.
♡❤♡DS: My friend I was with was Colombian from Miami, and he made the exact same observation. He had a prejudice against Cubans from his time in Miami and he said, "These people aren't anything like the Cubans in Miami."

<h2>On Chinese gay bars</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone: Do you have a favorite country you have visited?
♡❤♡DS: You talk about China a lot.
♡❤♡DS: Is it interesting to you to watch China change?
♡❤♡DS: Do you get tired of going to the same region and then you're like, ‘I need to go to Asia for a while?'
♡❤♡DS: I haven't been to Asia. It doesn't particularly interest me all that much. There are countries I would like to see, &lt;a href="w%3ACambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt; being one. &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; is one of the areas that I am most interested to explore because I speak Spanish.
♡❤♡DS: What are the gay bars like?
♡❤♡DS: Are they flamboyant?
♡❤♡DS: It's because &lt;a href="Execution%20of%20two%20gay%20teens%20in%20Iran%20spurs%20controversy"&gt;they kill them&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤♡DS: How did you get introduced to a gay bar in Beijing?
♡❤♡DS: Including the European ones, right? English is the international language.
♡❤♡DS: And it's so basic.

<h2>On the literary canon</h2>
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="John%20Reed%20on%20Orwell%2C%20God%2C%20self-destruction%20and%20the%20future%20of%20writing"&gt;I spoke with a young novelist named John Reed&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote a book called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASnowball%27s%20Chance"&gt;Snowball's Chance&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that was an attack on &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Orwell"&gt;Orwell&lt;/a&gt; and we were talking about the &lt;a href="w%3ALiterary%20canon"&gt;literary canon&lt;/a&gt; that's taught in grade school and high school. He raised an interesting idea that I wanted to run by you. His point was that kids are not becoming readers. So much of what they learn with books and reading doesn't seem applicable to their lives. I read in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANewsweek"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that your five favorite novels and there was a lot of classics – ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Scarlet%20Letter"&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Great%20Gatsby"&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, things like that. Reed's point was that kids have a hard time bonding with these materials. What should be taught at those levels is modern literature. At the more senior levels, once they've developed acumen for reading and they relate to it on a personal level, then they'll go exploring the classics and it's almost more pertinent to them being able to understand it. An analogy would be as if you had children and they only watched &lt;a href="w%3ABette%20Davis"&gt;Bette Davis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJoan%20Crawford"&gt;Joan Crawford&lt;/a&gt; movies and then the film genre would wither because young people found it difficult to relate to it. What do you think about that idea?

♡❤♡DS: Not kids.

♡❤♡DS: That's a phenomenon. It's not really that typical; I mean, it stands out because it's a billion dollar author.

♡❤♡DS: And they can't say certain things.

♡❤♡DS: Would you agree with the idea that children don't grow up reading much anymore, outside of what's required?

♡❤♡DS: You're saying that there never was really a time when people read more unless they had cause to read a lot based upon their circumstances?

♡❤♡DS: Is that who you were reading at that age?

♡❤♡DS: I've read ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Plot%20Against%20America"&gt;The Plot Against America&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Stuttgart 16 shots of which four hit the target while Bayer Leverkusen had 23 shots while four hit the target. However, Beck's goal proved to be the difference.

Next week, Stuttgart is away to FC Nürnberg while Bayer Leverkusen are home to Arminia Bielefeld.

If you've noticed a fuzzy yellowish object at night in the northeast sky, immediately to the left of the constellation &lt;a href="w%3APerseus%20%28constellation%29"&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt;, that's because it is the &lt;a href="w%3A17P/Holmes"&gt;Comet Holmes&lt;/a&gt; which has suddenly gotten brighter in what scientists say is "absolutely unprecedented" in comet research.

Earlier reports were that the object might have been a star that went &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Nova"&gt;super nova&lt;/a&gt;, or that a new star might have formed, but because the comet does not have a tail, the earlier reports were later dismissed.

"This is a terrific outburst, and since it doesn't have a tail right now, some observers have confused it with a nova. We've had at least two reports of a new star. When the Deep Impact probe hit Comet 9P Tempel, there was almost no change in brightness. This outburst by Comet Holmes is extreme!" said &lt;a href="w%3AMinor%20Planet%20Center"&gt;Minor Planet Center&lt;/a&gt; director, Brian Marsden.

Not more than a few days ago, the comet began to get brighter and appear larger in the sky, in what scientists call an "outburst." The comet is usually only visible through telescopes, but the outburst has caused it to be visible through the naked eye and it will continue to grow brighter with its &lt;a href="w%3AComa%20%28cometary%29"&gt;coma&lt;/a&gt; eventually reaching the size of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Moon"&gt;The Moon&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, only people living in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Hemisphere"&gt;Northern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt; are able to get a glimpse of the show. Binoculars and a small telescope can be used to get a close up view.

The comet took just 24 hours to get more than 400,000 times brighter than it usually is, and is currently over one million times brighter, but Marsden says the comet's brightness could dim in days or even weeks.

The comet was discovered on November 6, 1892 by &lt;a href="w%3AEdwin%20Holmes"&gt;Edwin Holmes&lt;/a&gt; while he was looking at the &lt;a href="w%3AAndromeda%20Galaxy"&gt;Andromeda Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; through his telescope. Researchers say that the comet may also have had an outburst at the time it was discovered. It was seen once after that in 1899 and then 1906, but disappeared until it was "rediscovered" in 1964 after a prediction Marsden had made.

"Since then, it’s been behaving well – until now," added Marsden.

&lt;a href="w%3AJamal%20al-Bedawi"&gt;Jamal al-Bedawi&lt;/a&gt;, one of the planners of the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Cole%20bombing"&gt;USS Cole bombing&lt;/a&gt; in 2000 that killed 17 &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20navy"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt; personnel and injured 39 others in &lt;a href="Yemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, has been freed from a prison in &lt;a href="w%3ASana%C3%A1%2C%20Yemen"&gt;Sanaá&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Yemen after he "pleaded allegiance" to the president of the country, and will be kept under house arrest with extreme security.

Al-Bedawi, who was serving a death sentence for his role in the attack, escaped from a Yemeni prison in February of 2006 along with another plotter of the attack, &lt;a href="w%3AFawaz%20al-Rabeiee"&gt;Fawaz al-Rabeiee&lt;/a&gt;, who has yet to be captured. Al-Bedawi turned himself in to authorities just over two weeks ago. 21 other militants, 13 of which who were members of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, also escaped from the prison.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; officials have described the move as "disappointing." "This action is inconsistent with a deepening of our bilateral counter-terrorism co-operation. We have communicated our displeasure to Yemeni officials," said a U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Security%20Council"&gt;National Security Council&lt;/a&gt; spokesman.

There has been no official information has yet to be released to the press about the decision or the conditions of al-Bedawi's release.

Yemen denied on Sunday media reports that a man convicted over the al Qaeda bombing of the U.S. Navy ship Cole in 2000 had been set free.

Attorneys for &lt;a href="Oral%20Roberts%20University"&gt;Oral Roberts University&lt;/a&gt; requested a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agag%20order"&gt;gag order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on court filings related to alleged illegal political and financial wrongdoing as well as wrongful firings. According to a court filing, ORU believes "their legal motion that publicity allegedly manipulated by the professors and their attorneys could lower the possibility of a fair trial. They want the professors and their attorneys barred from talking about the case outside of court." Specifically, "The motion refers to a report allegedly compiled by Roberts' sister-in-law, Stephanie Cantees, that Roberts has said consists of false rumors."

Also on Friday, the ORU Regents hired the &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; law firm of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiller%20%26amp%3B%20Chevalier%20Chartered"&gt;Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to investigate ORU expenses and the Arlington, Texas accounting firm &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APickens%20Snodgrass%20Koch%20%26amp%3B%20Company"&gt;Pickens Snodgrass Koch &amp; Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will support the investigation. 

The controversy has forced ORU president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Roberts%20%28evangelist%29"&gt;Richard Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to step down as his father &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOral%20Roberts"&gt;Oral Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; returns to the school. ORU Board of Regents Chairman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Pearsons"&gt;George Pearsons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said the change was temporary and did not imply guilt.

<h2>Plotter of USS Cole attack freed from prison</h2>

Jamal al-Bedawi, one of the mastermind plotters of the USS Cole bombing in 2000 that killed 17 American NAVY personnel and injured 39 others in Yemen, has been freed from a prison in Sanaá, the capital of Yemen after he "pleaded allegiance" to the president of the country, and will be kept under house arrest with extreme security.

Al-Bedawi, who was serving a death sentence for his role in the attack, escaped from a Yemeni prison in February of 2006 along with another plotter of the attack, Fawaz al-Rabeiee, who has yet to be captured. Al-Bedawi turned himself in to authorities just over two weeks ago. 

United States officials have described the move as "disappointing." 

<h2>Elderly couple found slain in scrapyard in Staffordshire, England</h2>

Bodies of an elderly couple have been found in Barlows scrapyard in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, United Kingdom. BBC reports the bodies were found on Friday night.

A 29-year-old man was the only person at the scrapyard when police and ambulance crews arrived and has now been arrested as a suspect.

The scene has been cornered off by police.

<h2>Unexpected comet 'outburst' could be visible for weeks</h2>

If you've noticed a fuzzy yellowish object at night in the northeast sky, immediately to the left of the constellation Perseus, that's because it is the Comet Holmes which has suddenly gotten brighter in what scientists say is "absolutely unprecedented" in comet research.

Earlier reports were that the object might have been a star that went super nova, or that a new star might have formed, but because the comet does not have a tail, the earlier reports were later dismissed.

The comet took just 24 hours to get more than 400,000 times brighter than it usually is, and is currently over one million times brighter, but Brian Marsden, director of the Minor Planet Center, says the comet's brightness could dim in days or even weeks.

<h2>Dalai Lama to meet with Canada's PM on Monday</h2>

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper will be meeting with the Dalai Lama on Monday at his office in Ottawa at 2 p.m.

The Dalai Lama is scheduled to give a speech on Sunday in downtown Ottawa. He is also planned to meet various Canadian officials and hold a news conference later in the week.

This is the second time the Dalai Lama will meet with a Canadian Prime Minister.

<h2>New bill will ban Muslims from wearing veils at polls; Canada</h2>

A new bill will propose a law to amend the Canada Elections Act to ban Muslims from wearing veils (or niqab's) while at polls.

According to a Canadian government press release it will allow "someone to be recognized, who is attempting to commit an offense at the polls such as trying to vote twice)," and it will "restore public confidence in the electoral process."

Complaints arose from the Quebec elections that some people reportedly concealed their faces during voting.

Sarah Elgazzar, a spokeswoman for the Canada Council on American-Islamic Relations in September stated that the small minority of women targeted by the bill already remove their veils for identification.

The &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party&lt;/a&gt; has elected a new party leader during its 25th Congress over the weekend. Current leader, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Miyeegombiin Enkhbold&lt;/a&gt;, was defeated by &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Sanj Bayar&lt;/a&gt; in a 377-289 vote. Bayar, the former secretary general of the MPRP, is expected to succeed Enkhbold as Prime Minister following a decision to unify the positions of the party chair and Prime Minister.

On Friday afternoon in Moore Allen &amp; Innocent's &lt;a href="w%3ACirencester"&gt;Cirencester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; auction house a suspect "&lt;a href="w%3ARembrandt"&gt;Rembrandt&lt;/a&gt;" painting was sold for &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;2.2 million, after being estimated by many experts at just £1,000 to £1,500. This is the most expensive Rembrandt to ever be sold in a provincial auction house in all England's auction history.

Bidding started at £4,500 and quickly galloped upwards, by the time it had reached £1 million bidding was rising in £100,000's. However by the £1.8 million mark had slowed down to increasing by £50,000 a time, by this point the pace had slowed remarkably, all 8 phone bidders had stopped and it was left between two people still in the room. 

When the hammer went down a round of applause rose up, staff looked stunned to silence and the room quickly emptied with people calling friends to tell of the news. Considering the original owner of the piece had kept it in their family house for generations thinking it nothing but a copy by one of Rembrandt's pupils it was an amazing result. The buyer of the piece has been left anonymous even to the auctions owners however the 9.5 by 6.5 inch painting labeled "The Young Rembrandt as Democrates the Laughing Philosopher" is sure to now be tested for authenticity. If it is a true Rembrandt then the buyer will have a relative bargain as it will likely be worth in the region of £8-10 million.

Reggie Bibbs is a 43-year-old-man living in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Bibbs was born with a genetic disease called &lt;a href="w%3Aneurofibromatosis"&gt;neurofibromatosis&lt;/a&gt; (NF), which causes him to develop tumors on his body (see infobox on the right). NF can be a subtle disease, but in Bibbs' case it has left him with a disfigured face and deformed leg. But he is happy with the way he looks, and doesn't want to change his appearance to please other people. He has launched a successful campaign entitled "Just Ask", and that's just what ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ did in a video-interview.

The interview was prepared by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ reporter with the help of &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ANCurse"&gt;Bertalan Meskó&lt;/a&gt; (who has a popular genetics and web 2.0 blog). Their questions were sent to a close friend of Mr. Bibbs, Lou Congelio, who kindly conducted the interview.

Currency &lt;a href="w%3Ahedge%20fund"&gt;hedge fund&lt;/a&gt; operator &lt;a href="w%3AGregory%20Chase"&gt;Gregory Chase&lt;/a&gt; was alerted by internet sources that former Senator &lt;a href="Mike%20Gravel"&gt;Mike Gravel&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidate in the race for presidency, will be excluded from the latest upcoming debate (that will be held this Tuesday at &lt;a href="w%3ADrexel%20University"&gt;Drexel University&lt;/a&gt; and broadcast on &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;♡❤MSNBC♡❤&lt;/a&gt;). Chase immediately took action by contacting &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;♡❤NBC♡❤&lt;/a&gt; executives, who are charge of the debate.

The letter was sent and it includes an explanation as to why ♡❤NBC♡❤ should not censor Gravel, and also holds an offer of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1 million to include Gravel. The US$1 million offer could be given to ♡❤NBC♡❤ in exchange for allowing the senator to participate in the 2-hour debate, by either Chase purchasing a million dollars worth of advertising space on their network, donating the million to ♡❤NBC's♡❤ favorite charity, or giving the million dollars to ♡❤NBC's♡❤ parent company, &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Electric"&gt;General Electric&lt;/a&gt;.

The decision made by Chase to give the million dollars to ♡❤NBC♡❤ is due to criteria that Gravel did not meet, which includes the following; having campaigned in &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; at least 14 times in the past year, not polling high enough in national polls, and Sen. Gravel's campaign had not raised more than US$1 million.

According to the ♡❤Gravel for President♡❤ campaign, Gravel reportedly visited either New Hampshire or Iowa at least 14 times since his announcement on April 17, 2006, and according to a recent poll by &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;♡❤CNN♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, Gravel is tied with fellow candidates Rep. &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, and Sen. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Dodd"&gt;Chris Dodd&lt;/a&gt; and 1% behind Gov. &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Richardson"&gt;Bill Richardson&lt;/a&gt;.

The fundraising requirement is the only criteria not achieved.

Below is the letter in full that was sent to ♡❤NBC♡❤ and &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20National%20Committee"&gt;Democratic National Committee&lt;/a&gt; executives.

As of October 26, 2007, Chase has not received a response from ♡❤NBC♡❤ regarding the offer.

&lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Pawlenty"&gt;Tim Pawlenty&lt;/a&gt; said today that Essar Global has committed to fully comply with all &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and international law, including those prohibiting certain investments in &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, and that he will support continued state assistance for Essar’s proposed steel project on the Iron Range.

A few days after Indian company Essar Steel Holdings Limited acquired Minnesota Steel LLC, the governor of Minnesota announced that he "will strongly oppose any effort to provide state financial assistance to companies or entities that engage in prohibited business practices with Iran." 

Governor Pawlenty recently returned from a trip to &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. He learned that Indian company &lt;a href="w%3AEssar%20Group"&gt;Essar Global Limited&lt;/a&gt; is pursuing a project to build a refinery in southern &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

There is no official word yet from Essar Group, but Iran's Petroenergy Information Network says Essar Group is expected to take a 60% stake in the project and that Essar's Ravi Ruia was negotiating for the project in Iran last week.

The northern Minnesota project will be the first facility which includes all steps in steel production from iron mining to a &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1.65 billion steel mill. The Iranian refinery will have a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day and cost $8-10 billion.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; announced on October 29, 2007 the list of winners of the &lt;a href="w%3APresidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom"&gt;Presidential Medal of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, the highest civilian honor which may be granted by the United States. 

President &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Truman"&gt;Harry Truman&lt;/a&gt; initiated the award in 1945 to honor civilian service during &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; and President &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kennedy"&gt;John Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; re-established it in 1963.

The Medal of Freedom may be awarded by the president to any person who has made an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, or to world peace, cultural or other significant endeavors.

The medals will be awarded on November 5, 2007.

The winners are:

The ACLU's philosophy is not that it agrees or disagrees with any of these people and the choices that they make, but that they have personal liberties that must not be trampled upon. 

In ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter 's interview with the President of the ACLU, &lt;a href="w%3ANadine%20Strossen"&gt;Nadine Strossen&lt;/a&gt;, he wanted to cover some basic ground on the ACLU's beliefs. Perhaps the area where they are most misunderstood or have their beliefs most misrepresented is their feelings about religion in the public sphere. The ACLU categorically does not want to see religion disappear from schools or in the public forum; but they do not want to see government advocacy of any particular religion. Thus, former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's placement of a ten ton monument to the Ten Commandments outside the courthouse is strenuously opposed; but "Lone Ranger of the Manger" Rita Warren's placement of nativity scenes in public parks is vigorously defended. In the interview, Strossen talks about how certain politicians and televangelists purposefully misstate the law and the ACLU's work in order to raise funds for their campaigns.

David Shankbone's discussion with Strossen touches upon many of the ACLU's hot button issues: religion, Second Amendment rights, drug liberalization, "partial-birth abortion" and whether or not George W. Bush should be impeached. It may surprise the reader that many ideas people have about the most visible of America's civil libertarian organizations are not factually correct and that the ACLU often works closely with many of the organizations people think despise its existence.
<h2>Strossen's background</h2>

♡❤♡David Shankbone:♡❤♡ Why did you want to be an attorney?
♡❤♡DS: Why?
♡❤♡DS: What family experiences?
♡❤♡DS: What were you taught about him?
♡❤♡DS: When you went to &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20School"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, were you an activist on campus?
♡❤♡DS: What would you say the atmosphere was like on campus back then, with all the issues that were being contended with, how would you describe it?

<h2>Religion in schools</h2>
♡❤♡DS: You had mentioned that one of the things that affected you with your family was seeing points of view not being allowed to be expressed. Many &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20right"&gt;religious conservatives&lt;/a&gt; would say that the ACLU opposes having their points of view in the schools. How would you respond?
♡❤♡DS: So there isn’t any opposition to having religious groups meeting inside of public schools?
♡❤♡DS: Would you defend someone’s right to have a religious meeting in a public school?

<h2>Religious symbols</h2>
♡❤♡DS: The ACLU has been involved in removing &lt;a href="w%3AReligious%20symbolism"&gt;religious symbology&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20sphere"&gt;public forum&lt;/a&gt;. Can you state your views on that?
♡❤♡DS: Can you give an example of a religious symbology case where the ACLU supported religious freedom?

<h2>How the ACLU is misrepresented by politicians and televangelists</h2>

♡❤♡DS: Do people misconstrue or misunderstand your work and what you have argued for or against?

♡❤♡DS: —and the ACLU said—
♡❤♡DS: —&lt;a href="w%3ARoy%20Moore"&gt;Roy Moore&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: When does a symbol become historical and when is it intrinsically religious? For instance, a community that was once a mission and they have had a large cross on a mountaintop that to them is more historical marker.
♡❤♡DS: Well, two years.
♡❤♡DS: Almost a slave.
♡❤♡DS: Yes, 3/5ths! [♡❤Laughs♡❤]
♡❤♡DS: That’s always the problem in law: who is that reasonable observer? Someone from the community, someone who has just moved into the community?
♡❤♡DS: Going back to when you have debated religious conservatives and they make the charge that what the ACLU is working toward is no religion in schools, and you can’t have a prayer group, do you think there is a conscious motivation to misrepresent what you have done and want, or is it a misunderstanding?

<h2>The abortion debate</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Don’t you think the way both sides go about engaging each other harms America? Take the &lt;a href="w%3AGonzales%20v.%20Carhart"&gt;partial-birth abortion Supreme Court case&lt;/a&gt;. Did you read &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;Justice Stevens'&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤New York Times♡❤ interview with &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Rosen"&gt;Jeff Rosen&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: He said it was a silly decision that wasn’t particularly important—
♡❤♡DS: Yes. He said it was, in the end, not a particularly important case.
♡❤♡DS: He was talking about in terms of the effect, that it didn’t have much of an effect because there were &lt;a href="w%3AAbortion%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;other legal alternatives&lt;/a&gt; to that particular method of abortion.
♡❤♡DS: The question I have is that on its face it was deciding one particular issue in the abortion debate, but a lot of pro-choice organizations paint this as, “We are now getting ready to ban abortion; this is the first step on what might be a short road—“
♡❤♡DS: Yes, a slippery slope. Isn’t it almost the same thing when the evangelicals say, “They are coming for your prayer, your kids aren’t going to be able to pray or allow God in schools.”
♡❤♡DS: Is it healthy for us to be ringing these alarm bells every time one nuance in the argument gets addressed?
♡❤♡DS: But let’s say the Christians give you that, and they say, “This is just the first step and what they ultimately want is not to have the word God said ♡❤anywhere♡❤ in the public square.”
♡❤♡DS: Whereas in the abortion argument it is a stated goal to bring about the end of ♡❤Roe v. Wade♡❤.

<h2>Judicial activism</h2>
♡❤♡DS: When you hear the phrase “&lt;a href="w%3AJudicial%20activism"&gt;judicial activism&lt;/a&gt;” what comes to your mind?
♡❤♡DS: So you believe in the &lt;a href="w%3ALiving%20Constitution"&gt;living Constitution&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: “These are cruel and unusual punishments”
♡❤♡DS: Do you think there is a right to privacy in the Constitution?

<h2>Capital punishment and criminal justice</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What argument for &lt;a href="w%3ACapital%20punishment%20debate"&gt;capital punishment&lt;/a&gt; do you think is ♡❤most♡❤ compelling for it?
♡❤♡DS: The &lt;a href="w%3ACriminal%20justice"&gt;criminal justice system&lt;/a&gt; is a rehabilitative system?
♡❤♡DS: Is that what it should be?
♡❤♡DS: How does it do that?

<h2>Decriminalization of drugs and suicide</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Are you an active member of &lt;a href="w%3ANORML"&gt;NORML&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: Do you believe in the &lt;a href="w%3ADecriminalization%20of%20non-medicinal%20marijuana%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;decriminalization of marijuana&lt;/a&gt;? 
♡❤♡DS: Can you give me your case for that?
♡❤♡DS: Should &lt;a href="w%3ALegal%20views%20of%20suicide"&gt;suicide be legal&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: So how would you like to die?
♡❤♡DS: You wouldn’t want a &lt;a href="w%3ATerri%20Schiavo"&gt;Terri Schiavo&lt;/a&gt; situation?
♡❤♡DS: So you have the choice, what is your choice?

<h2>War and threats to humanity</h2>
♡❤♡DS: What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity right now?
♡❤♡DS: However you interpret the question.

♡❤♡DS: How has the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; affected your world view?
♡❤♡DS: Have you seen a precipitous drop?
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="Iranian%20President%20Ahmadinejad%20speaks%20at%20Columbia%20University"&gt;Ahmadinejad came to Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and brought that argument up.
♡❤♡DS: It’s surprising that Hagel gave that criticism since it is his party that has instituted the fear of government into our culture. Such as Reagan’s famous line that the most terrifying words in the English language are, “I’m from the government and I’m here to help.”
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="Gay%20Talese%20on%20the%20state%20of%20journalism%2C%20Iraq%20and%20his%20life"&gt;When I interviewed Gay Talese&lt;/a&gt;, I asked him how the Iraq War affected him and he said it had not. He said, “I wish it did!” He said he doesn’t feel anything and that he doesn’t think anyone else does, either. He feels you can’t have a war affect people unless you have &lt;a href="w%3AConscription%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;conscription&lt;/a&gt;.
♡❤♡DS: But they see it as voluntary service. It’s a voluntary army.
♡❤♡DS: --That’s what Talese said. &lt;a href="Sam%20Brownback%20on%20running%20for%20President%2C%20gay%20rights%2C%20the%20Middle%20East%20and%20religion"&gt;Senator Brownback told me&lt;/a&gt; he is against conscription, and it’s interesting that the people who are most for the war are the people who are most for a voluntary army. 
♡❤♡DS: Rangel’s bent is that if people were actually fighting in the wars, or forced to fight, that it would bring public opinion against the war.

<h2>Should George Bush be impeached?</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you think &lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20to%20impeach%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush should be impeached&lt;/a&gt;?
♡❤♡DS: You just don’t think it would be productive.

<h2>Gun rights</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Where do you stand on the &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Amendment"&gt;Second Amendment&lt;/a&gt; and the rights of gun owners? Are the rights accorded to well-armed militias, or is it accorded to unfettered rights of individuals to own guns?
<h2>Strossen's philosophy</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Last question: what trait do you deplore in people?
♡❤♡DS: That’s about the best answer I can think of coming from the President of the ACLU! [♡❤Laughs♡❤]
♡❤♡DS: That you deplore in people.
♡❤♡DS: Do you deplore any in yourself?

ElBaradei discussed Iran's nuclear program in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Sunday.

Tensions between the United States and Iran have been on the rise recently, with U.S. President George W. Bush warning of the potential for "World War III" should Iran develop a nuclear weapon. On Thursday, the United States imposed new sanctions on Iran in an effort to pressure it to stop enriching uranium.

ElBaradei recommended entering negotiations with Iran as soon as possible to resolve the conflict. 

<h2>US turns security for Karbala over to Iraqi forces</h2>

United States forces in Iraq have today turned over control of Karbala Governorate over to Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). It is the eighth of eighteen provinces to be returned to local control since the US-led invasion in 2003.

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki reached out to those who have left the Iraqi insurgency and turned against Al-Qaeda in Iraq, welcoming them back to rebuild Iraq.

In a joint press release, General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker stated Iraqi Security Forces have been successfully operating independently for the past three months.

<h2>$1m offer for NBC to include U.S. presidential candidate Gravel in TV debate</h2>

Currency hedge fund operator Gregory Chase was alerted by internet sources that Former Senator Mike Gravel, a Democratic presidential candidate in the race for presidency, will be excluded from the latest upcoming debate (that will be held this Tuesday at Drexel University and broadcast on MSNBC), Chase immediately took action by contacting NBC executives, who are charge of the debate.

The letter was sent and it includes an explanation as to why NBC should not censor Gravel, and also holds an offer of US$1,000,000 to include Gravel, NBC had stipulated as the fundraising amount needed for candidates participating in the debate.

As of October 26, 2007, Chase has not received a response from NBC regarding the offer.

<h2>Prime Minister Ghedi of Somalia resigns</h2>

The Prime Minister of Somalia, Ali Mohammed Ghedi, has submitted his resignation to President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed and Speaker of the Transitional Federal Parliament, Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe.

A feud between Ghedi and the President has long been blamed for the lack of progress and inability of the government to deal effectively with the armed conflict with the Islamic Courts Union. The rift has often has been cited as frustrating for Western diplomats who support the government.

&lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Habana"&gt;Bryan Habana&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Arugby"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; player for the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South Africa national rugby union team&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Bulls"&gt;Blue Bulls&lt;/a&gt;, was tackled by a fan who tried to grab the &lt;a href="w%3AWebb%20Ellis%20Cup"&gt;Webb Ellis Cup&lt;/a&gt; from Habana while he was accepting the award at &lt;a href="w%3ANewlands%20Stadium"&gt;Newlands Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;.

"[The fan] came like a bullet, flying through a crowd of people that were behind Bryan. Bryan luckily saw him and kept the trophy tight," said Rayaan Adriaanse, a spokesman for &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South African&lt;/a&gt; Rugby who said that the man was the only "individual intent on spoiling the enjoyment of a lot of people."

The fan can be seen coming out of the left of the screen and jumping up in an attempt to grab the trophy, which Habana was raising above his head. The trophy did fall, but was not damaged despite its lip hitting the ground.

The unnamed man was immediately apprehended by stadium officials and was given a warning. He was not arrested. He was reported as an "overexcited fan."

Nine &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; nationals, that were arrested after they were caught trying to &lt;a href="w%3Aairlift"&gt;airlift&lt;/a&gt; over a hundred children from the country, will face charges of &lt;a href="w%3Akidnapping"&gt;kidnapping&lt;/a&gt;, officials in &lt;a href="Chad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; say. Seven &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; nationals, who were the crew of the plane, will face charges of being &lt;a href="w%3AAccessory%20%28legal%20term%29"&gt;complicit&lt;/a&gt;. Two Chadians were also charged.

The French, six of whom are members of a charity by the name of "&lt;a href="w%3AZoe%27s%20Ark"&gt;Zoe's Ark&lt;/a&gt;," say that they were trying to rescue the children from the &lt;a href="w%3Ahumanitarian%20crisis"&gt;humanitarian crisis&lt;/a&gt; that is resulting from the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur%20conflict"&gt;Darfur conflict&lt;/a&gt;. The other three are &lt;a href="w%3Ajournalism"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt;, there to cover the "rescue."

The prosecutor in &lt;a href="w%3AAb%C3%A9ch%C3%A9"&gt;Abéché&lt;/a&gt;, Ahmat Daoud, said: "For the nine French people it is a matter of kidnapping of minors...as well as extortion." They face 20 years in prison if convicted.

"Zoe's Ark" describes the children as &lt;a href="w%3Aorphan"&gt;orphan&lt;/a&gt;s and says that they would have a better life in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. "The team is made up of firemen, doctors and journalists," said spokesperson, Christophe Letien, at a news conference. "It's unimaginable that doubts are being cast on these people of good faith, who volunteered to save children from Darfur." However, French news agency &lt;a href="w%3ACAPA"&gt;CAPA&lt;/a&gt; published an interview in which a "Zoe's Ark" member said they could not be completely sure the children were orphans in need of help.

According to Annette Rehrl, spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees"&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees&lt;/a&gt;, few of the children appear to actually be orphans. "They keep saying that they want to return to their parents. Most of them are between three and six years old. It’s very difficult to ask three-year-olds their names and where they come from. Also, some children have already changed their names and stories," Rehrl said.

French officials say that they warned the group against this operation for months. "Zoe's Ark" offices in France were searched to see if the group broke French adoption law by promising families that they could adopt and not just host the children.

The &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Chad"&gt;President of Chad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIdriss%20D%C3%A9by"&gt;Idriss Déby&lt;/a&gt;, says that it is a case of "kidnap, pure and simple." He further suggested that "Zoe's Ark" may have sought to supply the children to &lt;a href="w%3APedophilia"&gt;pedophile rings&lt;/a&gt; or use them as donors for &lt;a href="w%3Aorgan%20transplant"&gt;organ transplant&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; is about to deploy a &lt;a href="w%3Apeacekeeping"&gt;peacekeeping&lt;/a&gt; force, which includes French soldiers, along the border between Chad and &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. Déby has assured his French counterpart, &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;, he will not attempt to block the EU troops.

&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; beat out &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; to be selected as host the &lt;a href="w%3A2011%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup"&gt;2011 edition&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AFIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup"&gt;FIFA Women's World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

Germany has won the last two FIFA Women's World Cup and never gave up a goal in the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 FIFA Women's World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

A woman who attempted to shoplift merchandise at a &lt;a href="w%3AT.J.%20Maxx"&gt;T.J. Maxx&lt;/a&gt; department store with another adult accomplice in &lt;a href="w%3AGreenburgh%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Greenburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; forgot one important item in her heist: her 8-month-old son.

While trying to shoplift, Suzette Gruber, aged 39, ran out of the store when she thought she would be caught, panicked, and left her son sitting in his stroller inside the store. Her accomplice also ran, and has yet to be identified.

"The mother panicked ... and just took off. It's sad," said Greenburgh police officer, Lt. Desmond Martin who also said that she left her cellular phone and purse behind.

Police say they will keep the child in protective custody while they investigate the incident. A man has claimed to be the father, presenting a birth certificate to police in an attempt to regain custody of the baby. He claims Gruber called him and told him to pick the boy up. Police are still working to confirm the man's claims. Reports say that he does not know where Gruber is.

Hidden inside the stroller's compartments were vases, teapots and utensils that were worth about &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$185.

Gruber has been charged with theft before. In March of 2007, Gruber stole clothing from a mall and was charged with larceny and endangering the welfare of a child. According to reports, her then 2-week old son and 14-year old daughter were with her when she was arrested in March.

Gruber turned herself in to Greenburgh Police on Tuesday morning. She will be charged with abandonment of a child, a felony, and misdemeanor charges of petty larceny and endangering the welfare of a child, according to Police Chief John Kapica.

People living behind the "&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20censorship%20in%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Great Firewall of China&lt;/a&gt;", do not have direct access to &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, a popular internet encyclopedia. But they can eat Wikipedia.

Or Wekipedia, actually.

Blogs have now started reporting that supermarkets now sell "Wekipedia" bread, created by a "Beijing Wekipedia Foods Co., Ltd." Just one letter different than the famed website, it appears to be a new company and product.

Even its Chinese name 维百客 (&lt;a href="w%3APinyin"&gt;pinyin&lt;/a&gt;: wei bǎi kē) is similar to the encyclopedia's 维基百科 (wei ji bǎi kē); the characters 维 and 百 are in both names. The words "bǎi kē" means "encyclopedia", a term with no obvious connection to baked foodstuffs like bread.

A bearded man is featured on the packaging; Blognation jokes that it is supposed to be &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, the site's co-founder.

The Wikimedia Foundation's communications manager Sandra Ordonez was amused at the branding choice, commenting "I think this is very funny. If they [internet users in mainland China] can't access Wikipedia virtually, at least they can eat it for breakfast".

While the Wikimedia Foundation is not in the bread industry, it is currently looking for "dough" of another sort. The American-based charitable organization is holding a , to help pay for expenses like running their servers.

Two scientists working at &lt;a href="w%3AMcGill%20University"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, reporting on their research and the research of other scientists, state in &lt;a href="w%3AScientific%20American"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="w%3AVitamin%20D"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; may have many uses in the human body besides building strong bones.

According to the scientists, Luz E. Tavera-Mendoza and John H. White, Vitamin D intake may also be beneficial in the prevention of &lt;a href="w%3ACancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMultiple%20sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADiabetes%20mellitus"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and fighting &lt;a href="w%3ATuberculosis"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AInfluenza"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AInflammatory%20bowel%20disease"&gt;inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers say that there is an emerging "widespread consensus" among experts that a large part of the population has levels of Vitamin D in their bodies that is well below optimal concentrations for health, particularly in temperate regions, due to decreased &lt;a href="w%3Asunlight"&gt;sunlight&lt;/a&gt; and or less time outdoors, and during or just after the winter months. One study indicated that as many as 92% of adolescent girls in Northern Europe may have deficient levels of Vitamin D and 37% have severely deficient levels. 

The problem is far worse among &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20American"&gt;African-Americans&lt;/a&gt; than Americans with lighter skin. Almost half of African-American women may be seriously Vitamin D deficient, with presumably still another fraction deficient. Furthermore, the authors say researchers at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere believe the &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; minimum recommended daily allowance of Vitamin D is far too low. The &lt;a href="w%3ADietary%20Reference%20Intake"&gt;Recommended Dietary Allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) ranges from 200 to 600 &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20unit"&gt;International Units&lt;/a&gt; (IU). In fact, the authors themselves take Vitamin D supplements. The first author takes 1000 IU during wintertime and the second author takes 5,000 IU in wintertime. They do caution, however, that there is a level at which Vitamin D becomes toxic.

Similar research has also been recently performed by researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20University%20of%20Technology"&gt;Queensland University of Technology&lt;/a&gt; who found that many elderly were likely not getting sufficient Vitamin D due in part to insufficient exposure to the &lt;a href="w%3Asun"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s most senior traffic police officer faces charges of speeding at 90 &lt;a href="w%3Amiles%20per%20hour"&gt;mph&lt;/a&gt; in a 60 mph speed limit zone (the equivalent of speeding at 144 &lt;a href="w%3Akilometres%20per%20hour"&gt;km/h&lt;/a&gt; in a 96 km/h zone). The &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Constable"&gt;Chief Constable&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Yorkshire%20Police"&gt;South Yorkshire Police&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMeredydd%20Hughes"&gt;Meredydd Hughes&lt;/a&gt; was allegedly caught speeding on the &lt;a href="w%3AA5%20road"&gt;A5 road&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AChirk"&gt;Chirk&lt;/a&gt; in north &lt;a href="Wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;.

Hughes was caught by a &lt;a href="w%3ARoad%20safety%20camera"&gt;camera&lt;/a&gt; that takes photographs of speeding cars. He is known as one of the main advocates for nationwide installation of such cameras.

Hughes is set to appear at &lt;a href="w%3AWrexham"&gt;Wrexham&lt;/a&gt; Magistrates Court on November 21, 2007. He faces a &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;1000 fine and a driving ban if convicted.

As the head of road policing within the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociation%20of%20Chief%20Police%20Officers"&gt;Association of Chief Police Officers&lt;/a&gt;, Hughes can be considered the top traffic cop in the UK.

The &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Dollar"&gt;Dollar&lt;/a&gt; fell to an all time low against the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after data from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; heightened concerns regarding an economic recession. 

The U.S. currency traded at 1.444 versus the Euro and reached a 26-year low against the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Pound"&gt;British Pound&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . An index that measures US consumer confidence fell in October to 95,6 points while in August U.S. home prices declined 4,4%, the biggest fall of the past six years. The data bolsters speculation that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may cut &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainterest%20rates"&gt;interest rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the next meeting. The U.S. central bank is set to decide on interest rates on the 31st of October and economists expect a 25 basis point cut to 4,50%

<h3>Singer Robert Goulet dies at age 73</h3>
&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; performer &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Goulet"&gt;Robert Goulet&lt;/a&gt; died on Tuesday in Los Angeles. The American-born, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;-raised singer and actor gained widespread attention in the 1960s, eventually winning &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Award"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20Award"&gt;Grammy&lt;/a&gt; awards for his talent.

Goulet was admitted to hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; late last month where it was learned he contracted &lt;a href="w%3Aidiopathic%20pulmonary%20fibrosis"&gt;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;. He was transferred to &lt;a href="w%3ACedars-Sinai%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Cedars-Sinai Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles earlier this month and died there awaiting a lung transplant. He was 73.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) a &lt;a href="w%3Amoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 5.6 earthquake, lasting about 30 seconds, struck at 20:04:54 (&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20time%20zone"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt;) on October 30, 2007, with the &lt;a href="w%3Aepicenter"&gt;epicenter&lt;/a&gt; being five miles north, northeast of &lt;a href="w%3AAlum%20Rock%2C%20California"&gt;Alum Rock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and nine miles northeast of the center of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;. The actual coordinates given by USGS put it along the border of San Jose and Milpitas in the hills near neighborhoods in both cities. The quake was felt as far away as the California communities of &lt;a href="w%3ASacramento"&gt;Sacramento&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASonoma%2C%20California"&gt;Sonoma&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Banos%2C%20California"&gt;Los Banos&lt;/a&gt;. It was the most powerful quake in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley since 1989.

At least ten aftershocks had been reported by 8:35 p.m with magnitudes ranging from 1.3 to 1.8.

Phone service, including cellular phone service, was reported to be down in some areas around the epicenter. Residents and business owners also reported their homes shaking.

According to the USGS, damage could be "moderate to heavy" and Rafael Abreu of the USGS said that the earthquake is considered "moderate," but so far there are "no injuries." The quake was reported at a depth of 9.2 km (5.7 miles).

USGS predicts a 30% chance of strong (magnitude &gt;5) aftershocks in the next seven days, with a 5-10% probability of aftershocks stronger than the main quake. Additionally, USGS predicts approximately 15-40 small (magnitude 3-5) aftershocks.

The USGS reports that the quake was centered on the &lt;a href="w%3ACalaveras%20Fault"&gt;Calaveras Fault&lt;/a&gt;, and was the most powerful earthquake on that fault since the 1984 Morgan Hill earthquake.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Red%20Sox"&gt;Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; baseball team, back in &lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; today, fresh off their sweep of the &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%20Rockies"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt;, paraded down from the venerable Fenway Park onto &lt;a href="w%3ABoylston%20Street"&gt;Boylston Street&lt;/a&gt; in Boston making their way through the heart of Boston's Back Bay until reaching the Boston Common where they then made their way up &lt;a href="w%3ATremont%20Street"&gt;Tremont Street&lt;/a&gt; to Boston's Government Center where the rally ended at City Hall.

The event was a "rolling rally", a term coined to describe the Red Sox victory parade in 2004, which had seen the Sox win their first World Series in over 86 years. The current players of the their team made their way up the road, with current team owners &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20W.%20Henry"&gt;John W. Henry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Werner"&gt;Tom Werner&lt;/a&gt; and president &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Lucchino"&gt;Larry Lucchino&lt;/a&gt;, who were followed by General Manager &lt;a href="w%3ATheo%20Epstein"&gt;Theo Epstein&lt;/a&gt; and Manager &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Francona"&gt;Terry Francona&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom had their own boat. 

The rally chugged along, as airplanes carrying banners congratulating the Red Sox flew over, with the duck boats filled with the team and it's supporters and even one for the Red Sox players of yesteryear, &lt;a href="w%3ADom%20DiMaggio"&gt;Dom DiMaggio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Pesky"&gt;Johnny Pesky&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AKyle%20Snyder"&gt;Kyle Snyder&lt;/a&gt; held up the trophy for all on Boylston Street to gaze at the reward the Sox fought so hard for. Catcher and team captain, &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Varitek"&gt;Jason Varitek&lt;/a&gt; waved a sign encouraging team management to re-sign third baseman and World Series MVP, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Lowell"&gt;Mike Lowell&lt;/a&gt;. The crowd greeted this with enthusiasm leading to cheers of "Re-sign Lowell!"

However, &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Papelbon"&gt;Jonathan Papelbon&lt;/a&gt; was not on a duck boat, he was on a flatbed truck playing air guitar with a broom with local Celtic punk stars, the &lt;a href="w%3ADropkick%20Murphys"&gt;Dropkick Murphys&lt;/a&gt;, who first gained notoriety in 2004, with a reworking of the old Boston Red Sox fan song, Tessie, which became the rallying cry for the 2004 season. The band gained either further recognition when their song I'm Shipping Up to Boston, which based on lyrics written by Woody Guthrie, was featured in the soundtrack of the Academy Award-winning Best Picture ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Departed"&gt;The Departed&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Papelbon chose the song as his to play when taking the field and became a huge hit with the crowd after performing a Irish step dance to the song after winning the AL East title in the beginning of the month and performing it again after winning both the ALCS and the World Series. Papelbon was joined by fellow pitchers, &lt;a href="w%3AHideki%20Okijima"&gt;Hideki Okijima&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Timlin"&gt;Mike Timlin&lt;/a&gt;.

This may not be the last rolling rally Boston will see this year, currently the Foxborough, Massachusetts based American football team &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Patriots"&gt;New England Patriots&lt;/a&gt; are currently undefeated in the NFL and appear at this time to be headed to another Super Bowl and possibly to becoming the second NFL team in the league's history to go undefeated an entire season. The other team that went undefeated was the 1972 &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Dolphins"&gt;Miami Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; team. 

In college football, the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20College%20Eagles"&gt;Boston College Eagles&lt;/a&gt; are also undefeated and are currently ranked number two in the NCAA. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Celtics"&gt;Boston Celtics&lt;/a&gt; who seemed to have lost another chance after drawing 5th in the NBA draft lottery are currently doing very well with their two new stars, &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Allen"&gt;Ray Allen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Garnett"&gt;Kevin Garnett&lt;/a&gt; both acquired in trades. Even the lowly Major League Soccer team, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Revolution"&gt;New England Revolution&lt;/a&gt; are in the running for the MLS Cup this year. The year also seems to be going good for the &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20Bruins"&gt;Boston Bruins&lt;/a&gt; so far. However, the Bruins' center, &lt;a href="w%3APatrice%20Bergeron"&gt;Patrice Bergeron&lt;/a&gt; suffered a serve concussion after being checked and sent into the boards, Bergeron had to miss a dinner in honor of him due to the concussion.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAudiencia%20Nacional%20of%20Spain"&gt;Audiencia Nacional of Spain&lt;/a&gt; (National Court of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;) has found 21 of 28 defendants guilty in connection with the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Madrid%20train%20bombings"&gt;2004 Madrid train bombings&lt;/a&gt;.

The defendants were facing charges including murder, forgery and conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack. 27 of them are men and one is a woman. 19 are mostly &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Moroccan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt;s and nine Spaniards.

Chief Judge Javier Gomez Bermudez read the verdicts which came after three months of &lt;a href="w%3Adeliberations"&gt;deliberations&lt;/a&gt;.

Jamal Zougam, Otman el Ghanoui and Emilio Trashorras were found guilty of murder. The three were given sentences of 42,924 years in prison, although the most one can serve in Spain is 40 years. As far as the other guilty verdicts, no one was given more than 23 years for their part in the crime.
Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed, aka "Mohamed the Egyptian", was acquitted although he is serving a ten-year sentence in &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; on other &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt; charges. Jose Maria de Pablos, spokesman for a victims' association, said: "We're very surprised by the acquittal. If it wasn't them, we have to find out who it was. Somebody gave the order."

"I'm not a judge or a lawyer but this is shameful, outrageous," said Isabel Presa, who lost her youngest son in one of the explosions. She told journalists of her outrage at what she thought were lenient sentences.

The 2004 Madrid train bombings (also known in Spain as 11-M) consisted of a series of coordinated bombings against the &lt;a href="w%3ACercan%C3%ADas"&gt;Cercanías&lt;/a&gt; (commuter train) system of &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; on the morning of March 11, 2004, killing 191 people and wounding 2,050.

Schools in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; have been told by the city's department of education to not allow any &lt;a href="w%3AHalloween"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt;-related events.

Alexander Gavrilov, press secretary of the education department, told &lt;a href="w%3AInterfax"&gt;♡❤Interfax♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, "The department's stance has remained invariable since 2003, when the leadership of the department sent a letter to Moscow principals, which bans holding Halloween events at their schools."

Gavrilov further said that the ban is because this holiday "includes religious elements, including the cult of death, the mockery of death, personification of death and evil, which contradict the secular nature of state educational institutions." 

"This is destructive for the minds and the spiritual and moral health of pupils," he said. "It's not an attempt to block the celebration of this holiday completely, just in schools and colleges."

It has been reported recently by ♡❤♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADotMusic.com"&gt;DotMusic.com&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that two fans of &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; theatrical &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt; were robbed at gunpoint on Friday in &lt;a href="w%3ALouisville"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the band's manager as well as a bodyguard were shot at. No-one was injured.

Following a gig in Louisville the band had split up, with three of the members going to a nearby bar for a drink. Lead vocalist &lt;a href="w%3ATomi%20Putaansuu"&gt;Mr. Lordi&lt;/a&gt;, his wife, and keyboardist &lt;a href="w%3ALeena%20Peisa"&gt;Awa&lt;/a&gt; had entered the tour bus, while manager Rikk Scholvinck and a bodyguard were escorting two fans towards the bus.

According to those at the scene, a van pulled up next to the bus and several youths emerged, at least one of which was carrying a gun. Mr Lordi describes what happened next: "One of the men with a gun took a fan, a girl, put the gun to her head and forced her to lie down on the ground. Also one of the boys froze on the spot while the others fled away, including Rikk and the bodyguard while another man started shooting at them. Luckily he missed and no one was hurt. Rikk ran to the bar and called the police who arrived soon. In a moment we were surrounded by like five police cars but the guys managed to escape. They were a group of drug addicts that had stolen the car earlier that night, and police were already looking for them but have still not managed to catch them."

"The girl that was held at gunpoint is obviously very shocked. We did our best to comfort and calm her down, but one can only wonder what could happen when people start running around with guns and even using them! It is a bit amusing that the boy fan was just happy he didn't lose the t-shirt he was wearing with all the autographs on it, even if they both lost everything else."

Both the fans were given lifelong all access passes to Lordi concerts worldwide to compensate.

Lordi has had previous altercations with criminals in the US. Earlier this year the bus the band was using for their tour as part of &lt;a href="w%3AOzzfest"&gt;Ozzfest&lt;/a&gt; was hijacked with several of the technical crew on board. During the same tour, two other fans were also robbed. "This was like a deja vú of that, once again we were surrounded by police cars and their flashing lights," Mr Lordi commented.

<h2>Judge delivers verdicts in 2004 Madrid train bombing trial</h2>

The National Court of Spain has found 21 of 28 defendants guilty in connection with the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Chief Judge Javier Gomez Bermudez read the verdicts which came after three months of deliberations.

The defendants were facing charges including murder, forgery and conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack. 27 of them are men and one is a woman. 19 are mostly Moroccan Arabs and nine Spaniards.

The 2004 Madrid train bombings consisted of a series of coordinated bombings against the commuter train system of Madrid, Spain on the morning of March 11, 2004, killing 191 people and wounding 2,050.

<h2>5.6 earthquake strikes California</h2>

According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a magnitude 5.6 earthquake, lasting about 90 seconds, struck at 20:04:54 (PDT), with the epicenter being 5 miles north, northeast of Alum Rock California and 9 miles northeast of the center of San Jose. The actual coordinates given by USGS put it along the border of San Jose and Milpitas in the hills near neighborhoods in both cities. The quake was felt as far away as the California communities of Sacramento, Sonoma, and Los Banos. It was the most powerful quake in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley since 1989.

At least ten aftershocks have been reported by 8:35 p.m with magnitudes ranging from 1.3 to 1.8.

<h2>Canadian government announces major tax reductions</h2>

Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced a five-year program that could reduce taxes by a total C$60 billion.

Some of the planned tax reduction measures include:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Low-end personal income tax rates which would be reduced half a percent to 15%, taking retroactive effect to January 2007;
BULLET::::- Raising the minimum income taxable about a thousand dollars to $9,000 Canadian which is also backdated to January 2007;
BULLET::::- As well as eventual reductions in business tax rates and goods and services tax.

</ul>
These measures will be brought before the House of Commons in Ottawa on Wednesday as a confidence motion. The opposition has expressed an unwillingness to defeat the government on this matter.

<h2>World champion Boston Red Sox hold "rolling rally"; many more could be on the way</h2>

The Boston Red Sox baseball team, back in Boston today, fresh off their sweep of the Colorado Rockies, paraded down from the venerable Fenway Park onto Boylston Street in Boston making their way through the heart of Boston's Back Bay until reaching the Boston Common where they then made their way up Tremont Street to Boston's Government Center where the rally ended at City Hall.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned that &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; rock singer &lt;a href="w%3AMeat%20Loaf"&gt;Meat Loaf&lt;/a&gt; has taken ill during a concert in &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20upon%20Tyne"&gt;Newcastle upon Tyne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. He told the audience that it was "the last concert of his life," and left the stage.

The incident came 70 minutes into the show on &lt;a href="w%3AHalloween"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt; night. During the opening of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AParadise%20by%20the%20Dashboard%20Light"&gt;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ he suggested that the crowd of thousands should enjoy the performance as it was the last of his career. He attempted to sing the first line of the song, but instead said "Ladies and gentlemen, I love you, and I thank you for coming, but I can no longer continue. Good night, God bless you. I love you. Thank you for 30 years. I’m taking my coat off; I bow; and I say goodbye forever." He then left the stage, soon followed by his band.

The venue, &lt;a href="w%3AMetro%20Radio%20Arena"&gt;Metro Radio Arena&lt;/a&gt;, have announced that the singer had a sore throat. However, they also say that fans are unlikely to be refunded the cost of their tickets, priced at between &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;37.50 and £45, because he had performed for over an hour.

<h1>Japan fishermen clash with surfers over 2007 dolphin hunt</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Japan%20fishermen%20clash%20with%20surfers%20over%202007%20dolphin%20hunt&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Japanese fishermen in &lt;a href="w%3ATaiji%2C%20Wakayama"&gt;Taiji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; clashed with surfers from &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. The location where dolphins are &lt;a href="w%3Acull"&gt;culled&lt;/a&gt; was moved to a secluded cove this year to hide the activity from television crews and protesters.

After successfully defending the hunt, by using boat propellers and boat hooks against the group of surfers, who were joined by actress &lt;a href="w%3AHayden%20Panettiere"&gt;Hayden Panettiere&lt;/a&gt;, the fishermen have started their annual cull. 

Whaling in Taiji usually yields 2,000 dolphins per year using the &lt;a href="w%3ADolphin%20drive%20hunting"&gt;dolphin drive hunting&lt;/a&gt; method. The dolphins are diverted from their migration route by banging metal rods. As fear can affect the taste of the meat, after being speared and bludgeoned to death, they are left to hang for a day before being cut up. Television crews and campaigners opposed to the culling were prevented by fishermen and local police from filming these activities.

Although the practice of aquatic mammal hunting is condemned by many groups worldwide as well as within Japan, &lt;a href="w%3AWhaling%20in%20Japan"&gt;whaling&lt;/a&gt; is seen by those involved as a long-practiced cultural tradition that should be defended. As the demand for whale and dolphin meat for use in &lt;a href="w%3ASushi"&gt;sushi&lt;/a&gt; has declined, the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Japan"&gt;Government of Japan&lt;/a&gt; now has to financially subsidize the industry to support the local economy. Japan argues that whaling is still carried out for scientific reasons, to understand species population numbers. This claim is disputed by the scientific community outside of Japan as well as by environmentalists.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWestboro%20Baptist%20Church"&gt;Westboro Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt; has lost a lawsuit and has been ordered by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20district%20court"&gt;United States District Court: District of Maryland&lt;/a&gt; to pay &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollars"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$11 million to the family of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marines"&gt;Marine&lt;/a&gt; Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder, a fallen soldier, who was killed while serving in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

The lawsuit was filed by Snyder's father, Albert, after the church held a protest across the street from the cemetery where funeral services were being held. The church was sued for, "defamation of character, invasion of privacy--intrusion upon seclusion, invasion of privacy--publicity given to private life, intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy," according to court documents obtained by ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has also learned that the church filed a motion for a mistrial on October 29, but was ultimately denied.

The jury ordered that $2.9 million be awarded to the Snyder family for compensatory damages and $8 million in punitive damages, but reports say that the church cannot afford that amount, with their assets worth under $1 million. The defendants plan to appeal the judgment and have expressed confidence they can get it overturned.

&lt;a href="w%3AWashoe%20%28chimpanzee%29"&gt;Washoe&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Achimpanzee"&gt;chimpanzee&lt;/a&gt; that became famous for being taught to use &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Sign%20Language"&gt;American Sign Language&lt;/a&gt; (ASL), has died at the age of 42. Washoe was the first chimpanzee to learn sign language, although whether or not Washoe's and many other great apes' communication is actually language is still a subject of controversy.

In the early 1960s, attempts to teach apes to speak had consistently failed. &lt;a href="w%3AAllen%20Gardner"&gt;Allen Gardner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABeatrix%20Gardner"&gt;Beatrix Gardner&lt;/a&gt; hypothesized that this was due to physical constraints on the vocal apparati of the apes rather than a lack of brain power. To test their hypothesis, in 1966 they took the baby Washoe and began to teach her sign language which turned out to be successful; Washoe learned over 250 symbols from American sign language, and other researchers quickly began to make similar experiments with other chimpanzees and great apes.

However, later work by &lt;a href="w%3AHerbert%20Terrace"&gt;Herbert Terrace&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the behaviour of Washoe and others was, to a large extent, imitating the researchers rather than spontaneous. Furthermore, Washoe and other chimpanzees never learned how to use grammar or how to construct recursions, two things which many linguists point to as unique aspects of &lt;a href="w%3Alanguage"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;. Later attempts to have chimpanzees learn by observation as human infants do have also been successful, but there are still no signs that they have learned grammar. Some linguists such as &lt;a href="w%3ANoam%20Chomsky"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that humans have specialized areas of the brain devoted to processing language and that we are hardwired to do so. Such hypotheses explain why apparently intelligent apes are unable to form language.

This is the second death this year of an animal famous for possibly learning language. In September 2007 &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20%28parrot%29"&gt;Alex the Grey Parrot&lt;/a&gt;, who had learned to speak a variety of words and distinguish colors and shapes, died after a protracted illness.

When Washoe and other apes who had learned ASL interacted with each other, they used ASL to communicate. 

Washoe spent the last few years of her life at &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Washington%20University"&gt;Central Washington University&lt;/a&gt; at the Ellensburg campus.

A memorial service is planned for Washoe for November 12, 2007. Details will be made available from "Friends of Washoe," a non-profit organization.

A &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;737-200&lt;/a&gt; overshot the runway at &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul%20Rachman%20Saleh%20Airport"&gt;Abdul Rachman Saleh Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Java"&gt;East Java&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; after a domestic flight from &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;. Five passengers were injured in the incident, none seriously.

The aircraft's nose landing gear is understood to have separated in the incident, in which the aircraft skidded 260 feet from the end of the runway. Five of the 89 passengers and seven crew on board received cuts and bruises during the emergency evacuation that followed. It was raining heavily at the time, although it is not known if this is considered to have played a factor.

Airport official Suradi described the scene to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ via telephone: "The plane now lies abandoned on the runway ... Its head is slightly tilted down because the front wheel broke off."

The accident is currently under investigation. One potential cause being looked at is the fact that the forward landing gear axle is believed to have snapped upon landing, setting off the chain of events.

The Indonesian aviation industry has been the subject of much criticism this year over safety concerns, sparked by a string of accidents including &lt;a href="Adam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;574&lt;/a&gt;, which crashed into the ocean, killing 102, &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20172"&gt;Adam Air Flight 172&lt;/a&gt;, a nonfatal accident where a plane snapped in half, and &lt;a href="w%3AGaruda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; , which overshot a runway at extreme speed, killing 21. All Indonesian airlines are on the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;list of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;Federal Aviation Administration&lt;/a&gt; has downgraded Indonesia to its lowest safety rating.

Mandala's only fatal accident was the crash of &lt;a href="w%3AMandala%20Airlines%20Flight%20091"&gt;Mandala Airlines Flight 091&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, which killed 112 people.

<h2>Baseball's Dodgers hire Joe Torre</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Torre"&gt;Joe Torre&lt;/a&gt; will be the new manager of the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Dodgers"&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; franchise, according to a team announcement on Thursday. Torre had been manager of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; since 1996.

&lt;a href="w%3AGrady%20Little"&gt;Grady Little&lt;/a&gt; had been the Dodgers manager until Tuesday when he resigned from the team with one year remaining on his three-year contract.

<h2>American screenwriters' strike set for Monday</h2>
Writers for &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; film and television productions are scheduled to walk off the job Monday leaving entertainment programming struggling for scripts. The &lt;a href="w%3AWriters%20Guild%20of%20America"&gt;Writers Guild of America&lt;/a&gt; is demanding that their members receive payments for "new media" distribution of their works such as Internet downloads.

The union's contract expired on Wednesday. Production of many television series and films will continue in the short term because of scripts that are already written. However, a strike will have an immediate impact on talk shows whose writing relies on current events. The last strike by the Writers Guild in 1988 lasted nearly half a year.

"Among men, La-La; among horses, Red Hare" (In Chinese: 馬中赤兔，人中拉拉) was recently elected as the "Best Internet Cool Quote".

Laa-Laa refers to the yellow character from the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATeletubbies"&gt;Teletubbies&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ television series, and &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Hare"&gt;Red Hare&lt;/a&gt; refers to military general Lü Bu's horse during &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s Three Kingdoms period. 

The quote was given its title after a two-week voting period, that started on October 14 until &lt;a href="w%3APepsiCo"&gt;PepsiCo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href="w%3ADoritos"&gt;Doritos&lt;/a&gt; announced "Top 10 Internet Cool Quote" on October 31. Voting was on the ♡❤Doritos Coolpedia♡❤ website, which started on September 28.

Voting attracted more than 10,000 Internet users from 64 countries participating and electing.

Coolpedia is a portal for teens and young adults to share and contribute their creations, and interact.

At the announcement event was the famous Taiwanese band "MACHI Brothers" (MACHI). Described by Pepsico as a symbol of younger people in the presence of the e-Century in Taiwan, MACHI serves as spokespeople for the website. Members of band dressed in different "Cool Quote T-Shirts" to symbolize the "unlimited creation" of Coolpedia.

On November 1, Coolpedia launched a website for a "Cool Video Award" contest, with the slogan "No pictures, no truth!". PepsiCo Taiwan has suggested that the site will be a major Web 2.0 site.

Microsoft Taiwan invited DeltaMac Taiwan (Movie Agency Member of CMC Magnetics Corporation) demonstrating their published and represented movie discs at the Press Conference. According to DeltaMac, those movie discs supported not only 1080p HD scales but also all &lt;a href="w%3AHD-DVD"&gt;HD-DVD&lt;/a&gt; players including Xbox 360 HD-DVD Player without &lt;a href="w%3ADVD"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARegional%20lockout"&gt;region code limitation&lt;/a&gt;.

Just before 5 a.m. on October 31, 2007, a water main broke underground in the middle of downtown &lt;a href="w%3A%20London%2C%20Ontario"&gt;London, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; at the intersection of Wellington and Dundas. As water gushed 5 metres up into the air the pavement slowly eroded over several hours eventually causing a giant sinkhole 9 m wide and 4 m deep; large enough for a city bus to hide in. 

The quickly escaping water eventually flooded the entire basement of the &lt;a href="w%3AGalleria%20Mall"&gt;Galleria Mall&lt;/a&gt; including the underground parking. The flooding affected several major electrical systems and left several downtown businesses over several blocks without power including City Hall, the &lt;a href="w%3AGalleria%20Mall"&gt;Galleria Mall&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href="w%3ATD%20Bank"&gt;TD Bank&lt;/a&gt; Buildings and &lt;a href="w%3ACIBC"&gt;CIBC&lt;/a&gt; until 9 p.m. that night.

Thailand's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Nation%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has praised the project, describing the children as "enthusiastic" and keen to attend school with their laptops.

Recent good news for the project sees Uruguay having ordered 100,000 of the machines which are to be given to children aged six to twelve. Should all go according to plan a further 300,000 machines will be purchased by 2009 to give one to every child in the country. As the first to order, Uruguay chose the OLPC XO laptop over its rival from Intel, the Classmate PC. In parallel with the delivery of the laptops network connectivity will be provided to schools involved in the project.

<h2>India team</h2>

♡❤♡The Mumbai team (OLPC-India)♡❤♡
In setting up the first pilot of the project in India, Carla and the OLPC team worked with Navi Mumbai telecommunications specialists - referred to as the Mumbai Team - who located the school for the XO laptop trial and established a relationship with the staff, students and community of Khairat school. Liaising with a local who sponsors schools in the area, Mr. Iyer, Carla's chronicle states, "it turned out that they struck a gold mine in terms of kindness and pro-activity of the teacher, children, and community."

According to the Khairat Chronicle report the Mumbai team was in two parts, but with little to separate them. A strategic team, working for OLPC-India in general and getting the project off the ground, started up in July, with the team's Mr. Joshi visiting the village with Carla's group on a number of times. He attended parent's meetings and acted as an advocate for the OLPC project, stressing villagers' involvement and explaining the role of Carla's team.

Amit joined the team in September, bringing a technical background on the &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; operating system. He was introduced to the educational aspects of the project and assisted greatly with the technical aspects and community-building efforts.

On the whole, the Mumbai team were based in Navi Mumbai.

♡❤♡The OLPC team♡❤♡

In India from Late September, Carla was working on the educational side of the project, helping out as needed on technical issues and relations with the community. Carla was joined by Arjun and Manu early in October, working with Amit from the Mumbai team setting up the network infrastructure and testing it. Work on Marathi fonts was also carried out with Amit. After a little over two weeks during which the children were given their XO laptops and introduced to them the OLPC team left, providing long-distance support to the Mumbai Team and the Khairat community.

<h2>Khairat</h2>

&lt;a href="w%3AKhairat"&gt;Khairat&lt;/a&gt; is a small village with around 200 people, placed near &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMaharashtra"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt; state. Carla described houses in the villages as "spacious and minimalist in their furniture." A section of each of the 20 or so house is set aside for cattle, only an outside door is present on each house, and cooking is done with a wood-fired stove. In most cases a partial second roof or attic is where people will sleep.
<h3>The town school</h3>

Children go to school 5 days in week, from Monday to Friday, from 10.30 AM to 5.30 PM and they attend also on Saturdays from 8.30 AM to 10.00 AM. The students are from 5 to 10 years old.

Khairat school (Vastishala Khairat-Dhangarvada) is a one-room schoolhouse, it is years old. The land to build it was donated by a villager. Carla was told that she used to go and help the construction workers with the building of the school. She also came to help organize the digging of the hole for grounding the server. The building itself was sponsored by a villager who has a lot of land in the area. He also supports, on a continual basis, with other items the school needs.

The schoolhouse has three cabinets. The one with glass panes is where the children keep their textbooks, and it also contains reading books that children can grab to read. On the top shelf, there is a statue of &lt;a href="w%3AGanesha"&gt;Ganesha&lt;/a&gt;, to whom children bring some fresh flowers. In one corner is the water bucket, glasses, and dishes. On the other, is the raw rice bucket and the server cardboard box that sometimes is a desktop for the teacher and other times a table to drink milky, sugary Indian tea. This arrangement is recent though, because he volunteered his desk for setting up the server.

A broad black strip is painted horizontally across all the walls, on which varied learning stuff is colorfully sketched with colored chalk, such as the &lt;a href="w%3AMarathi%20language"&gt;Marathi&lt;/a&gt; and English alphabets, the water cycle, &lt;a href="w%3AMahatma%20Gandhi"&gt;Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;'s face, the numbers in Marathi. Hanging from the ceiling, there's a fan and a few light-bulbs, which are rarely used because the sunlight that comes in through the door and the three grated windows is enough.

<h2>The workplace</h2>
The first girl to arrive to school early in the morning sweeps the floor. The second girl to arrive helps her remove things from the corners. Other children help by taking out and placing at the entrance two small palm trees they keep inside when the school is closed. The older girls go to the village well for water to refill the water bucket and have water to drink during the day. They also count the rations of rice to be cooked for lunch and take it to the person who will cook it. Three rows are made with mats on the floor. The floor is the seat where the students sit, the surface on which they write, the boundless space they can use to adopt any position they find comfortable as well as to work in pairs or groups, and a classmate&amp;mdash;or the teacher&amp;mdash;can come and sit next to anyone to help.

The school is multilevel. Children from first to fourth standard take classes in the same classroom with the same teacher. Sometimes they all listen to the same explanation or work on the same assignment, but the teacher usually assigns different tasks to each level, and when the younger ones get stuck and he is busy working with other students, children from third and fourth standard help the first and second standard ones. They learn so much by always being in touch with the 'basics' and previously learned facts, knowledge, or skills, and by teaching others, they reinforce their knowledge. With the XO, they help each other by explaining or by pointing a finger at the screen or keyboard or by checking the work done. And it's not necessarily the older ones who help the younger, nor age or grade level what determines how they group together. You can also see children by themselves, focused on their work, oblivious to what is going on around them, even to what the teacher is saying or doing&amp;mdash;and in this case it is perfectly alright to not pay attention to the teacher.

Although the teacher conducts the activities and is the leader and most knowledgeable one in the room, there reigns an atmosphere of independent work and independent grouping and consultations. The smaller ones are natural scouts and keep on exploring the laptops on their own, and when they find something interesting or need some help, they go to others to show them their findings or be helped out.

<h2>Marathi</h2>

The people in the village speak Marathi. The teacher speaks some English too. The children and the villagers talk to me in Marathi. Carla keep the communication channel open by smiling, which is easy and effective. Amit helps a lot by translating. 

<h2>The teacher</h2>

<h2>Older children, teenagers, and villagers</h2>

<h2>The students</h2>

 

<h2>Teacher session</h2>

The plan was to just work with the teacher. However, as soon as he got his students back in school, the teacher started working with them and teaching them how to write their names in English and how to do several other things on the laptops.

The work with the teacher was on how to best use laptops as a tool to “learn learning” by expressing, constructing, designing, modeling, imagining, creating, critiquing, debugging, collaborating with the children, carrying out hands-on activities and project based work, retrieving specific data from the Internet, and publishing content and collaborative production of content on &lt;a href="w%3Awiki"&gt;Wiki pages&lt;/a&gt; shared on the Internet.

Because one of the &lt;a href="w%3AThird%20World"&gt;Third World&lt;/a&gt;'s main problems is education, a ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter has asked Carla about this question:
♡❤♡♡❤♡: What do you think about education system in India?

♡❤♡P♡❤♡: Zana Brisks "Born into Brothels" film show that children have problem with their education, cause their mothers are prostitutes, but they take photos and they want to be photographers. Do you think that collaboration between OLPC, Kids with Cameras (children from Zana Briks documentary) and Wikimedia Foundation (I think about Wikimedia Commons) is possible?

♡❤♡P♡❤♡: Media don't want write about 3rd World's problems (too often). How can we change this situation? Is it possible?

<h2>Parents' meetings</h2>
Oct 3. Mr. Joshi came to Khairat school and organized a small impromptu parents' meeting. Few parents came because of such short notice. Basically, the idea was to explain the project to them and to invite them to take part in the learning of their children. The teacher explained the potential of the XOs in class and of all the relevant stuff that was now at their children's fingertips for them to learn or do, to which they had no opportunity before.

The &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Carolina%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; denied &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Colbert"&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a place on the primary ballot Thursday. “The council really agonized over this because they really like him, they love his show, and everyone thinks it’s wonderful that he cares about us,” said Carol Fowler, the chairwoman of the state’s Democratic Party. The council voted 13-3 to reject Colbert's application. According to their statement, Colbert did not meet two basic requirements: that he be a viable national candidate; and that he actively campaign for the state’s primary.

"It's a distraction," said Waring Howe Jr., one of the executive council member who voted against Colbert, "and takes away from the seriousness of our primary here and takes attention from the serious candidates: &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="John%20Edwards"&gt;Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and the rest."

Colbert's Thursday night program centered around his campaign in South Carolina until a Democratic official called mid-show with the news of the council's rejection. "It's your loss Democrats," Colbert said. "I had a lot of good ideas."

Colbert had originally announced his intention to run as both a Republican and Democrat, but only filed for the Democratic. The Republican primary ballot application cost was $35,000, versus $2,500 for the Democratic application. Fowler stated the council will return Colbert's check.

Following the launch of the ♡❤Doritos Coolpedia♡❤ website on September 28, and voting on October 14, this website has now become a complex portal with textures, pictures, and multimedia after adding video candidate function. As Coolpedia originally followed Wikipedia's example of Internet-relay contribution, Wikinews Reporter interviewed Claire Lin (Assistant Media Manager of Marketing Department, Pepsico Foods Taiwan) about the origins and objectives of Coolpedia.
<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡Brock♡❤♡: With witnessing the rise of Coolpedia, I wonder to know the origins of founding Coolpedia.

♡❤♡Claire♡❤♡: With a variety changes of some Internet language and phrases for younger people on the Internet newsgroups, BBS sites, discussion forums in Taiwan, Pepsico Taiwan decided to found ♡❤Coolpedia♡❤ website to gather some good quotes with their (younger people) creations named as "Internet Citizens". This foundation is matched as Doritos' brand symbol - Bold &amp; Creation, and ♡❤Coolpedia♡❤ made a impact with a great challenge in Taiwan's Internet culture.

♡❤♡Brock♡❤♡: With visiting this website and referred some backgrounds provided by Ogilvy Public Relations Taiwan, I found an interesting idea on the pursuit of "followed Wikipedia's example". Coincidently, Wikimania 2007, held on August in Taiwan earlier, encouraged Internet users' contributions with knowledge for a "Knowledge Without Borders" pursuit not only the conference but also the showcase. What do operation team of Coolpedia think about this?

♡❤♡Claire♡❤♡: Every Internet user knows "Wikipedia is the total of knowledge", but we (the team) think Coolpedia as the combination of "Internet culture" and "younger people" in Taiwan. Based on the multiple creation, we launched this site firstly with texture and picture contribution functions, next will join multimedia and video functions. I believe that Coolpedia and Wikipedia effected Internet culture in Taiwan deeply.

♡❤♡Brock♡❤♡: What's about the internationalization with several Chinese People from many countries world-wide?

♡❤♡Claire♡❤♡: Doritos is a notable world-class international brand by Pepsico. Many branches from Pepsico has their own ideas with their country culture, therefore, we won't promote the inter-language version of Taiwan's Coolpedia.

♡❤♡Brock♡❤♡: I've ever participated lots of press conferences and seminars such as YouTube, Microsoft, and some companies from IT industry in Taiwan. Those above mentioned on some issues of media reusing, copyright, and practices in society in Taiwan. Especially in some cases, some companies was sensitive on the computing crimes, pirate and illegal copy issues because those above were discussed by some people from governmental and security industries in Taiwan. And also, some Internet users may spread their own files created by the others so that the common practice will turn from bad to worse. With those issues, what should Pepsico regulate participants from Coolpedia?

♡❤♡Claire♡❤♡: We've regulated policies for participants. Of course, copyright violation will disadvantage Taiwan's Common Practice. If some participated works violated common practice, we'll decline those participations. Even though Coolpedia is similar as &lt;a href="w%3AKuso"&gt;Kuso&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a conjunction with Internet creation phrases and younger people.

<h1>American diplomats unwilling to go to Iraq may be forced, says State Department</h1>

Almost 50 positions at the &lt;a href="w%3AEmbassy%20of%20the%20United%20States%20in%20Baghdad"&gt;American embassy in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; remain unfilled with no volunteers, and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; has recently told diplomats that if they go unfilled then they will begin forced assignments. "We must go forward with the identification of officers to serve should it prove necessary to direct assignments," said Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. "Should others step forward, as some already have, we will fill these new jobs as we have before —with volunteers. However, regardless of how the jobs may be filled, they must be filled." 

Since the 48 vacant &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; posts were announced last Friday, only 15 diplomats have volunteered to work there. Diplomatic assignments are almost always filled by volunteers.

At a State Department "town hall" meeting, Jack Crotty, a 36-year State Department veteran, pointed out the main issue: It's a "potential death sentence".

"It's one thing if someone believes in what's going on over there and volunteers," said Crotty, "but it's another thing to send someone over there on a forced assignment." 

But U.S. Ambassador to Iraq 's response to such fears was unequivocal: "It's for us to go and serve, not to debate the policy, not to agree with it." 

Mark Bellamy, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who is now at the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Strategic%20and%20International%20Studies"&gt;Center for Strategic and International Studies&lt;/a&gt;, also questioned the entire diplomatic mission. "How do you do diplomacy and development work in an environment as violent as this?" asked Bellamy. The &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Zone"&gt;Green Zone&lt;/a&gt; can be a demoralizing place for a diplomat to work. Aside from the physical risk, the violence that surrounds daily life in Baghdad creates an isolated atmosphere and a sense of futility. The idea of traveling outside the fortified zone is outlandish and only under heavy guard (the &lt;a href="w%3ABlackwater%20Worldwide"&gt;Blackwater&lt;/a&gt; guards accused by the Iraqi government of attacking Iraqi civilians were guarding diplomats). 

The only association the diplomats have with civilian Iraqis is with those who work at the embassy. Even those Iraq nationals fear for their lives as they are targeted as "collaborators."

A 42-year-old man and a woman in her thirties have been arrested after a police officer was left critically injured after being hit by a car as she tried to make an arrest in west &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; this morning. 

Police are treating the incident as attempted &lt;a href="w%3Amurder"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt;.

Detective Constable Catherine Corbett of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Midlands%20Police"&gt;West Midlands Police&lt;/a&gt; was trying to arrest a man at Sheraton Hotel, near &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt; when the suspect escaped by car and left the officer with head injuries. She was in London as part of a fraud investigation. 

The man was arrested by firearms officers in &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; and will be taken to London for questioning. The woman has been held after she contacted the police.

Speaking about Corbett, Assistant Chief Constable Gareth Cann said, "Cathy is an experienced police officer and a very good police officer."

Police have appealed for anyone with any information to contact the Metropolitan Police Incident Room on 020 8358 0400 or &lt;a href="w%3ACrimestoppers"&gt;Crimestoppers&lt;/a&gt; anonymously on 0800 555 111.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIgor%20Moiseyev"&gt;Igor Moiseyev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who has been widely acclaimed as the greatest 20th-century choreographer of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afolk%20dance"&gt;folk dance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has died today after a long illness. He was 101 years old.

Born Igor Alexandrovich Moiseyev on January 21, 1906 in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKiev"&gt;Kiev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Moiseyev graduated from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABolshoi%20Theatre%20ballet"&gt;Bolshoi Theatre ballet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; school in 1924 and danced in the theatre until 1939. His first choreography in the Bolshoi was Footballer in 1930 and the last was &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpartacus"&gt;Spartacus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1954.

Since the early 1930s, he staged acrobatic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aparades"&gt;parades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Square"&gt;Red Square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and finally came up with the idea of establishing the Theatre of Folk Art. In 1936, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVyacheslav%20Molotov"&gt;Vyacheslav Molotov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; put him in charge of the new dance company, which has since been known as the Moiseyev Ballet. Among about 200 dances he created for his company, some humorously represented the game of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afootball"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aguerrilla%20warfare"&gt;guerrilla warfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . After visiting &lt;a href="Belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt; he choreographed a Belarusian "folk" dance &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABulba"&gt;Bulba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ("Potato"), which over the years indeed became a Belarusian folk dance. According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEncyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Moiseyev's work has been especially admired "for the balance that it maintained between authentic folk dance and theatrical effectiveness".

Moiseyev was named &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Artist%20of%20the%20USSR"&gt;People's Artist of the USSR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1953, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHero%20of%20Socialist%20Labor"&gt;Hero of Socialist Labor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1976, received the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALenin%20Prize"&gt;Lenin Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1967, for the dance show A Road to the Dance), four &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSSR%20State%20Prizes"&gt;USSR State Prizes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1942, 1947, 1952, 1985), Russian Federation State Prize (1996), was awarded numerous orders and medals of the Soviet Union, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, and many other countries. On the day of his centenary, Moiseyev became the first &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n to receive Order for the Merits before the Fatherland, 1st class — the highest civilian decoration of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Federation"&gt;Russian Federation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Researchers at &lt;a href="w%3ACase%20Western%20University"&gt;Case Western University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; have announced the creation of &lt;a href="w%3Atransgenic"&gt;transgenic&lt;/a&gt; mice with substantially improved athletic endurance, which live and breed longer and are more aggressive than genetically unmodified siblings, and are leaner despite consuming 60% more food. The mice have been dubbed "mighty mice" or "supermice" by the popular press and have been compared to cyclist &lt;a href="w%3ALance%20Armstrong"&gt;Lance Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;.

The changes were created by adding an extra copy of a single gene, &lt;a href="w%3APEPCK"&gt;PEPCK-C&lt;/a&gt;. This gene is already present in the mouse genome, but the modified gene is designed to be strongly active ♡❤(&lt;a href="w%3Atranscription%20%28genetics%29"&gt;transcribed&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤ in &lt;a href="w%3Askeletal%20muscle"&gt;skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;. (The natural copy of the gene, most active in the &lt;a href="w%3Aliver"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt;, continues to function normally). The gene mediates a crucial rate controlling step of &lt;a href="w%3Agluconeogenesis"&gt;gluconeogenesis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aglyceroneogenesis"&gt;glyceroneogenesis&lt;/a&gt;, and its activity helps to allow energy production by the &lt;a href="w%3Amitochondria"&gt;mitochondrial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acitric%20acid%20cycle"&gt;citric acid cycle&lt;/a&gt;. In the transgenics, more energy is available to muscle through the burning of &lt;a href="w%3Afatty%20acid"&gt;fatty acid&lt;/a&gt;s, with much less production of &lt;a href="w%3Alactate"&gt;lactate&lt;/a&gt; (a chemical that leads to sore muscles when one exercises). This is not as major a change to the mouse genome as it might seem to the layperson. The PEPCK-C gene is already present in the mouse and a variety of natural mutations could likely cause similar results. The study appears today in the ♡❤Journal of Biological Chemistry♡❤ in a paper with lead author Parvin Hakimi from the laboratory of Richard W. Hanson.

The altered mice can run at 20 meters per minute (0.75 miles per hour or 1.2 kilometers per hour) for up to six kilometers (nearly four miles) without stopping. The average treadmill time for strenuous exercise on a 25-degree incline is 31.9 minutes, well in excess of the 19 minute average of unmodified mice. Females can breed at two and a half years of age, whereas most female mice cannot breed after the first year. 

A colony of 500 mice has been bred, starting from six independent &lt;a href="w%3Agermline%20transformation"&gt;germline transformation&lt;/a&gt;s ("founder" mice). The level of PEPCK-C in muscle is 9 units per gram of muscle as opposed to only 0.08 in normal mice. Levels of triglycerides and the number of mitochondria are also increased.

Hanson said that he did not expect that the results would be applicable to humans due to both practical and ethical considerations in addition to the fact that the genes might not function the same way in humans. 

This is not the first time that the press has dubbed a genetically modified mouse a "mighty mouse". Earlier scientists at &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hopkins%20University"&gt;John Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt; announced that they had made mice with massively increased muscle mass that were larger and stronger than their normal cousins. These alterations increased strength rather than endurance through the genetic modification of &lt;a href="w%3Amyostatin"&gt;myostatin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Afollistatin"&gt;follistatin&lt;/a&gt;, or by injection of a soluble form of &lt;a href="w%3AACVR2B"&gt;ACVR2B&lt;/a&gt; to block myostatin activity in normal mice.

The &lt;a href="w%3APalo%20Verde%20Nuclear%20Generating%20Station"&gt;Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; is currently locked down while security teams are doing a sweep of the area after a pipe bomb was found this morning.

Arizona Public Service Company (APS) spokesman Jim MacDonald said a contract worker was stopped at the main gate of the facility for a routine security sweep and a suspicious looking device was reportedly found in the bed of the worker's pickup truck. APS owns the station, which is located in Wintersberg, Arizona. 

According to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO), the suspicious looking device was a pipe bomb.

"MCSO bomb squad tests later determined that the capped pipe was a credible explosive device," said APS in a written statement.

The worker was taken into custody, and the entrance to the plant was immediately closed. The suspect, only described as a white male, lives in a Phoenix apartment complex, is reportedly an engineer who works with computers, and is cooperating with police. 

Three schools in the Saddle Mountain Unified School District were locked down voluntarily, affecting about 1,500 students.

According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;'s operations center was monitoring the incident.

MacDonald said the plant nor the public are at risk, "We have a large and well-trained security force that followed the procedures exactly the way they're supposed to." The incident, which was classified as an "unusual event" -- the lowest emergency classification, is not believed to be terrorist related.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Department are investigating.

The Palo Verde plant is about 35 miles west of Phoenix and is the largest nuclear electric generating site in the country, producing as much electricity as nine &lt;a href="w%3AHoover%20Dam"&gt;Hoover Dams&lt;/a&gt;.

Solo &lt;a href="America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ashock%20rock"&gt;shock rock&lt;/a&gt; artist &lt;a href="w%3AAlice%20Cooper"&gt;Alice Cooper&lt;/a&gt; has commented that ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Osbournes"&gt;The Osbournes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a reality TV show starring &lt;a href="w%3Aheavy%20metal"&gt;heavy metal&lt;/a&gt; vocalist &lt;a href="w%3AOzzy%20Osbourne"&gt;Ozzy Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;, ruined the career of the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sabbath"&gt;Black Sabbath&lt;/a&gt; frontman.

Cooper said he felt that by allowing daily life in his house to be broadcast to the world, he destroyed the mystery that had previously surrounded him.

"Most fans thought he lived in a big, dark castle with skeletons in the cellar." said Cooper.

"When that show aired they knew he was just some guy who potters around his Beverly Hills mansion. 

"It was meant to be some kind of comedy but the audience was laughing at Ozzy, not with him. And as a close friend, that made me very sad." 

Meanwhile, both artists have related news this week. &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; solo &lt;a href="w%3Asymphonic%20power%20metal"&gt;symphonic power metal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asoprano"&gt;soprano&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATarja%20Turunen"&gt;Tarja Turunen&lt;/a&gt;, most famous as the former &lt;a href="Nightwish"&gt;Nightwish&lt;/a&gt; frontwoman, has released a 30-second preview of her cover version of Alice Cooper's top ten hit ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APoison%20%28Alice%20Cooper%20song%29"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which will feature on her upcoming album ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMy%20Winter%20Storm"&gt;My Winter Storm&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Cooper himself has stated that during an upcoming tour he will replicate a mock hanging for the first time after a near-fatal accident performing the same stunt in 1988, only this time he will also be wearing a &lt;a href="w%3Astraightjacket"&gt;straightjacket&lt;/a&gt;.

Meanwhile, Ozzy has blamed illegal music downloads for poor sales of his latest album ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Rain%20%28Ozzy%20Osbourne%20album%29"&gt;Black Rain&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, saying that the low sales have forced him into a 90-gig world tour that he has admitted he can barely cope with.

On Halloween night, October 31, during a 2-hour long live episode of NBC show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APhenomenon%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, famed &lt;a href="w%3Amagician"&gt;magician&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACriss%20Angel"&gt;Criss Angel&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AUri%20Geller"&gt;Uri Geller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Callahan%20%28magician%29"&gt;Jim Callahan&lt;/a&gt;, "I will give you a million dollars of my personal money right now if either one of you can tell me specific details of what’s in [this envelope] right now." While Geller ignored Angel's challenge, Callahan started to confront Angel in a hostile manner, as host &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Vincent"&gt;Tim Vincent&lt;/a&gt; held him back and Geller held Angel back.

Previously Angel made it clear that he will not "tolerate" fellow magicians who try to pass their illusions off as &lt;a href="w%3Aparanormal"&gt;paranormal&lt;/a&gt;. For example, on the day before the Halloween special, Angel told &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20King"&gt;Larry King&lt;/a&gt;, "No one has the ability, that I'm aware of, to do anything supernatural, psychic, talk to the dead. And that was what I said I was going to do with ♡❤Phenomenon.♡❤ If somebody goes on that show and claims to have supernatural psychic ability, I'm going to bust them live and on television."

In the midst of the confrontation, the TV show cut to a commercial break. Vincent said the show was not "&lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Springer"&gt;Jerry Springer&lt;/a&gt;." When the last contestant appeared Angel said it was "a hell of a lot more entertaining than the previous act." The following week Callahan was voted off the show by the TV audience.

&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Randi"&gt;James Randi&lt;/a&gt;, a former magician who had previously worked with Angel and a long standing critic of Geller and psychics, wrote of the incident, "Criss Angel said, in his rather lengthy comments, '[Callahan] demonstrated something that is unexplainable to some' — though to whom that might have applied, I cannot fathom — and Criss is beginning to sound very much like that chap James Randi, tossing about a &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Randi%20Educational%20Foundation"&gt;million-dollar challenge&lt;/a&gt;."

This is not the first time that Uri Geller has been challenged by a professional magician. Thirty years ago, during a French television show called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Afr%3ADroit%20de%20r%C3%A9ponse%20%28%C3%A9mission%20de%20t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision%29"&gt;Droit de réponse&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3Afr%3AGerard%20Majax"&gt;Gerard Majax&lt;/a&gt; demonstred that all "so called" powers shown previously during the show by Geller could be reproduced by a magician even more convincingly than Geller.

Floods have affected over a million people in the &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; State of &lt;a href="w%3ATabasco"&gt;Tabasco&lt;/a&gt;, mainly in the capital of the state, &lt;a href="w%3AVillahermosa"&gt;Villahermosa&lt;/a&gt;. This has escalated in the last days into becoming the state's worst catastrophe in its history.

Eighty percent of the state's territory is underwater due to the Grijalva river flooding and heavy rains, which are expected to continue over the next few days.

Mexican president &lt;a href="Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n"&gt;Felipe Calderón&lt;/a&gt; defined the situation as critical and urged all Mexicans to give their support.

Helicopters and boats are being used to move people from rooftops and hospital patients are being flown to neighbouring states.

Industry has also been affected as mentioned by Tabasco governor Andres Granier, who said that 100% of the tabasco pepper crops had been lost.

He also compared the damage caused by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt; two years ago, saying that &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; was "small compared to this".

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n federal &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;member&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ACalare"&gt;Calare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Andren"&gt;Peter Andren&lt;/a&gt; died on Saturday after a short battle with &lt;a href="w%3APancreas"&gt;pancreatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. He was aged 61.

Mr Andren who had held the seat since being elected in 1996 had previously announced his intention to run for the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20of%20Australia"&gt;senate&lt;/a&gt; after his electorate was changed for the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;2007 federal election&lt;/a&gt;. After Mr Andren was diagnosed with cancer in July, he announced that he would be retiring from politics at the election.

Mr Andren's 1996 campaign platform was based upon retaining services in regional Australia, particularly banking, health and telecommunications. Over the next 11 years, Mr Andren's primary vote grew and at the 2001 and 2004 elections was elected without preferences, achieving a majority primary vote.

In 2001, Mr Andren disagreed with his electorate on refugees. The electorate supported the government's tough stance but Mr Andren could not support the government's border protection measures. Following this, a vicious letter-box campaign rose up saying "you might like Peter Andren ... but you won't like what he's got to say about keeping our borders safe".

Fellow &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;NSW&lt;/a&gt; independent member, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Windsor"&gt;Tony Windsor&lt;/a&gt; said Mr Andren's stance on asylum seekers was just one sign of his compassion and strong belief in human rights.

Mr Windsor described Mr Andren as the "conscience" of parliament. "Peter Andren was a true representative of the people of the Calare electorate, a man of the highest integrity and the conscience of the Parliament," he said.

"He was subjected to vitriol from time to time within the Parliament over issues, but if he believed in something he stuck to it. He didn't compromise and I think that's a lasting legacy that Peter will leave."

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said despite having a difference of opinion with Mr Andren on many issues, he had a lot of respect for him.

"I respected his skills as a local member," he said.

"Mr Andren and I frequently disagreed on major issues and he made no bones about that and I made no bones about it either but that didn't stop me respecting him and acknowledging the tremendous work he did for his electorate."

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; described Mr Andren as a true independent.

"Peter Andren will be a great loss to the Australian parliament," he said.

"He was a man of principle, a man of commitment, a man who was an absolute independent."

Leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; said Mr Andren was an example of how a politician should be.

"He was an exemplar of representative politics for his electorate and the people of Calare kept returning him with a bigger and bigger majority," he said.

"[If] anybody ever asks me how a politician should be, I am going to say, 'Look at the record of Peter Andren'"

"He was a great Australian representative and he is a great loss to this country."

During his political career, Mr Andren fought the sale of &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra"&gt;Telstra&lt;/a&gt;, introduced a bill to allow MPs to opt-out of their generous superannuation schemes, opposed the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt; and campaigned on environmental issues.

Mr Andren was born at &lt;a href="w%3AGulargambone%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Gulargambone&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href="w%3ADubbo%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Dubbo&lt;/a&gt; in Western NSW in 1946. Before he entered politics Mr Andren worked as a teacher before moving into journalism. Mr Andren worked as a news producer in Sydney for the Seven and Nine networks, before moving back to regional NSW where he worked as the news editor for both Radio 2GZ and Prime Television.

Mr Andren is survived by his partner and two sons.

&lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s Leader of the Opposition has promised a special home buyers' bank account with tax concessions if &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; is elected on November 24.

Mr Rudd says AU$64,000 could be saved by a couple on the average wage over five years. The plan would cost the Government $600 million dollars.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHousing%20Industry%20Association"&gt;Housing Industry Association&lt;/a&gt; has welcomed the announcement but says it would be a start and would "avoid a stampede of first home buyers into the market."

Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; is bracing himself for a possible Wednesday interest rate rise which may decide the election. Howard has defended the rumours, saying that some rise would be 'unavoidable'.

The torch line of the 11-day "Taiwan Run For UN" relay returned to Ketagalan Boulevard in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20City"&gt;Taipei City&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. Taiwan’s president, Chen Shui-bian, launched the event as publicity and support for Taiwan's application to join the United Nations as a new member under the name of "Taiwan", alongside China. In a statement prior to the relay, Chen declared that "Taiwan and China are different countries across the Taiwan Strait."

The relay covered more than 1,200 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt; through 25 cities and counties since its start on October 24. The organizer of the event, the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; (DPP) held night-time parties in the cities of &lt;a href="w%3AYilan%20County"&gt;Ilan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHualien"&gt;Hualien&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATaitung%20County"&gt;Taitung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APingtung%20County"&gt;Pingtung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKaohsiung%20City"&gt;Kaohsiung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATainan%20County"&gt;Tainan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYunlin"&gt;Yunlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATaichung%20City"&gt;Taichung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMiaoli"&gt;Miaoli&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AHsinchu%20County"&gt;Hsinchu&lt;/a&gt; as the relay progressed, and finally in Taipei City to welcome the torch relay team.

&lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Shui-bian Chen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAnnette%20Lu"&gt;Annette Lu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Hsieh"&gt;Frank Hsieh&lt;/a&gt; (Taiwan's 2008 presidential candidate), and &lt;a href="w%3ASu%20Tseng-chang"&gt;Cheng-chang Su&lt;/a&gt; wore "UN for Taiwan" T-Shirts to the &lt;a href="w%3AKetagalan%20Boulevard"&gt;Ketagalan Boulevard&lt;/a&gt; rally, lit a flame and led people in a formation of "VT" (abbreviation for Victory Taiwan) line.

The rally was met with protesters from the &lt;a href="w%3AMillion%20Voices%20against%20Corruption%2C%20President%20Chen%20Must%20Go"&gt;Red Shirts&lt;/a&gt;, which complain of corruption in the Chen government. In addition, the China Unification Promotion Party attempted several aggressive actions but ultimately carried out a peaceful protest. Protesters had demonstrated previously, on October 24 at the start of the relay.

Even though the premier of Taiwan, Frank Hsieh insisted on the use of products made in Taiwan during the celebration party in Taipei, mini torch lights held by supporters were "Made in China" and featured the "MIC" mark, according to &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Television"&gt;Eastern Television&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. These were eventually removed by the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Progressive%20Party"&gt;Democratic Progressive Party&lt;/a&gt; (DPP). The use of Made in China products was criticized by DPP legislator Kuo-ching Lin after the television reports. 

The party ended with a queue of "VT" lines and a historical collection of two million signatures of support. The issue of Taiwan's application to the UN may become a variable in the upcoming &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Taiwan Presidential Election&lt;/a&gt;.

Taipei City Government, the main organizer of 2007 ING Taipei Marathon, invited running experts, ING Running Club delegates, athletes of 2009 Summer Deaflympics, and blind-visual runners (approximately 18 runners) split up into 3 teams (ING Antai Running Team, Taiwan Marathon Scud Team, Taipei City Government Runners Team) for charity funds to Taiwan Foundation For Rare Disorders, Chinese Taipei Blind-Visual Road Running Association, and Foundation of 21st Summer Deaflympics Organizing Committee in this 6-people relay competition. Finally, ING Antai Running Team won this competition.

After the charity race to benefit charity organizations and media in &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, ING Antai held "a lap within one minute" special challenge for the Basketball Team of Taipei Municipal &lt;a href="w%3ASongshan"&gt;Songshan&lt;/a&gt; Senior High School. With their excellent performance, the team succeeded in meeting this challenge.

At the end of the event, ING Antai invited 24 &lt;a href="w%3Aelementary%20school"&gt;elementary school&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei%20City"&gt;Taipei City&lt;/a&gt; to the "Kids' Running Championship". Before this event, some participants even won good places at Hualien, Kaohsiung, and Taichung warming-up running matches. Due to the actual strength of participants were too close, the organizer decided to split 4 sections by a group draw. Finally, Dong-hu Elementary School won the champion and qualified the main competition.

According to ING Antai, the sum of Charity Fund of ING Taipei Matathon was multiplied between numbers of finished runners and total running mileage with different groups and added from donations at this event. By the way, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei City Government (TCG) Yong-jen Chen talk to Wikinews Reporter and remarked: "The traffic quality of ING Taipei Marathon will be progressively accepted after the criticism by foreigners at 2004 &amp; 2005. With several coordination between supervisors, organizers, and sponsors, we (TCG) promised participants and runners for a great traffic condition at 2007 ING Taipei Marathon."

A &lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20Magnitude%20Scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 5.8 &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; has struck in a place where earthquakes are rare, but sometimes large.

According to the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS), at 3:35 p.m (&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20time%20Zone"&gt;eastern time&lt;/a&gt;) the 5.8 quake struck in &lt;a href="w%3AAntarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, 105 kilometers (65 miles) south, southeast of &lt;a href="w%3ACasey%20Station"&gt;Casey Station&lt;/a&gt; or 2565 kilometers (1590 miles) north of the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20pole"&gt;South Pole&lt;/a&gt;. The quake was reported at a depth of 7.5 k.m. (4.7 miles), but the USGS says it was "poorly constrained."

Had any civilization existed on the frozen ice cap, the USGS says that damage could be "light to moderate."

Antarctica's biggest earthquake was a magnitude 8.1 which occurred on March 25, 1998 near the &lt;a href="w%3ABalleny%20Islands"&gt;Balleny Islands&lt;/a&gt; of Antarctica.

One case took place in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJordan%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, when children made allegations of manufacturing child pornography, ritualistic &lt;a href="animal%20sacrifice"&gt;animal sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acoprophagia"&gt;coprophagia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aurophagia"&gt;urophagia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainfanticide"&gt;infanticide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , at which point the &lt;a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; was alerted. Twenty-four adults were arrested and charged with acts of sexual abuse, child pornography and other crimes related to satanic ritual abuse; only three went to trial with two acquittals and one conviction. &lt;a href="US%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Antonin%20Scalia"&gt;Justice Scalia&lt;/a&gt; noted in a discussion of the case, "[t]here is no doubt that some sexual abuse took place in Jordan; but there is no reason to believe it was as widespread as charged," and cited the repeated, coercive techniques used by the investigators as damaging to the investigation.

One of the most visible Satanic organizations—though one that was never a suspect or charged in any of the Satanic Panic cases—is the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Satan"&gt;Church of Satan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , founded by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnton%20LaVey"&gt;Anton LaVey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Members of the Church, such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20H.%20Gilmore"&gt;Peter H. Gilmore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeggy%20Nadramia"&gt;Peggy Nadramia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoyd%20Rice"&gt;Boyd Rice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Parfrey"&gt;Adam Parfrey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Diabolos Rex, and musician &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Diamond"&gt;King Diamond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , were active in media appearances to refute allegations of criminal activity and the FBI would later issue an official report debunking the criminal conspiracy theories of this time. 

Gilmore feels Satanists are often misunderstood or misrepresented. LaVey's teachings are based on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aindividualism"&gt;individualism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , self-indulgence, and "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aan%20eye%20for%20an%20eye"&gt;eye for an eye&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " morality, with influence from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFriedrich%20Nietzsche"&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAyn%20Rand"&gt;Ayn Rand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; while its rituals and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amagick"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; draw heavily from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aoccultism"&gt;occultists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAleister%20Crowley"&gt;Aleister Crowley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They do not worship—nor believe in—the Devil or a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADevil%20in%20Christianity"&gt;Christian notion of Satan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The word "Satan" comes from the Hebrew word for "adversary" and originated from the Abrahamic faiths, being traditionally applied to an angel. Church of Satan adherents see themselves as truth-seekers, adversaries and skeptics of the religious world around them. 

On a windy October day in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Park"&gt;Central Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter sat down with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Priest"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the Church, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20H.%20Gilmore"&gt;Peter H. Gilmore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who has led LaVey's congregation of Satanists since his passing in 1997 (he became the High Priest in 2001). They discussed the beliefs of the Church, current events, LaVey's children and how Satanism applies to life and the world.
<h2>Theistic Satanism ('devil worship')</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone:♡❤♡ What is your relationship to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATheistic%20Satanism"&gt;Theistic Satanists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: There is one in New York who does a lot of websites.
♡❤♡DS: &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ADiane%20Vera"&gt;She's also an editor on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. I contacted her, but I never received a response.
♡❤♡DS: Have you had much interaction with the theistic Satanists?
♡❤♡DS: Do you know what they think of you?
♡❤♡DS: What do you think is their motivation to worship a Christian Satan?

<h2>Church of Satan 101</h2>
♡❤♡David Shankbone: How would you define the word &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASatan"&gt;Satan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: What is the Church of Satan?
♡❤♡DS: Why do you think people are like that?
♡❤♡DS: Why do you think there are those who need to have a God or supernatural parental figure?
♡❤♡DS: In the history of a lot of religions, a doctrine was developed by people who were oppressed as a way to explain their lot, and that their oppressors were going to "get theirs in the end." That’s where &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKarl%20Marx"&gt;Karl Marx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was saying religion is the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpium%20of%20the%20People"&gt;opiate of the masses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , because it creates complacency with oppression ♡❤now♡❤ because in some other ethereal dimension equality will be achieved. 

♡❤♡DS: What would be their motivation for doing something for society and not for themselves? Would there even be a motivation?
♡❤♡DS: Like, I get value out of what I am doing for &lt;a href="Wikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt;, even though it’s for free, there is still a value…
♡❤♡DS: How would a Satanist define evil?
♡❤♡DS: Some people have a compulsion to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arape"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and it harms them to not act upon it. If it was harmful for somebody to not go out and rape somebody, how would a Satanist address that situation?
♡❤♡DS: Capital punishment is not antithetical to Satanism.
♡❤♡DS: “Slaughter them all!” [♡❤Laughs♡❤]
♡❤♡DS: But should it be the government doing it?
♡❤♡DS: Do you have a 10 Commandments?
♡❤♡DS: Are there certain sites or places that are important to the Church of Satan?
♡❤♡DS: No place with a natural significance?
♡❤♡DS: If someone wanted to explore your beliefs, what should they read?

<h2>On current events and politics</h2>
♡❤♡DS: I’d like to give you some political situations and ask how a Satanist would handle them.
♡❤♡DS: You can just speak for yourself, then. If you were &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; —
♡❤♡DS: —How would you handle the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli-Palestinian%20conflict"&gt;Israeli-Palestinian issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: Where do they violate Satanic principles in that conflict?
♡❤♡DS: What about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage"&gt;Same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: Abortion?
♡❤♡DS: Why do you not consider it just another operation? Some people run or exercise not realizing their limitations and pull a muscle or need an operation for that. 
♡❤♡DS: So is the fetus a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASentient"&gt;sentient being&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: When do you think life begins?
♡❤♡DS: You mean just on a cellular level it is functioning?
♡❤♡DS: A lot of people don't like contraception.
♡❤♡DS: But then doesn't responsibility come down to defining it for yourself in Satanism? Your statements seem to come down to a baseline level of what is responsibility? What is innocence? Whereas you were saying earlier that a lot of these things are self-referentially defined.
♡❤♡DS: Who are you supporting for President?
♡❤♡DS: If you had a choice between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARudolph%20Giuliani"&gt;Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Clinton"&gt;Clinton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: That’s talked about now more than it used to be.
♡❤♡DS: It’s a question of how much it will penetrate the American consciousness that has mythologized him.

<h2>Religious and Satanic symbols</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Could you explain your logo?
♡❤♡DS: So much of the symbology references a lot of myths and superstitions, yet you’re antithetical to that. How do you explain how those two notions comport?
♡❤♡DS: It’s almost difficult to come up with a symbol that ♡❤doesn't♡❤ reference a superstition in some way.

<h2>The Iraq War: A Satanic perspective</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do you think our pursuing the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;War in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is an example of killing innocent people?
♡❤♡DS: Who are the innocents?
♡❤♡DS: How has the war in Iraq affected your worldview?
♡❤♡DS: That is what you consider the greatest threat to humanity?

<h2>On New York City</h2>
♡❤♡DS: How do you feel about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHell%27s%20Kitchen%2C%20Manhattan"&gt;Hell's Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where you live, being called Clinton?
♡❤♡DS: When you see how New York is changing around you—I’ve lived here for close to seven years, and even when I moved here it was very different. 
♡❤♡DS: But it is.
♡❤♡DS: Where do you think the culture is going to go? Is the sanitized version here to stay?
♡❤♡DS: You see that in all the old &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManufacturing%20Belt"&gt;Rust Belt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cities. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReading%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was one of the most dangerous cities I’ve ever walked around in, and I thought, “This is what 1982 New York must have felt like.”
♡❤♡DS: A friend of mine once said if you took someone from 1982 New York and you transplanted them into 2007 New York, the first thing they would say is, “Where did all these people come from?!” That the streets just used to be barren back then.

<h2>Marilyn Manson</h2>
♡❤♡DS: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarilyn%20Manson"&gt;Marilyn Manson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a member?
♡❤♡DS: It’s more of a character.
♡❤♡DS: Is he an active member?

<h2>On the church after Anton LaVey</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Does the Church of Satan have relationships with other churches?
♡❤♡DS: It would seem there are pagans or humanist religions that follow your general philosophy.
♡❤♡DS: What is the membership numbers for the Church of Satan?

♡❤♡DS: Has the church thrived after LaVey’s passing?
♡❤♡DS: What is your book about?
♡❤♡DS: It’s not all &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGene%20Loves%20Jezebel"&gt;Gene Loves Jezebel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; sounding.

<h2>Anton LaVey's children and estate</h2>
♡❤♡DS: Do Dr. LaVey’s children have anything to do with the church at all?
♡❤♡DS: But not &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZeena%20Schreck"&gt;Zeena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: Based on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASet%20%28deity%29"&gt;Egyptian god&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?
♡❤♡DS: How did the legal wrangling surrounding his estate pan out?
♡❤♡DS: Who received the copyright to ♡❤The Satanic Bible♡❤?

According to a &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Maine"&gt;University of Maine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AStudent%20Government"&gt;student government&lt;/a&gt; representative, the university may file a lawsuit against &lt;a href="w%3Arock"&gt;rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3AMy%20Chemical%20Romance"&gt;My Chemical Romance&lt;/a&gt; due to a cancelled show.

The band cited health concerns for drummer &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Bryar"&gt;Bob Bryar&lt;/a&gt; in the cancellation notification on Thursday, but played a show on the proceeding Friday. The cancellation reason is considered an '&lt;a href="w%3AAct%20of%20God"&gt;Act of God&lt;/a&gt;', and relieves both parties from any obligations.

"Unless it is truly due to sickness or injury of the band, we intend to seek full damages for breach of contract. When they played Friday night, I think that kind of voids an 'Act of God' claim," Derek Mitchell, the vice president of student entertainment said. 

The lawsuit, if agreed upon by the General Student Senate, would seek &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$20,500 for advertising, ticket sales, contractor fees, and cancellation fees.

A leading Queensland union says that the &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Cup"&gt;Melbourne Cup&lt;/a&gt; due to be run tomorrow at 3:00pm Australian Eastern Daylight Saving Time could be used as a valuable educational tool in the classroom.

The &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20Teachers%20Union"&gt;Queensland Teachers Union&lt;/a&gt; president Steve Ryan said that he supported staff making their own decisions on whether to watch the race but statistics principles could be taught in conjunction with showing the race.

Mr Ryan said that incorporating the Cup into the curriculum would make statistics 'real' to work with, rather than using textbook material. "It's about making subjects real and certainly that's a good example of how you can use a particular situation."

Many religious schools in Brisbane have chosen not to show the race due to gambling concerns.

&lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; visited a shopping centre on New South Wales' Central Coast today an hour before Opposition Leader &lt;a href="Kevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; canvassed the same spot.

Kevin Rudd certainly fell into the 'me-too' trap today after he visited the Gosford shopping centre Erina Fair this morning one hour after the Prime Minister visited the same place. When Mr Howard entered the shopping centre he was confronted by a worker who asked him who he would 'turn gay' for. The same question was asked by &lt;a href="w%3ANetwork%20Ten"&gt;Network Ten&lt;/a&gt; show host &lt;a href="Rove%20McManus"&gt;Rove McManus&lt;/a&gt; the previous night.

When Howard left the shopping centre a Labor van had pulled up in the carpark. After announcing two campaign promises, Rudd entered the shopping centre and answered some journalists' questions. The Opposition Leader then went on to say to the journalists 'zob zob zob', which is a 'vernacular for a man's genitalia', according to News.com.au.

The Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; is bracing himself for the probable interest rate rise on Wednesday. Experts are saying that a rise is almost certain and that as many as three could occur within the next three months. Interest rates have never risen so close to a federal election (this year's election on November 24) but the Prime Minister says that some interest rate rise is unavoidable in a good economy.

"Now is not the time to replace an experienced government on economic issues with an inexperienced government," Howard warned today. Labor leader &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; recalls the Prime Minister's promise at the 2004 election to keep interest rates low - labelled the 'big interest rate con' by the opposition leader.

Treasurer Peter Costello reaffirms the Coalition's policy on the workplace relations laws, saying that a reversal of the laws by a Labor government would push up inflation and interest rates.

Following the success of "Chinatrust Global Leaders Forum" in 2005, Chinatrust Commercial Bank (CTCB), the forum organizer, invited &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Ma"&gt;Jack Ma&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="w%3AAlibaba%20Group"&gt;Alibaba Group&lt;/a&gt;, to give the main address on the subject of "Cross-Strait e-Commerce Development" yesterday.

"We (CTCB) held this forum originally with a speech-style type, and hoped participants absorb good experiences from some world-class notabilities. At the first holding, we invited Dr. Edward Prescott forecasting the future of global economics and this invitation was finally respected by financial people in Taiwan. With trendy transformations and global popularization of the Internet in the presence, we finally decided to invite Jack Ma to share experiences from his successful management theory." Jeffery Koo (Chairman of CTCB) remarked at the opening.

With Alibaba Group now entered into the &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; market, Ma sees a bright future with partners' cooperation. He said: "A successful company is decided by flexible wisdoms more than its scale." Those words echoed some of the quotes he used in his speech at the forum: "Rich is a sum by team collaborations and accumulating several experiences but not money. Several valuable things can't buy with money. A company should have a long-term consideration and planning to meet success with creative, better, and different products and services."

He not only taught some strategies but also cited Chinese stories on &lt;a href="w%3AThree%20Kingdoms"&gt;Three Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATang%20Dynasty"&gt;Tang Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; to point out key factors (visions, ambitions, bosoms, and actual strengths) which determine the success or failure of a company leader.

Every year around November 5th, people in &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; and some parts of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; celebrate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Fawkes%20night"&gt;Guy Fawkes night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to commemorate the dissident from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYork"&gt;York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholicism"&gt;Roman Catholic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; conspirators who failed to blow up the houses of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Parliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on November 5, 1605. This so-called Gunpowder Plot is celebrated with firework displays and sparklers, bonfires and Guy Fawkes effigies.

Fire experts, always busy around this time of year, have called for the use of safe and legal firework displays and have urged citizens to attend organised public displays. Every year dozens of people sustain injuries due to careless handling of fireworks or fires. Notably, the city of York is not having a public firework display this year, as health and safety measures would raise costs excessively.

Events in Lewes, East Sussex (noted for Bonfire events and processions) were for the most part peacful, with only 16 arrests, mainly for public order offences. There had however been calls for certain tradtions of the Lewes events to be banned prior to the event on safety grounds.

Critics say that bonfires and fireworks are not environmentally friendly. Piles of wood prepared beforehand are attractive nests for hibernating creatures like hedgehogs, who might burn in the bonfires. Some even suggest that Fawkes' failed attack is not something to commemorate at all.

After &lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20general%20election%2C%202007"&gt;federal elections&lt;/a&gt; on June 10, 2007, coalition talks in &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; have still failed to result in compromises on the main electoral issue. The previous record from 1988 was broken today after 149 days without a new government.

&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20and%20Flemish"&gt;Christian Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AYves%20Leterme"&gt;Yves Leterme&lt;/a&gt; won the elections in &lt;a href="w%3AFlemish%20Region"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; together with his nationalistic coalition partner, and they promised more powers for the Dutch-speaking majority. &lt;a href="w%3AWalloon%20Region"&gt;Wallonian&lt;/a&gt; parties however remain reluctant to give in to unilateral demands and are asking for symbolic gestures and compromises in symbolic debates over the electoral district of &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels-Halle-Vilvoorde"&gt;Brussels and Halle-Vilvoorde&lt;/a&gt;.

Flemish politicians argue that the time is high to split the district now, because a high court ruling from 2003 found the district unconstitutional. But their counterparts believe that everything works in two directions in Belgium, and unilateral demands have no place in a &lt;a href="w%3AFederation"&gt;federal state&lt;/a&gt;.

Some progress has been made in such areas as economical reforms, but the key debate of the elections lingers on. More than ever, the future of Belgium as a federal state is at stake, although immediate independence of the economically flourishing Flemish region is not currently being discussed by the negotiators.

On Wednesday, a commission of the Flemish parliament will vote on the topic of voting rights in Brussels, and it is expected that this will again stress Flanders' call for progress on autonomy for the region. Walloon Christian-Democrat &lt;a href="w%3AJoelle%20Milquet"&gt;Joelle Milquet&lt;/a&gt;, already dubbed ♡❤Madame Non♡❤ (Madame No) in Flanders because of her refusal to set aside her electoral promises to her constituency, warned during the weekend that such a move would be perceived as hostile, and that she would leave the negotiations table.

Candidate Prime Minister Yves Leterme has called for unity last Friday: "It's time for government negotiators to assume their responsibility in the national interest. It's time to stop mutual provocations." Many Walloons perceive Leterme as a defender of Flemish rather than Belgian values, as a notorious quote marking the Wallonians as intellectually incapable of learning Dutch, haunts him.

Belgium is a federal state made up of some 6 million Dutch-speaking citizens in the north and some 4.5 million French-speaking inhabitants south of the language border. Brussels is bilangual, and there is a minuscule German-speaking community.

With no new coalition to follow them, the previous ruling parties continue to meet under former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Verhofstadt"&gt;Guy Verhofstadt&lt;/a&gt; on a regular basis to make a few straightforward but necessary decisions, to avoid too many complications of the enduring political vacuum.

<h1>National Church of Scientology recognized in Spain</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=National%20Church%20of%20Scientology%20recognized%20in%20Spain&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On 31 October 2007 the National Court in &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; issued a decision recognizing that the National Church of &lt;a href="w%3AScientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; should be entered in the Registry of Religious Entities. 

The administrative tribunal of Madrid's High Court ruled that a 2005 justice ministry decision to scrap the church from the register was "against the law." Responding to a petition filed by the church, the ruling said that no documents had been presented in court to demonstrate it was anything other than a religious entity.

"This recognition marks the end of an era in which Spanish Scientologists were forced to fight for their rights to religious freedom. It vindicates the Church of Scientology and is a new beginning for all Spanish Scientologists," said Ivan Arjona, spokesperson for the National Church of Scientology in Spain.

The National Court examined the Church's formative documents and aims and purposes to determine that the National Church of Scientology of Spain has the right to be registered as a religion under Spanish law. 

Last April, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Court of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; ruled that &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; had blocked Scientology from registering as a church in Moscow and &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology%20Moscow%20versus%20Russia"&gt;ordered payment of 10,000 euros (13,000 dollars)&lt;/a&gt; in damages. In September, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; federal prosecutors announced that they had finished an investigation which would likely lead to charges against the Church of Scientology including blackmail, breaking privacy laws, unlawful practice of medicine, and formation of a criminal organisation.

On Monday, the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Turkey"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan"&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&lt;/a&gt; paid an official &lt;a href="w%3Astate%20visit"&gt;state visit&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. During his visit, he met with &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; for talks that centered on the &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey-PKK%20conflict"&gt;Turkey-PKK conflict&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;.

Turkey is concerned about attacks by the &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan%20Workers%20Party"&gt;Kurdistan Workers Party&lt;/a&gt; (PKK) that originate from within the borders of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. There have been &lt;a href="w%3AFall%202007%20clashes%20in%20Hakkari"&gt;cross-border clashes&lt;/a&gt; between Turkey and the PKK. Turkey has threatened a major incursion, something the US seeks to avoid, as it could upset the relative calm in northern Iraq. The PKK has been listed as a &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorism"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; organization by a &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20countries%20and%20organizations%20that%20list%20the%20PKK%20as%20a%20terrorist%20group"&gt;number of countries and organizations&lt;/a&gt;. The PKK's goal has been to create an independent &lt;a href="w%3ASocialism"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; Kurdish state in a territory which it claims as &lt;a href="w%3AKurdistan"&gt;Kurdistan&lt;/a&gt;, an area that comprises parts of south-eastern Turkey, north-eastern Iraq, north-eastern &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and north-western &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

After the meeting, Bush said of the PKK that "they are an enemy of Turkey, they are an enemy of Iraq, and they are an enemy of the United States." He pledged additional &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20intelligence"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to help Turkey, an offer that was also made by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; last week, during her &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; tour.

Bush further offered mutual military assistance with both Turkey and Iraq to fight the PKK. "We want to work in a close way to deal with this problem," he said.

Erdogan mentioned during the post-meeting news conference that the &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20National%20Assembly%20of%20Turkey"&gt;Grand National Assembly of Turkey&lt;/a&gt; has already authorized military action in Iraq. He did not, however, say whether such action would be imminent.

Neither leader indicated to what level, if any, that direct military cooperation would exist.

&lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Babacan"&gt;Ali Babacan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20minister"&gt;Minister of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; for Turkey, was last week not so impressed by Rice's offers. "We are at the point where words have been exhausted and where there is need for action," he said on Friday.

"The Bush administration would like to just kick this can down the road," said Bulent Aliriza, a political observer for the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Strategic%20and%20International%20Studies"&gt;Center for Strategic and International Studies&lt;/a&gt;. "The problem is, the can has been kicked down the road to the point where now it can't be kicked anymore."

The space shuttle &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt; is coming back to Earth after 11 days in orbit. The a scan of the Shuttle's heat shield (now routine since the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster"&gt;Space Shuttle Columbia disaster&lt;/a&gt;) showed no cause for concern and Discovery was cleared for the voyage home.

The current mission, &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-120"&gt;STS-120&lt;/a&gt; was launched on October 23. The mission's primary purposes were to deliver the &lt;a href="w%3AHarmony%20%28ISS%20module%29"&gt;Harmony module&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; and to help reposition and extend solar power arrays. 

The mission gained wide attention for including a space walk to repair damage in the solar power array. The space walk had not been planned until the mission was already underway when the damage was then detected. However, additional problems with a rotary joint were not repaired and if they are not repaired they could interfere with further station construction. 

The return will also bring back &lt;a href="w%3AClay%20Anderson"&gt;Clay Anderson&lt;/a&gt; who is being replaced on the International Space Station by &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Tani"&gt;Dan Tani&lt;/a&gt;. 

Discovery is scheduled to land at &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; at 1:02 PM &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-5"&gt;UTC-5&lt;/a&gt;) on November 7.

In late October, supporters of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; candidate-for-President &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; set up a website soliciting a "money bomb" of campaign donations to coincide with November 5th, the anniversary of &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Fawkes%20Day"&gt;Guy Fawkes Day&lt;/a&gt;, at ThisNovember5th.com.

The fund-raising campaign fell short of its original goal of 100,000 donors each donating &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;100 to generate $10 million for Paul's campaign. However, the final amount raised by over 35,000 Ron Paul donors was over $4 million. This is the largest fundraising day in primary history since John Kerry's 2004 acceptance of the Democratic nomination. It was originally reported that on June 30, 2007 &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; raised $6.5 million. According to the Paul campaign, though Clinton reported all that money on June 30th, it was in fact raised over the course of a week, not in a single day.

Paul is running for the Republican nomination but self-identifies as a &lt;a href="w%3Alibertarian"&gt;libertarian&lt;/a&gt;. Although Paul has been successful online, in straw polls, in debate polls, in fundraising, and in turnouts at rallies, his national polling has remained in the single digits.

The racehorse &lt;a href="w%3AEfficient%20%28horse%29"&gt;Efficient&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Melbourne%20Cup"&gt;2007 Melbourne Cup&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3AFlemington%20Racecourse"&gt;Flemington Racecourse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; was abuzz today as the Melbourne Cup was raced for the 147th time. The &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; horse Efficient finishing the 3200m race in a time of 3:23.24. The horse, which had won the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20Derby"&gt;Victorian Derby&lt;/a&gt;, became the first horse since &lt;a href="w%3APhar%20Lap"&gt;Phar Lap&lt;/a&gt; (also a New Zealand horse) to come back and win the &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Cup"&gt;Melbourne Cup&lt;/a&gt; a year later.

The race ended with a stunning finish as Efficient and his jockey Michael Rodd came from behind to overtake Purple Moon in the final stretch. The odds on Efficient were 24-1 to win and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;7.40 for a place. Purple Moon finished second and Mahler finished third.

120,000 spectators looked on as Mahler took the lead at 1600m and fell back to third in the closing stages. Early leader Tungsten Strike finished 21st (last).

The win is the third of its kind for owner Lloyd Williams with two previous victories in the 1980s. Williams had two horses in the race, Zipping and Efficient, but Zipping fell to fourth place while Efficient surged forward. 

Lloyd Williams' son Nick was at the raceground and was aiming high for Efficient. 

"People keep telling me the last horse to do what he has done was Phar Lap," he said.

Efficient was a favourite for the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Melbourne%20Cup"&gt;2006 Melbourne Cup&lt;/a&gt; but was scratched at the last minute.

An &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n soldier has been found dead with a gunshot wound in a &lt;a href="w%3Abarracks"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; area in &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="East%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;.

The soldier, working with the International Stabilisation Force in the turbulent country was found dead on the afternoon of November 5. The exact details of his death are still unknown but Air Chief Angus Houston said an inquiry will be launched as part of the investigation. 

"The soldier's next of kin have been informed and our priority is to ensure the family is receiving the support and care they need," Houston said.

About 850 &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Defence%20Force"&gt;Australian Defence Force&lt;/a&gt; soldiers have been deployed to East Timor as part of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), the military component of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Integrated%20Mission%20in%20Timor-Leste"&gt;United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste&lt;/a&gt;. The country was recognised as independent from Indonesia in 2002. 

Three Australian servicemen have died on active service in one month.

Two prominent South Carolina supporters of pressured the state Democratic council to keep &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Colbert"&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/a&gt; off the primary ballot. The Council voted 13-3 last week against Colbert's placement on the ballot.

According to an anonymous member of the council who felt pressured, one of those people was State Superintendent of Education &lt;a href="w%3AInez%20Tenenbaum"&gt;Inez Tenenbaum&lt;/a&gt;, who admitted she had made the calls. "I think lobbying was too strong a word," she said in an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;♡❤CNN♡❤&lt;/a&gt;. "I called them to see what they were thinking, and if they had made up their mind. I am a volunteer in that campaign, and so I am not a staffer. And I thought it could have taken votes away from a lot of people."

Another Obama supporter, state Representative Bakari Sellers, also admitted to making the calls. "I placed the calls as a concerned Democrat, realizing that we are a country in despair," Sellers told ♡❤CNN♡❤. "It is not a time for games or to make a mockery of the process."

Yesterday Colbert officially withdrew from the race. “I am shocked and saddened by the South Carolina Democratic Executive Council’s 13-to-3 vote to keep me off their presidential primary ballot,” he said in the statement. “Although I lost by the slimmest margin in presidential election history — only 10 votes — I have chosen not to put the country through another agonizing Supreme Court battle. It is time for this nation to heal.”

According to Tenenbaum, the reason she did not want Colbert on the ballot was financial and not political. For every name the Democrats put on the ballot in South Carolina, they have to pay &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;20,000 to the state election commission. 

The Obama campaign denied any connection to the phone calls.

In related news, at a book signing at &lt;a href="w%3ABorders%20Book%20Store"&gt;Borders Book Store&lt;/a&gt; in New York City last night, a protester posing as a member of the press disrupted the event, demanding Colbert make statements about &lt;a href="w%3A7%20World%20Trade%20Center"&gt;7 World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;. Despite preliminary findings by the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology"&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology&lt;/a&gt; that fire caused them, some &lt;a href="w%3Aconspiracy%20theorists"&gt;conspiracy theorists&lt;/a&gt; believe the dramatic building collapses on September 11, including that of &lt;a href="w%3A9/11%20conspiracy%23Building_Seven_collapse_as_a_conventional_controlled_demolition"&gt;building seven&lt;/a&gt;, were the result of &lt;a href="w%3AControlled%20demolition%20hypothesis%20for%20the%20collapse%20of%20the%20World%20Trade%20Center%23World%20Trade%20Center%3A%20Building%207"&gt;controlled demolition&lt;/a&gt;. NIST has "found no evidence of a blast or controlled demolition event", though in its final report on building 7, they would "like to determine the magnitude of hypothetical blast scenarios that could have led to the structural failure of one or more critical elements." 

"What about World Trade Center Number 7, Stephen?" shouted the protester. "What are you going to say about that? Why don't you give us a witty remark and make a joke about it? Keep smirking, Stephen!" The protester was removed by the book store's security.

The &lt;a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; suspended non-mission critical &lt;a href="w%3AF-15%20Eagle"&gt;F-15&lt;/a&gt; flight operations on Nov. 3 following the crash of a &lt;a href="w%3AMissouri%20Air%20National%20Guard"&gt;Missouri Air National Guard&lt;/a&gt; F-15C aircraft Nov. 2. The F-15 will continue to fly in some emergency situations and a few others according to Air Force spokesperson John Elolf.

The crash was 125 miles south of St. Louis on private property surrounded by the &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Twain%20National%20Forest"&gt;Mark Twain National Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADent%20County%2C%20Missouri"&gt;Dent County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; during dogfight training by four &lt;a href="w%3A131st%20Fighter%20Wing"&gt;131st Fighter Wing&lt;/a&gt; craft. The pilot ejected and suffered minor injuries.

The cause of that accident is still under investigation, however, preliminary findings indicate that a possible structural failure of the aircraft may have occurred. The suspension of flight operations is a precautionary measure.

The Air Force has stated that it will ensure that mission requirements will be met for worldwide operations normally accomplished by the F-15. Currently, F-15s operate out of bases in the continental United States, Alaska, England, Hawaii, Japan and the Middle East.

The F-15 Eagle is an all-weather tactical fighter designed to permit the Air Force to gain and maintain air supremacy over the battlefield. There are more than 700 F-15s in the Air Force inventory. The F-15 reached initial operational capability for the Air Force in September 1975.
The F-15C, D and E models were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Desert%20Storm"&gt;Operation Desert Storm&lt;/a&gt; where they proved their superior combat capability. F-15C fighters accounted for 34 of the 37 Air Force air-to-air victories. The F-15E's were operated mainly at night, hunting &lt;a href="w%3AScud"&gt;SCUD&lt;/a&gt; missile launchers and artillery sites using the &lt;a href="w%3ALANTIRN"&gt;LANTIRN&lt;/a&gt; system.

They have since been deployed for air expeditionary force deployments and Operations &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Southern%20Watch"&gt;Southern Watch&lt;/a&gt; (the no-fly zone in Southern Iraq), &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Provide%20Comfort"&gt;Provide Comfort&lt;/a&gt; in Turkey, &lt;a href="w%3A1999%20NATO%20bombing%20of%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia"&gt;Allied Force&lt;/a&gt; in Bosnia, &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Enduring%20Freedom"&gt;Enduring Freedom&lt;/a&gt; in Afghanistan and &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;Iraqi Freedom&lt;/a&gt; in Iraq.

The Air Force is replacing its aging F-15 fighters with the &lt;a href="w%3AF-22%20Raptor"&gt;F-22 Raptor&lt;/a&gt;. The F-22 is an advanced stealth fighter aircraft combining stealth for in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. However, budgetary concerns have caused the Air Force to reduce their total order of F-22s.

The nomination of Judge &lt;a href="Michael%20Mukasey"&gt;Michael Mukasey&lt;/a&gt; as the next &lt;a href="w%3AAttorney%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, passed the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt; today and will move to a vote before the entire &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt;. Two &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; joined the nine &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; to yield an 11-8 vote. Observers believe that Mukasey will easily succeed in the Senate vote.

The nomination of Mukasey by &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; had originally drawn broad support. Nonetheless, Mukasey triggered a political row, during pre-confirmation questioning, when he refused to state that &lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt; amounted to illegal torture. In the end, he was able secure the votes of the two Democrats after assuring them that, if &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; passed legislation that made waterboarding illegal, he would in fact work to enforce such a law.

&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Leahy%20%28politician%29"&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/a&gt;, Senator from &lt;a href="Vermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt;, who opposed Mukasey said: "Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey’s personal assurance that he would enforce a future, a new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one. Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of the president."
"Now, I wish I could support Judge Mukasey’s nomination," Senator Leahy further said. "I like Michael Mukasey. We have many things in common in our past careers. I certainly don’t question his intellectual ability or his independence."

The two Democrats that voted for Mukasey were Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Schumer"&gt;Chuck Schumer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and Senator &lt;a href="w%3ADianne%20Feinstein"&gt;Dianne Feinstein&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. Schumer has been reported as suggesting Mukasey as Attorney General to &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; during the search for a nominee.

Schumer defended his vote, saying: "If six months from now ... the same policies continued, the victory in defeating Mukasey would seem hollow. No one questions that Judge Mukasey would do much to remove the stench of politics from the Justice Department. I believe we should give him that chance."

Feinstein said that her vote for Mukasey was because, otherwise, Bush could have an acting Attorney General, who would not need confirmation, until the end of his term. In explaing this, she said: "I don't believe a leaderless department is in the best interests of the American people or of the department itself. [Bush] appointed this man because he believes he is mainstream."

Senator &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; did not agree with Mukasey's view on waterboarding. "Waterboarding is already illegal under United States law. It's illegal under the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit outrages upon personal dignity, including cruel, humiliating and degrading treatment," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Press%20Secretary"&gt;White House Press Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADana%20Perino"&gt;Dana Perino&lt;/a&gt; said of the committee vote: "Judge Mukasey has clearly demonstrated that he will be an exceptional attorney general at this critical time."

Constable Douglas Scott, 20, of the &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; (RCMP) was shot to death late Monday night while answering a call about an &lt;a href="w%3ADriving%20under%20the%20influence%23Canada"&gt;impaired driver&lt;/a&gt;. The incident took place in the community of Kimmirut in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s northern territory of &lt;a href="w%3ANunavut"&gt;Nunavut&lt;/a&gt;.

Constable Scott, who had been on the job for six months, is the second northern Canadian RCMP officer killed on duty in just under a month. On October 6, Constable Christopher Worden was shot and killed while responding to a call in &lt;a href="w%3AHay%20River%2C%20Northwest%20Territories"&gt;Hay River&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Territories"&gt;Northwest Territories&lt;/a&gt;.

Scott is survived by his parents, Doug and Marla, as well as his siblings and grandparents. His parents live near &lt;a href="w%3ABrockville%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Brockville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. 

RCMP Commanding Officer "V" (Nunavut) Division Marty Cheliak expressed the police force's shock and sadness at the shooting. "The death of any of our members is deeply felt, but when once again it occurs in one of our close-knit northern communities, the pain of that loss seems even greater," said Cheliak in a statement. "Our hearts also go out to the community of Kimmirut and to everyone who knew Doug."

Cheliak provided the following timeline of events:

<ul>
BULLET::::- "At 10:56 p.m., Cst. Scott was called to respond to a complaint of a possible impaired driver.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- At 11:02 p.m. Cst. Scott radioed “V” (Nunavut) Division telecoms to say that he was following up on the call for service.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Shortly thereafter, “V” Division telecoms attempted to contact Cst. Scott, but received no response.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- At 11:31 a second member from the detachment was advised by local residents that [the officer] had responded to a report of an impaired driver and that the driver had crashed into a residence. Upon arrival at the scene, it was found that [Constable Scott] had been shot.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- At 11:45 p.m. “V” division’s Emergency Response Team was mobilized.
BULLET::::- At 11:56 p.m. it was confirmed that the suspect had entered his own residence.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- At 4:10 a.m. the suspect surrendered to police without incident and was taken into custody."

</ul>
Canadian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement on the death of Scott on Tuesday. “I wish to pay tribute to Constable Doug Scott, who died tragically in the line of duty in Kimmirut, Nunavut," said Harper. "On behalf of Canadians, I extend my sincere sympathy to the family, friends and fellow colleagues of Constable Scott. We are forever grateful that young men and women like Constable Scott continue to respond to the call of duty often working under extreme circumstances, and in conditions of great danger."

The suspect in the shooting, Pingoatuk (Ping) Kolola of Kimmirut, Nunavut, has since been transported via RCMP aircraft to &lt;a href="w%3AIqaluit"&gt;Iqaluit&lt;/a&gt; where he remains in custody. He has been charged with first degree murder.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABindeez"&gt;Bindeez beads&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a children's toy from &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and manufactured by Moose Enterprise in &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, is being pulled off toy store shelves in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; after traces of an illegal drug, which is converted into &lt;a href="w%3Agamma-Hydroxybutyric%20acid"&gt;gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid&lt;/a&gt; (GHB) when ingested, was found inside the toy. At least 20 million toys are affected.

So far at least three children from the U.K. and at least two from &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have fallen seriously ill and are currently receiving medical attention. The toy is also sold in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; as ♡❤Aqua Dots♡❤, with two reports received by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) of children needing hospitalization after ingesting the beads.

"We've asked all our customers to take them off the shelf while we retest everything to make sure the toys comply with all regulations," said the company in a statement, although no mandatory recall has been issued for the product. The statement also says that the plant in Hong Kong was not using a chemical mixture approved by the company.

"This substitution was not at any time approved by Moose nor was Moose made aware of any substitution by the supplier," added the statement.

The toys were supposed to contain a non-toxic chemical known as 1,5-pentanediol, but instead &lt;a href="w%3A1%2C4-butanediol"&gt;1,4-butanediol&lt;/a&gt;, which is mainly used in creating the illegal drug GHB, was used in the toys. When humans consume 1,4-butanediol, the body converts it into GHB and could make the individual seriously ill, causing headaches, seizures, dizziness and in some cases death. GHB is a natural chemical found in a variety of things such as beef, wine and some varieties of citrus fruits. It is also used as a pharmaceutical which is sold as &lt;a href="w%3AXyrem"&gt;Xyrem&lt;/a&gt;.

Recent animal research indicates that drugs are available for human use which may work as antidotes to the poison, either by hindering its conversion to GHB with 4-methylpyrazole (fomepizole, Antizol) or by blocking GHB's effectiveness at the receptor (SCH 50911). Rodent testing has found the lethal dose of 1,4-butanediol to range from 1.4 to 2.5 grams per kilogram body weight, but an antidote can increase the lethal dose by a factor of 10.

It is not known how the chemicals got mixed up, but officials for the toy company say that they are continuing the investigation. The toy is currently banned in all of Australia, but the company says all those who bought it will be refunded their money.

"The issue of how a dangerous substance was used in these beads and not the non-toxic substance ... that is going to take us a few more days to uncover," said Australia's Fair Trade Minister, Linda Burney in a statement to the press.

The toy was recently named Australia's number one toy for 2007.

The opening ceremonies for the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Baseball%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Baseball World Cup&lt;/a&gt; (2007 BWC) were held Tuesday. Torrential rain, however, made &lt;a href="Panama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; the opening match of the 2007 BWC in &lt;a href="w%3ATaichung%20Intercontinental%20Baseball%20Stadium"&gt;Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. The original opening match of &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Chinese Taipei&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; was postponed until next week and will be played at &lt;a href="w%3ATianmu%20Baseball%20Stadium"&gt;Tianmu Baseball Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.

"Recently, we got into a sticky situation while constructing a dome due to some protests by non-governmental people, but we'll try to overcome these difficulties in order to present high-level sports to the international market." Chin-chi Wu, the Director of the Taipei City Bureau of Education, remarked at Tuesday's opening ceremony.

<h2>Spain vs Panama</h2>
The opening match of the 2007 BWC was played in Taichung after a bad weather Wednesday at Tianmu, Taipei City. The Spanish team became contenders after winning 3rd place at the 2007 European Baseball Tournament. Several of their players hail from &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;.

With a &lt;a href="w%3ASingle%20%28baseball%29"&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href="w%3ARun%20batted%20in"&gt;RBI&lt;/a&gt; by Angel Chavez, and the first &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20run"&gt;HR&lt;/a&gt; of 2007 BWC yielding 3 RBIs by Joel Vega, the Panamanian team transformed this match from one of pitching to batting. In the end, Panama beat Spain 5-0. Even though Spain lost this match, their strengths were witnessed by lots of spectators.

<h2>Australia vs Cuba</h2>
This match was delayed a few hours due to uncertain weather in &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;. The two teams also played each other in the finals of the &lt;a href="w%3ABaseball%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2004 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the two teams battled in an intense pitching duel.

At the bottom of 9th &lt;a href="w%3Ainnings"&gt;inning&lt;/a&gt;, Frederich Cepeda hit a solo HR and pushed this game into extra innings. &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;'s pitcher Pedro Lazo Iglesias saved his team at the top of 10th inning when the Aussies looked posed to score. Cuba beat &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; 3-2. Osmanis Urrutia's HR at the bottom of 10th inning was the winning &lt;a href="w%3ARun%20%28baseball%29"&gt;run&lt;/a&gt;.

At least four members of an armed criminal group have been killed and six arrested in a police action dubbed "Mountain Storm," &lt;a href="Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;n Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Kotevski told the MIA state news agency. He said no police officers were injured and confirmed special forces were still in the area. 

Locals from the village of Brodec, a &lt;a href="w%3A%C5%A0ar%20Mountain"&gt;Šar Mountain&lt;/a&gt; village north of &lt;a href="w%3ATetovo"&gt;Tetovo&lt;/a&gt;, have confirmed a shootout between police and armed groups in the village.

A spokesman for NATO peacekeepers in neighbouring &lt;a href="Kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; told a news conference a helicopter had crashed but there was no information on casualties. Macedonian police denied that report. "There is no helicopter down on the Macedonian side," spokesman Ivo Kotevski told Reuters. 

Local media reported that police are searching for Lirim Jakupi (also known as "Nazi"), a convicted criminal who escaped with seven other men in a violent break-out from Kosovo`s Dubrava Prison in August and is believed to be hiding in the area. Last week Xhavid Morina, another escaped convict from Dubrava Prison, was found dead near Odri, a village close to Tetovo. Also, in October, a Macedonian policeman was killed in an ambush near the border with Kosovo and Croatian TV aired a video showing Albanian militants threatening actions in Kosovo.

Several media reported that &lt;a href="w%3AKFOR"&gt;KFOR&lt;/a&gt; has closed the border towards Macedonia, in the part of Kosovo, due to the police operation at Šar Mountain. KFOR troops are heavily armed and ready to shoot in case of "conflict spillover at Kosovo territory," media report.

The operation was announced over at 14:00 local time.

The clashes took place in the part of Macedonia which saw bitter &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20Macedonia%20conflict"&gt;ethnic clashes in 2001&lt;/a&gt;.

Three power plant workers at the Salem Harbor Power Station in &lt;a href="w%3ASalem%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Salem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; died overnight after being severely burned when a water tube they were near burst releasing high pressure steam which burned the men on the head, face, neck and hands just before 9 a.m. EST yesterday.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ADominion%20Resources"&gt;Dominion Resources&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; energy company which bought the 1950s-era coal-firing plant, from USGen New England, a bankrupted subsidiary of &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Gas%20%26amp%3B%20Electric"&gt;Pacific Gas &amp; Electric&lt;/a&gt;, the three men, two operators and a mechanic were working on the ground floor of the plant on a coal-fired generator when the boiler tube exploded twenty feet above sending high pressure steam at a temperature of 320 degrees Fahrenheit and was, according the Salem Fire Department, down towards them.

The three men, Mark Mansfield, 41, of &lt;a href="w%3APeabody%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Peabody&lt;/a&gt;, Phillip Robinson, 56, of &lt;a href="w%3ABeverly%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Beverly&lt;/a&gt; and Matthew Indeglia, 20, of &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Lawrence&lt;/a&gt; were first rushed to the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Shore%20Medical%20Center"&gt;North Shore Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in Salem before being transported to &lt;a href="w%3ABrigham%20and%20Women%27s%20Hospital"&gt;Brigham and Women's Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; where they died overnight.

"All three men passed away," said hospital spokeswoman Christina Jeffrey.

"All of Dominion is greatly saddened at the deaths of these men, They were valuable members of our Salem Harbor family. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families," announced Thomas F. Farrell II, Dominion chairman, president and chief executive officer.

The boiler involved is 50 years old and, according to plant officials, is inspected yearly. The Salem Fire Department said they have received 19 calls concerning the boiler over the past five years, which, according to the fire department, is not unusual. The area where the explosion occurred was last inspected in April. The boiler tubes carry high-pressure water and steam to turn the turbine generators, which spin to produce electricity.

James "Red" Simpson, business manager of &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Brotherhood%20of%20Electrical%20Workers"&gt;International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers&lt;/a&gt; Local 326 has worked at the plant for 25 years said, "In my experience with the plant in the 25 years that I have been here, I can't say enough for the safety programs that are in place. These gentlemen who were sadly killed yesterday were some of the best-trained power plant workers. All of the safety precautions that had to be in place at the time of the accident, were in place."

Dominion has shut the plant's four generators down for a safety review and to assist employees with the deaths. The plant powers 740,000 homes and employs a 145 employees and is located on Fort Avenue in Salem on a 65-acre waterfront site and uses coal-fired generators but also has a generator that runs on oil.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Buffalo Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; is currently investigating how 12 "&lt;a href="w%3AMolotov%20cocktail"&gt;fire bombs&lt;/a&gt;" ended up inside an abandoned apartment house on 15 Allen Street in &lt;a href="w%3AAllentown%2C%20Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Allentown&lt;/a&gt;, a neighborhood in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday November 7.

In an exclusive report, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has learned from a witness who wishes to remain anonymous, that at approximately 12:00 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC-5"&gt;UTC-5&lt;/a&gt;) Heidi Garner called &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt; to report that while walking her dog, it had been attacked by two other dogs when it sniffed under a gate of the house. When police arrived to investigate and retrieve the assaulting dogs, they entered the house and found the 12 fire bombs. It is not known what the devices were made of or what the explosive material was, but unconfirmed reports say the main explosive source was gasoline.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADangerous%20goods"&gt;Hazmat&lt;/a&gt; team, the &lt;a href="w%3ABomb%20disposal"&gt;bomb squad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AEmergency%20service"&gt;emergency services&lt;/a&gt; were then dispatched to the scene to dispose of the devices, according to witness reports. It is not known where they were taken.

Both dogs were immediately put to sleep because they were fighting over the body of the dead dog. It is not known who is the owner of the dogs, as the house was not rented, and no one was supposed to be living there.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has also learned, while investigating the property history, the &lt;a href="w%3AErie%20County%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Erie County&lt;/a&gt;'s Department of Finance says that the building, which also has a storefront, is allegedly owned by a Richard White who happens to live next door at 17 Allen. White bought the property from Edward G. Koch in 1996. The building was built in 1910.

It is not known what the devices were going to be used for and an investigation is ongoing. It is not known if there are any suspects.

Because of a severe amount of garbage and dog feces, the City of Buffalo has condemned the building.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; musician &lt;a href="w%3AMeat%20Loaf"&gt;Meat Loaf&lt;/a&gt; has canceled the remaining dates of his 2007 European tour on Tuesday. This decision was announced less than a week after the performer prematurely ended a concert in &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%20upon%20Tyne"&gt;Newcastle upon Tyne&lt;/a&gt;.

Earlier reports attributed Meat Loaf's medical problems at Newcastle to a sore throat. This week's announcements indicate that the rocker sustained a vocal cord cyst that requires weeks of treatment and possibly surgery.

Despite Meat Loaf's indication at the Newcastle concert that his career might have ended, a most recent statement on his fan site declared that he would be "coming back strong in 2008" with hopes of new concerts following treatment.
