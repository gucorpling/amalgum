<h1>Colleges offering admission to displaced New Orleans students/AL-KY</h1>
Due to the damage by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent flooding, a number of colleges and universities in the New Orleans metropolitan area will not be able to hold classes for the fall 2005 semester. It is estimated that 75,000 to 100,000 students have been displaced. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm%3FSection%3DPresident2President"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In response, institutions across the United States and Canada are offering late registration for displaced students so that their academic progress is not unduly delayed. Some are offering free or reduced admission to displaced students. At some universities, especially state universities, this offer is limited to residents of the area.

<h2>Overview</h2>

The GNOME Project announced today the release of the latest version of its &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20software"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; desktop environment for &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnix"&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt; operating systems. Version 2.12 of the &lt;a href="w%3AGNOME"&gt;GNOME Desktop&lt;/a&gt; has several new features including an updated look and feel, an improved file manager, a new "About Me" panel to keep a user's personal information and &lt;a href="w%3AEvince"&gt;Evince&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="w%3APortable%20Document%20Format"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APostScript"&gt;PostScript&lt;/a&gt; document viewer. Several components comprising the GNOME Desktop, including its Web browser, e-mail client, and multimedia applications, have also undergone significant changes.

&lt;a href="w%3AOwen%20Taylor"&gt;Owen Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AGNOME%20Foundation"&gt;GNOME Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s board, explained that "GNOME 2.12 looks better than ever before and brings greater consistency." He added that "[t]here are useful new features throughout the desktop, carefully implemented to increase usability while keeping GNOME simple and intuitive."

The GNOME Desktop, which is available in 43 languages, has received some attention over the past few years with large deployments, affecting hundreds of thousands of users, reported in Spain and Brazil and several more on the way in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and China. The Italian South Tyrol province of Bolzano reported only a few days ago that 16,000 students would now be using the GNOME Desktop in private and public schools. Software vendors such as Real Networks, Mozilla (responsible for the &lt;a href="w%3AFirefox"&gt;Firefox browser&lt;/a&gt;), the Eclipse Project, and VMWare have adopted elements of its developer platform for software development.

More than 500 people, both volunteers and employees of sponsoring companies, make up the GNOME Project, which releases a new version of the GNOME Desktop every six months. The GNOME Foundation provides organizational support to the project.

<h1>Colleges offering admission to displaced New Orleans students/LA-ND</h1>
Due to the damage by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent flooding, a number of colleges and universities in the New Orleans metropolitan area will not be able to hold classes for the fall 2005 semester. It is estimated that 75,000 to 100,000 students have been displaced. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm%3FSection%3DPresident2President"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In response, institutions across the United States and Canada are offering late registration for displaced students so that their academic progress is not unduly delayed. Some are offering free or reduced admission to displaced students. At some universities, especially state universities, this offer is limited to residents of the area.

<h2>Overview</h2>

This is one of five separate articles: three for U.S. States, a fourth for international, a fifth for schools in all locations offering space for faculty, graduate and professional students.

<h1>Colleges offering admission to displaced New Orleans students/OH-WY</h1>
Due to the damage by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent flooding, a number of colleges and universities in the New Orleans metropolitan area will not be able to hold classes for the fall 2005 semester. It is estimated that 75,000 to 100,000 students have been displaced. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm%3FSection%3DPresident2President"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In response, institutions across the United States and Canada are offering late registration for displaced students so that their academic progress is not unduly delayed. Some are offering free or reduced admission to displaced students. At some universities, especially state universities, this offer is limited to residents of the area.

<h2>Overview</h2>

This is one of five separate articles: three for U.S. States, a fourth for international, a fifth for schools in all locations offering space for faculty, graduate and professional students.

<h1>Colleges offering admission to displaced New Orleans students/International</h1>
Due to the damage by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent flooding, a number of colleges and universities in the New Orleans metropolitan area will not be able to hold classes for the fall 2005 semester. It is estimated that 75,000 to 100,000 students have been displaced. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.acenet.edu/AM/Template.cfm%3FSection%3DPresident2President"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In response, institutions across the United States and Canada are offering late registration for displaced students so that their academic progress is not unduly delayed. Some are offering free or reduced admission to displaced students. At some universities, especially state universities, this offer is limited to residents of the area.

<h2>Overview</h2>

This is one of five separate articles: three for U.S. States, a fourth for international, a fifth for schools in all locations offering space for faculty, graduate and professional students.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; is hosting &lt;a href="http%3A//ngs.woc.noaa.gov/katrina/"&gt;over 3,000 high-resolution images&lt;/a&gt; on their website of the devastation along the &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Coast"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;. The images were taken by the NOAA Remote Sensing Division using a Emerge/Applanix Digital Sensor System or DSS from 7,500 feet.

They were mounted on a NOAA &lt;a href="w%3ACessna"&gt;Cessna&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.aoc.noaa.gov/aircraft_cessna.htm"&gt;Citation&lt;/a&gt; aircraft, a twin engine plane.

The images from the plane was taken to support the national security and emergency management response requirements. The image will also help current research efforts to help develop standards for aerial digital imagery.

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Maps"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; also contains some imagery (though limited) at this time when the word &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; or anything within New Orleans is typed in. It can be accessed by clicking the red button labeled Katrina.

Mr Brash said he had met members of the church a number of times. He has admitted today that he was aware of the group's intention to publish brochures that were critical of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Aotearoa%20New%20Zealand"&gt;The Greens&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesman for the Group admitted to having spent NZ$500,000 on the campaign so far.

The pamphlets were published without the link to the Church being obvious. However, former members of the Church identified the men as belonging to the church which has been described as a sect. The Exclusive Brethren are a closed order. Its members are not allowed to listen to Radio, Television or use computers at all. There are approximately 2000 members in New Zealand and active branches in the US and Australia. They are linked to political support for &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; and other conservative politicians.

There will be a delay in future &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20program"&gt;Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; flights until at least the fall of 2006, due to damaged &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; facilities that house and manufacture parts for the Shuttle program. &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; has damaged several NASA facilities, including not only the &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt;, but more importantly the &lt;a href="w%3AMichoud%20Assembly%20Facility"&gt;Michoud Assembly Facility&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; itself and the &lt;a href="w%3AStennis%20Space%20Center"&gt;Stennis Space Center&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3Agulf%20coast"&gt;gulf coast&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, both major worksites of NASA subcontractors that help with the servicing of parts for the shuttle. 

The Michoud New Orleans facility is the primary manufacturing facility for the external fuel tanks that are used on Shuttle launches. The Stennis Space Center is the manufacturing and test center for the main shuttle rocket engines. NASA is still trying to contact employees who have been evacuated from the New Orleans and Gulf Coast areas who have not reported to work due to the disaster and current situation in New Orleans. NASA announced that the Michoud Assembly Facility will not reopen until September 26th at the earliest.

There have been many setbacks for the Shuttle program as well. Hurricane Katrina simply added to these problems. &lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Storm%20Ophelia%23Hurricane%20Ophelia"&gt;Hurricane Ophelia&lt;/a&gt; forced the facilities at the Kennedy Space Center to go into a weather protection status, returning the shuttle Atlantis back to its hanger from the Vehicle Assembly building. The external fuel tank that was earlier scheduled to return to New Orleans prior to Katrina for some minor repairs had to be secured from the storm. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that Wayne Hale, NASA’s deputy shuttle program manager, suggests that it may be over a year before they can get back to flying another shuttle mission.

Among other problems facing NASA, employees at these damaged facilities have faced very personal losses. Some have lost family members, their homes, and more. In some cases, NASA has been unable to locate employees, or employees of contractors. For those that have been located, many of them from New Orleans are being transferred either to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, or to the Marshall Space Center in &lt;a href="w%3AHuntsville%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Huntsville, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;. 

At the Stennis Space Center, they at first attempted to put the facility to use as an evacuee center to take in some people coming from out of New Orleans. As of Wednesday, those plans were dropped when evacuees were being transferred to other facilities better equipped to deal with their long term needs. The center is now focusing on efforts to recover from the damage to the facility itself. 

At the Michoud Assembly Facility, the U.S. Marine Corp is also using it as a staging area for its operations in New Orleans, and as a temporary military base.

<h2>Audio Wikinews transcript – 2005 09 08 – 0930 UTC</h2>

The time is 0930 UTC on Thursday 8th September 2005, and this is Audio Wikinews: News Briefs.

&lt;a href="Palestinian%20gunmen%20assassinate%20ex-security%20chief"&gt;Palestinian gunmen assassinate ex-security chief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Former Palestinian security chief Moussa Arafat, cousin of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, was assassinated at his home in the Gaza Strip after a half-hour shootout between a number of militants and Arafat's bodyguards. They dragged Arafat into the street, while still in his pajamas, where he was shot. He was declared dead on arrival to hospital.

There is no indication that this incident will affect the withdrawal of Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank, scheduled to be completed in the next few weeks.
&lt;a href="Blair%20is%20first%20public%20official%20to%20apologize%20for%20Hurricane%20Katrina%20response"&gt;Blair is first public official to apologize for Hurricane Katrina response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has apologised to Britons affected by Hurricane Katrina. Many British citizens who were trapped in New Orleans have complained to the British Foreign Office about the lack of response from their government after the hurricane destabilized almost 200 miles of the United States gulf coast.
&lt;a href="Controversy%20erupts%20over%20German%20Anarchist%20Pogo%20Party%27s%20campaign%20ad"&gt;Controversy erupts over German Anarchist Pogo Party's campaign ad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The German Anarchist Pogo Party ran a campaign ad which, instead of discussing the party's politics, featured various party scenes set to a heavy metal soundtrack. The spot included revellers smashing furniture, pouring beer down each other's throats, and women dancing topless. TV channel ARD refused to air the ad because it "violates the human dignity" and showed only a heavily censored version at an earlier airtime. The Party then sued the station and got an injunction by an appeal court in Münster only minutes before the next ad was due, forcing the ARD to air the spot uncensored, right before their evening news flagship.

And: 
One year ago yesterday, on September 7, 2004, the Wikimedia Commons project was presented to the public. Wikimedia Commons, or simply Commons, is a repository for multimedia files that include images, videos, computer animations, and music as well as spoken texts, such as this one. They currently count more than 232,000 files.

&lt;a href="w%3ASamsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; announced it will market &lt;a href="w%3ADVD"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; players capable of playing back both &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABlu-Ray"&gt;Blu-Ray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AToshiba"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AHD%20DVD"&gt;HD DVD&lt;/a&gt; next-generation optical storage formats, if the two camps refuse to compromise on a single format. Assuming development is successful, consumers could expect to see such a device on store shelves next year.

Blu-Ray and HD DVD are projected to be the successor formats for current DVDs. Samsung, while leaning towards the Blu-Ray camp, hopes it can cover both bases by distributing a player with dual-compatibility. While this means spending more in development to unify the two technologies and develop a cost-effective production method, dual compatibility may pay off for the company if the formats challenge each other as &lt;a href="w%3AVHS"&gt;VHS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABetamax"&gt;Betamax&lt;/a&gt; did &lt;a href="w%3AVideotape%20format%20war"&gt;twenty-five years ago&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the support for Blu-Ray, Samsung has also been supportive of a unified standard to avoid such costly competition.

HD DVD offers single layer capacity of 15GB, more than triple the size of standard single layer DVDs, and benefits from similarities with current DVDs, such as cheap production and compatibility with current DVD players. Blu-Ray can hold 23GB on its smallest single layer version, and is reported to have superior durability and interactivity over current DVD-based technology and HD-DVD. HD-DVD is currently promoted by Toshiba, &lt;a href="w%3ANEC%20Corporation"&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASanyo"&gt;Sanyo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;; while Blu-Ray's base of support is the &lt;a href="w%3ABlu-ray%20Disc%20Association"&gt;Blu-Ray Disc Association&lt;/a&gt;, which is led by Blu-Ray developers Sony and &lt;a href="w%3APhilips"&gt;Philips&lt;/a&gt;. It is notable that Sony and Philips, who developed the Blu-Ray format, also competed against the Toshiba-designed SuperDisc DVD standard, which is the standard that is followed today.

The first Blu-Ray and HD DVD products are expected to start appearing in mainstream markets within the next year.

<h1>US FEMA aid site only supports Windows with Internet Explorer</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20FEMA%20aid%20site%20only%20supports%20Windows%20with%20Internet%20Explorer&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFEMA"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)&lt;/a&gt; website (for requesting disaster aid) is only functional for applicants using the latest version of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; web browser on the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; operating system. Users with other web browsers, such as &lt;a href="w%3ANetscape"&gt;Netscape&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOpera%20%28web%20browser%29"&gt;Opera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASafari%20%28web%20browser%29"&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFirefox"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, or operating systems other than Windows, are effectively screened out of the site, which gives them a message that they need to download Internet Explorer version 6 or call FEMA at 1-800-621-3362 to register. 

Relief workers are setting up many computer kiosks for evacuees to use. These kiosks are built from donated computers, many of which are unable to run Windows and/or Internet Explorer. Most of these kiosks use &lt;a href="w%3ALiveCD"&gt;LiveCD&lt;/a&gt; versions of Linux, leaving evacuees unable to fill out aid forms. 

A spokesperson for FEMA told ♡❤MSNBC♡❤ they were aware of the problem, and were trying to resolve the issue. They were, however, unable to provide an estimate of when the problem would be solved. Mike Quealy, a FEMA spokesperson, said the issue occurred because this tool was originally designed for in-house use by people working at the call center.

Telling the Opera web browser to spoof its &lt;a href="w%3Auser%20agent"&gt;user agent&lt;/a&gt;, by identifying itself as Internet Explorer, appears to trick the FEMA website into allowing the user to fill out the form. Firefox users can install the Prefbar extension (http://prefbar.mozdev.org/), and use the "User Agent Spoof" dropdown to achieve the same effect. Safari users can use the Debug drop-down menu (http://developer.apple.com/internet/safari/faq.html#anchor14), and use the "User Agent" option to achieve the same effect. Other options are to run Windows and Internet Explorer in an emulator such as &lt;a href="w%3AVirtualPC"&gt;VirtualPC&lt;/a&gt; on the Mac or &lt;a href="w%3AVMware"&gt;VMware&lt;/a&gt; on Linux. This option is slow and requires the user to already own or purchase a license for Windows and the emulator software. Purchasing the software can cost several hundred dollars. Implementing a software compatibility layer, like the GPL &lt;a href="w%3Awine%20%28software%29"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; project, allows the user to run certain Windows software on Linux, but still requires valid licenses for Windows.

<h1>Death of candidate will delay final results for German federal election by weeks</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Death%20of%20candidate%20will%20delay%20final%20results%20for%20German%20federal%20election%20by%20weeks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The death of a candidate for the &lt;a href="w%3ABundestag"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt; could delay the final outcome of the &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20federal%20election%2C%202005"&gt;German federal election&lt;/a&gt; by several weeks.

The 43-year old Kerstin Lorenz, of the far right &lt;a href="w%3ANPD"&gt;NPD&lt;/a&gt;, suffered a &lt;a href="w%3ACerebrovascular%20accident"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; during a campaign appearance on Monday and slid into a coma. She died on Wednesday in the hospital.

The NPD must now nominate a new candidate for the constituency of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADresden"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt; I♡❤ and election officials have to reprint hundreds of thousands of ballot papers. Also, the vote of anyone who already sent in their absentee ballot will be declared invalid, and these voters need new ballots as well. The leading election official for the state of &lt;a href="w%3ASaxonia"&gt;Saxonia&lt;/a&gt;, Irene Schneider-Böttcher, said it would be impossible to achieve all that was required within the time remaining before election day, September 18th. She ordered a by-election for the 2nd of October.

If the election results are extremely close, the outstanding Dresden I by-election result could potentially change the final outcome, which would leave Germany in uncertainty. While Dresden I is only one out of 299 constituencies, it could ultimately decide who will govern the country for the next few years.

The projected majority of the opposition parties &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Germany%29"&gt;FDP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;CDU&lt;/a&gt;, which headed the polls for months, is shrinking with current government parties &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20%2790/The%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;SPD&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href="w%3AParty%20of%20the%20Left"&gt;Party of the Left&lt;/a&gt;, getting closer by the day.

Some constitutional lawyers have also raised concerns if it would be legal to announce any results at all on September 18th. They argue that in the case of a close result, the voters in Dresden would realize that they will be the one to decide the election, which could shift their votes. And on the other side, if the race is already over, they might decide to stay at home.

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; announced today, September 8, that they have hired &lt;a href="w%3AVint%20Cerf"&gt;Vinton Cerf&lt;/a&gt;, to serve as the Chief Internet Evangelist. He is often referred to as the "father of the Internet". While working at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADARPA"&gt;Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)&lt;/a&gt; he played an important role in the development of the Internet. At DARPA he co-designed the &lt;a href="w%3ATCP/IP"&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACommunications%20protocol"&gt;protocol&lt;/a&gt;, on which the Internet runs.

Google CEO &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Schmidt"&gt;Eric Schmidt&lt;/a&gt; said "Cerf is clearly one of the great technology leaders of our time”. Cerf has been awarded the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Medal%20of%20Technology"&gt;National Medal of Technology&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20of%20Asturias%20Awards"&gt;Premio Principe de Asturias de Investigacion Cientifica&lt;/a&gt;, or the Prince of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research. &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20Magazine"&gt;People Magazine&lt;/a&gt; listed Cerf as one the "25 Most Intriguing People" in 1994. In early 2005 Cerf was included among the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociation%20for%20Computing%20Machinery"&gt;Association for Computing Machinery&lt;/a&gt; (ACM) 2004 &lt;a href="w%3ATuring%20Award"&gt;Turing Award&lt;/a&gt; winners. The Turing Award is considered one of the most prestigious computing awards.

Cerf, aged 62, is currently working on developing a new set of planet-to-planet communications protocols for &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to being hired by Google, he worked for &lt;a href="w%3AMCI"&gt;MCI&lt;/a&gt;, where he led the development of MCI Mail. MCI Mail was the first commercial e-mail service to connect to the Internet. Cerf also serves as the Chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Corporation%20for%20Assigned%20Names%20and%20Numbers"&gt;Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers&lt;/a&gt; (ICANN), a role he plans to continue.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACrude%20oil"&gt;Crude oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; prices fell by $0.32, to $63.95 a barrel, after a report showed lower than expected losses in oil supplies due to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

According to a report published by the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Energy"&gt;Department of Energy (DOE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , crude oil stocks declined by 6.5 million, to 315 million barrels. The department also announced that 57% of the production capacity in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is still down, versus 97% the day after the storm.

The DOE said it expected that production would not return to normal until December.

Yesterday, economists warned that one of the impacts of Katrina on the US economy would be a reduction in the number of jobs by up to 400,000. They also said the country's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGross%20Domestic%20Product"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in the second half of 2005, could be 1% less than expected, due to the surge in oil prices.

The Executive Director of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IEA), Claude Mandil, announced a collective action by members of the 26 nation agency. An agreement was reached to supply an additional 60 million barrels to the market over the next 30 days. The biggest contribution of total response comes from North America (52%), then by Europe (30%), and finally the Pacific region (18%). The share of these increases is based upon of the consumption from each of the IEA member areas.

In one of the most shocking changes in No. 1 in Hot 100 history, rapper &lt;a href="w%3AKanye%20West"&gt;Kanye West&lt;/a&gt;, who has been in the news this week because of his &lt;a href="Rapper%20Kanye%20West%20denounces%20Bush%20response%2C%20American%20media%20at%20hurricane%20relief%20telethon"&gt;controversial views&lt;/a&gt; on the federal government’s reaction to the relief efforts of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, received a surge of radio airplay in the pop mainstream radio markets and topped the &lt;a href="w%3ABillboard%20Hot%20100"&gt;Billboard Hot 100&lt;/a&gt; for the second time in his career as a performer. 

His “&lt;a href="w%3AGold%20Digger"&gt;Gold Digger&lt;/a&gt;” featuring &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Foxx"&gt;Jamie Foxx&lt;/a&gt; vaulted 19-1 on the chart, ending &lt;a href="w%3AMariah%20Carey"&gt;Mariah Carey&lt;/a&gt;’s 14 non-consecutive week reign with “&lt;a href="w%3AWe%20Belong%20Together"&gt;We Belong Together&lt;/a&gt;”. “Together” drops to No. 4 on the Hot 100. 

The 19-1 rally makes it the fifth biggest gain to No. 1 in Hot 100 history. The song also gains a record 94-2 on Billboard’s &lt;a href="w%3APop%20100"&gt;Pop 100&lt;/a&gt; chart kept out of the No. 1 on that chart by the Pussycat Dolls with “Don’t Cha”.

Mariah Carey is still No. 2 with “Shake It Off”. “Shake” was widely expected to gain to the Hot 100 pole position this week. Mariah Carey was No. 1 all summer with “Together” dethroned only once before by American Idol winner &lt;a href="w%3ACarrie%20Underwood"&gt;Carrie Underwood&lt;/a&gt; with “Inside Your Heaven” on the July 2 chart.

&lt;a href="w%3AMissy%20Elliott"&gt;Missy Elliott&lt;/a&gt;’s “Lose Control” featuring &lt;a href="w%3ACiara"&gt;Ciara&lt;/a&gt; and Fat Man Scoop gained 5-3 while “Don’t Cha” dropped to No. 5.

Bow Wow’s “Like You” featuring Ciara gained 7-6 trading places with Rhianna’s “Pon de Replay”. The only other song gaining into the top-10 is Fall Out Boy’s “Sugar, We’re Going Down” rising 12-8. Bow Wow’s “Let Me Hold You” featuring Omarion fell 5-9 and Lifehouse’s “You and Me” rounded out the top-10 with a two position dip.

An &lt;a href="w%3Aair%20strike"&gt;air strike&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20of%20the%20willing"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt; aircraft destroyed a house in the city of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Jaramil"&gt;al-Jaramil&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3Awestern%20Iraq"&gt;western Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The house was believed to have been used by the &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; terrorist organization as a safe house. A man, identified as Abu Ali and believed by coalition forces officials to be a &lt;a href="w%3Aforeign%20fighter"&gt;foreign fighter&lt;/a&gt; facilitator was believed to have been killed in the attack.

According to officials, Ali was linked to other facilitators in the towns of &lt;a href="w%3AH%C4%ABt"&gt;Hīt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Qaim"&gt;al-Qaim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKarabila"&gt;Karabila&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHusayba"&gt;Husayba&lt;/a&gt; as well as having connections to the &lt;a href="w%3AMosul"&gt;Mosul&lt;/a&gt; area, including an individual that was captured in June and another killed last month. He was also said have had links to &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, where he reportedly recruited most of his foreign fighters.

It's believed that he brought the foreign fighters into &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, where they were dispatched to various insurgent groups operating in the country and carried out attacks against Iraqi civilians, &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Security%20Forces"&gt;Iraqi Security Forces&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20of%20the%20willing"&gt;Coalition forces&lt;/a&gt;.

Secondary explosions were reported by the pilots of the aircraft, indicating that the house also contained a &lt;a href="w%3AWeapons%20cache"&gt;cache&lt;/a&gt; of weapons.

The munitions used were selected to reduce the risk to civilians in the area, according to the US &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;.

Workers are scouring &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; for any remaining survivors of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, and are vigorously searching for dead bodies. 25,000 body bags have been prepared in advance, in the event that the death toll from Katrina is that high. Temporary warehouses are being set up around the city to deal with corpse storage.

In the last twenty-four to thirty-six hours, however, officials have revised downward, at least three times, the estimated death toll; 35,000, 10,000, and now less than 10,000. After the first sweep of the city devoted to recovery of bodies, officials retrieved approximately 800 bodies. 

Floodwaters are receding, but leaving a great deal of mud and contaminated water in their wake, filled with high levels of bacteria and viruses. 

All survivors are urged to leave the city. Dr. Julie Gerberding, head of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, said "If you haven't left the city yet, you must do so," and stated that anyone who comes in contact with the toxic water must immediately wash themselves with clean water. If necessary, force will be used to remove all remaining citizens from New Orleans. 

While Dr. Gerberding's statement about mandatory evacuation seems clear, other officials have not been as emphatic. When asked about mandatory evacuations, New Orleans Police Superintendent Eddie Compass, while reaffirming the official word, qualified his statement stating that every reasonable means would be used to logically convince a person that it is in his best interest to evacuate. The superintendent would not comment on whether force would be used if reason failed. Furthermore, utility workers are in the process of re-establishing power to the Central Business District of the city prompting residents in those areas to reconsider the evacuation option.

Animal rights campaigners are protesting against evidence that law enforcement officers are killing animals as a form of control. According to &lt;a href="http%3A//www.helpinganimals.com/f-latestnews0909am.asp%3Fc%3Dha_kat_net"&gt;HelpingAnimals.com&lt;/a&gt;, pets left behind by evacuees are being shot.

Residents of Jefferson Parish, and the upper portions of Saint Bernard Parish will be allowed to return permanently to their homes starting on Monday. Conditions in those areas &amp;mdash; re-establishment of power, clearing of roads, and abatement of water &amp;mdash; have improved to the point of making permanent return possible. Parish President Arron Broussard and Councilor Jennifer Sneed stated that residents should be allowed to return as soon as possible so repairs and rebuilding may begin. 

Companies are working with the US &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; to provide money and support to the victims of Katrina, in order to ease them into a new life. In addition, a contract for approximately thirty-three million dollars to repair the I-10 span crossing the eastern portion of Lake Pontchartrain has been awarded. Many of the bridge sections, especially on the eastern-facing span, were knocked off their pilings as hurricane Katrina passed close to the city. The contractor expects one span to be repaired and opened for traffic within forty-five days.

&lt;a href="w%3ATajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt; will now protect their border unaided by &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, as Pyandzh unit border guards leave the area. The guards continued to protect part of the Tajik-Afghan border until September 1, having begun in a 1993 intergovernmental agreement.

Russian Border Service deputy Lt. Gen. Viktor Trufanov told Interfax newswire: "The last sector of the Afghan-Tajik border under the control of the Pyandzh unit of Russian border guards was transferred to our Tajik colleagues on September 1 in conformity with the intergovernmental agreement." 

This week, expert Russian border guard officers and tacticians have met with the Tajik State Border Committee, in order to assist in the turnover, according to chief of the border command Major-General Nikolai Kasharin.

Since Russia took over border control duties in 1993, ♡❤China View♡❤ reports that 40,000 Tajik citizens have been trained by the guards, in anticipation of the handover.

Tajikistan is a prime route for illegal drugs from &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, which is the world's top &lt;a href="w%3Aopium"&gt;opium&lt;/a&gt; producer. Drug interdiction and stopping the transport of arms are both high on the list of border guard priorities.

There were angry scenes, today, at Harris Park train station in the western suburbs of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, when the 9:12am train to the city stopped at the platform but didn't open its doors. The train stood at the station for about sixty seconds before moving off, leaving about seventy potential passengers standing on the platform.

"The guard looked at me and laughed," said one commuter. Some passengers became very angry, yelling at the station attendant and cursing &lt;a href="w%3ACityRail"&gt;CityRail&lt;/a&gt;. "The rail system is a bloody joke!" another commuter yelled. 

The station attendant arranged for one of the &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20railway%20line%2C%20Sydney"&gt;Western Line&lt;/a&gt; express services to stop at Harris Park, which satisfied commuters who, by this time, had started to demand their money back. However, some Harris Park passengers may have been inconvenienced because the train they were forced to catch did not stop at all stations. The next all-stations train was scheduled to arrive half an hour later. 

CityRail has stated that the doors were not opened by the train guard because of confusion over the timetable. The train was carrying a guard trainer and a trainee guard. According to a CityRail spokeswoman, they were not aware that the train was going to be stopping at Harris Park.

"The fault is with the guard and they have been disciplined accordingly," the spokeswoman said. 

When questioned about reports of the guard laughing at passengers on the platform, the spokeswoman said that she had no information that this had occurred. She said that it was possible that the guards did not even realise that they were stopped at a station. Video footage from the station was used during the investigation. 

Many commuters have expressed their dissatisfaction at the state of the rail network for some time, with many writing to major Sydney newspapers. As a result, timetable changes have been implemented by CityRail and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; state government, justifying the changes as being necessary to improve safety and reliability. The new CityRail timetable, which commenced on September 1, resulted in a decreased service from Harris Park. There are now only two city trains departing between 8am and 9am, down from the previous four - the next train from that station to arrive after 9:12am is at 9:42am.

Online &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US-based&lt;/a&gt; auction company &lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; is in talks to acquire &lt;a href="w%3AVoIP"&gt;Voice-over-IP (VoIP)&lt;/a&gt; provider &lt;a href="Skype"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; for US$5 billion. Many believe that eBay intends to enter the rapidly expanding VoIP market and give recent entrants, &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, a run for their money.

The speculation that eBay may buy the small &lt;a href="Luxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;-based company sent their shares down four percent on Wall Street.

Last month, &lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, was in talks with Skype to possibly buy the company. The talks ended when Skype said the company was not for sale.

VoIP is becoming an increasingly significant threat to traditional telephone companies, since most calls between computers are free and some users wonder why a separate land line is still needed.

Skype was founded by the creators of the &lt;a href="w%3AP2P"&gt;P2P&lt;/a&gt; file-sharing program &lt;a href="w%3AKaZaA"&gt;KaZaA&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AViktor%20Yushchenko"&gt;Viktor Yushchenko&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Ukraine"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; announced the dismissal of his government Thursday, under accusations of graft and political infighting. Amongst those dismissed was &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Ukraine"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AYulia%20Tymoshenko"&gt;Yulia Tymoshenko&lt;/a&gt;.

Yushchenko, who won the Presidency almost one year ago, in what became known worldwide as the "&lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20Revolution"&gt;Orange Revolution&lt;/a&gt;" had vowed to stamp out the corruption that was widespread under &lt;a href="w%3ALeonid%20Kuchma"&gt;Leonid Kuchma&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the dismissed officials took part in the revolution that swept the popular Yushchenko into power.

Yushchenko announced that &lt;a href="w%3AYuriy%20Yekhanurov"&gt;Yuriy Yekhanurov&lt;/a&gt;, governor of the &lt;a href="w%3ADnipropetrovsk"&gt;Dnipropetrovsk&lt;/a&gt; province would replace Tymoshenko, as PM and form a new government. He also claimed that he wanted to give a fresh start to an administration that he said failed to meet the high expectations of supporters.

According to Yushchenko, the dismissed officials "...remain my friends. It is very difficult but today I must remove this Gordian knot," criticising the dismissed officials for lack of team spirit.

It is hoped by analysts that the &lt;a href="w%3Atecnocrat"&gt;technocratic&lt;/a&gt; Yekhanurov would help strengthen the country's &lt;a href="w%3AEconomy%20of%20Ukraine"&gt;economy&lt;/a&gt;, which has suffered recently from a sharp downturn and &lt;a href="w%3Ainflation"&gt;inflation&lt;/a&gt;.

The move is seen as leading to a possible standoff between the President and his dismissed Prime Minister in the upcoming 2006 parliamentary elections, as Tymoshenko is both a powerful political figure and leads her own &lt;a href="w%3AYulia%20Tymoshenko%20Electoral%20Bloc"&gt;party alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Tymoshenko had a notable role within the Orange Revolution as a public speaker whose speeches brought thousands of supporters to the Yushchenko camp, in a revolution that caught the world's attention. She was recently named the third most powerful woman in the world, behind such major political figures as &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWu%20Yi"&gt;Wu Yi&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;.

There had been noted friction between the President and Prime Minister in recent months, largely over the country's economy. The friction ultimately led the resignation of Yushchenko's chief of staff, who cited deep corruption within the administration. This friction may make it difficult for Yekhanurov to be confirmed by the parliament, in which the Pro-Yushchenko groups do not control a majority.

According to the Ukrainian Constitution, special elections to the &lt;a href="w%3AVerkhovna%20Rada"&gt;Verkhovna Rada&lt;/a&gt; (Ukrainian parliament) can be called by the President to be held within sixty days of the initial call. As of yet, with the March elections around the corner, there appears to be no indication that Yushchenko will be calling for special elections. 

International response has been mostly similar, with Russian &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Russia"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and Ukraine's neighbor, &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; downplaying the dismissals as being of no cause for alarm.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
After Category 4 storm ♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡ slammed into New Orleans, on the night before August 29, 2005, several flood control constructions failed. Much of the city flooded through the openings. One of these was the flood wall forming one side of the 17th Street Canal, near Lake Pontchartrain. The ♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers"&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (USACE)♡❤♡ is the primary agency for engineering support during such emergencies. A USACE team was assessing the situation in New Orleans on the 29th, water flow was stopped September 2nd, and the breach was closed on September 5th.

<h2>Background</h2>
The breaches that occurred on the levees surrounding New Orleans were located on the 17th Street Canal Levee and London Avenue Canal Levee. The floodwall atop the canal levee was one foot wide at the top and widened to two feet at the base. The visible portion is a concrete cap on steel sheet pile that anchors to the wall. Sheet piles are interlocked steel columns, in this case at least 30 feet long, with 6 to 10 feet visible above ground.

Another breach was on a levee by Industrial Canal, which flooded the east side of the city during the storm.

The 17th Street Canal Levees and London Avenue Canal Levees were completed segments of the Lake Ponchartrain and Vicinity Hurricane Protection Project. Although other portions of the Lake Ponchartrain project are pending, these two segments were complete, and no modifications or improvements to these segments were pending, proposed, or remained unfunded.

The Corps was authorized by Congress to do a reconnaissance study back in 1999 to provide Category 4 or 5 protection. Money was received in 2000 and the reconnaissance study was completed in 2002, which indicated there was a federal interest in proceeding with the feasibility study. Preparation for that study is still underway, and involves issues such as environmental impacts, economics, and the engineering design of the project itself. The feasibility study was scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2006. It may take six years to complete, and there was nothing that could have been done to get this level of protection in place before this storm hit.

Within the city there are 13 subbasins, some of which became flooded. There are existing pumping stations to remove water from the basins. Usually there is much less water to remove, and the level became too high for some pumping stations to continue operation.

<h2>August 27: Before the storm</h2>
One of the services of the USACE is planning, designing, building and operating dams and other civil engineering projects. It has been deeply involved in creating the navigation waterways and flood control constructions around New Orleans, although construction and operation involves various levels of state and local involvement. The Corps is well suited toward emergency activities due to its combination of engineering expertise and being a component of the nation's military forces. Assigned by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the primary agency for Public Works and Engineering support, USACE supports &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;FEMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during disasters.

On Saturday, August 27, while Katrina was a Category 3 storm gathering strength in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, USACE's Mississippi Valley Division was preparing and posturing elements from as far as Hawaii. Anticipating the possibility of a Category 5 storm placing water in New Orleans, preparations began for un-watering operations.

<h2>August 29: Day of the storm</h2>

USACE District Engineer, Col. Richard Wagenaar, and a team worked out of an emergency operations shelter in New Orleans. Other teams waited in the storm's path across the Gulf coast. Corps employees assessed the situation at the 17th Street Canal floodwall that was breached overnight. Corps engineers believed that water over-topped the floodwall, scoured behind the wall, and caused it to collapse. A second breach was known to have occurred on the Industrial Canal during the storm. 
The Corps worked with the U.S. Coast Guard, Army National Guard and other state and federal authorities to bring in all assets available to expedite the process. "We're attempting to contract for materials, such as rock, super sand bags, cranes, etc., and also for modes of transportation ­ like barges and helicopters, to close the gap and stop the flow of water from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Pontchartrain"&gt;Lake Pontchartrain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; into the city," said Walter Baumy, Engineering Division chief and project manager for closing the breach.

Planning for repairs involved the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, the East Jefferson Levee District and Orleans Levee District, to locate materials and access to the breach
area.

The New Orleans District's 350 miles of hurricane levee had been built to withstand a fast-moving Category 3 storm. The fact that Katrina, a category 4-plus hurricane, didn't cause more damage is considered a testament to the structural integrity of the hurricane levee protection system.

<h2>August 30: Flood</h2>

At 2 or 3 AM, Corps officials got a telephone report of a suspected 17th Street Canal breach.

Flooding had begun slowly, but the second disaster appeared as water poured in even as the winds abated. Storm surge and rainfall had raised the level of Lake Pontchartrain, providing an enormous amount of water which poured into the city. By the end of the day much of the city was under as much as 20 feet of water.

Plans were made to begin levee work, including use of 3,000-pound sand bags on the 17 Street Canal. Army National Guard helicopters are expected to begin assisting in the operation August 31.

<h2>August 31: Recovery begins</h2>

The breach at the 17th Street Canal Levee, a levee-floodwall combination, is about 300 feet long. It's believed that the force of the water overtopped the floodwall and scoured the structure from behind and then moved the levee wall horizontally about 20 feet, opening both ends to flow.

State Transportation workers began building a road toward the breach with available equipment.

The Corps released two contracts to close the breach in the 17th Street Canal. The 3,000 pound sandbag operation at the 17th Street Canal was postponed early in the day when U.S. Army &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACH-47%20Chinook"&gt;Chinook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; helicopters were diverted for rescue missions. The Corps continued to coordinate with Army officials to have helicopters assist in placement of sandbags at the breaches. The 3,000 pound sandbags are each about 3 feet square.

Corps officials worked with Orleans Parish and Louisiana Department of Transportation officials and Boh Brothers Construction Company, headquartered in New Orleans, to place piling at the lakefront to stop flow in the 17th Street Canal. This would stabilize the water flow and allow work on the levee, while also helping to stabilize the rest of the levee system.

Along with local and state officials, the Corps contracted to build access roads to the breach sites and to fill in the breaches. Rock/stone/crushed concrete would be hauled by truck for road construction and to repair the breaches. One plan called for building an access road from Hammond Highway to the 17th Street breach, and then southward to the end of the breach. The road would have to be built to safely permit backing and dumping of heavy materials.

<h2>September 1: Construction</h2>
Lake Pontchartrain was almost back to normal levels, so little water flowed out of the city. This allows a change of plans, and marine equipment was used to drive sheet piling at the mouth of the 17th Street Canal to seal off the entire canal from the lake.

Shortly after 1 PM the first piece sheet piling is driven, to form a steel wall across the lake's entrance to the 17th Street canal. The opening was expected to be closed by the end of the day. A contractor began bringing in rock to build a road toward the breach. The breach was south and east of the Hammond Highway bridge over the canal, with dry land on the west side of the bridge.

Rock was being transported from offsite to complete the access road and closure at the 17th Street breach. Once the rock required to build the roads arrived in New Orleans and the access road to the breach has been completed, the Corps estimated closure of the breach could be completed in three to four days. Several private firms have volunteered services and provided assistance in design of the closure.

The 17th Street Canal Levee, a levee-floodwall combination, was now estimated to have a breach 450 feet long. It was still believed water overtopped the floodwall, scoured the structure, and then moved the structure 20 feet horizontally.

<h2>September 2: Water flow stopped</h2>

On east side of the 17th Street Canal, closure by sheet piling of the 200-foot-wide canal was done after the Corps was confident that the lake had fallen to a normal level and water was not trapped inside the city that would otherwise drain out by gravity.

♡❤♡♡❤Water could no longer flow from the lake into the city.♡❤♡♡❤

With the mouth of the canal sealed, the sheet piling prevented lake water from getting to the levee breach. Since no additional water can get through the breach it was no longer necessary to seal the breach itself. The next step is to get existing pumps working, and to bring in additional pumps to drain the surrounding city and the canal. Later, the canal can be drained so permanent repairs will be made to the levee.

Helicopters were dropping large sandbags made of strong, synthetic materials in the breach. Heavy equipment on the ground has been placing rock. Ground access was created by building a rock road from Hammond Highway, which is about 700 feet lake-ward of the breach. The 17th Street Canal is a drainage canal whose dimensions and an important bridge, integral to the flood control system, would not permit entry of barges and towboats to haul rocks and placement cranes.

<h2>September 3</h2>

<h2>September 4: Almost done</h2>
Work continued on the breach. The sheet piling still blocks water from flowing in.

<h2>September 5: Breach closed</h2>

17th Street Canal breach was closed. After the emergency is over, the canal will be drained and the wall repaired.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUH-60%20Black%20Hawk"&gt;Blackhawk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Chinook helicopters had dropped over 200 sand bags.
Approximately 125 sandbags had broken the surface of the water.

There were three 42" mobile pumps staged and two 42" and two 30" pumps were placed at the sheet pile closure. Sewer &amp; water board, electric utility and 249th Prime Power Engineer Battalion were completing pump house inspection.

When pumps began operation, a 40-foot-wide opening was made in the sheet piling to allow water to flow out the canal.

<h2>September 6: Pumping and moving on</h2>

The pump stations began to get online on 17th Street Canal. Pump Station 10 was actually pumping at
this point. Pump Station 6 was interrupted to clean up some debris out of the area.

Due to a growing &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHispanic"&gt;Hispanic&lt;/a&gt; population, the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;American Broadcasting Company (ABC)&lt;/a&gt; announced that all primetime shows in their upcoming lineup will be closed captioned in both English and Spanish. In addition, four of the shows, as well as many theatrically-released films and other specials, will be dubbed in Spanish.

The move was a major one for ABC. Previously, only the Hispanic comedy ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20George%20Lopez%20Show"&gt;The George Lopez Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was captioned and dubbed in Spanish. "We wanted to move beyond toe-dipping and really dive in," said Stephen McPherson, ABC entertainment chief. "Almost half of the 41 million Hispanics in this country watch only or mostly Spanish-language television, and we want to bring that audience to ABC."

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Asecond%20audio%20program"&gt;SAP&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ function allows an optional second audio transmission, which may be used for transmitting programs in Spanish. However, the additional costs of hiring voice actors to provide Spanish dialogue, as well as production costs, have been prohibitive for most networks. McPherson said that while it was "not inexpensive", having Spanish-speaking viewership could yield a significant benefit.

♡❤George Lopez♡❤ will continue to air, dubbed in Spanish. In addition, two of the network's most popular shows, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADesperate%20Housewives"&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALost%20%282004%20television%20series%29"&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt;,♡❤ as well as the new comedy ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFreddie"&gt;Freddie&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, will be dubbed; Spanish voice actors are currently being cast for the roles.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; have called upon member states to donate US$88m to fight hunger in &lt;a href="w%3AMalawi"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt;. So far, not a single country responded.

U.N &lt;a href="w%3AUnder-Secretary-General%20for%20Humanitarian%20Affairs%20and%20Emergency%20Relief%20Coordinator"&gt;Emergency Relief Coordinator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Egeland"&gt;Jan Egeland&lt;/a&gt; launched an appeal ten days ago and especially called upon nations in the &lt;a href="w%3APersian%20Gulf"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt;, who are benefiting from the current high oil prices, to donate. "There are many countries in the Gulf and elsewhere who have received an enormous windfall from these oil prices. We can save a life for a $1 a day", Egeland said.

Malawi is one the poorest countries in the world. The majority of the population live on less than one US dollar a day. Four million people out of a population of ten million face hunger every single day.

The domestic production of &lt;a href="w%3Amaize"&gt;maize&lt;/a&gt; has plunged to 1.3 million tons, only half of what is needed to feed the population. The prices on the other hand have increased by 50%, making it even harder for the affected people.

&lt;a href="w%3AOxfam"&gt;Oxfam&lt;/a&gt; estimates that in the entire &lt;a href="w%3Asouthern%20Africa"&gt;southern Africa&lt;/a&gt; region, about 10 million people would face serious food shortages later this year if the developed countries don't act quickly. &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; is also a major problem for southern Africa with the infection rate being as high as 40% of the adult population.

The &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Secretary of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chertoff"&gt;Michael Chertoff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , announced from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;Baton Rouge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Coast%20Guard"&gt;Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Vice Admiral &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThad%20W.%20Allen"&gt;Thad W. Allen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will replace the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFEMA"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (FEMA) director &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20D.%20Brown"&gt;Michael D. Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the Principal Federal Official (PFO) for the recovery effort; however, Mr. Brown will continue as the Director of FEMA.

Admiral Allen was given the assignment of special deputy to Mr. Brown earlier this week. Secretary Chertoff now describes Allen as, "the Principal Federal Official overseeing the Hurricane Katrina response and recovery effort in the field." 

Mr. Brown, who came under intense pressure for government failures to provide timely assistance to disaster victims of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was ordered back to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and relieved of his duties in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20States%20%28US%29"&gt;Gulf States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . His immediate FEMA role now will be for its national administration. The personnel change results in FEMA's local effort now being headed-up by military leadership, instead of civilian. However, Admiral Allen's Deputy (the number two federal offiicial in the field) is a civilian.
The Coast Guard came under the homeland's security umbrella in 2003. Allen, a career Coast Guard officer, was in charge of its Atlantic forces fleet during the terrorist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; attack in New York City in 2001. 
Mr. Brown, who was hailed last week by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , "Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job," was nominated by Bush himself to head FEMA in 2003. Recent allegations that credentials Brown listed on his resume prior to employment at FEMA, which began in 2001, that said he worked in emergency services for the city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdmond%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Edmond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;OK&lt;/a&gt; from 1975 to 1978, along with being awarded "Outstanding Political Science Professor" at the Central State University in Oklahoma, both have come under fire in a report by ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATIME%20%20magazine"&gt;TIME&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ magazine two days ago. Critics question how thorough the White House was in its vetting Brown for the FEMA assignment.

When commenting about Mr. Brown last Friday, Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMary%20L.%20Landrieu"&gt;Mary L. Landrieu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who spent more than a week in the hurricane struck area, said "I have been telling him from the moment he arrived about the urgency of the situation" and "I just have to tell you that he had a difficult time understanding the enormity of the task before us."

Law enforcement authorities in New Orleans are confiscating firearms, sources in the city say. The confiscations come after a wave of gun violence swept over the flood-ravaged city, with looters shooting at other refugees, police and military authorties, rescuers, and even hospital personnel.

"Only law enforcement are allowed to have weapons," said police superintendent P. Edwin Compass III. And although this is being enforced, private guards with permits are being allowed to keep their firearms.

Blogger Michael Barnett, who is manning a New Orleans &lt;a href="w%3Adatacenter"&gt;datacenter&lt;/a&gt;, said he would turn in his weapons if authorities came for them. "I'm not gonna die on the 10th floor of this building to enforce my right to keep and bear arms."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Firefox%201.5%20beta%20released%20to%20public&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A beta release of the next major version of the &lt;a href="w%3AMozilla%20Foundation"&gt;Mozilla Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Aweb%20browser"&gt;web browser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFirefox"&gt;Firefox 1.5&lt;/a&gt; (formerly called "Deer Park", the codename for Firefox 1.5), is now available for download.

<h2>New features</h2>

New or improved features cited by the company:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Quicker navigation
BULLET::::- Drag-and-drop reordering of browser tabs
BULLET::::- New design for the options panel
BULLET::::- Support for new standards like &lt;a href="w%3ASVG"&gt;SVG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACSS%202"&gt;CSS 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACSS%203"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJavaScript"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; 1.6
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ARSS%20%28file%20format%29"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; discovery
BULLET::::- Error pages, instead of dialogs.

</ul>
Many current and potential security issues have been fixed and the new version offers a more secure "Safe Mode". Privacy improvements include a "Clear Private Data" feature. The browser's pop-up blocker now prevents &lt;a href="w%3AMacromedia"&gt;Macromedia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMacromedia%20Flash"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt; from creating &lt;a href="w%3Apopup%20advertising"&gt;pop-up ads&lt;/a&gt;.

After updating to 1.5, further updates should be easier, as users can use the program's new "Software Update", which now can download binary patches, which are much smaller than the complete install programs used in the past.

<h2>Availability</h2>

Most &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS%20X"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; (10.2 and up) users will now be able to copy their settings from &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;'s own browser, Safari, and market leader &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; and most version of &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; are supported, as before.

<h2>Further release</h2>

As beta software, Firefox 1.5b1 is primarily for testing and checking to ensure no major bugs exist. Mozilla intends to release a second beta version (1.5b2) before the final, stable public version (1.5).

<h2>New version compatibility and beta related problems</h2>

With the upgrade to Firefox 1.5 (beta) from 1.06, many of the plugins supported by 1.0+ will be disabled.

<h2>A note on version numbers</h2>

1.5 will supplant the current 1.0.7 as the most up-to-date version of Firefox. 1.5 was originally to be numbered 1.1, but after significant changes were made, beyond the intended roadmap, the version number was changed.

<h2>Response</h2>

Chris Beard, head of products and marketing at Mozilla, told TechWorld "We've had a pretty successful year following the launch of Firefox 1.0 and we're continuing to see very strong demand."

<h1>Report: Annan failed to fix Oil for Food program</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Report%3A%20Annan%20failed%20to%20fix%20Oil%20for%20Food%20program&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After a year-long investigation, a committee has found that &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, head of the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, failed to halt corruption in the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AOil%20for%20Food"&gt;Oil for Food&lt;/a&gt; program, which was supposed to provide food to impoverished &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; citizens. 

According to &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3APaul%20Volcker"&gt;Paul Volcker&lt;/a&gt;, head of the Independent Inquiry Committee, "Our assignment has been to look for mis-or mal-administration in the oil-for-food program and for evidence of corruption within the UN organization and by contractors. Unhappily, we found both." 

The report emphasized that Annan knowingly allowed &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; to continue making huge unethical profits off of the program.

While Annan acknowledged that there was blame to pass around, he stated that "None of us -- member states, Secretariat, agencies, funds and programs -- can be proud of what it has found." Annan also says that he was at least partly at fault for the corruption; "The report is critical of me personally, and I accept its criticism."

On a lighter note, while the report is critical of Annan, it also says that the Oil for Food program did help get food to many Iraqis.

A look at some of the movies set to be released in North America, the week of 9 September, 2005.

Note, "fresh" or "rotten" refer to the movie's &lt;a href="w%3ARotten%20Tomatoes"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; rating, based on North American critical reviews. The higher the percentage, the greater the percentage of critics that liked the movie.

<h2>♡❤The Exorcism of Emily Rose♡❤</h2>
Nineteen-year-old college student Emily Rose (played by &lt;a href="w%3AJennifer%20Carpenter"&gt;Jennifer Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;) was the victim of a demonic possession. The story follows the lawyer, Erin Bruner (&lt;a href="w%3ALaura%20Linney"&gt;Laura Linney&lt;/a&gt;) and her fight against the church and the priest named Father Richard Moore (&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Wilkinson"&gt;Tom Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt;) who performed the botched exorcism. According to the director, this may be the first ever courtroom horror film.

The film is loosely based on the actual events of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.movieweb.com/news/news.php%3Fid%3D8520%7CAnneliese"&gt;Michel&lt;/a&gt; in 1962. German director &lt;a href="w%3AHans-Christian%20Schmid"&gt;Hans-Christian Schmid&lt;/a&gt; is launching his own treatment of Anneliese Michel's story, ♡❤Requiem♡❤, around the same time in late 2005. His movie stays very close to the real-world events and is a drama rather than a horror film.

Released by Sony Pictures. Also stars &lt;a href="w%3ACampbell%20Scott"&gt;Campbell Scott&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AShohreh%20Aghdashloo"&gt;Shohreh Aghdashloo&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡44% approval♡❤♡ by North American film critics

<h2>♡❤The Man♡❤</h2>
An "on-the-take" federal agent turns up dead on the mean streets of Detroit, suspicions arise around street-wise agent Derrick Vann (played by &lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20L.%20Jackson"&gt;Samuel L. Jackson&lt;/a&gt;). Vann's given 24 hours to recover the stolen arms and find the cop killers, but he's about to stumble upon an unlikely ally. The affable, optimistic dental supply salesman Andy Fiddler (&lt;a href="w%3AEugene%20Levy"&gt;Eugene Levy&lt;/a&gt;) is pulled into the mix after a case of mistaken identity, and must help Vann complete the mission.

Released by New Line Cinema.

&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; destroyed their last remaining military facilities in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; today, leaving behind as few remnants of the occupation as possible. Soldiers placed explosives in the buildings, and watched as they were destroyed, sources say.

&lt;a href="w%3AShaul%20Mofaz"&gt;Shaul Mofaz&lt;/a&gt;, Israel's Defense Minister, expects the final pullout from Gaza to be completed by Monday or Tuesday. The remaining military troops in Gaza remain in military vehicles while waiting for the pullout.

It is being currently debated in the Israeli cabinet as to whether the synagogues will be demolished. The decision is expected to come on Sunday. According to Mofaz, "it is very hard for me to give the army orders to destroy and blow up Jewish synagogues." 

If the synagogues are to be destroyed, the pullout will be delayed a day, and the pullout will be completed on Tuesday. The last soldier to leave Gaza will be General Aviv Kochavi, who will lock the &lt;a href="w%3AKissufim"&gt;Kissufim&lt;/a&gt; gate in a symbolic event.

&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AFiat"&gt;Fiat&lt;/a&gt; Auto SPA and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AFord"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; Motor Co. announced they signed an agreement to cooperate in designing two small car models. This came only seven months after &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt; severed their relationship with Fiat.

Both companies plan to work together on a new version of the popular &lt;a href="w%3AFiat%20Cinquecento"&gt;Fiat Cinquecento&lt;/a&gt; and on a replacement for the &lt;a href="w%3AFord%20Ka"&gt;Ford Ka&lt;/a&gt;, both to be based on the &lt;a href="w%3AFiat%20Panda"&gt;Fiat Panda&lt;/a&gt; platform.

The cooperation can help reduce the companies' small car production costs and ease financial difficulties they are facing. Ford is struggling with high labor and health care costs, while Fiat suffers from its unprofitable Italian plants.

After the deal was announced, shares of Fiat rose $0.06 to $9.44, while Ford gained $0.06 to $9.95 on the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)&lt;/a&gt;.

On Friday, all six major American television networks; &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;FOX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20WB%20Television%20Network"&gt;WB&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AUPN"&gt;UPN&lt;/a&gt;, along with most &lt;a href="w%3APBS"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt; stations, united in a rare show of solidarity to air a one hour charity concert called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AShelter%20from%20the%20Storm%3A%20A%20Concert%20for%20the%20Gulf%20Coast"&gt;Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The concert aired live at 8pm in the &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt; time zone and 7pm in the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt; time zone and on &lt;a href="w%3ATape%20delay%20%28broadcasting%29"&gt;tape-delay&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Standard%20Time%20Zone"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt; time zones. It was also shown on the Internet and many cable networks such as &lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Network"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABravo%20%28television%20network%29"&gt;Bravo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AG4%20%28television%29"&gt;G4&lt;/a&gt;.

The show was produced by &lt;a href="w%3AJoel%20Gallen"&gt;Joel Gallen&lt;/a&gt;, the same man behind the September 11th tribute concert ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%3A%20A%20Tribute%20to%20Heroes"&gt;America: A Tribute to Heroes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The show was not censored for political statements but was for obscenities. Gallen did not expect any political statements. Last week, rapper &lt;a href="w%3AKayne%20West"&gt;Kayne West&lt;/a&gt; made a remark on an NBC charity show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Concert%20for%20Hurricane%20Relief"&gt;A Concert for Hurricane Relief&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, in which West claimed that "&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; doesn't care about black people.", which caused controversy.

The concert began with Randy Newman singing "Louisana 1927." Throughout the concert there were notable acts, such &lt;a href="w%3AU2%20%28band%29"&gt;U2&lt;/a&gt; performing "One" with &lt;a href="w%3AMary.%20J%20Blige"&gt;Mary. J Blige&lt;/a&gt;. Another moment was Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood and the house band from The Late Show with David Letterman doing a cover of John Fogerty's "Who'll Stop The Rain".

Donations were being solicited for the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Red%20Cross"&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASalvation%20Army"&gt;Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt;.

Telecom company &lt;a href="w%3AAT%26amp%3BT"&gt;AT&amp;T&lt;/a&gt; provided toll-free calling and 10 call centers for the event and &lt;a href="w%3AMCI"&gt;MCI&lt;/a&gt; provided volunteers from their call centers.

&lt;a href="w%3ABET"&gt;BET&lt;/a&gt; also held a charity concert called ♡❤S.O.S (Saving OurSelves)♡❤, a half-hour before cutting to the main one.

&lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMTV%20Overdrive"&gt;MTV Overdrive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVH1"&gt;VH1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACountry%20Music%20Television"&gt;CMT&lt;/a&gt; will air a charity show Saturday called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReAct%20Now%3A%20Music%20%26amp%3B%20Relief"&gt;ReAct Now: Music &amp; Relief&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

<h1>British Gas announces a hike in energy bills of 14.2%</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20Gas%20announces%20a%20hike%20in%20energy%20bills%20of%2014.2%25&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

One of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;'s largest domestic energy suppliers, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Gas"&gt;British Gas&lt;/a&gt;, has announced that it is to raise the price of its gas and electricity prices by a record 14.2%. It blames the price rise on increasing wholesale gas prices, which have gone up by over 50% in the past year, the rising cost of oil &amp; the increasing difficulty in getting gas from the North Sea, a major gas field for the United Kingdom. 

250 000 people on low incomes will receive a one-off GBP 60 (USD 110.35 , EUR 88.93) &lt;a href="w%3Arebate"&gt;rebate&lt;/a&gt; to alleviate this price rise. 

This follows increases from other suppliers including &lt;a href="w%3APowergen"&gt;Powergen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A%20EDF%20Energy"&gt;EDF Energy&lt;/a&gt;, with both having risen their prices by 7 to 12%. &lt;a href="w%3AEnergywatch"&gt;Energywatch&lt;/a&gt;, Britain's consumer energy watchdog has said domestic gas and electric bills have gone up by 17 and 22% on average respectively in the last 18 months to August.

In 2004, British Gas increased its prices by 5.9% in January and 12.4% in September.

Across the water in &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, the Irish government approved a 25% increase on gas prices by the state owned monopoly, Bord Gais.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Red%20Cross"&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; is not lending its usual assistance in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, because the &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Guard"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt; acted first. After Saturday September 3, it was agreed with state officials the Red Cross was not needed because the large-scale evacuation of the city was under way.

The organization explains on its web site:

On September 1, the Red Cross offered to Louisiana state officials to enter New Orleans, who rejected the offer due to logistical difficulties. Making the offer the next day to Col. Jay Mayeaux, the deputy director of the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the Red Cross was asked to wait 24 hours while preparations were made. By the next day, Saturday September 3rd, the National Guard had arrived in the city, felt they had adequate supplies and did not need the Red Cross.

<h2>Superdome: refuge of last resort</h2>

The American Red Cross is often involved in emergency situations, and the term applied to the Superdome, "refuge of last resort", is based on Red Cross shelter standards. It is the minimal type of shelter, defined primarily by not meeting shelter standards:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. May or may not meet any of the ARC criteria for a shelter and has not been approved for use as a shelter by the ARC.
BULLET::::2. May be located either inside or outside of the Hurricane Risk Area.
BULLET::::3. Physical features required:
<dl>
BULLET::::- Located outside of the flood zone or ability to locate on floors elevated above flood potential area and hurricane wind resistant structure.

</dl>
</ol>
<h2>Ticking clock</h2>

Despite the Superdome being a minimal shelter, it was reported there were 26,000 people there. As the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%20Times-Picayune"&gt;Times-Picayune&lt;/a&gt; reported on Sunday, August 28, Col. Mayeaux was involved in preparations:

The National Guard delivered enough food for 15,000 people for 3 days, to a place which may have had 26,000 people. Four days later, National Guardsmen accompanied by buses (475 in all) and supply trucks arrived at the Superdome on September 1.

♡❤♡Limassol♡❤♡. At least two people have died at a &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cypriot&lt;/a&gt; army aircraft crash in the village of Kolossi this morning, west of the island's southern coastal town of &lt;a href="w%3ALimassol"&gt;Limassol&lt;/a&gt;.

Kolossi is a community of some 2,000 Britons, Germans and Cypriots.

Director of the President's Press Office Marios Karoyan told CNA that the aircraft was a PC - 9 (Pilatus). It is one of the two training military aircraft of the National Guard (Cyprus Army) and according to the first reports two people have died, believed to be the two pilots.

Defence Minister Kyriakos Mavronicolas and National Guard Commander Lieutenant-General Athanasios Nikolodemos have rushed to the area. Ambulances and fire engines are in the area.

<h1>Australia proposes new anti-terror laws</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australia%20proposes%20new%20anti-terror%20laws&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The proposed legislation includes an increase in the number of security cameras, penalties for leaving bags unattended at airports, electronic tags and restraining orders on suspects and tougher jail terms for inciting violence. Greater powers will be given to police and spy agencies to deal with terror suspects, and the length of time before permanent residents may apply for citizenship will increase from two to three years.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian government&lt;/a&gt; has received criticism over its new proposed anti-terror laws, claiming they are encouraging a transition into a police state. Critics say that the laws are draconian, too open to abuse, and may restrict the Australian 'way of life'.

The government has responded by saying that the laws are necessary to ensure security due to the rising terrorist threat to Australia. It is also considering sunset clauses for some laws, to counter claims that the laws may be abused after the terror threat has ebbed. 

There has been concern from the Muslim community that the laws are unfairly biased against Muslims. The government denied this. The &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said all Australians, including Muslims, should have nothing to fear if they are law-abiding citizens. "These laws are not directed at Islamic people, they are directed at people who might be contemplating terrorist deeds," Mr Howard said.

There will be a meeting of State and Federal leaders, to determine the finer details of the new legislation, later this month.

With only one week to go till the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20federal%20election%2C%202005"&gt;German federal election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , all polls say it's impossible to predict who will govern the country for the next four years (for the polls see end of article).

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CDU) had headed the polls for over two years. Only three months ago, when chancellor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; proclaimed he would seek early elections, a move that at the time was considered to be political suicide by many commentators, it seemed not unlikely that the CDU could even govern on its own, without an coalition partner. While their lead was slowly shrinking in the past few months, there was still a comfortable majority for a coalition with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Free Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (FDP).

Then came the TV debate between Schröder and Merkel. Commentators and newspaper editorials first thought it didn't have much impact. Sure, the "Media chancellor" Schröder was widely considered to have performed better, but that was to be expected. And Merkel certainly wasn't as bad as Schröder's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (SPD) had hoped. Also the topics they talked about weren't really new. Every position they stated had already been printed and broadcasted over and over again.

But something did happen. The CDU plunged between 2-3% in the various polls, while the SPD gained as much as 3.5%. Suddenly the black-yellow (named for the party colors of the CDU and FDP) majority was gone. But the current red-green (this time the colors of SPD and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20%2790/The%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) coalition is even farther from reaching a majority because there is also the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeft%20Party%20%28Germany%29"&gt;Left Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The Left Party (or simply The Left) is essentially a renamed PDS, which in turn is the successor of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASozialistische%20Einheitspartei%20Deutschlands"&gt;SED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the former ruling party of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGDR"&gt;GDR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It failed the 5% quorum in the 2002 election and currently only has two representatives in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABundestag"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; both won constituencies in East Berlin. The Left originally planned to merge with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWASG"&gt;WASG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a party mainly consisting of former SPD members who were disappointed by Schröder's social reforms, before the election which would have been held in 2006. However, they were caught off guard by the early elections call, so candidates of the WASG for the Bundestag now run under The Left banner. One of them is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOskar%20Lafontaine"&gt;Oskar Lafontaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .
Lafontaine was the Party chair of the SPD. He was also the Finance minister in Schröder's first government. But only a few months after the SPD got in power after 16 years of CDU government, he resigned in March 1999 from both the offices of minister and party chair, citing insurmountable political and personal differences with Schröder. He largely stayed out of politics, writing only a few books and newspaper columns, but is now, along with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGregor%20Gysi"&gt;Gregor Gysi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one of two front-runners of the Left Party.

So the Party of Left may tip the scales in this election. But all other parties have ruled out a coalition with them and The Left itself also called it impossible that a common ground could be found with the "neoliberal" parties currently in the Bundestag.

So, assuming neither black-yellow nor red-green reach a majority, what options are left? Maybe, the only remaining possibility is a grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU. But the differences between those two parties seem irreconcilable from today's viewpoint. There are radically different approaches in the fields of taxation, social and labor reforms to name only a few. Angela Merkel has recruited a jurist from the German constitutional court, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Kirchhof"&gt;Paul Kirchhof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to her team. Kirchhof plans to introduce a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aflat%20tax"&gt;flat tax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on income, 25% for everyone, and remove all tax exemptions. While the CDU doesn't want to go that far during the next four years, it has already named Kirchhof finance minister in the case they win the election. The SPD has blasted those plans as "radically unsocial" and instead plans to increase the taxes for wealthier people.

Another hot topic is Germany's high unemployment. The CDU plans to abolish the dismissal protection of workers to give companies greater flexibilty in the hiring of their employees. Again, this is a no-go for the SPD. 

But the two parties won't even speculate about this option. Both ruled out a coalition with each other. Nonetheless, 35% of all Germans think this coalition would be the best for the nation, a survey by the ZDF shows. That is still more than the 31% who would favor a black-yellow coalition and 17% who want a continuation of the current red-green government.

So, Germans have to wait for the 18th of September to know who will govern them for the next four years. But then again, it might even take two weeks longer because a by-election is required in Dresden, after a &lt;a href="Death%20of%20candidate%20will%20delay%20final%20results%20for%20German%20federal%20election%20by%20weeks"&gt;candidate died&lt;/a&gt;. And if it gets even closer than the aforementioned polls suggest, Germany will have to wait till October 2nd for a new, or the old government.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Swedish%20minister%20wants%20more%20free-to-air%20channels%20in%20the%20terrestrial%20television%20network&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
In a press release on September 8 from the Swedish &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Education%2C%20Research%20and%20Culture"&gt;Ministry of Education, Research and Culture&lt;/a&gt; it was announced that new television broadcasting licenses for the Swedish digital terrestrial television network was to be given and that the &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Radio%20and%20Television%20Authority"&gt;Radio and Television Authority&lt;/a&gt; (RTVV) had been given the task to handle the applications. All digital television licenses will cease by the end of 2005 and the companies must apply for a renewal if they want to continue broadcasting in 2006 and 2007.

Minister &lt;a href="w%3ALeif%20Pagrotsky"&gt;Leif Pagrotsky&lt;/a&gt; says in the press release that he is "taking an initiative towards a broader offer and more free channels". He doesn't give any clue on how this will be done in the press release, however. In an interview in &lt;a href="w%3ADagens%20Media"&gt;Dagens Media&lt;/a&gt;, his press secretary Thomas Johansson says that new applicants most likely must offer &lt;a href="w%3Afree-to-air"&gt;free-to-air&lt;/a&gt; channels if they want a licence. Johansson says that there is space for at least two more channels in the network.

The RTVV shall leave a suggestion of what channels will get new or continued licenses on November 21, 2005. As of September 8 TV4 AB, Dagens Industri, Sportexpressen and Eurosport SA had sent their applications for new or continued licenses.

Currently, very few of the 33 channels in the network have chosen to go free-to-air, in contrast to the United Kingdom, Germany and Finland where most channels are free-to-air.

The notorious &lt;a href="w%3A%20Anna%20Ayala"&gt;Anna Ayala&lt;/a&gt;, who caught the world’s attention by filing a lawsuit against the fast food restaurant &lt;a href="w%3A%20Wendy%27s"&gt;Wendy's&lt;/a&gt;, for a piece of a human finger she claimed was served in her bowl of chili, pleaded guilty to all charges brought before her in the case. Her co-defendant husband, Jaime Placencia, also pleaded guilty Friday to charges they both faced for conspiring to file a false claim and attempted grand theft.

The plea of guilt amounts to an admission the two conspired to plant the fingertip in Ayala's bowl of chili. The stage set for a lawsuit against Wendy's was met by the company's own reward of US$100,000 for information leading to the source of the finger part. 

A week before yesterday’s trial, the prosecutor for &lt;a href="w%3A%20Santa%20Clara%20County"&gt;Santa Clara County&lt;/a&gt;, Deputy District Attorney Chuck Gillingham, made it clear that the two would not be offered a plea bargain. Gillingham expressed confidence in the strength of the case against them. Wendy's International Inc. said the negative publicity generated by the Ayala claims cost the company $2.5 million in lost sales.
Ayala, 39, and Placencia, 43, remained in jail prior to the trial in lieu of $500,000 bail each. Ayala faces up to 10 years in prison, and her husband faces 13 years. Sentencing is set for November 2.
Wendy’s aggressively pursued evidence to counter Ayala’s claims. Suspicion against the claims grew as forensic evidence mounted. Ayala was later arrested in Nevada for selling a motor home to a woman who paid for it, but never got the home, because it belonged to her husband Placencia.

Ayala’s husband supplied the fingertip that was planted in the chili from a work incident involving a co-worker.

&lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; signed on Friday a trade agreement with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, which was considered to be one the last major hurdles to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Organisation"&gt;World Trade Organisation&lt;/a&gt; membership of the kingdom. Now, Saudis have to complete negotiations at the Geneva-based WTO on the formal accession document.

The deal opens Saudi markets to US farm and manufactured goods, as well as most services, including IT, financial, energy and tourism sectors. It also forced Saudis not to boycott US companies which are doing business with &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;.

The kingdom also promised to have normal trade relations with all 148 WTO members, which include Israel.

The other problem remains a Saudi-EU row over gas prices. The EU officials accused Saudi Arabia of selling the natural gas to their home &lt;a href="w%3Apetrochemicals"&gt;petrochemicals&lt;/a&gt; at rates below international market prices, which could cause losses to the European producers.

As of September 1, 2005, &lt;a href="w%3ABlackwater%20USA"&gt;Blackwater USA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.blackwaterusa.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sent equipment and security forces to the &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; disaster area, including a &lt;a href="w%3AA%C3%A9rospatiale%20Puma"&gt;SA-330J Puma helicopter&lt;/a&gt;, with the stated purpose of assisting in the evacuation of citizens from flooded areas. A later press release on Blackwater USA's web site confirms that their privately contracted forces are on the ground in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, being used to secure petrochemical facilities and provide security services for the federal government.

Private citizens are also reported to be hiring Blackwater "military warriors" and bodyguards to protect them and/or their expensive homes in New Orleans, such as in the &lt;a href="w%3AGarden%20District"&gt;Garden District&lt;/a&gt;, despite the repeated mandatory evacuation orders of all civilians by local, state, and federal authorities. One publication has reported that the number of soldiers for hire could be in the hundreds, as told to them by the commander of Blackwater's operations in the city. &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries from the firm known as ISI were also seen guarding a gated community, and were wearing full military gear including bulletproof vests and M16 assault rifles.

Blackwater has a history of being employed by the U.S. government and by private contractors across Iraq over the last two years to protect civilian and military convoys and provide security and bodyguarding services.

The city of San Jose, California greeted the opening of the Guadalupe River Park and Gardens today with festivities, music, and dancing. Local organizations and businesses offered booths and activities for the crowd.
Themed "A park for many reasons, a park for all seasons", the opening marked the culmination of 12 years of building, at a cost of $340 million. With trails running 2.6 miles along the Guadalupe River, the park offers an open space for city residents, preserves habitat for local wildlife, and works in conjunction with local flood control projects. 

Planning for the park began in 1985 and construction continues to extend the trails along the lower Guadalupe River to Alviso by 2006.

September 11, 2005 is not only a day of remembrance for the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, but for &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; as well. On September 11, 1973, General &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAugusto%20Pinochet"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt; took control of Chile with support from the US, establishing a military dictatorship that lasted 17 years.

The day is often one marked by violence. This year, riots in protest of the government have broken out across Chile. The government stated that it would not tolerate violence. 

At least four were injured and 20 arrested in connection with rioting, sources say. 

Chile remains divided by the current government. "This is not the Chile we want to build," says the current president, &lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Lagos"&gt;Ricardo Lagos&lt;/a&gt;.

Pinochet had claimed that the democratically elected leader of Chile, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASalvador%20Allende"&gt;Salvador Allende&lt;/a&gt; was a communist intent on aligning the country with the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;.

Pinochet is now being sued for various human rights abuses committed during his reign, and has all but left the public spotlight. Many of the former officials of the Pinochet regime have been arrested and detained. Hundreds of said officials have been tried for human rights crimes, but only four have been convicted. 

Lorena Pizarro, leader of a group of families of victims of Pinochet's violence, stated, "One works hard to get a human rights violator indicted and then he is pardoned." She further said, "Those who are guilty must be punished. We will continue to fight to gain even more convictions."

Rioting and disorder erupted in &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday because of a controversial decision to reroute the &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20Order"&gt;Orange Order&lt;/a&gt; parade. &lt;a href="w%3ALoyalist"&gt;Loyalists&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href="w%3APSNI"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Army"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; with blast bombs (homemade grenades) and petrol bombs. There was widespread stone-throwing, and barricades were erected on some roads that caused traffic disruptions in the city. In some places, automatic gunfire was heard, with police returning live fire. 

Half a dozen police were injured, and two men were taken to hospital &amp;mdash; one with a gunshot wound, and another was caught in the blast of an explosion.

The parade route was altered by the Parades Commission. The intended path of the original parade route was through a Nationalist part of Springfield Road, with the potential to result in rioting and violence (the route would have had to pass through a 30 foot high security barrier, one of the "&lt;a href="w%3APeace%20Line"&gt;Peace Lines&lt;/a&gt;". Unionists called for the decision to be reconsidered by the Commission; however, no change was made. Instead of passing through Springfield Road, the Orange Order parade was required to proceed through the site of the engineering firm Mackies.

The streets of northern and western Belfast echoed with sounds of violence not commonly heard since the late 1990s and the &lt;a href="w%3ATroubles"&gt;Troubles&lt;/a&gt;. Petrol and blast bombs were used by rioters, and water cannon and plastic bullets were used by police. Several cars and a bus were hijacked, and roads were closed off by mobs of people. A number of buildings were set alight with fire around the outskirts of the city.

Throughout the night, violence spread to outlying towns around Belfast, including &lt;a href="w%3ABallymena"&gt;Ballymena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABallyclare"&gt;Ballyclare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACarrickfergus"&gt;Carrickfergus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALarne"&gt;Larne&lt;/a&gt;.

Police Chief Constable &lt;a href="w%3AHugh%20Orde"&gt;Hugh Orde&lt;/a&gt; described the rioting as perhaps the worst such situation ever seen in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; - particularly because of the use of firearms in a public order situation. He controversially held the Orange Order responsible for the disorder, and complained about the politicians who called for people to protest. The &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Rev. Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt; had threatened at the time of the parade rerouting decision by the &lt;a href="w%3AParades%20Commission"&gt;Parades Commission&lt;/a&gt; that it "could be the spark which kindles a fire there would be no putting out".

The response of Unionist politicians has been to accuse the police of brutal and heavy-handed tactics. Hugh Orde has praised the police for being "heroes", and suggested that no other police force in the UK, Europe, and perhaps even the US has had to deal with such ferocity in a public order situation. Unionists described the Chief Constable's comments as "inflammatory".

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Red%20Cross"&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; is seeking at least 40,000 more volunteers to replace current relief workers suffering from fatigue.

“This is a disaster of such scope and such significance that it is not going to go away in a few weeks or a few months,” said Ken Degnan, a spokesman for the American Red Cross. 

The organization is currently sheltering 116,000 victims. It has 36,000 volunteers in the field and is currently running 675 shelters across the nation.

The reason the recruitment is needed is due to the fact that the 36,000 will begin to rotate as they go home to their families.

Volunteers are encouraged to sign up on their local chapter's website or call and leave their contact information.

From an Atlanta chapter email:

"Please do not go to a Red Cross location without prior scheduling. Only scheduled volunteers will be working at each site. Thank you for your patience in this process. Our trained volunteers and staff are being utilized to respond to families in need and to the thousands of calls coming in from people wanting to help. However, we do appreciate your generous offer and will be in contact based on the current needs."

The &lt;a href="w%3Aadult%20literacy"&gt;adult literacy&lt;/a&gt; program Read Santa Clara marked its tenth &lt;a href="w%3Aanniversary"&gt;anniversary&lt;/a&gt; today with a gathering of program participants, staff, and supporters from the community. Read Santa Clara trains volunteer tutors and matches them with adult learners who wish to build their literacy skills.

In the presentation, program staff and supporters reviewed the program's history and growth, honored long-time participants, and looked toward the future.

Santa Clara Mayor Patricia Mahan spoke at the gathering, noting, "Read Santa Clara joins people who need to learn with people who need to teach, and what a powerful combination that is." She added, "I think adult literacy is so important."

Program coordinators estimate that tutors volunteered some 5000 hours last year. City Manager Jennifer Sparacino estimates, "That's worth about $100,000 per year in volunteer time."

Learners also spoke about what Read Santa Clara meant to them. Raymond Moreno said, "I hope it stays for another ten, twenty, thirty years, because we need it." Juan Velasquez said, "My life has changed a lot...I did many things I could not have done without help." And Ike Moore said, "To be able to express myself...What a gift!"

A US peace activist and history teacher, &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Parkin"&gt;Scott Parkin&lt;/a&gt;, has been arrested in Melbourne after his visa was revoked on grounds of character. He was deemed "a threat to national security" by the Australian &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs"&gt;Department of Immigration&lt;/a&gt;, according to a spokesperson from Anti-Deportation Alliance. The ABC has reported that the Federal police have confirmed an American man was arrested on the orders of the Immigration Department (DIMIA) and is in custody.

Mr Parkin, a native of Houston, Texas, USA, participated in an anti- war-profiteering protest outside &lt;a href="w%3AHalliburton"&gt;Halliburton&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney on August 31, and was also reported to have attended the &lt;a href="Carnival%20style%20protest%20held%20in%20Sydney"&gt;Forbes Global CEO Conference protest&lt;/a&gt;.

Liz Thompson from the National Anti-Deportation Alliance (NADA) said Mr Parkin was held by Federal Police at Carlton West police station before being moved to Melbourne Custody Centre on Saturday September 10. She said the incident seemed to contradict Philip Ruddock's denial that Australia was turning into a &lt;a href="w%3Apolice%20state"&gt;police state&lt;/a&gt;.

"This is a major attack on dissent, free speech and the anti-war movement. This should be a warning to everyone about the greater powers that &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Organisation"&gt;ASIO&lt;/a&gt; may soon be granted," Ms Thompson said. She was referring to the proposed legislation to increase police and ASIO powers in dealing with suspected terrorists. 

Federal Attorney-General &lt;a href="w%3APhillip%20Ruddock"&gt;Phillip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; stated that he knew of the case, and that it was an issue for the Immigration Minister. He said that a security assessment of Mr Parkin had been conducted, and it was this security assessment that provided the basis for the decision to revoke his visa. 

"I understand the decision was based upon a security assessment, and security assessments are not something about which I can comment in any detail," he said. "I understand it's a decision that's been taken by the Minister for Immigration and that there may be legal proceedings surrounding it."

Spokesperson for the Brisbane Peace Convergence Kim Stewart said Mr Parkin's detention and deportation posed a "dangerous precedent to free speech in Australia".

"By arresting and threatening to deport Mr Parkin, the government is already using its power to silence non-violent peace campaigners and discourage peaceful dissent in our community," Ms Stewart said.

Julian Burnside QC, a prominent human rights lawyer, asked why it took so long for authorities to act if indeed Mr Parkin is a security threat.

"They've got the right but the question is whether that right has been exercised in a way that provides sufficient protection for ordinary citizens of Australia," he said.

Greens Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; also criticised the arrest, suggesting that pressure may have been applied by the United States government. 

"The Howard government appears to be doing the Bush administration’s bidding. As far as I know, Mr Parkin has broken no Australian law. He was granted a visa to enter this country, so his arrest contradicts the government’s own assessment of his credentials,” 

"It seems to have nothing to do with terrorism. The Howard Government will do whatever Washington asks of it and I am very concerned the request for his arrest came in the wake of information from Washington," Mr Brown said. 

The government is currently calling for increased police powers ostensibly to protect the country from terrorists. Some groups are concerned that these powers will be used against critics of government policy. 

"Our fears that these [Anti-terrorist] powers would be used against activists have been justified by yesterday's police action," said Kim Stewart.

Scott Parkin, on the day of his arrest, was due to give a workshop titled: ♡❤Bringing Down The Pillars - People power strategies against war and capitalism♡❤. The workshop was sponsored by Forest Action Trust, Pt'chang Nonviolence Training Project, and Friends of the Earth Melbourne.

Parkin had done guest lectures and teach-ins in the past; he has been an organizer with Houston Global Awareness, including direct action pertaining to the 2004 and 2005 protests outside the Halliburton Shareholders Meeting. He is also an active participant with Houston Indymedia despite 'outing' Maoist-themed activists by enforcing quasi-apartheid policy of noncollaboration. 

<h3>Appeal lodged</h3>

&lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; is providing legal help to Mr Parkin and advised that he had instructed his lawyers to appeal to the Migration Review Tribunal to review the basis on which his visa was withdrawn.

Danny Kennedy, Greenpeace campaigns director, said: "The burden of proof in the Scott Parkin expulsion case lies morally with the Commonwealth, to prove that he is a danger. When the Government brought in anti-terror legislation, they promised the public that these laws would only be used to confront a real and present risk of a terrorist attack, not a sweep-all approach against citizens. Peace is not terrorism. Peace is not a threat to national security. No democratic government should expel a foreign citizen because [it] opposes his political opinions."

Protests against the detention and deportation of Scott Parkin have taken place outside the Melbourne custody centre today, as well as in Sydney.

&lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="cricket"&gt;cricket&lt;/a&gt; team have won &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Ashes"&gt;The Ashes&lt;/a&gt; with a draw in the final test.

&lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; won the series 2-1, with the other two tests drawn. &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; won the first Test comfortably, but the Second Test saw England level the series with a two run victory that was the narrowest win in Ashes history. The third Test ended in a draw (with England one wicket away from a win), and England narrowly won the fourth Test in &lt;a href="w%3ANottingham"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt; by three wickets after the English enforced &lt;a href="w%3Afollow%20on"&gt;follow on&lt;/a&gt; after a poor first innings by Australia.

The fifth and final Test started on 8 September at &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Oval"&gt;the Oval&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. It entered its final day evenly balanced with all results still possible and the destination of the urn still in doubt. Australia needed to win to force a 2-2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give them to England, ending 18 years and eight series of Australian dominance. In the end, England managed to bat out the final day, and a draw ensured the Ashes were coming back to England.

&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Pietersen"&gt;Kevin Pietersen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAshley%20Giles"&gt;Ashley Giles&lt;/a&gt; hit personal bests of 158 and 59 respectively, to bat out the best part of the last day. Pieterson's 158 was his maiden test century, and included 7 sixes. Early in the day, Australia looked to be in with a chance of winning the match, with early wickets leaving England at 67 for 3. Giles and Pietersen's century partnership, though, left Australia with no hope of catching England in the remains of the day, sealing England's Ashes win since 1987.

England's next Tests will be an away series in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the world champions Australia will play an ICC World XI (which inclues &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Pietersen"&gt;Kevin Pietersen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Harmison"&gt;Steve Harmison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Flintoff"&gt;Andrew Flintoff&lt;/a&gt;) in the &lt;a href="w%3AICC%20Super%20Series"&gt;Johnnie Walker Super Series&lt;/a&gt; in early October.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; (FEMA) is being criticized for misallocation of personnel in the wake of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. FEMA representatives said they requested volunteers from fire departments around the U.S., to handle its community relations campaign. However, a document FEMA sent to local fire departments asked for firefighters with very specific skills and who were capable of working in "austere conditions". Fire departments around the nation responded by sending crews to the FEMA staging ground in Atlanta. Some of these crews were unaware that they were only going to be used for public relations work. Others, however, merely hoped that FEMA would allocate them to rescue and damage control operations once it saw their qualifications.

The firefighter's objections are particularly poignant as one of FEMA public relations training seminars coincided with New Orleans Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Nagin"&gt;Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt; plea for firefighters on national television, to relieve his own exhausted crews. It is unclear if FEMA's request for firefighters prevented any municipalities from responding to Mayor Nagin's request.

Some firefighters have objected to their use as FEMA public relations officers because their municipalities must bear the cost of their salaries, as well as endure reduced firefighting capacity. FEMA has stated that it sought to use firefighters to avoid background checks required of federal employees.

Firefighters began receiving their assignments Monday, September 5th. Among these was a crew of 50 assigned to tour the devastated areas with President Bush and the press.

Mr Brown accused 'the &lt;a href="w%3Acartel"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt;' of the lack of reaction on &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s rising oil demand. He said that he wanted OPEC to increase supplies by the end of the month.

However, the Chancellor insisted that the government would not ease the tax on fuel, saying that the price surge is "a global challenge that demands global measures". He admitted the situation is as serious as it was in 1970s oil crisis, but added that the slump can be avoided due to stability and low inflation rate of the British economy.

Mr Brown will probably have to face country-wide protests on high fuel prices. The protesters from the Fuel Lobby give the government three days to meet them to discuss lowering the fuel tax, then they threat refinery demonstrations and motorway go-slows.

The Japanese postal system deals with post and banking and life insurance services as well, and Koizumi earlier proposed legislation to divide the postal system and to privatize it, which failed, with governing Liberal Democrat members &lt;a href="w%3Acrossing%20the%20floor"&gt;crossing the floor&lt;/a&gt; on the issue. Koizumi then dissolved the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Japan"&gt;lower house&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain a mandate for the reforms.

Polls have predicted Koizumi will win this election by a landslide, permitting the Liberal Democrats to govern without any alliances. The opposition Democratic Party leader Katsuya Okada has said he will resign if the election was lost.

There have also been reports of electoral "assassins", attractive candidates, who were intended to push out the rebel Government ministers who helped defeat the postal reform bills.

The retail price of gasoline has risen higher than ever in the wake of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The losses from the deadly hurricane include the destruction of oil refineries all around the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Mexican Gulf&lt;/a&gt; area, and resulted in a cut of nearly 11 percent of &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; refining capacity. 

It is estimated that 897,605 barrels of oil production has been curtailed, an amount which accounts for nearly 59.8% percent of the Gulf of Mexico's total daily output. Since Katrina, 17.1 million barrels have not been produced. There were 122 oil platforms shut down, out of 819 platforms in the Gulf.

The national average retail price for gas was $3.04 on Sunday. This exceeds the previous inflation-adjusted record of $3.03, set in March of 1981.

The survey was published by Trilby Lundberg, who publishes such surveys semi-monthly. 

These prices are all "thanks to Katrina," said Lundberg. 
Lundberg also says that prices could drop in the next few weeks, as the hurricane damaged areas are repaired, and less gas is being purchased nationwide because of lowered demand due to higher prices.

A new &lt;a href="w%3ANewsweek"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; poll shows that &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s approval rating has fallen to an all-time low of 38%. The drop comes largely in response to the Bush Administration's -- and in particular, &lt;a href="w%3AFEMA"&gt;FEMA&lt;/a&gt;'s -- inability to handle the recent rescue and recovery efforts after &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt; hit &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;.

The poll also shows that 57% of people have lost faith in the Administration's ability to handle a natural disaster. 52% do not feel Bush has the ability to make good decisions in a time of crisis.

The poll of 1,009 people, which has a margin of error of 4%, also showed that the country is still split on issues such as dealing with &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHomeland%20Security"&gt;Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20war"&gt;military action&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. An overwhelming 66% are not satisfied with the current direction of the country.

The combination of the above issues are likely contributing to President Bush's declining approval rating. The strong and vocal criticism from Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Nagin"&gt;Ray Nagin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; may be one factor in the near-term decline. Nagin has given a number of publicized interviews during the recovery crisis, and the following is from the Sunday, September 11 broadcast of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMeet%20The%20Press"&gt;Meet The Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤:

&lt;blockquote&gt;MR. RUSSERT: What's the biggest mistake you made?&lt;br&gt; 

MAYOR NAGIN: My biggest mistake is having a fundamental assumption that in the state of Louisiana, with an $18 billion budget, in the country of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; that can move whole fleets of aircraft carriers across the globe in 24 hours, that my fundamental assumption was get as many people to safety as possible, and that the cavalry would be coming within two to three days, and they didn't come. 

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Responding to public criticism, President Bush stated he intends "to lead an investigation to find out what went right and what went wrong." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.boston.com/news/weather/articles/2005/09/07/bush_vows_probe_of_what_went_wrong/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt; is expected to investigate the disaster response on the local, state, and federal level as soon as is practical.

A second night of rioting on Sunday night and into Monday morning has taken place in and around &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="w%3Aloyalist"&gt;loyalist&lt;/a&gt; mobs attacking &lt;a href="w%3APSNI"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt;, hijacking vehicles and setting them alight.

A crowd of about 700 gathered on the Albertbridge road in the east of the city, where police were attacked. A mob of about 100 attacked police in the north of the city, and in the west of the city, a police station was attacked with a blast bomb (homemade grenade).

A digger was used to take out streetlighting before the disorder, with some of the street left in darkness. It is also believed that an ATM was removed by the digger. The police and army came under attack as they moved in to retrieve the items and respond.

Cars were hijacked and set alight in a number of locations. A more serious incident occurred in &lt;a href="w%3ABangor%2C%20County%20Down"&gt;Bangor&lt;/a&gt;, some distance east of Belfast in &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Down"&gt;County Down&lt;/a&gt; where a bus was hijacked. Passengers were ordered off the vehicle before being robbed, and the bus set alight, blocking a road.

&lt;a href="w%3Aplastic%20bullet"&gt;Baton&lt;/a&gt; rounds were again fired by police and the army, with the army also firing one live round. A suspect was shot and apprehended in this incident, and they are to be charged with attempted murder.

The &lt;a href="Loyalist%20rioting%20erupts%20in%20Belfast"&gt;previous night's riots&lt;/a&gt; were the worst seen in Northern Ireland for many years, and a first for involving live fire at police during a public disorder incident.

On Saturday 10, 2005, the &lt;a href="w%3Aworld%20record"&gt;world record&lt;/a&gt; for the largest performance of the &lt;a href="w%3ASiege%20of%20Ennis"&gt;Siege of Ennis&lt;/a&gt;, an Irish folk dance, was set in Cork, Ireland. It was organised by the Triskel Arts Centre and the local newspaper ♡❤Evening Echo♡❤, and was part of the city's tenure as European Capital of Culture.

It beat the previous record set in &lt;a href="w%3ADublin%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Dublin, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. This attempt was sponsored by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Flatley"&gt;Michael Flatley&lt;/a&gt;.

The record breaking attempt was immediately followed by an actual dance.

Long queues are forming outside &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; petrol stations as motorists rush to buy fuel ahead of protests against fuel tax.

Consumer groups such as 'The Fuel Lobby', the group behind the fuel protests in 2000, have given conflicting reports on plans to blockade refineries to prevent supply of petrol stations. Action started at 6am this morning, with a low turnout of protesters at refineries. Further protests are planned at forecourts and on various roads for the remainder of the week. Welsh protesters plan a 20mph rolling roadblock on the M4 motorway, starting at 7am on Friday, September 16.

The government has told the public there are enough petrol supplies to last for 80 days, but petrol stations themselves may be set to run out much faster as large numbers of people fill up their tanks in anticipation of shortages. An eyewitness has said that as well as filling up their vehicle tanks, people are taking spare tanks. 

Bill Johnson, a petrol station manager in Cornwall, told the Guardian that he found it necessary to restrict petrol supplies to account holders only. He said: "They were shouting, 'You fucking bastards, I've got to get to work.' It wasn't pretty, people are just getting greedy."

Matthew Carrington of the Petrol Retailers' Association called on Gordon Brown to reduce tax. "His tax take goes up as the price goes up, " he said.

On Monday, the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; army withdrew from the &lt;a href="Gaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; rejoiced over this occasion, with &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; saying that "This is a day of happiness and joy that the Palestinian people have not witnessed for a century."

The 38 years of Israeli presence in the Gaza strip have officially ended.

Palestinians were overjoyed at the sight of the burning synagogues, planting flags in the midst of it all, and shouting cries of independence. Teenagers set fire to a few synagogues, letting out anger at Israel's occupation. 

The fires did little damage to the concrete structures, but Abbas said that the Palestinians planned to destroy them fully.

Palestinian police admitted that there was not much they could or would do to stop this. 

Last year, the Israeli cabinet had planned to destroy the synagogues, but this Sunday, under pressure from religious Jewish organizations, it reversed its decision. Palestinians were angry at the cabinet's Sunday vote.

The synagogues, as well as all community structures, including community centers, schools, and sports facilites, are the only physical remnants of the Israeli Gaza Strip presence since all residential structures have been destroyed.

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Walt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;The Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt; and the government of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; officially opened the world's eleventh Disney theme park, &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong%20Disneyland"&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland&lt;/a&gt;, today at 13:00PM local time.

The park, located in &lt;a href="w%3APenny%27s%20Bay"&gt;Penny's Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALantau%20Island"&gt;Lantau Island&lt;/a&gt;, is the major attraction at the &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong%20Disneyland%20Resort"&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland Resort&lt;/a&gt;, which also features two luxurious hotels and a recreational lake with stunning views of local Hong Kong scenery, unlike previous &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney%20Parks%20and%20Resorts"&gt;Disney theme parks&lt;/a&gt;.

Chinese Vice President &lt;a href="w%3AZeng%20Qinghong"&gt;Zeng Qinghong&lt;/a&gt;, chief executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Tsang%20Yam-kuen"&gt;Donald Tsang Yam-kuen&lt;/a&gt;, and vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, &lt;a href="w%3ATung%20Chee-hwa"&gt;Tung Chee-hwa&lt;/a&gt;, were present at the ceremony, as were joint Walt Disney CEOs &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Eisner"&gt;Michael Eisner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Iger"&gt;Bob Iger&lt;/a&gt;, among a host of Disney &lt;a href="w%3AImagineers"&gt;Imagineers&lt;/a&gt; who helped design and create the park.

The park has been criticised for its apparent lack of attractions compared to the other Disney theme parks around the world, but senior show designer for the park, Tom Morris, told journalists that the Imagineers had left much room around the park for expansion, and if all goes well financially, much construction will be going on in the next few years.

Sixteen thousand guests attended the park today, and officials expect five million will follow in the next year. Over seventy percent of all visitors will come from Hong Kong and mainland &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

Skype technology is to be introduced on eBay's website, allowing sellers to receive calls or leads from the sites users, for a fee.

It is the biggest &lt;a href="w%3Aacquisition"&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; in eBay's history. The company hopes to diversify its profit sources and gain popularity in areas where Skype holds a strong position, such as &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Europe"&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.

EBay expects to cut 2006 earnings per share by $0.12 due to the acquisition.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Brown"&gt;Michael Brown&lt;/a&gt;, head of the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; (FEMA) has announced his resignation as Director. Brown had come under criticism for FEMA's slow reaction and handling of the devastation in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;.

Allen&lt;/a&gt; in his place.

Brown told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; that the focus had to be FEMA and the efforts of people in the disaster areas. Brown also said that his resignation was in the best interests of the agency and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;, who himself, has received criticism over the handling of the disaster.

Exit polls from four different news sources have given the opposition, a centre-left bloc led by Jens Stoltenberg of the Labour party an early lead. However, early prognoses still show the election as too close to call. 

If elected, Stoltenberg will replace Kjell Magne Bondevik as Prime Minister. Bondevik, a former priest, has for the last four years led a centre-right coalition government consisting of the Conservative Party (H), the Christian People's Party (KrF) and the Liberal Democrats (V).

Prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AKjell%20Magne%20Bondevik"&gt;Kjell Magne Bondevik&lt;/a&gt; (Christian Democrat) is currently in government with his triparty coalition with the Conservatives and the Liberals. The polls during the last months have shown that the opposition, led by the Labour party has had a majority behind it, but during the last few days, the polls have shown a trend towards favouring the ruling coalition. On election day, polls show more or less a tie.

A &lt;a href="w%3APower%20outage"&gt;power outage&lt;/a&gt; in a large portion of &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles, California&lt;/a&gt; occurred at approximately 13:00 PST (20:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) on Monday. Reports from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power indicate that the incident was caused by a worker who accidentally cut a line. The outage caused a chain reaction that took out power to a large part of the city.

According to local television stations, power is being returned to some of the city, including the UCLA Medical Center. Police are on "full tactical alert", meaning that they will only respond to serious calls and all officers must remain on duty. Most officers are directing traffic.

&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20International%20Airport"&gt;Los Angeles International Airport&lt;/a&gt; briefly was affected but generators engaged shortly thereafter. No flights were delayed or cancelled.

According to the Department of Water and Power, the shutdown happened because of a mechanical problem at two receiving stations. The system automatically triggered a shutdown when a line was cut. DWP spokesman Ron Deaton said that if there is an increase in the power stations automatically shut down. "You cut the wrong wire and it triggers the system to shut down. We have finished repairing the transmission systems. Some units are not up yet, but we have other generating parts of the system. All that remains is the distribution of the power to the individual customers."

The DWP is currently restoring power by redirecting it from other areas.

The DWP, LAPD, the DOD and Department of Homeland security immediately assured the public that the power outage has nothing to do with terrorism or sabotage, and that the identity of the worker(s) who cut the power lines will not be released.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AOracle%20Corporation"&gt;Oracle Corporation&lt;/a&gt; announced earlier today that they are buying rival US-based &lt;a href="w%3ASiebel%20Systems"&gt;Siebel Systems&lt;/a&gt; for $10.66 &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt; per share. Siebel shareholders have the option to receive the $10.66 per share in cash or in Oracle stock. This deal is valued at approximately $5.85 billion USD. Siebel Systems' Board of Directors has already voted in favour of the acquisition. Founder &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Siebel"&gt;Thomas Siebel&lt;/a&gt; has also given his support. A special meeting will soon be held for Siebel stockholders to vote on the acquisition. If all goes well the deal should close in the early part of next year.

After acquiring Siebel; Oracle, which specializes in database applications, will become the second largest &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20software"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; company. Oracle has offices in more than 145 countries, and employs over 50,000 people. This acquisition will make Oracle the largest &lt;a href="w%3ACustomer%20relationship%20management"&gt;customer relationship management (CRM)&lt;/a&gt; applications company in the world. CRM applications include accounting, inventory management and customer management software. "Siebel's 4,000 applications customers and 3,400,000 CRM users strengthen our number one position in applications in North America and move us closer to the number one position in applications globally", said Oracle CEO &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Ellison"&gt;Larry Ellison&lt;/a&gt;.

"Today is a great day for Siebel Systems' customers, partners, shareholders, and employees," said Thomas M. Siebel, Chairman and Founder of Siebel Systems. Many analysts predicted the acquisition of Siebel after Oracle bought competitor &lt;a href="w%3APeopleSoft"&gt;PeopleSoft&lt;/a&gt; for $10 billion USD, last December.

The legislation and amendments ensuring the sale of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s half-privatized telecommunications provider, &lt;a href="Telstra"&gt;Telstra&lt;/a&gt;, was moved and debated on September 12. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; /&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20Party"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; coalition government has come under criticism for the allotting of time for debate as being insufficient.

In &lt;a href="Australian%20Parliament"&gt;Federal Parliament&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20House"&gt;Leader of the House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Tony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; moved to adjourn debate at 9.06pm, to which his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; counterpart &lt;a href="Julia%20Gillard"&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/a&gt; attempted to adjourn the Telstra debate until today, but Abbott put the question and used the Government's majority to move debate onward. 

Abbott then moved that the legislation, comprising of three bills, be considered as urgent and allotted approximately forty-five minutes to debate all three. The Opposition had attempted to further amend the urgency motion which failed due to Government majority &amp;mdash; there were six &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adivision"&gt;divisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the space of approximately half an hour, all which failed. Gillard and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Adams"&gt;Dick Adams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had called the process "a disgrace", and the amendments (negotiated earlier by Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarnaby%20Joyce"&gt;Barnaby Joyce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) were termed the "'Backdown Barnaby' bribe" by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Smith"&gt;Stephen Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; before the Deputy Speaker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Causley"&gt;Ian Causley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; asked him to withdraw.

Whilst the Government has an absolute majority in the &lt;a href="Australian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt;, it is not guaranteed that the necessary legislation will pass this house. Garnering the support of key Senator Joyce is critical to ensure that the bills will pass (as he will have the deciding vote) and he has already stated that, due to a damning report released earlier in the House of Representatives showing that fourteen percent of lines were faulty amongst other criticism, that it has turned the "green [light] to amber" &lt;a href="http%3A//abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200509/s1456454.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Joyce was crucial in defeating a Senate Opposition motion to delay debate until October 4, even though he himself agreed that the time for debate should be extended; he stated in an interview on the ♡❤AM♡❤ program on ABC Radio National that he voted against the motion as he believed crossing the floor would destroy any "political capital" he had to enable him to further negotiate improvements to the Telstra deal within his own party.

Among its many ongoing research studies, the &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20Resources%20Conservation%20Service"&gt;Natural Resources Conservation Service&lt;/a&gt; (NRCS) National Plant Materials Center (NPMC), in &lt;a href="w%3ABeltsville%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Beltsville, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, is researching native, ornamental, &lt;a href="w%3Aperennial%20plants"&gt;perennial plants&lt;/a&gt; which are tolerant of hot, droughty conditions. The end result of this research is to promote city gardening in the Washington/Baltimore metro area and to eventually expand to the entire mid-Atlantic region. 

“The use of native plants are beneficial to the region in that they are already adapted to the cultural conditions present in city environments and are unlikely to displace other native-plant communities,” said Shawn Belt, Horticulturalist at the NPMC. “And, not only do these native plants add to the diversity of inner-city plant materials they encourage wildlife as well.” 

Working with NRCS conservationists for &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;, the NPMC has recently installed a “&lt;a href="w%3Abutterfly"&gt;butterfly&lt;/a&gt; garden” a native-plant garden at the Myrtilla Miner Elementary School in NE Washington DC. According to Belt, Washington, DC typically has poor soils so this site will be a good evaluation for hot, dry conditions.

“Since there are no farms in DC to award contracts for the various NRCS cost share programs, NRCS does award cost share for schools in order to educate students to the benefits of using native plants in city landscapes,” said Belt. 

NRCS conservationists have been encouraging teachers to install butterfly gardens with cost-share money from the Environmental Quality Incentives Programs (EQIP) to help with the costs of installing these gardens.

While working with the school to install the native-plant garden, NRCS employees will evaluate the performance of the plants over the next 3 years. Additionally, evaluations will be continued in other areas of Washington, DC in order to replicate the "experiment" in differing locations.

The Pentagon has drafted a revised plan for the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/policy/dod/jp3_12fc2_15mar2005.htm"&gt;Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations&lt;/a&gt;. This draft document is a revison of the Pentagon's &lt;a href="http%3A//www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/policy/dod/jp3_12.htm"&gt;Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations, Joint Publication 3-12&lt;/a&gt;, which is dated December 15, 1995.

This draft redefines the purpose of United States's Nuclear forces to include "Assuring allies and friends of the US steadfastness of purpose and its capability to fulfill its security commitments." and "Dissuading adversaries from undertaking programs or operations that could threaten US interests or those of our allies and friends". This is a departure from the previous document which defined the purpose of the Nuclear Force as:

The draft proposal also seeks to expand the definition of deterence to include US interests as well as threats to national security. The draft goes on to describe how deterence will work in cases of state actors using WMD:

This again is a departure from the previous version, as pre-emption was not mentioned as a method for deterence to work. The current draft also suggests new scenarios for the United States to deploy nuclear forces, against biological or chemical attack on US, allied, or multinational forces, to counter overwhelming converntional forces, and against states supporting a non-state actor's use of WMD.

This draft, like the previous version, also emphasizes that the US abhorrs the use of unrestricted warfare, and has codefied "laws of war".

Critics of the draft argue that the "aggressive posture" outlined in this new document actually undermines US security. Hans Kristensen, of the Natural Resouces Defense Council, analyzed the draft in &lt;a href="http%3A//www.armscontrol.org/act/2005_09/Kristensen.asp"&gt;The Role of U.S. Nuclear Weapons: New Doctrine Falls Short of Bush Pledge&lt;/a&gt;.

The draft document was written under the direction of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General Richard B. Meyers. The draft is going through a final coordination with various military branches and pentagon offices. The draft has not received final approval from United States Secretary of Defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUDA"&gt;Ulster Defence Association&lt;/a&gt; (UDA) has called on its members to "avoid any confrontation on the streets and steer away from any acts of violence". This statement from the UDA comes after the third consecutive night of &lt;a href="w%3ALoyalist"&gt;Loyalist&lt;/a&gt; violence in &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;. The rioting has so far left 60 &lt;a href="w%3APSNI"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; officers injured and resulted in 63 arrests. Rioters blocked roads, hijacked and torched vehicles, and attacked police.

Police Chief Constable Hugh Orde has said that he believes the &lt;a href="w%3AUVF"&gt;Ulster Volunteer Force&lt;/a&gt; (UVF) and the UDA are behind the violence, which broke out after the re-routing of an &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20Order"&gt;Orange Order&lt;/a&gt; parade.

&lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; Secretary Peter Hain is expected to announce shortly that the UVF &lt;a href="w%3Aceasefire"&gt;ceasefire&lt;/a&gt;, announced in 1994, has come to an end.

Armed police and officials entered the &lt;a href="w%3AKalahari"&gt;Central Kalahari Game Reserve&lt;/a&gt; on , giving the &lt;a href="w%3ABushmen"&gt;Bushmen&lt;/a&gt; there ten days to leave. Some Bushmen are reported to have fled into the Reserve and are evading capture.

In 1996 the central government of &lt;a href="w%3ABotswana"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt; adopted a policy of evicting the Bushmen from the Central Game Reserve, an area originally set aside for them to inhabit. A constitutional amendment is also pending in Parliament to revoke the right of Bushmen to live in the Reserve in perpetuity. The government has expressed concern with several issues surrounding their continued presence in the reserve, including the need to supply them with water, the expense of educating them and providing them with health care, and their effect on the animals in the Reserve. They also say that it is in the Bushmen's best interest to join civilized society.

Critics of the relocation, including the groups &lt;a href="w%3ASurvival%20International"&gt;Survival International&lt;/a&gt; and Botswanian Centre for Human Rights, allege very different motivations. Some believe that the government is moving the Bushmen out of the region to encourage tourism and diamond mining. Others argue that the government is acting out of compassion, but is making the wrong choice; they say that the Bushmen should be left to their &lt;a href="w%3Ahunter-gatherer"&gt;hunter-gatherer&lt;/a&gt; ways, and that attempting to integrate them into modern Botswania will destroy their identity. They also state that the resettlement camps they are placed in are in bad condition, with rampant alcoholism and prostitution.

A court case has been in progress for three years against the government for moving them out of the Reserve, and is currently being heard. In August 2005 the United Nations urged Botswana to work with the Bushman to settle the dispute. It is estimated that some 250 Bushmen remain in the Reserve, having evaded eviction or infiltrated back after having been removed.

At press time, there were six days left on the government's ultimatum.

&lt;a href="w%3ALexmark%20International"&gt;Lexmark International&lt;/a&gt; introduced the Lexmark P450 in the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, the first printer to have a built-in CD burner. The CD burner allows users to copy photos from their camera directly to CD without requiring the printer to be connected to a computer.

The P450 is a small, portable printer that can print 4in by 6in photos. Photos can be printed from USB flash drives, memory cards, Bluetooth devices and PictBridge compatible digital cameras. The printer includes a 2.4-inch color LCD from which users can perform basic editing tasks such as cropping, rotating, and removing red-eye.

"The Lexmark P450 brings more photo processing functions to the home. People can now save and organize their digital photos on CD, print from a cell phone, view their photos on a television and much more. The Lexmark P450 is quite intuitive, easy to use and affordably priced," said Najib Bahous, president of Lexmark’s Consumer Printer Division.

This printer will compete with many other portable printers such as the popular and slightly cheaper HP Photosmart 375.

The Lexmark P450 is scheduled to be released in the USA in October, with an estimated retail price of $199USD, and &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; in November, with an estimated retail price of $299CAD. It is scheduled to be released in other countries shortly thereafter.

Rhythm and blues artist &lt;a href="w%3AD%27Angelo"&gt;D’Angelo&lt;/a&gt; was able to walk out of Judge William R. Shelton’s &lt;a href="w%3A%20Chesterfield%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Chesterfield County&lt;/a&gt; courthouse in &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; on Monday after being given a 3-year suspended sentence for possession of &lt;a href="w%3Acocaine"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt;.

D’Angelo, also known as Michael Eugene Archer, 31, pleaded &lt;a href="w%3Ano%20contest"&gt;no contest&lt;/a&gt; to the charge. The appearance in court, by the now heavier-set Archer who was once known for his trim physique, was the result of a traffic stop for driving 61 mph in a 45 zone. In connection with the incident, he was also charged with &lt;a href="w%3ADrunk%20driving%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;driving while intoxicated&lt;/a&gt; (DUI), and possession of marijuana and cocaine.

Archer avoided jail time for all charges in the incident. In April, his driving privileges were suspended for one year, and he received a 90-day suspended sentence, plus a $250 fine, for the DUI conviction. On the marijuana charge, he received a $50 fine and 10-day suspended sentence.

At the time of his arrest, traces of cocaine were found on a folded dollar bill.

D’Angelo received &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20Award"&gt;Grammy&lt;/a&gt; awards for “Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance” and
”Best R&amp;B Album” in 2001.

As they have done for the last four years, &lt;a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) scientists were measuring an approximate 100 square mile bulge in central &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href="w%3AThree%20Sisters"&gt;South Sister&lt;/a&gt; this past August. The bulge is located 25 miles outside of the city of Bend, Ore. and three miles from the South Sister.

The results of this years survey won't be available for some weeks, but geologists have come to some conclusions based on the past four years of monitoring. The intial discovery was made by using information from the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency's&lt;/a&gt; (ESA) Interferometric Satellite Aperture Radar satellite. Scientists believe the bulge is rising at a rate of 1.4 inches per year and is due to a large lake of fluid (likely &lt;a href="w%3Amagma"&gt;magma&lt;/a&gt;) that is 4.5 miles below the surface. They also think the fluid covers an area about one mile across and extends to a depth of 65 feet. The pooling fluid could be shifting magma or the creation of a new &lt;a href="w%3AVolcano"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt;. 

Ground swells aren't an extraodinary occurrence in geology. Geologists suspect that these ground swellings occur in the &lt;a href="w%3ACascades"&gt;Cascade Range&lt;/a&gt; and at other volcanoes, and the majority of them do not lead to eruptions. Using the same ESA satellite technology, geologists have seen lots of bulges in the &lt;a href="w%3AAleutian%20Islands"&gt;Aleutian Islands&lt;/a&gt; that have not lead to eruptions.

On the 20th birthday of &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;'s mascots, &lt;a href="w%3AMario"&gt;Mario&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href="w%3ALuigi%20%28Nintendo%29"&gt;Luigi&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo has released the newest addition to the popular &lt;a href="w%3AGame%20Boy"&gt;Game Boy&lt;/a&gt; line.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGame%20Boy%20Micro"&gt;Game Boy Micro&lt;/a&gt; is the smallest handheld release by Nintendo to date. Unlike other handhelds in the &lt;a href="w%3AGame%20Boy%20Advance"&gt;Game Boy Advance&lt;/a&gt; series, the Game Boy Micro can only play Game Boy Advance games and not games designed for the original Game Boy system. The handheld features a new link port, includes multiple removable faceplates, and additional faceplates can be purchased separately. This system has an &lt;a href="w%3AMSRP"&gt;MSRP&lt;/a&gt; of USD$99.99.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Senate%20questions%20Roberts%20in%20confirmation%20hearings&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="John%20Roberts"&gt;John Roberts&lt;/a&gt; sat before the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in his third day of confirmation hearings. Members of the nation's highest legislative house questioned him on his ideology, deciding whether they should confirm his appointment as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Chief%20Justice"&gt;Chief Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Roberts flatly refused to say about when he believes life begins, an important question when considering the ethics of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , saying that it would be unethical to comment on the specifics of likely cases. He did, however, reiterate his earlier statement that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoe%20v.%20Wade"&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was the "settled law of the land", emphasizing the importance of consistent Supreme Court rulings. He also confirmed that he believed in the implied &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aright%20to%20privacy"&gt;right to privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which the Roe decision depended upon.

Senator &lt;a href="Jeff%20Sessions"&gt;Jeff Sessions&lt;/a&gt; asked Roberts about his opinion of yesterday's California ruling against the use of the words "under God" in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APledge%20of%20Alliegance"&gt;Pledge of Alliegance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which is recited daily at most public schools. Roberts noted that the Supreme Court has previously been inconsistent in its application of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aestablishment%20clause"&gt;establishment clause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and that it should try to correct the situation, but didn't hint at his stance on the issue.

Asked about the recent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKelo%20v.%20New%20London"&gt;Kelo v. New London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ruling, a case involving the government's power to seize property, Roberts called on state and federal legislatures to limit the power of local governments: "The court was saying there is this power, and it is up to the legislature to decide if this power is available."

Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Leahy"&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; inquired if Roberts believed the President had war powers allowing him to torture prisoners. "I believe no one is above the law in our system," Roberts replied.

Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed frustration at what they see as Roberts dodging their questions, but commentators expressed irony at the complaint; as one letter-writer to a California newspaper noted, "When is the last time that you heard one of those politicians give a direct answer to a specific question?"

The August Bank Holiday weekend, as usual, played host to many festivals and musical events around the UK, not least the &lt;a href="w%3ACamel%20Rock"&gt;Camel Rock Festival&lt;/a&gt; held at Porthcressa on the &lt;a href="w%3AIsles%20of%20Scilly"&gt;Isles of Scilly&lt;/a&gt;. But will it be the last?

Local bands included those formed at the Five Islands' School, the members of the Steamband under the temporary name Senile Shambles and the rhythm and blues band, Roadrunner. Bands imported from mainland England included Murdoch, from Manchester.

The event, deemed 'unique' in the local press, raises money for local musical projects on the islands. It's future is, as always, in doubt due to the amount of work for organisers and volunteers, especially for the clean-up operation. Organiser Paul Lewis hopes that the event will return next year as long as there are still volunteers.

Clarksfield Township, Ohio - The children looked ordinary enough to neighbors and seemed polite, well-behaved, well-dressed. They spent their apparently carefree days playing in a toy-filled yard.

But at night, the 11 children were not treated like ordinary children, authorities say. Their adoptive parents allegedly forced several of them to sleep in homemade cages about 3 1/2 feet high.

Their adoptive parents, Michael Gravelle, 56, and Sharen Gravelle, 57, denied in a custody hearing Monday they abused or neglected the children, aged one to 14, who have conditions that include &lt;a href="w%3AAutism"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFetal%20alcohol%20syndrome"&gt;fetal alcohol syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.

The cages had mats and the house smelled of urine. They also had alarms that sounded when they were opened.

Neighbors said that the children were polite and well-behaved. They never saw any signs of abuse.

The children have been placed with foster families and appear to be doing well, authorities said. Charges have yet to be filed.

A class-action suit has been filed with the Superior court of the state of &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; accusing &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; of failing to ensure their suppliers' employees work in acceptable conditions.

The complaint accuses Wal-Mart of failing to adequately police garment suppliers and ensure that workers are not kept in sweatshop conditions, and that this is in breach of their own Code of Conduct for foreign suppliers. Wal-Mart counters that they have an extensive programme to ensure suppliers adhere to their Code of Conduct; that 200 full-time inspectors are employed to check supplier factories, and 108 factories have been permanently banned as suppliers. However, this is mainly for child labor violations.

This is part of an ongoing campaign against Wal-Mart by the International Labor Rights Fund &lt;a href="http%3A//www.laborrights.org/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; a labor rights group opposed to many of the business practices of Wal-Mart that they claim encourage unacceptable working conditions and salaries in developing countries.

Recently the first ever &lt;a href="w%3ANestorian"&gt;Nestorian&lt;/a&gt; Search Engine went online currently offering users more than a million resources... 

The Web site says that is the "official Search Engine for all things Nestorian." The Nestorian Search Engine has materials ranging from Assyrian, Chaldean, Biblical languages, Aramaic, Hebrew, Christianity, Judaism, Armenian texts, and much more. 

This is the only Nestorian Search Engine on the Internet. Spokesman Marcus Levine said, "Our Search Engine spiders the internet on a daily basis for Nestorian related Web sites and research materials in general." Levine said the Nestorian Search Engine is an ongoing project. 

"We are working on many features that will be of interest to Nestorians and all Christians in general such as recipes from Nestorians around the world. Users will soon be able to post their own recipes or request others. Get breaking news from your city, state or country through the free service as well as local weather - users can find out what the weather's like in their area or anywhere in the world", Levine said. 

The Nestorian Search Engine will also include a service called "Nestorian Books", which Levine said would serve as a "book finder and publishing service. We will be offering a free print-on-demand service. You can upload a PDF or MS Word doc of your manuscript and the service will publish it. The search engine will also be able to find online books within just a matter of seconds." 

Other features the Nestorian Search Engine will include: 

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Nestorian Q&amp;A♡❤♡ - Nestorian Question and Answer. Post a question and get an answer from a clergy person with the Nestorian Orthodox Church.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Nasrani Blog♡❤♡ - Users can sign up for a free blog and post their thoughts daily, every other day, or weekly with the free service.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡The Global Nestorian♡❤♡ - This is the search engine in the user's own language. Soon users will be able to search Nestorian sites in many different languages.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Free Translation Service♡❤♡ - Need a translation of a verse or passage in the Scriptures? Want to see your congregation's name in another language such as Nasramit, Hebrew or Aramaic? Users will be able to post translation requests and get their answer emailed to them.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Nestorian Chat♡❤♡ - Users will be able to start chatting soon with fellow Nestorians worldwide with the free Nestorian toolbar.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Photo Gallery♡❤♡ - Find Nestorian graphics, create your own Nestorian photo gallery or view other galleries with the click of a button.

</ul>
You can visit the beta site of the Nestorian search engine by going to this link: &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nasrani.org/search/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The Nestorian Search Engine is provided by the Nasrani-Kazaam Software Foundation and sponsored in part by the Nasrani Church of the East and Abroad which is also known officially in many parts of the world as The Nestorian Orthodox Church.

&lt;a href="w%3ALight"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="w%3ASpeed%20of%20light%23Light-slowing%20experiments"&gt;stopped&lt;/a&gt; in its tracks for more than one second, setting a new record over a thousand times longer than the previous one.

Researchers at the used a technique called &lt;a href="w%3AElectromagnetically%20induced%20transparency"&gt;electromagnetically induced transparency&lt;/a&gt; in which a beam of &lt;a href="w%3Alaser"&gt;laser&lt;/a&gt; light puts the atoms in a solid sample into a state in which a signal light pulse can be trapped.

Most previous stopped-light demonstrations have used gases rather than solid materials. Light had previously been stopped in a solid (&lt;a href="w%3AYttrium"&gt;yttrium&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ASilicate"&gt;silicate&lt;/a&gt; doped with atoms of &lt;a href="w%3Apraseodymium"&gt;praseodymium&lt;/a&gt;), but only for a few milliseconds.

Although the efficiency of the storage was low in this experiment, the researchers believe they can improve the efficiency by using a thicker sample and by increasing the concentration of praseodymium in the sample. The technique could be useful in &lt;a href="w%3AQuantum%20mechanics"&gt;quantum&lt;/a&gt; information processing applications such as &lt;a href="w%3Aquantum%20computer"&gt;quantum computer&lt;/a&gt;s.

The slow moving, and wavering between hurricane status and tropical storm Ophelia, crawled up the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; coastline from northern &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; on what appears to be a track for landfall on Thursday near &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Lookout"&gt;Cape Lookout, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AOuter%20Banks"&gt;Outer Banks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Ophelia gained some strength to a &lt;a href="w%3ASaffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale"&gt;Category 1&lt;/a&gt; hurricane over the last 24 hours while on its north-northeast track to side-swipe the protruding coastline of the Carolinas. 

Power outages were reported with sustained winds of 80 mph and rain, up to 6 inches, in the southeast portion of the state. &lt;a href="w%3AOcean%20Isle%20Beach%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Ocean Isle Beach&lt;/a&gt; closed a bridge to the barrier islands due to the rough surf conditions created by Ophelia.

Residents and tourists had been ordered on Sunday to evacuate &lt;a href="w%3A%20Ocracoke%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Ocracoke&lt;/a&gt; by governor &lt;a href="w%3A%20Mike%20Easley"&gt;Michael F. Easley&lt;/a&gt;. Tourists on &lt;a href="w%3AHatteras%20Island"&gt;Hatteras Island&lt;/a&gt; were also ordered to leave, but earlier on Monday, emergency officials for &lt;a href="w%3A%20Dare%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Dare County&lt;/a&gt; decided against an ordered evacuation for the northern portion of the Outer Banks. 

Weaker tropical and hurricane storms such as Ophelia have in the past still caused major damage from flooding in North Carolina's barrier islands from winds stirring up the shallow &lt;a href="w%3A%20Sound%20%28geography%29"&gt;sound waters&lt;/a&gt; between the mainlaind and Outer Banks.

Further inland from the storm, except for the possibility of thunderstorms, little effect from Ophelia is expected. &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia's&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Warner"&gt;Mark R. Warner&lt;/a&gt; declared a state of emergency on Monday as a precaution. Nearly two dozen F-15 fighter jets were moved from &lt;a href="w%3AHampton%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Hampton's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALangley%20Air%20Force"&gt;Langley Air Force&lt;/a&gt; base out of Ophelia's way to &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; has announced that they are recalling 3.5 million &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%202"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; power adaptors world wide. A small component in the power adaptors is vulnerable to overheating. Sony advises customers using a unit covered by the recall to unplug it and wait until a replacement AC adaptor is provided.

This recall affects only the AC adaptors that were manufactured between August 2004 and December 2004 for the black slimline PlayStation 2, with the product identification code HP – ATH048H03. Users with an affected unit should visit the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ps2ac.com"&gt;AC Adaptor Replacement Programme&lt;/a&gt; website.

In North America, two people have suffered minor burns, one person suffered a minor shock and four people have reported property damage from the power adaptor overheating. The U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Product%20Safety%20Commission"&gt;Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt;, reported Sony has received 38 reports of adaptors overheating. Only four cases of overheating have been reported elsewhere.

Sony is not the only games console manufacturer to suffer from AC adaptor related issues. In February, &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; recalled 14 million power adaptors for the &lt;a href="w%3AXbox"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; due to a similar overheating problem.

The so-called "&lt;a href="w%3Acloture"&gt;guillotine&lt;/a&gt;" was used and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrat&lt;/a&gt; senators criticized the Government for not informing other parties that they intended to do so; Senator &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Bartlett"&gt;Andrew Bartlett&lt;/a&gt; of the Democrats said in the chamber today that the Liberal senators actions were "arrogant" and that these senators used the guillotine "because [they] can". Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; of the Greens had said "This is a disgraceful day for democracy."

Opposition members attempted to move amendments or motions to try and extend debate, furthermore Democrats senators moved amendments based on advice from the &lt;a href="w%3AACCC"&gt;ACCC&lt;/a&gt;, but these were defeated in another sequence of several divisions.

Later in the day (after debate was suspended due to &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt; and other matters), the bills passed the &lt;a href="w%3Athird%20reading"&gt;third reading&lt;/a&gt; by a majority of two votes.

&lt;a href="w%3AFrances%20Newton"&gt;Frances Newton&lt;/a&gt; was put to death by &lt;a href="w%3Alethal%20injection"&gt;lethal injection&lt;/a&gt; in the US state of &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, September 14, 2005, for the murder of her husband and two children in April of 1987. 

Her parents watched the execution in Huntsville where a few dozen demonstrators gathered outside to protest. Frances Newton was the first state-sponsored execution of an &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican-American"&gt;African-American&lt;/a&gt; female in Texas since the civil war. Newton is the third woman put to death by the state of Texas since &lt;a href="w%3ACapital%20punishment"&gt;capital punishment&lt;/a&gt; resumed following the end of a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; national moratorium on the death penalty in 1982.

According to the police, the motive for the murders was collection of $100,000 in life insurance. Newton stated that a drug dealer committed the killings. Prosecutors say that gunpowder residue was found on Newton's skirt. Ballistics tests also backed up police claims that the pistol in question was the murder weapon. The defense rebuffed this by saying that police had, in fact, found two weapons. The defense also stated that the residue could have come from standard garden fertilizer.

In 1998 hundreds protested the execution of &lt;a href="w%3AKarla%20Faye%20Tucker"&gt;Karla Faye Tucker&lt;/a&gt;, the first woman put to death in Texas since the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20War"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; era. &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Perry"&gt;Rick Perry&lt;/a&gt;, the Governor of Texas, had postponed Newton's sentence to allow further investigation of evidence. Once the governor was convinced the state's case was solid, he allowed the execution to proceed. 

Frances Newton of Texas was 40.

Parts of central Tauranga city in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; were evacuated around lunchtime today after a man threatened to detonate a bomb unless he was allowed to speak to the Prime Minister, &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;.

The man is said to have entered the Devonport Towers hotel at around 11:15 am. When hotel staff attempted to remove him, he claimed that his backpack was packed with explosives.

Police are negotiating with the man via telephone. Tauranga resident Erin Cornwall said that police have been called in from Auckland to help deal with the situation. It appears that the man is a foreign student who has a grievance related to the expiry of his residence permit.

Tauranga is one of the most hotly contested electorates in the New Zealand parliamentary general election to be held this Saturday. The result of the electorate voting for Tauranga will decide whether MP Winston Peters retains his long-held seat. If Peters loses Tauranga and his NZ First party fails to get 5% of the party vote, then NZ First will not be represented in the next parliament.

The Prime Minister has been informed of the situation, but has declined to speak to the man. She is currently in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; campaigning for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;.

In an ironic turn of events, Winston Peters, well known for his intolerant views on immigration, is reported to have offered to negotiate with the man.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; High Court has unanimously ruled that the controversial &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20West%20Bank%20barrier"&gt;wall&lt;/a&gt; separating Israel from the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt; should be rerouted.

The panel of nine justices gave their ruling on a petition submitted by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and ordered that alternative routes be investigated around the settlement of Alefei Menashe. The court ruling orders that the existing wall in the area be demolished and rebuilt nearer to the settlement.

The rerouting of the wall will result in the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Territories"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; village of Qalqilya, and four others, being on the West Bank side of the barrier.

The barrier has been a contentious issue between Israelis and Palestinians since construction began. Israel's government ignored last year's non-binding ruling by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;International Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; which declared the barrier illegal.

In dawn raids ordered by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Clarke"&gt;Charles Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, seven people have been detained in London and Greater Manchester.

The seven, who are believed to all be &lt;a href="w%3AAlgeria"&gt;Algerian&lt;/a&gt;, are thought to include some of those allegedly involved in an earlier &lt;a href="w%3Aricin"&gt;ricin&lt;/a&gt; poisoning plot.

The Home Secretary ordered the raids based on information provided by police and other security forces. Those seized may appeal against deportation, but are deemed a "threat to national security" by the &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Office"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt;. According to officials, those detained were done so using powers granted under the &lt;a href="w%3AImmigration%20Act%201971"&gt;Immigration Act of 1971&lt;/a&gt;, not under the recently passed legislation aimed at removing radical muslim clerics from the country.

In the aftermath of the disaster in &lt;a href="New%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, questions have arisen as to whether the Bush administration withheld the deployment of troops and other assistance pending an agreement by the Louisiana Governor, Kathleen Blanco, to authorize the invocation of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInsurrection%20Act"&gt;Insurrection Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which would have legally allowed Bush to declare martial law and take control of the rescue and rebuilding effort.

The NY Times on Sept. 8 reported that "As New Orleans descended into chaos last week and Louisiana's governor asked for 40,000 soldiers, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's senior advisers debated whether the president should speed the arrival of active-duty troops by seizing control of the hurricane relief mission from the governor." But how this step would have improved the response time is not clear.

It is also unclear as to why such a move would be considered at all as no legal requirement was at issue, leading to the question of whether this was what some fear to have been a political power grab.
The same Times article quotes unnamed official(s) saying that "no active-duty forces could have been sent into the chaos of New Orleans on Wednesday or Thursday without confronting law-and-order challenges." But though the law does bar US Military forces from law enforcement duties absent a declaration of martial law, there are no restrictions on their use in other capacities. Bush authorized more than 7,000 additional active duty troops on September 3 to join the more than 21,000 National Guard troops and more than 4,000 active duty forces deployed to the ravaged gulf region on September 1st and 2nd, law-and-order challenges taking a back seat to the urgency of the rescue mission.

Navy helicopters were over the city on August 30th and landing craft busy the following day. More than 400 members of the Army Corps of Engineers were on site, working to repair the levee system in New Orleans and removing floodwaters from the city. By September 2nd, 113 DoD helicopters, about half from the National Guard and half from active-duty Navy, Army and Air Force units, were continuing to support search and recovery missions.

The National Guard, which remains under the authority of the Governor of the state, are legally authorized and trained for law enforcement duties and the Times article goes on to say that "Pentagon officials said even the 82nd Airborne, which has a brigade on standby to move out within 18 hours, could not arrive any faster than 7,000 National Guard troops, which are specially trained and equipped for civilian law enforcement duties."

The Louisiana National Guard was conspicuously absent following the flooding and four days passed without relief. Several states offered emergency supplies, equipment and units from their National Guard. "&lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; Gov. Bill Richardson offered Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco help from his state's National Guard on Sunday, the day before Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana. Blanco accepted, but paperwork needed to get the troops en route didn't come from Washington until late Thursday."

Similarly, FEMA has been roundly criticized for its own failure to fulfill its emergency command and control mandate during the same period of time. Though on-site before the hurricane struck, many stories of manpower, equipment and supplies being refused have surfaced. Jefferson Parish President Aaron Broussard has accused FEMA of cutting their local communication lines in the midst of the crisis. FEMA chief Mike Brown was ultimately removed from his post on Friday Sept. 9th.

Also on Friday National Guard units arrived in force and brought food and water, medical personnel, and quickly quelled the rampant looting that had beset the city during the previous days. 

Without a full investigation, it is impossible to say what caused these delays. This disaster was unprecedented in scope and hit an area long known to be exceptionally vulnerable to catastrophic damage from a hurricane. But the length of the delay and the breadth of the failures have been widely condemned and demands for an explanation have come from both sides of the political aisle.

&lt;a href="Delta%20Airlines"&gt;Delta Airlines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Northwest%20Airlines"&gt;Northwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, the third and fourth-largest &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; airlines, filed for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy protection from creditors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Wednesday. Together with &lt;a href="United%20Airlines"&gt;United&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Airways"&gt;US Airways&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , four of the seven biggest US carriers are now operating under bankruptcy protection, representing 51% of US passenger flight capacity. 

The filing occurred due to rising fuel prices, high labor expenses and competition from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alow-cost%20carrier"&gt;low-fare carriers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Delta and Northwest both said that bankruptcy protection would cause no changes for passengers in their flight schedules and frequent-flyer schemes. However, analysts say that cuts in some flights can be expected in the future.

The body’s is less effective at quashing disease than it could be - but if it were better the immune system might do more harm than good, according to new research by Michael Deem and colleagues of in .

The immune system has apparently evolved to be mildly inefficient so that it achieves a balance between quick response to disease and decreased probability of , a condition in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue.

The authors drew their conclusions from a model of the dynamics of . Their simulations show that while there are mechanisms that would allow the immune system to develop antibodies that respond faster and more strongly against invading , those mechanisms would also create antibodies that are likely to attack the body’s own healthy cells. The model also bolsters controversial suggestions that chronic infections could lead the immune system awry, ultimately resulting in or other autoimmune ailments.

The study will be detailed in a forthcoming issue of the journal .

&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s popular political talk show, Muang Thai Rai Sapda has been dropped by Channel 9. Hosted by Sondi Limthongkul, the show was notorious for its criticism of the Thai government. This happens as much of Thai media is being bought by a government-allied media conglomerate, GMM.

Sondhi, the presenter, and founder of a popular magazine, Pujatkran (Eng: Manager), accused the network of making a politically motivated decision.

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; announced on Thursday the release dates for the new version of the Xbox gaming console. The &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; will be in shops in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; on November 22. It will be launched in &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; on December 2 and in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; on December 10.

The Xbox 360 in the US and Europe will come in two editions, base and premium. The premium edition will include the console, an external hard drive, wireless controllers, headset and membership in the &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20Live"&gt;Xbox Live&lt;/a&gt; gaming service. The base version will only include the console and a wired controller. The base edition will sell for £209.99 in the UK, €299.99 in Europe and $299.99 in the USA. The premium edition will sell for £279.99 in the UK and $399.99 in the USA. A third edition with nearly identical features to the premium edition will be available in Japan for ¥37,900.

Microsoft has said up to 20 games would be ready by the launch date, and 40 games should be launched by the end of 2005. "We expect a strong portfolio of titles on launch day and through the holidays that will appeal to fans of every genre and gamers in every region," said Chief Xbox officer Robbie Bach.

The launch date is two days before &lt;a href="w%3AThanksgiving"&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt;, the traditional start of the US Christmas buying season. A November launch will give Microsoft a lead over competitors &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;. Sony plans to release the &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%203"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; in the spring of 2006, and Nintendo plans to release its new console, the &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo%20Revolution"&gt;Revolution&lt;/a&gt;, sometime next year.

With recovery from &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt; still under way, &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Ophelia"&gt;Hurricane Ophelia&lt;/a&gt; has now cut power to nearly 81,000 homes and businesses on the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Eastern coast&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.

On Thursday, the storm moved slowly up the coast of North Carolina, causing considerable damage. Alton Ballance, a resident of the affected area, said that the storm was "just beating us to death. It's similar to the wintertime &lt;a href="w%3ANor%27easter"&gt;nor'easters&lt;/a&gt; that lay there and beat you for a couple of days.".

A small &lt;a href="w%3ASaffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale"&gt;Category 1&lt;/a&gt; hurricane, with top wind speeds of 85 mph (136 kph), Ophelia is nearly stalled in its current position in North Carolina and, in the words of another resident, Laurie Garner, "It just beat us and beat us and beat us."

"The &lt;a href="http%3A//ncnatural.com/Coast/dynamics.html"&gt;barrier islands&lt;/a&gt; will be getting hammered one way coming up and the other way going back out," said the Governor of North Carolina, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Easley"&gt;Mike Easley&lt;/a&gt;.

Former United States President &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Ford"&gt;Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; (born Leslie Lynch King, Jr.) died yesterday at 6.45 pm PST (0345 UTC Wednesday) at his home in &lt;a href="w%3ARancho%20Mirage%2C%20California"&gt;Rancho Mirage, California&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 93.

Gerald Ford was a prominent politician from &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Grand Rapids, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; before his appointment to the vice-presidency, having served in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; for 24 years from 1949 to 1973 and acted as &lt;a href="w%3AMinority%20Leader%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Minority Leader&lt;/a&gt;. He was appointed &lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Vice President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; following the resignation of &lt;a href="w%3ASpiro%20Agnew"&gt;Spiro Agnew&lt;/a&gt;.

Ford was sworn in as the 38th &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; following the resignation of &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Nixon"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; in 1974 following the &lt;a href="w%3AWatergate%20scandal"&gt;Watergate scandal&lt;/a&gt;. He served the appointed term and ran an unsuccessful re-election bid for the office of the presidency in 1976 against &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt;. Ford is the only president to have held the office of the presidency without ever having been elected to either the presidency or the office of the vice-presidency.

Ford's presidency was marked by his pardon of former President Nixon, a controversial move that many felt cost him the 1976 election. Ford also attempted to tackle inflation (at the time, only a modest 7%) with a public relations campaign to "&lt;a href="w%3AWhip%20inflation%20now"&gt;whip inflation now&lt;/a&gt;". Ford's presidency also saw the final United States evacuation of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Vietnam"&gt;South Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.

Once one of the most active former Presidents, in recent years Ford was perceived as becoming increasingly frail, particularly since suffering a small stroke in 2000. For the first time since becoming active in national politics, he did not attend the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Convention"&gt;Republican National Convention&lt;/a&gt; in 2004. He also did not attend the inauguration of President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 — former President &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; indicated in an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20King"&gt;Larry King&lt;/a&gt; that Ford was increasingly uncomfortable flying. In 2006, he was hospitalized on four separate occasions by the month of November.

Ford was the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20United%20States%20Presidents%20by%20longevity"&gt;longest-lived President&lt;/a&gt; in the history of the United States surpassing &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; on November 12, 2006; the oldest-living President is now &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George H. W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. After a state funeral in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, Ford's body will lie in state in &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Grand Rapids, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum, before a private burial outside the museum.

&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s popular political talk show, Muang Thai Rai Sapda has been dropped by Channel 9. Hosted by Sondi Limthongkul, the show was notorious for its criticism of the Thai government.

Sondhi, the presenter, and founder of a popular newspaper and magazine, Pujatkran (Eng: Manager), accused the network of making a politically motivated decision.

MCOT Plc, which owns the channel, issued a statement saying the company had to remove the programme after several warnings to Sondhi to exercise caution when making comments and to adhere to the basic journalistic principle of not violating the rights and freedom of others.

It said Sondhi had made several one-sided attacks on people who had no chance of countering his accusations. According to the statement, in his 8 September programme Sondhi said the appointment of the interim Supreme Patriarch infringed on a royal prerogative and had made reference to the monarchy in a way that might cause public misunderstanding.

Reacting to the accusation, Sondhi said MCOT distorted the facts to turn public sentiment against him. "I don't mind being removed because I am critical of the government, but do not say that I infringed on a royal prerogative," he said. Sondhi said his reference to the monarchy was made with respect.

In a speech before the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; called for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20headquarters"&gt;UN headquarters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to be moved out of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Chávez cited the &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; and the US' alleged disregard for the will of the United Nations as his reasoning for proposing the pullout. He then went on to criticize the proposed UN reforms, saying they were "illegal" as they did not take into account anti-poverty goals set out in a 2000 summit. Proposing sweeping reforms, including the elimination of Security Council members' veto powers, Chávez described the UN as unfit for the 21st century.
In a comment more related to the frosty relationship between the US and Venezuela, Chávez expressed regret that &lt;a href="Pat%20Robertson"&gt;Pat Robertson&lt;/a&gt; remained at liberty. Chávez has branded Robertson a terrorist for implying that the US would do well to assassinate the Venezuelan President.

The current summit marks the sixtieth anniversary of the formation of the United Nations, and many world leaders have gathered to work out reforms to the organization to make it more relevant in today's world.

A &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese non-profit organisation Hiroshima Semipalatinsk Project will send their 8th medical aid visiting team to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASemey"&gt;Semey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;, known as Semipalatinsk under the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;USSR&lt;/span&gt; reign, reported a regional newspaper, Chugoku Shimbun. The team will consist of seven medical staffs, doctors and nurses, including Professor Masaharu Hoshi of the Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine at Hiroshima University. They will visit Semey from 19 September till 26 to examine radioactive exposed people and give medical instruments to local hospitals.

Hiroshima Semipalatinsk Project (HSP)　was founded in 1999 by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHiroshima"&gt;Hiroshima&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; citizens, many of whom or their relatives suffered radiation exposure due to the atomic bomb dropped by the US army in 1945. When in 1994 Hiroshima hosted the Asia Games, a Hiroshima citizen met a Kazakh and eventually became aware of another group of "Hibakusha". In Semey approximately 470 atomic bomb experiments were held between 1949 and 1989 by the USSR government. Residents have been severely affected by radiation. Following the Hiroshima Semipalatinsk Project it is reported that 1.2 million people are affected by the fallouts and over 300,000 people have suffered of radiation exposure in that area, mainly in the city of Semey with a population of 350,000. 

Since its foundation in 1999, HSP continues to aid Kazakhs and endeavours to provide the public with information about suffering in the area. The organisation gives Kazakhs not only medical aid but also social aid through student exchange programs for highschool students.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALeadership"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, incoming &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJens%20Stoltenberg"&gt;Jens Stoltenberg&lt;/a&gt;, announced yesterday that Norway is to withdraw the remainder of its &lt;a href="w%3ATroop"&gt;troops&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="w%3ANato"&gt;Nato&lt;/a&gt; member Norway still has approximately 20 &lt;a href="w%3AOfficer%20%28armed%20forces%29"&gt;military officers&lt;/a&gt; stationed in Iraq. They participate in the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20Training"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; of Iraqi troops with the &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; divisions. Previously Norway had approximately 170 &lt;a href="w%3ASoldier"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt; stationed in Iraq, of which most were withdrawn in &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt; due to lack of popular and &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; support.

Stoltenberg notified &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; of his decision on Thursday, when Bush called to congratulate him on his election victory. Norwegians voted in Monday's &lt;a href="w%3AParliament"&gt;parliamentary&lt;/a&gt; elections in favour of a &lt;a href="w%3ARed-Green%20Alliance"&gt;red-green alliance&lt;/a&gt; headed by Stoltenberg's Labour party, ousting the &lt;a href="w%3ACentre-right"&gt;centre-right&lt;/a&gt; government.

Retiring Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AKjell%20Magne%20Bondevik"&gt;Kjell Magne Bondevik&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACritic"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; Stoltenberg's &lt;a href="w%3ADecision"&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; as inconsistent. He said Labour's plan to withdraw the same troops it previously supported sending to Iraq was &lt;a href="w%3AContradiction"&gt;contradictory&lt;/a&gt;.

States "rights" battle unfolding.

In an address to the nation on Thursday, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; laid out a sweeping set of initiatives to aid the rebuilding effort of the &lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Coast"&gt;gulf region&lt;/a&gt; and called for an investigation into what went wrong in the &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;disaster&lt;/a&gt; and how better to respond in the future.

Following a list of economic stimulus programs designed to aid small businesses and individuals, the president called for something sure to draw fierce debate, a broadening of Federal power to declare martial law.

This follows on the heels of the Bush administration's failed effort to have &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href="w%3AKathleen%20Blanco"&gt;Kathleen Blanco&lt;/a&gt; sign documents allowing Bush to invoke the &lt;a href="w%3AInsurrection%20Act"&gt;Insurrection Act&lt;/a&gt; during the height of the crisis in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

Sparking controversy and eliciting widespread condemnation in an interview with the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s President, &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, has made some poorly-judged comments about &lt;a href="w%3Arape"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt; and rape victims.

Musharaff was quoted as having said, "Rape has become a money-making concern" and he suggested that getting raped was a method of getting a visa to western countries.

Activists and opposition MPs alike condemned Musharaff's comments. The high-profile rape victim, &lt;a href="w%3AMukhtar%20Mai"&gt;Mukhtar Mai&lt;/a&gt;, dismissed the idea that any woman could allow herself to be subjected to such treatment for money. Her case attracted widespread international media attention with it being alleged that her rape was ordered by the local &lt;a href="w%3Apanchayat"&gt;panchayat&lt;/a&gt; (town council).

In New York, speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative, British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; spoke with "brutal honesty" about the &lt;a href="w%3AUNFCCC"&gt;UNFCCC&lt;/a&gt;'s Kyoto protocol and global warming.

Blair, a longtime supporter of the Kyoto treaty, recognized that countries will not accept the limits imposed on Kyoto: "No country is going to cut its growth."

Of India and China, "They're not going to start negotiating another treaty like Kyoto." India and China are classified as developing countries in the Kyoto protocol, so they can get money and technology but are not restricted by its limits.

His approach: "What countries will do is work together to develop the science and technology….There is no way that we are going to tackle this problem unless we develop the science and technology to do it."

A team of scientists from universities in and have developed a theory that explains the patterns of fine bubbles that arise in a freshly poured glass of &lt;a href="w%3Achampagne%20%28beverage%29"&gt;champagne&lt;/a&gt;. 

The bubble patterns evolve as the amount of dissolved changes in the glass. They start out as strings of bubbles that rise in pairs, then gradually transition to bubbles in groups of threes, and finally settle down in a clockwork pattern of regularly spaced individual bubbles.

The researchers observed the carbon dioxide bubbles in a champagne glass as they rise from nucleation points on the glass wall. The nucleation points are small defects in the glass that trap tiny vibrating pockets of carbon dioxide. Dissolved gas in the champagne gradually collects in a vibrating bubble inside the defect, causing it to grow and soon expel gas from the defect, forming another bubble that sticks to the outside of the defect. That bubble, in turn, grows as more dissolved carbon dioxide collects inside it and it eventually breaks free of the defect to rise through the champagne. Then the process begins again with a new bubble expelled from the defect, forming rising strings of tiny bubbles.

The patterns are determined by the vibration rate of the gas trapped in the defect and the growth rate of the bubbles outside the defect, which are in turn determined by such things as the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of the champagne, the champagne temperature, and the size of the nucleation defect in the glass, among other factors.

The work could be important in understanding bubbles formed of dissolved gasses in other situations, such as nitrogen bubbles that grow in the blood vessels of surfacing divers and can cause the , and the explosive release of carbon dioxide gas from 's that killed over 1800 people in 1986.

According to a recent patent published by &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer%2C%20Inc."&gt;Apple Computer, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, future Mac laptops will come with built-in video cameras. Ostensibly, they would be used with the company's iChat AV video conferencing software, which allows for four-way video conferencing, and up to ten-way audio conferencing.

The patent reveals plans for a laptop with a swiveling lid, which rotates on the base. The camera, or, as the patent describes, "data capture device," would be placed on top of the lid of the laptops, where it would "secure the lid to the base," according to the patent. 

The patent is not unclear; it is firmly in the direction of developing a video camera built into a laptop.

However, it is not entirely focused on laptops; a quote from the patent says it all: "For example, although the invention is primarily directed at a camera latch for a laptop computer, it should be noted that concepts disclosed herein may also be applied to other electronic devices, including but not limited to PDAs, music players, mobile phones and the like or I/O devices such as monitors, televisions and the like."

The camera could be configured to produce either streaming video, video stills, or images taken at intervals, and the camera would most likely have a built-in microphone.

An &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson confirmed Thursday that &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; would no longer be offering servers with Intel &lt;a href="w%3AItanium"&gt;Itanium&lt;/a&gt; CPUs. The spokesperson said "Losing Dell as an Itanium customer is unfortunate but frankly, we see their impact as negligible." Servers with Itanium CPUs are no longer promoted on Dell's website, though a few can be found by searching.
Dell is the largest seller of computers with Intel processors. Dell currently sells 10.5 percent of all servers worldwide. The majority of Dell servers use an &lt;a href="w%3AIA-32"&gt;IA-32&lt;/a&gt; (colloquially "x86") chip, but a growing number use the &lt;a href="w%3A64-bit"&gt;64-bit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIntel%20Xeon"&gt;Intel Xeon&lt;/a&gt;. Sales of Itanium servers have been very poor; last year Dell sold only 1,371 Itanium servers, up from 12 the previous year. In February, &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; also phased out Itanium-based servers, replacing them with IBM &lt;a href="w%3AIBM%20POWER"&gt;Power&lt;/a&gt; CPUs. &lt;a href="w%3AFujitsu"&gt;Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHP"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHitachi%2C%20Ltd."&gt;Hitachi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANEC%20Corporation"&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASilicon%20Graphics"&gt;SGI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUnisys"&gt;Unisys&lt;/a&gt; are the only major manufacturers to still offer Itanium-based servers.

The Intel Itanium was designed in the early 1990s. It was intended to be the processor of choice for 64-bit computers, but the processor suffered from several major flaws preventing widespread adoption. Unlike competing &lt;a href="w%3AAMD64"&gt;AMD64&lt;/a&gt; chips, the Intel Itanium uses a different instruction set from IA-32 chips. An emulation feature allows them to run IA-32 code, but only very slowly; users were forced to choose between accepting greatly-reduced performance and expending time and programmers' salaries porting their software. Even Intel has acquiesced to AMD's leadership in this field, designing chips with a compatible &lt;a href="w%3AEM64T"&gt;EM64T&lt;/a&gt; technology.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Deadly%20car%20bomb%20explosion%20rocks%20Beirut&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The seemingly endless saga of car bombings continued to haunt citizens of Lebanon on Friday night, when an explosion ripped through multiple cars and buildings, killing one and injuring 19 people. 

The blast took place close to midnight near Byblos Bank in the J'eitawi district of Ashrafieh in Beirut. 

<h3>Bomb triggered by timer</h3>

Major General Ashraf Rifi, commander of the Internal Security Forces, confirmed that the bomb was put in a bag and placed between two cars. Rifi was also able to identify a timer used to detonate the bomb.

The bomb shattered through a nearby coffee shop, killing the shop owner upon impact. 

Lebanese security forces were quick to respond. They cordoned the bomb site in a swift and professional manner, preventing people from tampering with the evidence.

<h3>Dwindling confidence</h3>

A series of car bombings preceded this latest explosion, predominantly in Christian areas. While the people are losing count of the bombings, no arrests have been made so far. Public confidence in Lebanon's security state is extremely low, understandably so with the lack of closure to virtually identical crimes.

The bombing is the first since the string of arrests of individuals suspected of murdering Premier Rafik Hariri on February 14, 2005. Chief investigator Detlev Mehlis has yet to draw a link between the perpetrators of the Valentines Day massacre, and the subsequent series of car bombings and targeted assassinations since. 

The latest exposure of Lebanon's shaky security state comes at a time when the country's two top leaders are absent.

President Emile Lahoud is in New York. Despite &lt;a href="http%3A//yalibnan.com/site/archives/2005/09/lahoud_travels.php"&gt;repeated calls&lt;/a&gt; for Lahoud to cancel his trip, he insisted on attending the U.N. General Assembly, where he delivered a speech today. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora boycotted Lahoud's delegation, declaring it unwise for both the President and Prime Minister to be absent with the current security state.

Despite his previous reservations, Siniora flew to New York on Friday to lead the 'Help Lebanon' conference. The premier will be soliciting international aid to fund political, economic, social and judicial reforms in a post-Syria occupied Lebanon.

A court has freed prominent Malawian politician &lt;a href="w%3AGwanda%20Chakuamba"&gt;Gwanda Chakuamba&lt;/a&gt; on bail after Chakuamba denied ridiculing &lt;a href="w%3AMalawi"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3ABingu%20wa%20Mutharika"&gt;Bingu wa Mutharika&lt;/a&gt; at a political rally. Ridiculing the head of state is a crime in Malawi, with a potential penalty ranging from a $20 fine to three years in prison.

Prosecutor Mcleod Mlonda objected to the ruling, stating that he was worried that as Chakuamba was an influential figure, he would use his freedom to tamper with the evidence. Magistrate David Kadwa disagreed though, stating that he found it unlikely that Chakuamba would be able to interfere with the evidence, as there had been hundreds of witnesses present when the alleged comments were made. For his part, Chakuamba has denied the charges.

Chakuamba was ejected from Malawi's cabinet for allegedly buying a limousine with government funds last week, amid rumours of an internal power struggle. Prosecutors accuse him of labelling the President a "drunkard and a brute" .

The Spanish word "&lt;a href="w%3ATortuga"&gt;tortuga&lt;/a&gt;" means "turtle." But in the wake of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; disaster, the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Tortuga%20%28LSD-46%29"&gt;USS Tortuga&lt;/a&gt; is helping other animals.
For nearly two weeks now, sailors from Tortuga's repair division have devoted much of their time during this disaster relief operation to ensure the health and comfort of displaced pets.

September 4th, just after the ship moored to a pier at Naval Support Activity (NSA) New Orleans, HT1(SW) Mark Hanley and DC1(SW) Antony Graves gathered materials from the repair shop on board to construct a kennel along the levee. The facility they made soon became a popular shelter for the homeless animals of the storm.

Tortuga's search and rescue team brought aboard more than 170 displaced citizens during this past week, providing them with food, water, medical aid and a place to sleep.
Tortuga's makeshift kennel, named ‘Camp Milo &amp; Otis,' has housed as many as 90 dogs, eight cats, one rabbit, one guinea pig, a pair of parakeets and a flightless pigeon during the past week of operation.

Currently, there are 14 dogs that remain in Tortuga's care, as many of the other pets have been taken to animal shelters in the area for extra medical attention, or been claimed by their owners upon arrival to Tortuga. The pets that Tortuga has registered have all been in the hands of professional veterinarians assigned to provide expert medical attention to the members of Camp Milo &amp; Otis.

Dr. Kelly Crowdis and Dr. Latina Gambles, both from &lt;a href="w%3ATuskegee%20University"&gt;Tuskegee University&lt;/a&gt; and Christian Veterinary Missions, have treated many of the pets for infection, dehydration, malnourishment and broken bones at the Camp during the past week.

“The animals were bathed and assessed before physical interaction with the sailors,” said Dr. Crowdis. “They've been given immunizations, antibiotics and medications based on their medical needs.”

Dr. Crowdis added, “What these sailors have done on their own has been such a heart-warming thing. As an animal lover, it is so comforting to know that everyone cares about the animals in addition to the human lives rescued from the storm. I'm very pleased with these guys for taking the initiative to construct this kennel.”

Graves, Hanley and other members of their division have consistently bathed, fed, walked and given special attention to every dog, every day.

“We play with them,” said Hanley. “We take them out of their kennels to give them attention every day. And we'll continue to do that for as long as our ship's mission keeps us here.”
September 11th, the Agricultural Center at &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana%20State%20University"&gt;Louisiana State University&lt;/a&gt; donated supplies to “Camp Milo &amp; Otis” in support of Tortuga's efforts to help the animal victims.

”We got medical supplies, bowls, food, cages, leashes, collars, toys, cat litter and cleaning supplies from these people yesterday,” said Graves. “It's nice to know that so many people out there have heard about what our ship is doing, and responded by donating so much to support us the best they can.”

A photo gallery of unclaimed pets is on the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tortuga.navy.mil/"&gt;USS Tortuga's web site&lt;/a&gt;.

As part of disaster plans, the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; has also deployed Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams to provide medical care to pets and livestock, as well as provide any needed veterinary medical care for &lt;a href="w%3Arescue%20dog"&gt;search and rescue dog&lt;/a&gt;s.

There are over 3,850 animals being sheltered around the state. If someone is looking for a pet they should contact their nearest Humane Society or go online to http://www.petfinder.org// . More information is also available at http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu//.

Frenzied destruction of empty Jewish settlements in Gaza by Palestinian looters have marred plans for exploiting those facilities to create much needed jobs for the area.

Greenhouses in Gaza have been partly destroyed as crucial equipment was stripped by the Palestinians. Looters took everything from water pumps, plastic sheets, tubing and equipment. This makes at least one third of the hothouses at least temporarily unusable to feed the families of Gaza and for potential export to Israel.

The facilities were purchased by a group of Jewish-American donors and given to the Palestinian government to encourage economic development. It was initially anticipated over four thousand Palestinians could be given work at the greenhouses, however all offers have been suspended prior to the damage being assessed and repairs arranged.

There is a little under an hour to go until polls close in the 2005 &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; General Election.

Both National leader &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Brash"&gt;Don Brash&lt;/a&gt; and the Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; (Labour) have already cast their votes.

Nearly three million people are eligible to vote. 

Turnout has been strong, and turnout results are predicted to be higher than the 2002 turnout (77%).

Under New Zealand's &lt;a href="w%3AMixed%20Member%20Proportional"&gt;MMP&lt;/a&gt; system, parties must win either an electorate seat or 5% of the party vote to win seats in the 120-seat parliament.

Within the past 24 hours Russian and Lithuanian authorities have been haggling over the details of a crashed &lt;a href="w%3ASu-27"&gt;Su-27&lt;/a&gt; fighter-bomber and the return of her pilot. While Lithuania's commander-in-chief has ruled out a joint investigation, Russian investigators would be granted access to an analysis of the plane's &lt;a href="w%3Aflight%20recorder"&gt;flight recorder&lt;/a&gt;.

Current information suggests that the plane was flying over the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltic%20Sea"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; when it suddenly veered off course due to a failure in navigation equipment. The pilot, Major Valery Troyanov, was questioned by Lithuanian prosecutors earlier in the day. Lithuanian Defense Minister Gediminas Kirkilas said in a local radio interview: "We know that the plane flew into our territory giving a SOS signal. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov says the same. We hope further investigation will confirm it,"

While both nations are in concurrence to the cause of the crash, the pilot has been labeled a "suspect" by prosecutors and will be kept until the end of investigation.

NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; entered a new era of science operations as September began, when engineers shut down one of the three operational &lt;a href="w%3Agyroscope"&gt;gyroscope&lt;/a&gt;s aboard the observatory. The two-gyro mode is expected to preserve the operating life of the third gyro and extend Hubble's science observations through mid-2008, an eight-month extension. Switching off one gyro can preserve it for future use and extended two-gyro operational time for Hubble.
The gyros are an integral part of Hubble's complex pointing control system. The system maintains precise pointing of the telescope during science observations. The system was originally designed to operate on three gyros, with another three in reserve. Two of the six are no longer functional.

"Hubble science on two gyros will be indistinguishable from the superb science we have become accustomed to over the years," said senior Hubble scientist David Leckrone at Goddard.

Gyros are the heart, though not the sole component, of Hubble's pointing control system. When only two gyros are available, the observatory experiences an "unsensed" direction. Using Hubble's Fine Guidance Sensors, engineers were able to "fill in" the missing data normally generated by the third gyro.

Hubble also needs to know its location as it completes one observation and slews across the sky to acquire its next target. This information, previously supplied by the observatory's three gyros, is provided by onboard magnetometers and Fixed Head Star Trackers.

NASA has stated a Space Shuttle servicing mission to Hubble will be considered after two successful return-to-flight missions. The servicing mission would include installing new gyros, batteries, and science instruments to provide several more years of observations.

At 07:00 UTC today (19:00 NZST, local time), the polls closed in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20general%20election%202005"&gt;New Zealand general election, 2005&lt;/a&gt;.

Nearly three million people were eligible to vote. 

Turn out was strong, turnout results are predicted to be to be higher than the 2002 turn out (77%)

Under &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%27s"&gt;New Zealand's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAdditional%20Member%20System"&gt;MMP system&lt;/a&gt;, parties must win either a electorate seat or 5% of the party vote to win a seat in the 120-seat, parliament.

Preliminary election results will be on Wikinews as they come through &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/wiki/Results_of_2005_New_Zealand_General_Election"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it is expected that all votes will be counted by 11:30 UTC (23:30 NZST) 

The official results are expected to be available by Saturday, 1 October 2005, on the Chief Electoral Office 2005 General Election Results website &lt;a href="http%3A//www.electionresults.govt.nz"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A deal to reform the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; has been signed at the end of a summit marking the organisation's sixtieth anniversary.

The summit was the largest gathering of heads of state ever, with over 150 in attendance. During its three days, &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; was the only one of the 191 represented nations not to address the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary%20General"&gt;Secretary General&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, had put forward a wide-ranging set of reform proposals encompassing &lt;a href="w%3Apoverty"&gt;poverty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Awar"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;, and reform of the organisation itself.

Of the reforms that got through the intense diplomatic negotiations, Responsibility to Protect is one of the most significant. Rather than waiting for genocide to be demonstrated, the international community has now agreed to act in cases of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. A peacebuilding commission is also to be established by December 2005.

The opinions expressed by participants varied, with &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/a&gt; President, &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; condemning the document as having been "conceived in darkness". In stark contrast, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; ambassador, &lt;a href="John%20R.%20Bolton"&gt;John R. Bolton&lt;/a&gt;, praised the document.

<h1>Voting chaos in Germany expected</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Voting%20chaos%20in%20Germany%20expected&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Electoral voting experts are expecting a chaos in the &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20federal%20election%2C%202005"&gt;German federal election&lt;/a&gt;, caused by the by-election in the constituency of &lt;a href="w%3ADresden"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt; I, in the state of &lt;a href="w%3ASaxony"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt;. The reason is a bug in the German electoral law, which can force the voters to vote against their political party.

While in 298 of 299 constituencies the federal elections take place on September 18th, 
a Dresden constituency has to vote on October 2nd, caused by the death of the &lt;a href="w%3ANationaldemokratische%20Partei%20Deutschlands"&gt;NPD&lt;/a&gt; candidate there, Kerstin Lorenz. 

Voters in Germany have two votes, one for a candidate in their constiuency and another for the list of a party within one of Germany's sixteen states. The vote which normally defines how many seats a party gets in the Bundestag is the second vote (party vote). But due to the extreme complexity of Germany's &lt;a href="w%3AMixed%20Member%20Proportional"&gt;Mixed Member Proportional&lt;/a&gt; voting system, voters could actually have "negative vote", as constitutional lawyers call it. This is mainly caused by &lt;a href="w%3Aoverhang%20seat"&gt;overhang seats&lt;/a&gt;, which occur when a party gains more seats by winning constituencies than they would actually be entitled to according to the Percentage of second votes they get. 

Polls suggest that exactly that is going to happen with the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;CDU&lt;/a&gt; in Saxony. The CDU would then actually have to urge their supporters not to vote for them with their second vote because that could change their overhang seat into a "normal" seat, which the CDU would then be missing in another state where no overhang seats occurred thus reducing their total seats by one.

In the 2002 election 49638 party votes were cast for the CDU in Dresden I and caused them to lose the seat of Siegfried Meseck. A complaint against the 2002 election at the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Germany"&gt;German constitutional court&lt;/a&gt; is still not decided.

A story about a man carrying over 30,000 (sometimes reported as 40,000) &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVolt"&gt;volts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astatic%20electricity"&gt;static electricity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in his body, allegedly generated by a wool sweater and nylon jacket combination, is circulating through major news outlets. The story, carried first by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarrnambool%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Warrnambool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Standard, says that the man, Frank Clewer, a 58-year old cleaner from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADennington"&gt;Dennington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , involuntarily created a scene by causing fire departments to evacuate three buildings where he had left his mark, before he realized he was causing the burn marks on carpets and allowed the fire department to help him.

The story has been picked up by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Register"&gt;The Register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , local agencies of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AABC"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Chronicle"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and other news outlets.

Several unanswered objections mark the story as a possible hoax:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Clewer enters and exits his car several times in the story &amp;mdash; if he opened the car by touching its presumably metal lock, he would surely release some electricity into the car through his hand; everyone has at some point experienced the painful shock of touching a door handle or car keys to a lock. Though the car might not be &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aground%20%28electricity%29"&gt;grounded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , it would still be at a lower potential and thus energy would be transferred. This would be noticeable; the story does not comment that Clewer understood what was happening to him.
BULLET::::- Firefighters supposedly "used a device to check static electricity on him and his belongings." While firefighters would be likely to carry a high-voltage &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amultimeter"&gt;multimeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around to measure the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acurrent%20%28electricity%29"&gt;current&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Avoltage"&gt;voltage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ratings of downed power lines, it is unlikely that the same device could measure such a large voltage resulting from a very small amount of static energy without de-electrifying it.
BULLET::::- For such a large voltage to be stored, humidity would have to have been extremely low on that day for the air around him not to ionize and source current, removing the static energy.
BULLET::::- If he was carrying such a large voltage, his hair would probably have stood on end, as this is a notable effect when one touches a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVan%20de%20Graaf%20generator"&gt;Van de Graaf generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Note: It is uncertain at what voltage this effect begins, and since Van de Graaf machines routinely exceed Megavolts of electric potential, this may not be a verifiable objection.
BULLET::::- This statement: "Firefighters took possession of Clewer's jacket and stored it in the courtyard of the fire station, where it continued to give off a strong electrical &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acurrent%20%28electricity%29"&gt;current&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ." (Reuters UK) First, there is no reason they would need to take possession of the jacket &amp;mdash; the static electricity could be dealt with by simply dumping water on it. Second, the jacket could not "give off" an electric current without some continuous source of energy, which, in storage, is impossible. It is possible that the jacket could hold a voltage, but the effects of this would not be visible &amp;mdash; if they were, they would be short-lived as the jacket would lose its static energy. In any event, the current would be miniscule.
BULLET::::- The amount of energy stored on Clewer's person and possessions could not have been more than a few Joules; this is unlikely to have burned carpet.
</ul>
The equation for stored energy in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acapacitor"&gt;capacitors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is:
&lt;center&gt;formula_1&lt;/center&gt;
Where ♡❤U♡❤ = energy, ♡❤C♡❤ = &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acapacitance"&gt;capacitance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and ♡❤V♡❤ = &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Avoltage"&gt;voltage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A human body by itself typically has a capacitance of around 250 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apicofarad"&gt;pF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which would mean a voltage of 30,000 V would produce energy of 0.11 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoule"&gt;joules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Even if Clewer's possessions resulted in a parallel capacitance of 1 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amicrofarad"&gt;microfarad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , this would still only result in an energy storage of 450 J. This amount of energy would be insufficient to burn carpet or char plastic, although a spark could ignite flammable vapor or gas.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=DeLay%20declares%20%27victory%27%20in%20war%20on%20U.S.%20budget%20fat&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="US%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20Majority%20Leader"&gt;House Majority Leader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Rep. Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt; has declared an "ongoing victory" in spending cuts. He stated that the federal government was running at peak efficiency and that there was nothing left to cut from the U.S. federal budget. DeLay supports additional deficit spending for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; relief efforts, on top of the this year's existing $331 billion federal budget deficit.

DeLay's position has drawn criticism from some fiscal conservatives, including a few fellow republican representatives. Rep. &lt;a href="Jeff%20Flake"&gt;Jeff Flake&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="US%20Republican%20Party"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-Arizona) commented "I wonder if we've been serving in the same Congress." The majority of congressional republicans still support DeLay's view, and feel that their fiscal policies have been more sound than the democrats were in the past.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Conservative%20Union"&gt;American Conservative Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Chairman David A. Keene claimed that federal spending was "spiraling out of control" before Katrina, and suggested fiscal conservatives were "losing faith" in the Republican congressional leadership. Mr. Keenes stated that "Excluding military and homeland security, American taxpayers have witnessed the largest spending increase under any preceding president and Congress since the Great Depression." Specifically, aside from military and security spending, federal spending increased by $303 billion per year from 2001 and 2005, and the acknowledged federal debt increased more than $2 trillion since fiscal year 2000. The estimates used by the American Conservative Union predict that the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill will increase the government's unfunded obligations by $16 trillion. 

Tom Schatz, president of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACitizens%20Against%20Government%20Waste"&gt;Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; claimed "there are plenty of places" to make budget cuts, especially an estimated $20 billion to $25 billion in pet projects that make their way into must-pass spending bills each year. His group expects to release a list of $2 trillion in suggested spending cuts over the next five years. In particular, CAGW and the Heritage Foundation believe that some 6,000 projects in the recently passed highway bill are not essential and should be cut. Such projects include the planting of flowers along the Ronald Reagan freeway in California and the controversial $230 million Ketchikan bridge project, which is estimated to cost federal taxpayers at least $28 per vehicle trip, without a toll. Mr. DeLay previously described these projects as "important infrastructure" and stated that eliminating them might harm the economy.

The debate was sparked by controversy over spending on relief and reconstruction in the wake &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; which some fiscal conservatives have humorously labeled "Bush's New Orleans Deal." Liberal criticism of the reconstruction effort has focused on the awarding of reconstruction contracts to perceived Washington insiders.

<h1>Nintendo unveils controller for Revolution console</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Nintendo%20unveils%20controller%20for%20Revolution%20console&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At Thursday's keynote presentation of the &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%20Game%20Show"&gt;Tokyo Game Show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3ASatoru%20Iwata"&gt;Satoru Iwata&lt;/a&gt; unveiled the controller design for the company's new &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo%20Revolution"&gt;Nintendo Revolution&lt;/a&gt; console. Resembling a television remote, the controller uses two sensors placed near the user's television to triangulate its position in three-dimensional space. This will allow players to control actions and movements in video games by moving the device through the air.

The remote control design is said to target new players who are unfamiliar with traditional video game controllers.

A supplementary peripheral has also been shown, consisting of a separate plastic grip that is designed to be held in the player's second hand. It provides an &lt;a href="w%3Aanalog%20stick"&gt;analog stick&lt;/a&gt; and two trigger buttons, and connects to the bottom of the main controller with a simple cord. Additionally, Nintendo has suggested that the main controller will be able to slide inside a "shell" that will allow it to function like a conventional video game controller.

The Revolution is expected to be released next year.

Oil ministers from &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt; announced that both countries would support raising crude oil output quotas by the &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20Petroleum%20Exporting%20Countries"&gt;Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&lt;/a&gt;. The Saudi minister, Ali al-Naimi, said that rising prices were lowering world demand, and his nation 'absolutely' backs the increase, while Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli from the UAE claimed that the markets could calm on the decision.

Earlier, the OPEC cut their oil demand estimates for 2005, saying that it will rise by only 1.7%, compared to previous prediction of 1.9%.

The organisation is to meet to discuss the possible increase on September 19. If the decision take place, the official limits will be the highest since &lt;a href="w%3A1987"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;.

Saudi Arabia is the OPEC's biggest crude oil producer, with production of about 9.5 million barrels a day and spare capacity of approximately 940,000 barrels. Formal daily output of whole organisation is 28 millions barrels outside &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, and estimated unused stocks of 1.39 million barrels.

On the London-based International Petroleum Exchange price of the Brent crude barrel fell $1.45 to $62.21 on Friday.

&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; police have recovered a laptop stolen on March 11 from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;. The laptop was left unattended in the Graduate Division and contained personal information on 98,369 graduate students and applicants going as far back as 1976. This information included names, birth dates, addresses, and &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Security%20number"&gt;Social Security numbers&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASilicon%20Valley"&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; forensic lab which analyzed the laptop said it had been reformatted, making it very difficult to determine if the data had been accessed. "There's nothing in the Police Department investigation that points to any type of identity theft or credit card theft" said university spokeswoman Janet Gilmore.

The laptop was stolen by an unknown woman, who sold it to Shuki Alburati, who sold the laptop to an unsuspecting South Carolina man. Shuki Alburati was arrested on June 8 for receiving stolen property; he has been charged with one misdemeanor count. 

He claims he didn't know the laptop, a new &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; X40 worth $2,429, was stolen. He purchased the laptop from the woman, who said it wasn't stolen, for $300 or $340. A few days later, on April 19, he placed the laptop on eBay. The winning bidder was a man in South Carolina who bought the laptop for $1,195.50. Police have said this man is not a suspect. Police were alerted by IBM after the man called IBM for tech support.

Shuki Alburati has pleaded not guilty. He claimed "It's unfair, I didn't know it was stolen." His trial is scheduled for Sept. 30 before Superior Court Judge Michael Gaffey in &lt;a href="w%3AOakland%2C%20California"&gt;Oakland&lt;/a&gt;. The woman who stole the laptop has not yet been found.

http://ScienTOMogy.info has apparently received a fax and at least 6 emails in the span of 2 days from Scientology lawyer Ava Paquette of Moxon &amp; Kobrin threatening a lawsuit of up to $100,000 if the domain name ownership is not transferred. This type of letter is often called a &lt;a href="w%3Acease%20and%20desist%23Cease-and-desist%20letters"&gt;cease and desist letter&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AStollery"&gt;owners&lt;/a&gt; of scienTOMogy.info have posted the complaints and their replies, saying that the site simply expresses opinion, does not make any claims, and clearly states that it has no connection to the Church of Scientology. "The site was put up as a single source to view all the recent hype Tom has made about the church - it does nothing but show Tom, so we are at a loss as to why the church is acting so rashly."

The Church of Scientology is notorious for pursing legal action against its critics, under the name of the "Religious Technology Center" (RTC). It previously made headlines when it used the US's Digital Millennium Copyright Act to remove xenu.net&lt;a href="http%3A//www.xenu.net"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a site critical of Scientology, from Google's listings.

Early Friday morning, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJeb%20Bush%2C%20Jr."&gt;John "Jebby" Ellis Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the 21 year old son of Florida Governor &lt;a href="Jeb%20Bush"&gt;Jeb Bush&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustin%2C%20Texas"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; for public intoxication and resisting arrest. Roger Wade, Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission spokesman, said Bush was apprehended at 2:30AM near the corner of Trinity and Sixth Street in the city's downtown entertainment and bar district.

Jeb and Columbia Bush's youngest son allegedly wobbled up to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATABC"&gt;TABC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Austin police on duty in the city's downtown entertainment district and began badgering police about an earlier arrest of people he knew. TABC agent Capt. David Ferrero said Bush appeared to be drunk and "was observed to be a danger to himself and others."

According to the arrest affidavit, "Subject further resisted by pushing back with his body as he was restrained at the [Austin Police Department] transport van." During the scuffle, Bush suffered a cut on his chin and was transported to Breckenridge Hospital where he was treated and released. Bail was set at &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;2,500, but Bush was released on his own recognizance later about 10:30AM. If he fails to appear for court, he will forfeit the bond. Austin law classifies Public Intoxication as a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $500, while Resisting Arrest is a Class A misdemeanor, and is punishable by up to a year in jail.

Authorities were unaware of Bush's identity until after his arrest and booking when they observed his Florida Driver License. Governor Bush appearing with his wife at a &lt;a href="Miami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; museum reception bristled at reporters' questions Friday evening when the issue was mentioned saying, "I'm not going to discuss it on the public square with 30 cameras."

Several members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABush%20family"&gt;Bush family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have received considerable press coverage for perceived or abusive use of alcohol and other substances, including George W. Bush's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADriving%20under%20the%20influence"&gt;DUI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Jenna and Barbara Bush's underage drinking, and Jebby's sister Noelle arrest for forging a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AXanax"&gt;Xanax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; prescription.

<h1>Rupert Murdoch: Blair says BBC &quot;hates America&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rupert%20Murdoch%3A%20Blair%20says%20BBC%20%26quot%3Bhates%20America%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Media magnate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , managing director and the largest shareholder of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , claimed that the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; offered his opinions about the BBC in a private conversation with him. According to Murdoch, Blair views &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20World%20Service"&gt;World Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; broadcasts as portraying &lt;a href="United%20States%20of%20America"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; in a negative light, and accusing their coverage of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to be used for political statements.

Murdoch, a long-time critic of the BBC, apparently revealed details of his conversation with the Prime Minister during a session of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClinton%20Global%20Initiative"&gt;Clinton Global Initiative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. Murdoch's News Corp. owns &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="Sky%20News"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt;, both BBC competitors.

On September 14, pop singer &lt;a href="w%3ABritney%20Spears"&gt;Britney Spears&lt;/a&gt; reportedly gave birth to a baby boy through &lt;a href="w%3ACesarean%20section"&gt;Cesarean section&lt;/a&gt;. Spears and husband &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Federline"&gt;Kevin Federline&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement on their website confirming the birth later in the week, saying the following: "We are ecstatic to announce the birth of our son! Everyone is happy, healthy and doing wonderful. Thank you for all your love and well wishes!!".

Spears reportedly gave birth through a Cesarean section due to the fact she did not want to experience the regular pain encountered during child birth. She has been met with some criticism by her fans in wake of this report.

The birth of the boy, whose birth name is disputed among different sources, is considered very important in the entertainment world. Analysts say his first photo could be sold by his parents for upwards of US$1,000,000.

The head of GMM Grammy in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; has backed off from his attempts to take over the leading Thai newspaper, Matichon. In a statement on Friday, Mr Paiboon Damrongchaitham announced he would reduce his stake in the paper from 32% to 12%.

The attempted takeover has drawn widespread criticism from journalists, academics, and democracy activists. Mr Paiboon is known to be close to the Thai Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, and many argued his control of the well-respected paper would have a chilling effect on free speech in the country.

Despite announcing the planned sale of more than a third of his holding in the paper, Mr Paiboon will still have a sufficiently large share to command a place on the board. Academic, Anusorn Srikaew, the dean of Rangsit University's Faculty of Communication Arts, suggested that GMM Grammy's ambitions had just been shelved and that they would again increase their stake in the paper at some point in the future.

<h1>News briefs:September 18, 2005</h1>
<h2>Audio Wikinews transcript – 2005 09 18 – 2000 UTC</h2>

The time is 2000 UTC on Sunday 18th September 2005, and this is Audio Wikinews: News Briefs.

&lt;a href="Results%20of%202005%20German%20federal%20election"&gt;Results of 2005 German federal election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Early result projections from today's German federal election suggest that the alliance consisting of chancellor Gerhard Schröder's Social Democratic Party and the Greens has lost its majority. The strongest party appears to be the Christian Democratic Union, with its chancellor candidate Angela Merkel. However, it is not yet certain who will govern the country for the next four years. Neither the CDU and its likely coalition partner the Free Democratic Party nor SPD and its partner the Greens have a majority of seats in the Bundestag. While the CDU got the most votes, it performed much worse than projected, and officials from the party now suggest that a grand coalition with the SPD is the likely option for a future government. But a coalition of both Greens and FDP with either the SPD or the CDU also seems a possibility. Winners in this election include the Free Democrats, who gained 3%, and The Left, up 4%.
&lt;a href="Iran%20determined%20to%20continue%20with%20nuclear%20program"&gt;Iran determined to continue with nuclear program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, announced on Saturday the resolve of his country to proceed with the development of nuclear energy. He stated that Iran would not pursue nuclear weapons. Mr Ahmadinejad also noted that he was willing to allow international inspection of his programme, and reaffirmed his claim of its peaceful nature. At the UN conference in New York this week, Mr. Ahmadinejad made clear that he felt that Iran had a right to nuclear energy, and that the nations of world practiced "nuclear apartheid" by refusing to let Iran pursue this course. "We're not going to cave in to the excessive demands of certain powers," he said, refusing to yield to international pressure to halt his country's nuclear course.
&lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia%2C%20UAE%20to%20support%20increasing%20oil%20production"&gt;Saudi Arabia, UAE to support increasing oil production&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Oil ministers from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced that both countries would support raising crude oil output quotas by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Saudi minister, Ali al-Naimi, said that rising prices were lowering world demand, and his nation 'absolutely' backs the increase, while Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli from the UAE claimed that the markets could calm on the decision. Earlier, OPEC cut their oil demand estimates for 2005, saying that demand will rise by only 1.7% compared to the previous prediction of 1.9%. The organisation is to meet to discuss the possible increase on 19th September. If the decision takes place, the official limits will be at their highest since 1987.

<h1>IDG cancels Macworld Boston</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=IDG%20cancels%20Macworld%20Boston&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Show organizer &lt;a href="w%3AIDG"&gt;IDG&lt;/a&gt; has canceled &lt;a href="w%3AMacworld%20Expo"&gt;Macworld Expo&lt;/a&gt; Boston. The &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;East Coast&lt;/a&gt; Macworld Expo was held in &lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; from 1985 to 1997. In 1998 it was moved to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.

In October 2002, IDG announced their intention to move the show back to Boston, a move many criticized. &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; quickly announced it would no longer participate in the East Coast show. East Coast Macworld expos have always been much smaller than Macworld &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;. New York's shows would have tens of thousands attendees. The Boston shows only had about 8,000 attendees. The San Francisco show, however, had 36,000 attendees. Without Apple's support, and with the low attendance numbers, many had predicted the cancellation. 

Macworld Expos are held twice a year. They are an opportunity for companies to announce new products to the &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Macintosh"&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt; community. Macworld was once one of the largest technology trade shows in the country. Apple regularly announces new products at the Macworld San Francisco expos. "Historically, we have had a West Coast and an East Coast show, after the last show, though, we did a lot of market research and it was obvious that the market wanted one show", said IDG spokesperson Mike Sponseller. 

The 2006 show had been scheduled for July 10 through 13.

In mid-September, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; launched a new &lt;a href="w%3Asearch%20engine"&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt;: ♡❤♡♡❤Google Blogsearch♡❤♡♡❤. The new search engine, whose development was announced over two years ago, allows you to search &lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; by dates, date ranges, language, authors, and by the blog itself, in addition to keywords. It is then possible to set up your own custom newsfeed with these search criteria.

Despite the features, there has been criticism related to this new engine. One example is how their index only dates back to March 2005. In addition, flaws in the search algorithm may result in duplicate blog entries, as well as other "blog noise" to receive high results.

This new search engine was made supposedly to help compete with other search engines, such as one by &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤Google Blogsearch♡❤ has joined the group of other Google search engines, including ♡❤Google Image♡❤ search, ♡❤Google Groups♡❤, and the famous ♡❤Google Web♡❤ search.

On Sunday, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3A%20Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; held its first democratic general elections. They are the first elections held in the country since last year's presidential elections.

There was voter participation of about 50%, compared with 70% for the previous presidential election. According to Bimillah Bismal, head of the Afghan-&lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; Joint Electoral Management Body, "The election was held in a peaceful manner…there was also a high level of political awareness and participation amongst the Afghan people."

Voting proceeded calmly, with little violence at the polling stations, most of which were able to remain open throughout Saturday.

There are approximately 5,800 candidates, competing for 420 slots in the provincial court, and 249 deputy positions in the wing of the Afghani Parliament (Wolesi Jirga). 

Violence did sprout up occasionally, with four election officials killed in the past year, as well as seven contenders for deputy positions. However, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-led coalition is working to minimize these problems during the elections, and, so far, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3A%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; militant actions have not been an overwhelming issue.

Women have a sizable role to play in these elections–they can vote, and 10 percent of the candidates are female. Even in the more conservative southern areas of Afghanistan, a sizable number of female voters came to the polling stations.

Preliminary election results are expected by October 10.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has announced plans for sending humans back to the Moon, as a first step to &lt;a href="Mars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;.
A 2018 lunar mission is proposed, where a crew of four would remain on the Moon for as long as a week. A minimum of two lunar missions a year is planned, with astronauts remaining as long as six months.

Some of the technology had previously been proposed for replacement of the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20program"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt;.
<ul>
BULLET::::- Astronauts will be launched in a capsule, similar in concept to that used for the &lt;a href="Apollo%20program"&gt;Project Apollo&lt;/a&gt; but three times larger. The top part of an ♡❤♡Exploration Transportation System (ETS)♡❤♡, the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3ACrew%20Exploration%20Vehicle"&gt;Crew Exploration Vehicle&lt;/a&gt; (CEV)♡❤♡ will be a capsule attached to a service module which contains supplies, power, and propulsion units. The CEV is designed for use in Earth orbit.
BULLET::::- On lunar missions, crew or cargo versions of a ♡❤♡Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM)♡❤♡ would be used with a CEV. The LSAM will have design concepts related to the &lt;a href="w%3AApollo%20Lunar%20Module"&gt;Apollo Lunar Module&lt;/a&gt;, with a four-legged landing unit carrying an ascent stage.
BULLET::::- An ♡❤♡Earth Departure Stage (EDS)♡❤♡, a powerful propulsion unit, will be used to move CEV and LSAM units out of Earth orbit, such as on lunar missions.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Heavy Launcher♡❤♡ unmanned cargo rockets will be used for heavy loads of equipment.
BULLET::::- The launch rockets, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AShuttle%20Derived%20Launch%20Vehicle"&gt;Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;s♡❤♡, will use engines developed for the Shuttle program.
<ul>
BULLET::::- CEV will be launched atop a ♡❤♡Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV)♡❤♡, a single solid fuel booster with a second stage using a shuttle main engine. The CLV can carry a payload of 25 metric tons into low Earth orbit.
BULLET::::- The heavy-lift system uses a pair of longer solid rocket boosters and five shuttle main engines to put up to 125 metric tons in orbit -- about one and a half times the weight of a shuttle orbiter.
</ul>
BULLET::::- The use of a ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3ALaunch%20Escape%20System"&gt;Launch Escape System&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ ♡❤♡(LES)♡❤♡ will improve safety. A LES is a top-mounted rocket that can quickly remove the crew capsule away from an exploding or otherwise dangerous rocket.

</ul>
For a lunar mission, the LSAM and EDS would be placed in orbit by a cargo launcher, then a CEV would dock with the assembly before leaving Earth orbit.
The goal is to begin production of the new spacecraft by 2011.
<ul>
BULLET::::- Robotic missions will be sent, probably the first one in 2008.
BULLET::::- Past experience with lunar dust is being used in designing equipment and spacesuits which may encounter it.
BULLET::::- Surface mobility with open and pressurized rovers for use in such missions is also being developed.
BULLET::::- The CEV can be reused up to ten times.
BULLET::::- Crew capsule, upon return to Earth, will set down on dry land. It can also land on water.
BULLET::::- The CEV and lunar lander ascent stage use methane as fuel, as methane may be available on Mars.
BULLET::::- Eventually the designs could be expanded to support six astronauts for a trip to Mars.
</ul>
The plans are a means to implement President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="w%3AVision%20for%20Space%20Exploration"&gt;Vision for Space Exploration&lt;/a&gt;" program. Goals include:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Implement a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond;
BULLET::::- Extend human presence across the solar system, starting with a human return to the Moon by the year 2020, in preparation for human exploration of Mars and other destinations;
BULLET::::- Develop the innovative technologies, knowledge, and infrastructures both to explore and to support decisions about the destinations for human exploration; and
BULLET::::- Promote international and commercial participation in exploration to further U.S. scientific, security, and economic interests.

&lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; has again agreed to abandon its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;nuclear weapons and development programs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The country agreed to again return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and follow International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. 

Five other countries have agreed to give North Korea energy assistance. There also would be discussion "at an appropriate time" about providing a civilian light-water reactor.

The day after the agreement, North Korea demanded the new reactor before it ends its other nuclear programs. &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; said the light-water reactor issue was to be discussed "down the road" &amp;mdash; not immediately.

&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s President, &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, has denied making the comments on rape reported by the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.

The widespread reporting of the quotes from Musharraf's interview sparked protests on Friday in Pakistan and drew criticism from around the globe, with the &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister, &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt;, saying that President Musharraf should issue some sort of apology.

Whilst Musharraf may deny the specifics of the comments made, co-author of the Post's interview, Glenn Kessler, has said that the Pakistani President was quoted, "verbatim and in context". That context being a discussion of the treatment given to &lt;a href="w%3AMukhtar%20Mai"&gt;Mukhtar Mai&lt;/a&gt;, a rape victim whose plight was publicised worldwide. Musharraf is quoted as saying, "A lot of people say if you want to go abroad and get a visa for Canada or citizenship and be a millionaire, get yourself raped."

In recent times, Pakistan has seen a growth in activist groups seeking to promote Women's rights in Pakistan. A number of high profile rape cases, including that of Mukhtar Mai, have focused international attention on some of the practices that are commonplace in tribal parts of the country. Activists have accused President Musharraf of not taking the issue seriously, and that tribal elders still condone rape, if not actually ordering it.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; doctors are to interview 12 patients with a view to performing the first ever transplant of a human face.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; Clinic will choose between seven women and five men to find the person most suited for the experimental procedure, which is a radical and controversial solution to extreme facial scarring or disfigurement.

Having practiced the procedure on bodies donated for medical research, the Cleveland Clinic team believe they have a 50% chance of success. The procedure will not live up to science-fiction predictions and give the recipient the appearance of the donor; the underlying bone structure is the deciding factor in the final appearance. The new face will end up resembling neither the donor nor recipient.

Surgeons in several other countries have announced being ready to perform this procedure in the past. However, the risk and non life-threatening nature of disfigurement have meant that gaining approval for the groundbreaking surgery has been difficult. Like many other transplant operations, the recipient would be required to take drugs to prevent tissue rejection for the remainder of their life. These drugs can have side effects and carry their own risks involving the patient's immune system.

Gelitin, a group of artists from Vienna, has erected a pink bunny measuring 200 feet in length (about 60 metres) on the side of a northern Italian mountain.

The artwork, titled "Hase" (which translates simply as "Hare"), is located at a height of 1600m on the mountain Colletto Fava, close to Bar La Baita, above the Village of Artesina, Piemonte, Italy.

The soft rabbit is constructed out of pink wool, and is expected to remain on the mountain until 2025. Though it seems like a giant children's toy at first glance, a closer look or an in-person exploration quickly leads to the realization that the rabbit's side is split open, and its entrails pulled out.

The group designed it, but claims it was "knitted by dozens of grannies out of pink wool." The group's website, however, provides the actual credits for all the people involved.

Group member Wolfgang Gantner said: "It's supposed to make you feel small, like Gulliver. You walk around it and you can't help but smile."

The press release provided by the group explains rabbits as "the things one finds [while] wandering in a landscape, familiar things and utterly unknown."
Though they compare the initial reaction they hope people to have to that of those encountering the giant Gulliver in &lt;a href="w%3AGulliver%27s%20Travels"&gt;Gulliver's Travels&lt;/a&gt;, looking around it in awe, the group does make it clear that they hope for people to climb onto the rabbit to explore and relax on it.

Wireless provider &lt;a href="w%3ASprint%20Nextel%20Corporation"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt; announced today, that they would be working with &lt;a href="w%3ARealNetworks"&gt;RealNetworks&lt;/a&gt; to launch a streaming music service, for Sprint wireless customers, called ♡❤♡Rhapsody Radio♡❤♡.

The service will allow users to listen to podcasts and six streaming radio stations (rap, hip-hop hits, alternative, country, '70s, and music news) from their mobile phone. Users will be able to listen to live broadcasts of those stations over their cellular connection. For a monthly subscription fee of $6.95, users will also have unlimited access to commercial-free radio broadcasts. Selected streaming podcasts from &lt;a href="w%3AKCRW"&gt;KCRW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Monica"&gt;Santa Monica&lt;/a&gt; 89.9 FM, and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Public%20Radio"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;’s Southern &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; station will also be available. A special ♡❤Beats N Breaks♡❤ stream is also available. ♡❤Beats N Breaks♡❤ provides background music from hip-hop songs for users to rap with.

Rhapsody Radio service requires a &lt;a href="w%3ASanyo"&gt;Sanyo&lt;/a&gt; MM-7400, Sanyo MM-5600, Sanyo MM-8300, &lt;a href="w%3ASamsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; IP-A790, Samsung MM-A800, Samsung MM-A880 or an &lt;a href="w%3ALG%20Group"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt; MM-535 mobile phone. Customers are able to order directly from their phones, with the charge appearing on their next bill. 

Many analysts predicted the introduction of music services by other wireless providers after &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; recently introduced the &lt;a href="w%3AMotorola"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; ROKR. The Motorola ROKR comes with a version of the &lt;a href="w%3AITunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; software which allows users to listen to up to 100 songs on their phone. Service for this phone in the USA is provided by &lt;a href="w%3ACingular%20Wireless"&gt;Cingular Wireless&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Florida Keys evacuated in preparation for Rita</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Florida%20Keys%20evacuated%20in%20preparation%20for%20Rita&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Rita"&gt;Hurricane Rita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; prompted local &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Keys"&gt;Florida Keys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; officials to evacuate the area. Evacuation ended as remaining people sought shelter. The storm is threatening to cause a 16+ foot &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Astorm%20surge"&gt;storm surge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and has become a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaffir-Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale"&gt;Category 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hurricane.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT3%2Bshtml/212053.shtml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The storm may hit Southern &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20Coast"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; preliminary maps suggest landfall in &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Fear has caused crude oil prices to rise by $4 per barrel on Monday, in anticipation that Rita would cause more damage to the oil refineries around the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. This was the largest single day price increase for crude oil in history. Prices dropped by $1 to $66 per barrel on Tuesday, eased partly by news that &lt;a href="OPEC"&gt;OPEC&lt;/a&gt; would supply 2 million barrels of oil per day in extra capacity to ease supply shortages.

Phil Flynn, an analyst, stated that "We really can't afford to lose more production," as Katrina left many oil facilities inoperable.

40,000 residents are affected by the evacuation plans, which include everyone in the southern portions of the Keys. Voluntary evacuations were issued to 134,000 coastal residents. Five &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuban&lt;/a&gt; provinces were set on alert, as well as certain areas in the &lt;a href="Bahamas"&gt;Bahamas&lt;/a&gt; and the remainder of Florida.

Rita could affect &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other places recovering from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; it may cause a great deal of water to be dumped on the region &amp;mdash; worrying officials. Daniel Brown, a hurricane meteorologist, said "This is something everyone should be paying attention to." President Bush adds: "There is deep concern about this storm causing more flooding in New Orleans."

From a Sunday, September 11 broadcast of ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ ♡❤Meet The Press♡❤, Mr. Russert received the following answer to a question about the vulnerability of New Orleans to flooding. Dr. Ivor van Heerden is the deputy director of Louisiana State University Hurricane Center:&lt;blockquote&gt;

MR. RUSSERT: ...Doctor, you're an expert on this. We're still in the hurricane season. What are the chances, the likelihood that a tropical storm or, God forbid, another hurricane could hit this same area?&lt;br&gt;
DR. VAN HEERDEN: You know, there is a high probability it could happen. The unfortunate thing is, because the levee system is so weakened, just a tropical storm could reflood New Orleans. So it's a very, very vulnerable situation right now. We don't need another Katrina to flood New Orleans. A tropical storm that puts maybe five feet or six feet of water in Lake Pontchartrain, which is not rare, would reflood the city.&lt;br&gt;
MR. RUSSERT: Do you think the local, state and federal governments are prepared for an event like that in the coming weeks?&lt;br&gt;
DR. VAN HEERDEN: I don't think so, because right now they're really battling just to try and shore up the levees. You know, there were seven major levee breaks and it's going to take quite a lot of time to repair those, to have them engineeringly sound so they won't give way again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hurricane season is in full swing, ending on November 30.

Scott Stevens, weatherman at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.kpvi.com/index.cfm%3Fpage%3Dteam/scot/content.cfm"&gt;KPVI-TV&lt;/a&gt; in Pocatello, Idaho claims that someone used Russian &lt;a href="w%3AKGB"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; technology to create &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. According to a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.flashnews.com/news/wfn1050908J5463.html"&gt;brief article&lt;/a&gt; published September 8, 2005 on Flashnews.com, Stevens blames the Japanese &lt;a href="w%3AYakuza"&gt;Yakuza&lt;/a&gt; mafia, who he says were attempting to manipulate futures markets via the natural disaster. 

Stevens' website, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.weatherwars.info/"&gt;WeatherWars.info&lt;/a&gt;, includes documentation he has collected in an attempt to bolster his theories that energy weapons and airplane contrails are part of secret weather manipulating activities.

An anti-war demonstration in the streets of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; failed to apply for a sound permit, normally granted for public demonstrations of all kinds. As a result of what police claim was an unauthorized use of an amplification device, the New York Police Department took action. Anti-war protester &lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt; was speaking to a crowd of 150 before the microphone was removed by the authorities, according to a report published in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Village%20Voice"&gt;The Village Voice&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The organizer of the event, Paul Zulkowitz (nicknamed "Zool"), was arrested moments before the demonstration was dispersed.

Sheehan's speech was almost over Monday when the police interrupted. As Sheehan was escorted off the scene, the crowd shouted at the cops to "let her speak".

Sheehan said that "I was speaking and someone grabbed my backpack and pulled me back pretty roughly," and that "I was shoved around."

She added that "I think their use of force was pretty excessive for someone that didn't have a permit." Mrs Sheehan noted that this happened when police broke up the rally.

The Sheehan tour's previous stop was in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; where she addressed a small gathering in front of the Virginia Army National Guard office. The small afternoon demonstration drew only a dozen supporters; and as many pro-war demonstrators joined the gathering. 

Sheehan achieved national prominence following her peace vigil at the beginning of August 2005, when she camped in a ditch by a road near &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush's&lt;/a&gt; ranch in &lt;a href="w%3ACrawford%2C%20Texas"&gt;Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, vowing to stay until the President agreed to meet and speak with her about the Iraq War.

&lt;a href="w%3AIrvine%2C%20California"&gt;Irvine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; – 
Lightning storms moved over &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20California"&gt;Southern California&lt;/a&gt; Monday evening and Tuesday morning. Rain fell several times during the night, and lightning struck repeatedly throughout the region.

Citizens reported smoldering palm trees in several areas of &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;. In the suburban city of &lt;a href="w%3AIrvine%2C%20California"&gt;Irvine&lt;/a&gt;, darkness came early as heavy clouds blotted out the twilight. Some of the heaviest weather came soon after, as fat raindrops fell on the city. Lightning lit up the sky as often as every fifteen seconds, and AM radios emitted bursts of static every few seconds as lightning struck. The storm tapered off for several hours, but peaked again shortly before 1 am; lightning was once again seen repeatedly and power flickered several times.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;'s San Diego office issued an advisory warning of approaching thunderstorms; they estimated there would be 1/4 inch of rainfall and that the storm would leave the area by Tuesday night.

Southern California rarely sees lightning; a thunderstorm rolls through once every few years, typically due to bad weather to the south. Meteorologists say that this storm is an offshoot of Hurricane Max, which is currently several hundred miles west of Mexico and moving away from land.

&lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War%23UK_incident_with_Iraqi_police"&gt;UK forces have raided an Iraqi police station&lt;/a&gt; and a house in &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve two British soldiers who had been arrested by Iraqi police forces. Later media reports say 'the soldiers were found not to be at the police station. Based on received intelligence a house was then stormed; the soldiers were found being held by "local militia".' 

The identities of the two soldiers are unknown, but it is known they were special forces working in "plain clothes", dressed as Iraqis and wearing dark wigs. The incident has been accompanied by petrol bomb attacks on British armoured vehicles and stones being thrown at the soldiers as they evacuated the vehicles due to fears of "exploding ammunition", according to more recent media. Associated Press has reported that about 150 prisoners are believed to have escaped as the result of the raids, although the higher Iraqi authorities hold that this is not true.

It is not clear precisely what the rescued soldiers were being held for, besides a possible covert attempt to plant a carbomb, as the Sept. 19th article listed below declares the 2 "were using a civilian car packed with explosives" while disguised as Iraqis wearing Arab uniforms. Many news sources have reported that the men were working undercover for British forces. Iraqi authorities report that the men had opened fire on police, killing one officer and wounding another. The Washington Post article tells of the Iraqi Police calling for locals to come help hold the soldiers so as the situation may be investigated. Three hours later, the 2 were broken out of an allied jail by force. It is too early to determine the truth of any of these claims yet, but it is certain to have ramifications for the peace process as well as global affairs.

The constant manipulation of this story as it progresses is undeniable.

Police at Scotland Yard have discovered that the suicide bombers who mounted an attack on London on July 7th had rehearsed their plan nine days earlier.

As part of the formal investigation into the attacks, detectives studied thousands of hours of CCTV footage. The images show three of the bombers entering Luton station, before travelling to King's Cross station where they are also pictured.

Police were able to trace their movements after recovering tickets and receipts from houses connected to the bombers which indicated the route of their trip.

Scotland Yard says the practice run shows 'terrorist methodology'. Over 3,000 witness statements have been gathered and 80,000 CCTV tapes analysed, and the investigation is expected to carry on for many months to come.

Holocaust survivor and famous Nazi hunter &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Wiesenthal"&gt;Simon Wiesenthal&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Wiesenthal%20Center"&gt;center that bears his name&lt;/a&gt;, has passed away this morning at his home in &lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;. He was 96.

Wiesenthal was born December 31, 1908 in &lt;a href="w%3ABuchach"&gt;Buchach&lt;/a&gt;, then part of &lt;a href="w%3AAustria-Hungary"&gt;Austria-Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, and studied in &lt;a href="w%3APrague"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt;. He settled in &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and was forced to work in a factory after the Soviet Union had invaded Poland, following the &lt;a href="w%3AHitler-Stalin%20pact"&gt;Hitler-Stalin pact&lt;/a&gt;. When the Germans then turned on the Soviet Union in 1941, Wiesenthal was caught and interned in several concentration camps. He was liberated when American forces reached the &lt;a href="w%3AMauthausen%20concentration%20camp"&gt;Mauthausen concentration camp&lt;/a&gt; in May 1945.

Wiesenthal devoted almost his entire Post-WWII life tracking down and pursuing Nazi war criminals. In 1947 he and thirty colleages founded the Jewish Documentation Center in &lt;a href="w%3ALinz"&gt;Linz&lt;/a&gt;, Austria which was devoted to collecting information on the whearabouts of war criminals and the documentation of their crimes. But the brewing cold war caused the U.S. and Soviet Union to quickly lose interest in the prosecution of Nazis. Wiesenthal closed the Linz centre in 1954 but gained new hope with the capture of &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Eichmann"&gt;Adolf Eichmann&lt;/a&gt;, whom he helped to track down. Possibly his biggest success was the capture and trial of &lt;a href="w%3AFranz%20Stangl"&gt;Franz Stangl&lt;/a&gt;, commandant at the &lt;a href="w%3ATreblinka"&gt;Treblinka&lt;/a&gt; extermination camp. In total he and the Simon Wiesenthal center he set up in the U.S. in 1977 is thought to have brought some 1100 war criminals to justice. But he failed to capture &lt;a href="w%3AGestapo"&gt;Gestapo&lt;/a&gt; chief &lt;a href="w%3AHeinrich%20M%C3%BCller"&gt;Heinrich Müller&lt;/a&gt; and Auschwitz "doctor" &lt;a href="w%3AJosef%20Mengele"&gt;Josef Mengele&lt;/a&gt;.

Wiesenthal's life was not without controversy. Austrian chancellor &lt;a href="w%3ABruno%20Kreisky"&gt;Bruno Kreisky&lt;/a&gt;, himself a Jewish person, accused Wiesethal of being part of "certain mafia" seeking to besmirch Austria and claimed Wiesenthal collaborated with the Nazis to survive. On the other hand Wiesenthal refused to condemn Kurt Waldheim, former U.N. Secretary-General and Austrian president, for being a officer of the German army during WWII, something which alienated him from American Jewish groups.

<h2>Tributes</h2>
Israeli president &lt;a href="w%3AMoshe%20Katsav"&gt;Moshe Katsav&lt;/a&gt; called Wiesenthal the "biggest fighter" of his generation. "He represented the morality of humanity; he represented the free world, the democratic world. He devoted his life to fighting racism, anti-Semitism, Nazism and he really contributed to making a better world for the next generation", Katsav said during a visit to Latvia.

Hungarian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AFerenc%20Gyurcsany"&gt;Ferenc Gyurcsany&lt;/a&gt; said: "Humanity is poorer because a just man, Simon Wiesenthal, is gone".

German president &lt;a href="w%3AHorst%20K%C3%B6hler"&gt;Horst Köhler&lt;/a&gt; said that Wiesenthal sought "justice, not revenge or hatred. That was an expression of a personality embossed with deep humanitarianism. He remains a role model for us to fight injustice persistently and forceful".

According to several pages on Google’s website, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is launching a free &lt;a href="w%3AWiFi"&gt;WiFi&lt;/a&gt; service. This program, called ♡❤♡♡❤Google Secure Access♡❤♡♡❤, creates a &lt;a href="w%3AVirtual%20Private%20Network"&gt;Virtual Private Network&lt;/a&gt; allowing secure access to the Internet. ♡❤Google Secure Access♡❤ encrypts all traffic to and from a user’s machine while the user is connected to the wireless access point.

Google provides its engineers with time to work on independent research projects. ♡❤Google Secure Access♡❤ was created as an independent research project by a Google engineer after he discovered that WiFi was insecure at most locations.

According to the ♡❤Google Secure Access FAQ♡❤, the service is only available at "certain Google WiFi locations in the San Francisco Bay Area". According to some reports, the service is working from some independent (non-Google) WiFi locations in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;NYC&lt;/a&gt;.

Like many of Google’s other popular services such as &lt;a href="w%3AGmail"&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤Google Secure Access♡❤ is still in the beta testing stage.

The US &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; has just raised the base rate of interest for the 11th month in a row, despite concerns that the economy will slow after &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;.

The rate rose by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.75%, but analysts have predicted it may rise to 4.5% in the coming months, in spite of consumer spending being down. The Fed says it is hoping to counter soaring house prices and the high price of oil. 

Economic growth in the US this year is forecast at around 3.3%, but government officials estimate that 0.5% growth could be lost due to Hurricane Katrina.

However, analysts are confident that the economy is robust enough to withstand and shake off the effects of high oil prices and unemployment caused by Hurricane Katrina.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Einstein"&gt;Albert Einstein's&lt;/a&gt; best known equation, and probably the best known aspect of all physics, E=mc, turns one hundred today. 

September 27, 1905 is generally considered the birthday of the equation because that is the day that Einstein's paper outlining the significance of the equation arrived in the offices of the German journal .

In the equation, 'E' stands for &lt;a href="w%3AEnergy"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;, 'm' stands for &lt;a href="w%3AMass"&gt;mass&lt;/a&gt;, and 'c' stands for the &lt;a href="w%3ASpeed%20of%20light"&gt;speed of light&lt;/a&gt;.

The equation shows that matter and energy are, essentially, two aspects of the same thing, and that a small amount of matter can be converted into an enormous amount of energy. &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20reactions"&gt;Nuclear reactions&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="w%3Afusion"&gt;fusion&lt;/a&gt; in the sun and in nuclear weapons, are examples of large amounts of energy released from the conversion of comparatively small quantities of mass. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; declared 2005 the International Year of Physics in recognition of Albert Einstein's work in 1905. In addition to discovering his famous equation, over the course of 5 months in 1905 Einstein developed the &lt;a href="w%3Aspecial%20relativity"&gt;theory of Special Relativity&lt;/a&gt; (which led him to the equation E=mc), proved the existence of atoms and molecules, and showed that light is made of photons. 1905 is often called Einstein's annus mirabilis, or miracle year. 
The 100th anniversary of Einstein's miracle year is being celebrated in many countries around the world as the . In the UK, it is called the Einstein Year.

The Vatican has denied the accusation that it is shielding the alleged war criminal, General &lt;a href="w%3AAnte%20Gotovina"&gt;Ante Gotovina&lt;/a&gt;, claiming they have sought clarification on Ms del Ponte's accusation that the General is being sheltered in a monastery in Croatia.

Today, &lt;a href="AOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt; had announced that it is launching a new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVoIP"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; service to be named ♡❤TotalTalk♡❤. TotalTalk is much like &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Talk"&gt;Google Talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; due to its unification of verbal conversation and instant messenger into one client. However, much like &lt;a href="Skype"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt;, client-to-phone conversations are possible. Other features include caller ID, voice mail integration with e-mail, three-way calling, and more.

Unlike AOL's current VoIP service, TotalTalk will not require AOL membership. However, access to this service may cost upwards of $34.99 per month.

Later this week, AOL will also release its new instant messenger client, Triton. Triton will contain a softphone feature that can be used with TotalTalk.

<h1>FBI recruits for &quot;War on Porn&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=FBI%20recruits%20for%20%26quot%3BWar%20on%20Porn%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Last month, the &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;'s Washington Field Office began an internal recruitment drive to staff a new anti-obscenity squad. The job of the new squad would be to gather evidence against the "manufacturers and purveyors" of &lt;a href="w%3Apornography"&gt;pornography&lt;/a&gt;, and would require eight agents, a supervisor and assorted support help. The squad would not be concerned with child pornography, but instead focus on pornography that depicts, and is marketed to, consenting adults. The squad would target bestiality, urination, defecation, and &lt;a href="w%3Asadism%20and%20masochism"&gt;sadomasochistic&lt;/a&gt; behavior, which have a high rate of conviction in jury trials.

The initiative is described as "one of the top priorities" of Attorney General &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;, as well as FBI Director &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20S.%20Mueller%20III"&gt;Robert S. Mueller III&lt;/a&gt;. Gonzales has said that "adult pornography is a threat to families and children." Christian groups, such as the &lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20Research%20Council"&gt;Family Research Council&lt;/a&gt; who have criticized Gonzales for what they consider his weak stance on abortion, welcomed the initiative with "a growing sense of confidence in our new attorney general."

Historians have criticized past FBI policies for focusing resources on cases which are easy to solve, especially stolen car cases, with the intent of boosting the agency's success rate. Congress began funding the obscenity initiative in fiscal 2005 and specified that the FBI must devote 10 agents to adult pornography.

The adult pornography initiative is seen as a "running joke" by many agents at larger offices which usually focus on national security, technology crimes, and public corruption.

Hard-core pornography is seen as far more mainstream today, partly due to its availability on DirecTV, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., and on in-room television offerings at the Sheraton, Hilton, Marriott and Hyatt hotel chains. Such companies are referred to as "white-collar pornographers" by Christian groups.

The American &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; has recalled operational rations (&lt;a href="w%3AMRE"&gt;MREs&lt;/a&gt;) donated by Britain to help survivors of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Mirror"&gt;Daily Mirror&lt;/a&gt; insinuated that the majority of the 400,000 rations donated by Britain, at a cost of millions of pounds, are set to be destroyed at a plant in &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas"&gt;Little Rock, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Times"&gt;Washington Times&lt;/a&gt; reported, on September 23, 2005, that a spokeswoman for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that the food was being held at the facility but denied any plans to incinerate the rations donated by Britain.

Nevertheless, the move has infuriated aid workers who hasten to point out that "Under &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;, American soldiers are also entitled to eat such rations, yet the starving of the American South will see them go up in smoke because of FDA red tape madness." One aid worker was quoted as saying that "the world's richest nation couldn't organize a &lt;a href="w%3Apiss-up"&gt;piss-up&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="w%3Abrewery"&gt;brewery&lt;/a&gt; and lets Americans starve while they arrogantly observe petty regulations. Everyone is revolted by the chaotic shambles the US is making of this crisis. Guys from &lt;a href="w%3AUNICEF"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt; are walking around spitting blood."

An FDA spokesman said the rations had not been inspected but were automatically deemed "unfit for human consumption" due to &lt;a href="w%3ABovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;Bovine spongiform encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; (BSE or colloquially "mad cow disease") fears. He observed that 70 pallets of vegetarian MREs were inspected and approved on September 13th. Aid workers claim that, today, BSE is much more of a problem in the U.S. than in Britain.

Food donations from &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; are also being held by the FDA due to similar concern, as well as thousands of &lt;a href="w%3Agallon"&gt;gallon&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href="w%3Apear"&gt;pear&lt;/a&gt; juice from &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. Licensing regulations have also prevented foreign nations from sending doctors and other medical personnel.

The Tennessee state Department of Mental Health has ordered the closing of two &lt;a href="w%3AEx-gay"&gt;Ex-gay&lt;/a&gt; ministries operated by &lt;a href="w%3AEx-gay%23Love%20In%20Action"&gt;Love In Action International Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial Christian group that counsels gays to give up homosexuality.

The state deemed that Love in Action was "providing housing, meals and personal care for mentally ill patients without a license". In particular, the state found that Love in Action was dispensing medication to patients without the required license.

Love in Action has repeatedly drawn fire from gay rights groups who view it as preying upon the fears of religious parents in order to make Christian ministers like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson seem more acceptable to the uninformed public. Gay rights advocates view such bootcamp style Ex-Gay camps as "tantamount to child abuse". &lt;a href="http%3A//www.anythingbutstraight.com/learn/eghistory.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.exgaywatch.com/blog/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Love In Action is viewed as the first modern Ex-Gay group. Its co-founder John Evans, who abandoned the ministry, feels that it has led to "nothing but shattered lives, depression, and even suicide" and suggests that "The Church has been wrong in the past regarding moral issues and I’m sure there will be more before Christ returns."

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Psychological%20Association"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3A%20American%20Psychiatric%20Association"&gt;American Psychiatric Association&lt;/a&gt; strongly affirm that "homosexuality is not an illness", "does not require treatment" and "is not changeable." They feel that "gay men and lesbians who have accepted their sexual orientation positively are better adjusted than those who have not done so," and warn that people seeking conversion therapy may be doing so under pressure from religious groups. The American public is evenly divided on the question of whether homosexual orientation can be changed, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life &lt;a href="http%3A//pewforum.org/docs/index.php%3FDocID%3D37"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

On Tuesday an &lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; appellate court ruled that the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, a federal law that bans using autodialers to call mobile phones or pagers, also applies to text messages sent to mobile phones.

The three-judge Court of Appeals panel upheld the trial judge’s ruling in favour of Rodney L. Joffe. He sued Acacia Mortgage Corp. in 2001, for $55,000 in damages for harassment. 

Acacia used a web-based system to send the text messages, which translates the users phone number into an e-mail address. Acacia argued that the company was not making calls to mobile phones, but rather sending e-mails. "Even though Acacia used an attenuated method to dial a cell phone telephone number, it nevertheless did so," wrote Judge Patricia K. Norris.

In the wake of an outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3Atyphoid"&gt;typhoid&lt;/a&gt;-related illnesses in Delmas, north-east &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, a protest that forced local council members to lock themselves indoors has been broken up by police.

Rubber bullets were used in an effort to disperse the crowd which was calling for the town's council to resign over the failure to provide adequate and safe services. Authorities report that 4 people are have died from typhoid and over 526 have been stricken since August 22. However, a report by the Treatment Action Campaign (Tac) states that 49 have died. A local undertaker was quoted as saying that burials have increased since the outbreak and that he buried 14 people on the weekend of 17 September alone.

An outbreak of the current magnitude suggests waterborne spread &lt;a href="http%3A//www.promedmail.org/pls/promed/f%3Fp%3D2400%3A1001%3A6370841843379819443%3A%3ANO%3A%3AF2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE%2CF2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID%3A1000%2C30463"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although health authorities deny finding ♡❤Salmonella typhi♡❤ (the causative agent of typhoid fever) in the town's drinking water. Sanitation services in Delmas, only 70 km from &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, are primitive. In many areas human waste is transported in open buckets and it is believed this may have contaminated the water supply.

&lt;a href="w%3AJetBlue%20Airways%20Flight%20292"&gt;JetBlue Flight 292&lt;/a&gt;, en route to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKJFK"&gt;JFK Airport&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ABurbank%2C%20California"&gt;Burbank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, encountered nose gear malfunctions shortly after takeoff. It safely landed three hours later at &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20International%20Airport"&gt;Los Angeles International Airport&lt;/a&gt; (LAX) with no apparent injuries.

The pilots first realized something was wrong when the landing gear failed to retract; television footage showed that the plane's front wheels were pointing sideways, perpendicular to the plane's body. The plane was diverted to Long Beach Airport, where it tried and failed to land, and then on to LAX, which has better emergency facilities. The aircraft circled near the airport for several hours to burn fuel; the &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A320"&gt;Airbus A320&lt;/a&gt; aircraft is not designed to dump fuel.

Commentators predicted that the nose gear would either snap off, immediately twist to parallel upon touch down, or withstand the friction from the landing while remaining at a 90 degree angle.

At approximately 6:19PM local time, almost three hours after takeoff, the aircraft successfully managed to touch down. The pilot landed the plane first on its two rear wheels, keeping its nose in the air as long as possible until it slowed enough that the nose could be safely lowered. The front tires remained at a 90 degree angle and were incinerated through the friction. A cloud of white smoke and sparks burst out from behind the nose gear as the plane traveled down the runway. As the airplane finally stopped, the pilot had managed to keep the plane no more than 6 inches from the runway's centerline. Officials were prepared with a brigade of fire engines as well as fire retardant foam in case the front wheel ignited. The plane was evacuated a few minutes later.

Reports indicate that the pilots acted in a "calm and professional manner."

JetBlue flight 292 was in a unique situation as each seat in the plane was equipped with live TV through &lt;a href="w%3ADirecTV"&gt;DirecTV&lt;/a&gt;. Several of the stations carried on the &lt;a href="w%3ALiveTV"&gt;LiveTV&lt;/a&gt; system had cameras trained on the plane and were monitoring the situation. It has been established that the televisions were operating as the plane circled the airfield, though there are conflicting reports on whether or not the televisions were in operation during the landing. For a time, passengers on board were able to watch their own airplane circle the airfield in a precarious situation.

139 passengers and 6 crew were on board Flight 292.

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is being sued by the &lt;a href="w%3AAuthors%20Guild"&gt;Authors Guild&lt;/a&gt;, among others, due to the verbatim publishing of contents of their books in &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Print"&gt;Google Print&lt;/a&gt; for Libraries, a search engine for searching books that started in December. The Authors Guild wants Google to make the content from books protected under copyright unavailable, as they claim that they have never given permission for their text to be published. However, Google offers the option of having their text removed from their databases.

Google also claims that the text is used under ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Afair%20use"&gt;fair use&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, as they only include "snippets" of the text, and not the entire book. Also, Google sees Google Print as an incentive to authors, as it could help boost sales. “This ability to introduce millions of users to millions of titles can only expand the market for authors’ books, which is precisely what copyright law is intended to foster,” says Google.

The lawsuit was filed by three writers in a New York federal court, and has the support from the U.S.-based &lt;a href="w%3AAuthors%20Guild"&gt;Authors Guild&lt;/a&gt;. The suit acknowledges that text snippets presented via the internet to users is legal under the U.S. definition of ♡❤fair use♡❤. Rather, the complaint centers on the wholesale copying of a book's text into Google databases.

Another Google Print program, called "Google Print for Publishers", seeks consent from publishers (such as &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster"&gt;Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/a&gt;, who has given permission) to publish their works. Considering as publishers ♡❤may♡❤ be holders of the copyright in book contents, this could be the sole project of Google Print, assuming Google Print for Libraries is deemed "massive copyright infringement" by the District Court in Manhattan where the suit was filed.

Traffic is bumper to bumper on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; interstate highways as citizens try to evacuate ahead of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Rita"&gt;Hurricane Rita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Houston &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMayor%20of%20Houston"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20White"&gt;Bill White&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; urged citizens in low areas of the city to "begin making their evacuation plans" in preparation for what is currently the 3rd strongest hurricane to ever form in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the worst to enter the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Acting U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director David Paulison was quoted saying "I strongly, strongly urge Gulf Coast residents to pay close attention to this storm. It's already a Category 4, a huge storm, it's in warm waters and there's a potential for it to increase more," at a briefing in Washington DC. The storm was upgraded to a category 5 hurricane on Thursday, the strongest category of storm. Recently, Rita has lost intensity since entering cooler waters and facing wind shear from an opposing weather front, and is now a Category 4 storm.
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; lies 50 feet above sea-level on average, but the area is still prone to flooding as the region is very flat and supported by multiple bayous. In 2001, following &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Storm%20Allison"&gt;Tropical Storm Allison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , large areas of Houston remained flooded after receiving 10 inches (250 mm) of rain, causing over $US 5 billion in damage. Meteorologists fear that Rita could cause similar, if not worse damage.

Located 50 miles away from the inland city of Houston, and situated on the Gulf’s coastline, lies &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGalveston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Galveston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Texas at a mere 8 feet above sea level. The island city, with a population of nearly 60,000, built a 10-mile-long, 17-foot-high solid granite barrier next to the sea as a defense against hurricanes.

The National Hurricane Center currently predicts a storm surge from Rita in the 15 to 20 feet range, along with strong battering waves. The city manager of Galveston, Steve LeBlanc said, "Galveston is going to suffer. And we are going to need to get it back in order as quickly as possible. I would say that we probably have 90 percent of our residents have left the island. It feels like a ghost town to me, and that's a good thing."

Rita is expected to slow down and linger after making landfall in the region. That could possibly mean even more damage from heavy rainfall accumulations. The governor of &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKathleen%20Blanco"&gt;Kathleen Blanco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said the rain is a threat to &lt;a href="New%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. Anywhere from 2 to 4 inches of rainfall are expected there, when earlier predictions estimated that 3 inches of rainfall would be enough to cause more flooding in the city.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Oil%20price%20jumps%20as%20Rita%20heads%20to%20refineries&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Oil, natural gas, and gasoline futures prices are all rising in anticipation of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Rita"&gt;Hurricane Rita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; landfall on Friday. The market price for crude oil is rising about 1% a day, while gasoline futures rose 5% both Wednesday and Thursday. Natural gas prices are also rising, with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mercantile%20Exchange"&gt;NYMEX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Hub"&gt;Henry Hub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; price index showing an increase of over 3.5% on Thursday. Oil refineries in the path of the storm, despite the pressure exerted by rising oil prices, are expected to increase their prices which in turn will be reflected at the pump.

The price for crude oil is expected to reach US$68 a barrel after reaching the all-time high in the U.S. at $70.85 on Aug 30, in fear of the landing of Rita along the U.S. &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Along the &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; gulf coastline, whose key U.S. oil production facilities were largely untouched by the catastrophic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; onslaught three weeks ago, production and distribution facilities have been battened down.

Rita was downgraded to a Category 3 storm Friday as it neared the coast. The storm, packing sustained winds of 125 mph, appears headed for the border between Texas and &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;. Hurricane force winds extend up to 60 miles from the center, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm, currently, is the third-most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic, just behind Gilbert in 1988 and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. 

Regions of Texas near where the storm is expected to land is home to the biggest concentration of U.S. oil refineries, accounting for 26 percent of the nation's total capacity. After Katrina made its landfall in Louisiana last month, four damaged refineries in Mississippi and Louisiana were shut down, crippling 5 percent of the US capacity. Eighteen of the 26 refineries in Texas are located on the Gulf of Mexico with a combined distillation capacity of 4 million barrels daily.

The National Weather Service has issued a flood watch for the Texas coastline, including Galveston, where the nation's largest oil refinery belonging to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AExxonMobil"&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is located.

"Some of those refineries in Texas, they're at sea level. It's a table top, it floods very easily,♡❤ said Ed Silliere, vice president of risk management at Energy Merchant LLC in New York. 

Plants have shut down as Rita advances. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Dutch%20Shell"&gt;Shell Oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shut down its seventh-largest refinery in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADeer%20Park%2C%20Texas"&gt;Deer Park, Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . There is no date set for resuming production. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConocoPhillips"&gt;Conoco Philips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is shutting its Old Ocean, Texas, refinery. &lt;a href="BP"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; is pulling some workers from its Texas refinery and shutting parts of the fourth largest plants in US. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AValero"&gt;Valero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the largest U.S. refiner, said it is closing its plants in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20City%2C%20Texas"&gt;Texas City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with the shutdown to be completed by midday Thursday.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20Petroleum%20Exporting%20Countries"&gt;Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (OPEC) agreed at its meeting in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday to effectively suspend its quota system for the first time since 1991 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20War"&gt;Gulf War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to relieve the rising oil price by pumping an estimated additional 2 million barrels of oil a day, which will begin at Oct 1 and last for 3 months.

The head of the U.S. Energy Information Administration (the statistical and analytical wing of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy"&gt;U.S. Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), Guy Caruso, criticized OPEC for constraining production to keep prices high after the 11-member oil cartel pledged to make available the additional 2 million barrels daily.

"Without question," Caruso said Wednesday when asked during a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Commerce%2C%20Science%20and%20Transportation"&gt;Senate Commerce Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hearing whether OPEC has contributed to soaring oil prices, "OPEC policy has been to constrain production and collude... Under the FTC definition of collusion and price-fixing, yes." 

According to OPEC, 62 percent in U.K., and 24 percent of fuel prices in the U.S. consist of taxes. Consuming nations have a responsibility to invest in refineries and to lower taxes if they want lower fuel prices, OPEC President Sheikh Ahmad Fahd al-Sabah said. He is the oil minister of &lt;a href="Kuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=London%20bomb%20suspect%20returned%20from%20Italy&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; bomb suspect, &lt;a href="w%3AHussain%20Osman"&gt;Hussain Osman&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Hamdi Issac, has arrived in London and been arrested following his &lt;a href="w%3Aextradition"&gt;extradition&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.
Allegedly involved in the second set of &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;attacks on London in July&lt;/a&gt;, which targeted the city's public transport infrastructure, Osman was arrested in &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; by Italian police on July 29, just one week after the failed attacks.

On September 13, a final appeal against extradition was rejected by an Italian court despite his lawyer's protests that he could not get a fair trial in the UK. Osman is accused of planting the failed bomb at &lt;a href="w%3AShepherd%27s%20Bush%20tube%20station%20%28Hammersmith%20and%20City%20Line%29"&gt;Shepherd's Bush Underground station&lt;/a&gt;. His flight subsequent to the attack proved futile as phone records led police to Rome, and a raid on his brother's apartment, where he was captured.

Pending his extradition, he was held at Rebibbia jail, Rome, a high-security facility on the outskirts of the city. He left the jail late on Thursday and the &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopian&lt;/a&gt;-born terror suspect flew out of Italy at 12pm local time, accompanied by officers from the &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan police&lt;/a&gt;. Flying on a chartered private jet, Osman and his escort landed at &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Air%20Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/a&gt; Northolt, where Osman was charged on arrival. He is expected to be put on trial at the &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Bailey"&gt;Old Bailey&lt;/a&gt; in London, alongside the other suspects involved in the failed attacks.

The &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; Minister of the Economy, &lt;a href="w%3ADomenico%20Siniscalco"&gt;Domenico Siniscalco&lt;/a&gt;, resigned from his position in the Government on Thursday.

Siniscalco cited the handling of a recent banking scandal among the reasons for his resignation. He had sought the resignation of the governor of the Italian central bank, &lt;a href="w%3ABanca%20d%27Iatlia"&gt;Banca d'Italia&lt;/a&gt;, for his alleged involvement in insider trading during an aborted bank takeover bid. The governor, &lt;a href="w%3AAntonio%20Fazio"&gt;Antonio Fazio&lt;/a&gt;, was believed to strongly favour an Italian bid over that of the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; bank &lt;a href="w%3AABN%20Amro"&gt;ABN Amro&lt;/a&gt;.

Siniscalco stated in his resignation letter that he was "scandalized" by the state of affairs, and would prefer to return to work as a university professor in &lt;a href="w%3ATurin"&gt;Turin&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to his issues with the Bank of Italy, his proposed budget had faced considerable dilution by the government coalition.

The Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; gave the appearance of not being concerned about the resignation, and did not expect to take long to replace the minister. Centre-left opposition leader, &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt;, said the dispute over the budget was a defining part of what made up the government. He called for immediate elections in the wake of the resignation.

In a major restructuring plan, &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; announced that approximately 7% of their workforce will be laid off between now and March 2008. Nearly 4,000 of the job losses will be in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; itself.

The plan to try and revitalise the company is the brainchild of &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Stringer"&gt;Sir Howard Stringer&lt;/a&gt;, the company's first ever non-Japanese CEO. Apart from the job losses, eleven of the company's 65 manufacturing plants will be closed or put up for sale. Restructuring follows considerable stock price falls over the last five years with the share value reduced to less than 40% of the 2000 value.

As well as announcing restructing plans, Sony announced an expected loss of 10 billion yen (US$ 90 million) during the current financial year.

The five members who voted No on Roberts were Senators &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Kennedy"&gt;Ted Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADiane%20Feinstein"&gt;Diane Feinstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Schumer"&gt;Charles Schumer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Durbin"&gt;Richard Durbin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The thirteen members who voted Yes were the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the committee as well as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Leahy"&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHerb%20Kohl"&gt;Herb Kohl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARuss%20Feingold"&gt;Russ Feingold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It is likely that the Senate will confirm Roberts to the Supreme Court.
