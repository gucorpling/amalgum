On October 14, 2008, Canadians will be heading to the polls for the federal election. ♡❤♡Christian Heritage Party candidate Ron Gray♡❤♡ is standing for election in ♡❤♡the riding of &lt;a href="w%3ALangley"&gt;Langley&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

Wikinews contacted Ron Gray, to talk about the issues facing Canadians, and what they and their party would do to address them. Wikinews is in the process of contacting every candidate, in every riding across the country, no matter their political stripe. All interviews are conducted over e-mail, and interviews are published unedited, allowing candidates to impart their full message to our readers, uninterrupted.

Mr. Gray has been leader of the Christian Heritage Party since 1995. He first ran for office in 1988.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡Why are you running for political office, why at the federal level, why this party, and why in this riding?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?♡❤♡

♡❤♡As you campaign around your riding, it's likely that some issues are mentioned more often by voters, than other issues. What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding? What would you and your party do to address these issues?♡❤♡

Adopt the National Firearms Association's "Practical Firearms Control System", and allow any citizen who does not have a criminal record or mental illness, after taking the appropriate safety training program, to own and keep at home, or carry a firearm for personal and family protection. The NFA can provide $4 million of a liability coverage to its members for $9 a year; that proves that their system works!
The SCJ should also have the authority to accept or reject Supreme Court Justices from nominations prepared by the Justice Committee; and to initiate impeachment proceedings, to be tried by Parliament, on grounds of moral turpitude, bias, corruption or neglect of duty.

♡❤♡Is there any misconceptions about you, your leader, or your party and platform?♡❤♡

"Our purpose is to place ourselves under the authority and guidance of the principles of the Gospel — principles like justice, honesty, compassion, diligence, thrift and "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." 

♡❤♡There are more ways than ever to get your message out, from the traditional campaign fliers and lawn signs, to new media like websites, Facebook, and YouTube. The tried-and-true routes get the message out to the masses much easier, but digital alternatives are much more measurable in how many are seeing or interacting with your campaign. What seems to be the most effective, from your experience?♡❤♡

Reports published by various political news websites on Wednesday night said that there may be a movement within the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Libertarian%20Party"&gt;Libertarian Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to replace its vice presidential nominee, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Allyn%20Root"&gt;Wayne Allyn Root&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

This comes after &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALibertarian%20National%20Committee"&gt;Libertarian National Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (LNC) representative Stuart Flood made a motion to remove Root from the ballot over remarks that the latter made in a recent interview with ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReason%20Magazine"&gt;Reason Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. Many found these remarks to be racially insensitive.

It is reported that Libertarian presidential nominee and former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Congress"&gt;congressman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Barr"&gt;Bob Barr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wants Root off of the ballot as well, which some believe is the reason that the Barr campaign supposedly advised party &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Redpath"&gt;Chairman Bill Redpath&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to keep Angela Keaton, a probable vote for Root’s removal, on the LNC. Over the past few weeks, several members of the LNC have been trying to remove Keaton from the committee because of what they felt were sexually inappropriate comments written by her in a blog.
Barr has been the subject of controversy for over a week because of his last-minute refusal to attend former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; presidential hopeful &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Paul"&gt;Congressman Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's third party unity conference at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Press%20Club%20%28USA%29"&gt;National Press Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last Wednesday.

<h1>Somali pirates seize Greek freighter, 25 crew in the Gulf of Aden</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Somali%20pirates%20seize%20Greek%20freighter%2C%2025%20crew%20in%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Aden&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Noel Choong, who represents the International Maritime Bureau, advised ships traveling through the gulf to take extra precautions. "It appears that the pirates are now attacking ships in two areas, the eastern part of Somalia and northern parts of the Horn of Africa nation," he said. "Ships are warned to take extra measures and stay 200 nautical miles away from the coast. They must maintain a strict watch.♡❤

The Gulf of Aden is a dangerous place for ships, with many incidents of piracy occurring regularly in the Gulf.

Four hours earlier pirates had attacked another vessel, a chemical tanker from &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, which was at the time carrying 22 crew members. Following that attack, the gulf was described by the managing director of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association as an "incredibly dangerous place."

In response to this, several large shipping organisations have called for countries to deploy forces from their Navies in the Gulf of Aden.

"The shipping industry's plea is in response to a situation which it describes as in danger of spiralling completely and irretrievably out of control," said the group which consisted of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Chamber%20of%20Shipping"&gt;International Chamber of Shipping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIntercargo"&gt;Intercargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABimco"&gt;Bimco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIntertanko"&gt;Intertanko&lt;/a&gt;. "Continued inaction against these violent acts could prompt shipowners to redirect their ships via the Cape of Good Hope, with severe consequences for international trade, including increased prices for delivered goods."
The group also said that there have been 40 hijackings in the gulf, resulting in 133 crew members being kidnapped and 10 ships being held. According to the IMB six gangs totalling approximately 1,200 people have carried out these attacks.

<h3>Government sued for operating electronic Dragnet</h3>
On September 18, 2008, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (EFF) filed a lawsuit against the NSA, President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, Cheney's chief of staff David Addington, former Attorney General and White House Counsel &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;, and other government agencies and individuals who ordered or participated in the warrantless domestic surveillance. They sued on behalf of AT&amp;T customers to stop the illegal, unconstitutional, and ongoing dragnet surveillance of their communications and communications records. The EFF's ongoing case may be bogged down by constitutional questions due to new FISA provisions, but they won't impact the new case.

A hacker who has claimed to be loosely associated with internet group ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ managed to hack into the email account of &lt;a href="w%3AAlaska"&gt;Alaskan&lt;/a&gt; Governor and &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; vice-presidential nominee &lt;a href="w%3ASarah%20Palin"&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/a&gt; in the early morning hours of Wednesday, September 16. 

Partial contents of her email account - including two family photos, email messages and contact lists - were subsequently hosted online at ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks.org&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a website that anonymously hosts leaked government and corporate documents. Anonymous, who were responsible for attacks on Scientology in the past, have claimed credit for the intrusion. The email account has been used by Palin for conducting government business and communication, circumventing transparency laws.
The hacker gained access to Palin's account by answering Yahoo!'s security questions, finding the answers on websites like ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The hacker was apparently careless and frightened, and posted the new password on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A4chan"&gt;4chan.org&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as well as a few hasty screenshots. In the screenshots were proxy data, which ♡❤Ctunnel.com♡❤ owner Gabriel Ramuglia plans to use to help with &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; investigations. 

"White hat" hackers, however, have discovered that the hacker's online identity was linked to the email address of David Kernell, the son of &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATennessee%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Tennessee state representative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Kernell"&gt;Mike Kernell&lt;/a&gt;. When confronted, Kernell made no confirmation of that. While ♡❤4chan♡❤ has deleted all images of the email account, the screenshots have quickly spread to blogs and news websites online.

The one page document, which ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ confirms to be authentic, shows a list of individuals and passwords of those who have accounts on O'Reilly's website, ♡❤BillOReilly.com♡❤. The list, according to the document, contains at least 205 names, e-mail addresses, billing addresses and passwords of subscribers.

"The hack was a response to the pundit's recent scurrilous attacks over the &lt;a href="w%3ASarah%20Palin"&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/a&gt;'s email story--including on Wikileaks and other members of the press," said ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ in a statement on their website. According to the report, the security on O'Reilly's website was "non-existent".

"I'm not going to mention the website that posted this, but it's one of those despicable, slimy, scummy websites. Everybody knows where this stuff is, OK, and they know the people who run the website, so why can't they go there tonight to the guy's house who runs it, put him in cuffs and take him down and book him?," said O'Reilly on his show, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20O%27Reilly%20Factor"&gt;The O'Reilly Factor&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, on September 18.

♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ recently published documents from Palin's hacked ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AYahoo"&gt;Yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ e-mail account. The documents had shown that Palin had been conducting matters pertaining to the public or government of &lt;a href="Alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; over her private e-mail account.

In an exclusive statement to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ stated that they will only publish the single page, but also claim to have several more. ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ also states that they have already received "three letters" from staff members employed by O'Reilly "requesting" ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ remove the document, which ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ refuses to do.

"We simply cannot [remove the information]. The system, as per policy, is designed so that files can not be taken down, once up," said ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.

O'Reilly and Fox News have not yet responded to inquiries.

A video has surfaced which shows &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Paul%20Police%20Department"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;St. Paul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; arresting over 200 people at a city park during the first day of the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Convention"&gt;Republican National Convention&lt;/a&gt; (RNC) on September 1, 2008. The video first appeared on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ which was then picked up and reported on by the political news websites ♡❤Alternet.org♡❤ and ♡❤Blue Linchpin♡❤. Glass Bead Collective (GBC), which had interviewed the author of one of the buried videos, was preemptively raided before the RNC according to an interview published on ♡❤Democracynow.org♡❤.

The video, which had been buried in the park's ground by the author only known as 'Wes', shows hundreds of people, protesters and others who were there to only to attend the &lt;a href="w%3AService%20Employees%20International%20Union"&gt;Service Employees International Union&lt;/a&gt; (SEIU) concert and were not part of the convention at all; talking amongst themselves or passing through. Nearly 400 armed police officers, dressed in full riot gear, then began to surround them. Some officers were on bicycles while others were on horses. Some people began to yell for help while others complained that the officers cut them off from water and the use of restrooms for at least an hour. One video shows police shooting canisters of tear gas and percussion grenades at seemingly peaceful protesters, some who were on bicycles, were running and screaming for help.

According to another video posted on ♡❤Alternet.org♡❤, among those arrested were people just passing through or were there to use its services. It also states that the National Guard was dispatched to the park. When the narrator of one of the videos asks the police what the police are waiting for, he replies "we are waiting for them [other officers] to let us know when we can let you leave." Several minutes later, police began to arrest everyone they surrounded.

"Ladies and gentlemen, you are [all] under arrest. Please be seated, place your hands on your head and cooperate with us," stated a police officer speaking through a &lt;a href="w%3Amegaphone"&gt;megaphone&lt;/a&gt;. In the background one female is heard saying, "Are you serious?" 

The Glass Bead Collective tells ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that 'Wes' was charged with "felony rioting" but that after spending three days in jail, "his charges were downgraded to misdemeanors right before he saw the judge". GBC also tells ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that about a week after being released, 'Wes' went back to the park and retrieved his videotape.

It is not known if anyone was injured nor if any individuals remain in jail. Reports say that 800 people were arrested during the convention, with nearly 20% of those being the people inside the park.

The United States &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Trade%20Commission"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; filed charges against five companies for "deceptive advertising of bogus cancer cures". An additional six companies also named in the federal agency's complaint have settled and their cases will not go into litigation; however, they will be required to send letters to their former customers, and four will be forced to offer reimbursement 

The five companies charged are Omega Supply, &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt;; Native Essence Herb Company, &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Prado%2C%20New%20Mexico"&gt;El Prado, New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;; Daniel Chapter One, &lt;a href="w%3APortsmouth%2C%20Rhode%20Island"&gt;Portsmouth, Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;; Gemtronics, Inc., &lt;a href="w%3AFranklin%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Franklin, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and Herbs for Cancer, &lt;a href="w%3ASurprise%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Surprise, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. According to Lydia Parnes, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, "There is no credible scientific evidence that any of the products marketed by these companies can prevent, cure, or treat cancer of any kind." 

Attorney Richard Jaffe who represents the firm Native Essence, one of the companies charged, protested against the FDA's action. "In our view it's a battle between the right to speak and the government's censorship." Native Essence sells herbal supplements and informs customers of herbs that have historic use for cancer and other ailments. Jaffe asserts the claim of historic use is truthful and does not necessarily mean that the herb is effective. Other items marketed by the companies named in the action include &lt;a href="w%3Alaetrile"&gt;laetrile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aessiac%20tea"&gt;essiac tea&lt;/a&gt;, mushroom extracts, and black salve. FDA representative Douglas Stearn expressed concern that people who have cancer may select these items instead of treatments that have been studied and found effective, or that unstudied herbal treatments could produce drug interactions with conventional medicine. 

Before filing legal action the FTC sent over 100 warning letters and many firms dropped or changed the health claims for their products. In conjunction with the announcement the FDA announced a new website http://www.ftc.gov/curious that urges cancer patients to discuss all treatments they consider trying with their physicians, warns about the dangers of delaying or stopping cancer treatments in favour of &lt;a href="w%3Aalternative%20medicine"&gt;alternative medicine&lt;/a&gt;, and gives advice about spotting and reporting false health claims.

The parliament of &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; has approved government plans to make an &lt;a href="w%3AInitial%20Public%20Offering"&gt;Initial Public Offering&lt;/a&gt; (IPO) of shares in three major state-owned firms, privatising them. They are steelmaker Krakatau Steel, Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN) and national &lt;a href="w%3Aflag%20carrier"&gt;flag carrier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Garuda%20Indonesia"&gt;Garuda Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.

The parliament has left the process fully in the hands of the government, and has set the maximum stake to be sold at 30% for BTN and Krakatau, and 40% for Garuda. Although Indonesia has been known to fund budget deficits with privatisation, the intention is for the funds from this scheme to go to the businesses themselves to allow expansion.

Krakatau expects 3.2 trillion &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesian%20Rupiah"&gt;Rupiah&lt;/a&gt; (IDR) from the sale, while the estimated price for their stock is between IDR3 and IDR4 trillion (321 - 428 million &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;). Both &lt;a href="w%3AArcelorMittal%20SA"&gt;ArcelorMittal SA&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest steelmaker in the world, and &lt;a href="w%3ABlueScope%20Steel"&gt;BlueScope Steel&lt;/a&gt; Ltd, the largest in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, have expressed an interest in the IPO. Krakatau will use the funds to help finance an expansion scheme which aims to have production doubled to five million &lt;a href="w%3Atonne"&gt;tonne&lt;/a&gt;s in 2011.

BTN, which focuses on home owner loans, has set itself a target income of IDR36.12 trillion (3.86 billion USD) in 2010 compared to a projected IDR22.9 trillion ( 2.45 billion USD) this year. Net profit for this year is projected at IDR472 billion (50.5 million USD)and is hoped to rise to IDR1.39 trillion (148.7 million USD) in 2010. The bank's &lt;a href="w%3Aloan%20to%20deposit%20ratio"&gt;loan to deposit ratio&lt;/a&gt; is predicted to rise from 105.05% this year to 144.93% in 2012. BTN hopes to conduct its IPO before the end of 2008.
Garuda is not quite 100% state-owned to start with, unlike the other two, but is very close with 95.44% of the company belonging to the government. Like all of Indonesia's 51 airlines, Garuda is on the &lt;a href="w%3Alist%20of%20air%20carriers%20banned%20in%20the%20EU"&gt;list of air carriers banned in the EU&lt;/a&gt; due to safety concerns raised after a string of air accidents in the nation. Garuda expects to raise IDR4.2 trillion (449.4 million USD) in funds from the IPO, and will use IDR2.5 trillion (267.5 million USD) to pay off its debts and invest IDR1.7 trillion (181.9 million USD) in new aircraft.

The government is still working to get a deal to make IPOs for architectural firm Yodya Karya and three plantation firms called Perkebunan Nusantara III, IV and VII.

An international study, Awareness during Resuscitation experiment (Aware), will examine &lt;a href="w%3ANear%20death%20experience"&gt;near-death experiences&lt;/a&gt; involving 1,500 &lt;a href="w%3Acardiac%20arrest"&gt;cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt; survivors in about 25 centers in the US and Britain. The study is coordinated by the Human Consciousness Project at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Southampton"&gt;University of Southampton&lt;/a&gt;, which specializes in studying the &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20brain"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aconsciousness"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adeath"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;.

The research, expected to take three years, will analyze whether people with no heartbeat or brain activity can have "out of body" experiences. Some people report seeing a tunnel or bright light, recall looking down from the ceiling at medical staff, hearing voices telling them to return to the living world and others feel a tremendous sense of peace and well-being. 

During the study, doctors will use technology to study the brain and consciousness during cardiac arrest. To test whether such experiences involve the mind leaving the body, pictures will be placed around the areas of the hospital where heart attacks occur most frequently, such as accident and emergency and intensive care units. The pictures will only be visible from above. If patients are able to describe these pictures, project leaders argue that scientists will have to rethink how they understand the mind.

"There could be great benefits from this research for the future," said Penny Satori, an Intensive care nurse, who leads the project at &lt;a href="w%3AMorriston%20Hospital"&gt;Morriston Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. "As well as helping surviving patients psychologically after a trauma, it can give peace of mind to grieving families.

<h1>No evidence of engine fire at Aeroflot-Nord Flight 821 crash site</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=No%20evidence%20of%20engine%20fire%20at%20Aeroflot-Nord%20Flight%20821%20crash%20site&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Investigators have announced that there is no evidence of an engine fire in the wreckage of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAeroflot-Nord%20Flight%20821"&gt;Aeroflot-Nord Flight 821&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which crashed on September 14 in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APerm"&gt;Perm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , killing the 88 on board. This contradicts earlier eyewitness statements which say one engine was aflame when the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; crashed.

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;'s Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) says the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACFM%20International%20CFM56"&gt;CFM International CFM56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; engines kept operating up until impact. They also confirm the plane did not break up in the air. Instead, the investigation focus has shifted to some unusual movements that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Traffic%20Control"&gt;Air Traffic Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; records indicate were made by the pilot.

As announced earlier this week, the plane began to ascend instead of descend as it was cleared to do during final approach. After executing a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amissed%20approach"&gt;missed approach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; procedure, the 737-500 then turned in the wrong direction before crashing.

Efforts are continuing to analyse the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACockpit%20Voice%20Recorder"&gt;Cockpit Voice Recorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlight%20Data%20Recorder"&gt;Flight Data Recorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which were heavily damaged by a post-crash fire. It is hoped they will provide an insight as in to what the crew were up to during the flight's final moments.

Up-and-coming WWE star &lt;a href="w%3AOleg_Prudius"&gt;Vladimir Kozlov&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href="w%3ANashville%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Nashville, TN&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday night with an agenda. "I want better competition," the former sambo champion from Ukrane said last week. "If you will not give it to me, then I will find it myself." 

Kozolv has done just that, and he started his quest by attacking the top contender for the WWE Championship, &lt;a href="w%3AJeff_Hardy"&gt;Jeff Hardy&lt;/a&gt;, at the end his match last week. Hardy would again be the target for Kozlov's frustrations, but he would not be alone. Hardy had just won a hard-fought match against Brian Kendrick, as he was walking up the stage, he turned around to wave to the fans. As Hardy turned around to go backstage, he was surprised by Kozlov with a stiff kick to the chest. The blow left Hardy on the stage, gasping for breath, he would be carried away by medical staff during a commercial break. 

Later in the evening, it would be WWE Champion &lt;a href="w%3ATriple%20H"&gt;Triple H&lt;/a&gt; who would become the new target. After Triple H defeated Montel Vontavious Porter in the main event match, Vladimir Kozlov would ambush the champion as he was celebrating in the ring. Triple H, no stranger to being attacked unprepared, quickly retaliated and appeared to have the rookie handled. Kozlov was able to hold his own, and brought down the champion with a vicious head butt. As Triple H laid on the mat knocked out, Kozlov mouthed the words, "The end is near for you." 

Vladimir Kozlov received word shortly before this second attack that his wish for tougher competition would be answered. If he wants a shot at the WWE Champion, he will have to first go through another former champion, the 7'3" Great Khali. 

In other events, the reigning WWE Tag Team Champions were also looking for competition. Curt Hawkins and Zach Ryder made an impromptu appearance during ♡❤Carlito's Cabana♡❤ as host Carlito Colon was introducing the fans to his younger brother, WWE newcomer Primo Colon. The brothers from &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; had won their first match as a tag team last week. Hawkins and Ryder came down to the ring and picked a fight with the Colon brothers, challenging them to a match next week. It appeared that the tag team champions were leaving the ring, but when the Colon brothers turned their backs to leave as well, they were attacked by Hawkins and Ryder. Jesse and Festus Dalton came down to the ring to break the scuffle up.

Internet users, as well as editors making edits on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, have been the victims of a recent hoax that talk show host &lt;a href="w%3AOprah%20Winfrey"&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/a&gt; has been found dead in her &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; home. The rumors are considered to be a hoax, connected with the online group known as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Other reports say that the website ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A4chan"&gt;4chan.org&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is responsible for starting the rumor which began to spread quickly over the Internet.

Winfrey is set to appear on tonight's Emmy Awards ceremony broadcast.

The rumors started after a statement Winfrey made on a recent show, defending a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; bill against pedophiles and child rapists saying a pedophile group has "over 9,000 penises" harming children. She was referring to a comment left on her website by an individual affiliated with ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ who was claiming to be a pedophile. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ can confirm through anonymous sources that the rumor was started by the group ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ and the website ♡❤4chan♡❤.

According to an edit made by &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ACamalex"&gt;Camalex&lt;/a&gt;, a registered user on ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤, Winfrey was found dead "in her Chicago home early Saturday morning". It was followed by a source linking to a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADigg"&gt;Digg.com&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ article, which links to ♡❤oprahsdeath♡❤, a blog website regarding her alleged death. The first edit to her ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ article, which was posted by an anonymous user, stated that Winfrey was "lying dead on her bed" when a family member found her. According to the edit, she had been suffering chest pains for several days, but concealed the discomfort.

According to the ♡❤oprahsdeath♡❤ blog, Winfrey was found dead in her home at 8:21 a.m. on Saturday morning. Winfrey "appeared to have a bloody area around her eye, a bullet wound in her stomach and some cuts and bruises up and down her body." The post also says the suspect was "beaten" and "shot by a handgun". 

Shortly after the ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ edit, an anonymous user with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Protocol%20Address"&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt;, 24.109.236.254 on ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, added an edit to the &lt;a href="Newsroom"&gt;Newsroom&lt;/a&gt; that she had been "found dead".

On ♡❤Digg♡❤ users posted links to screen shots of websites allegedly carrying the news of her death via an alleged &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; report. Other ♡❤Digg♡❤ users left comments claiming to have seen it on their local news stations. Another screen shot apparently shows a &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; article on her death which states that police released the claims.

Despite the reports, there were no other news agencies covering Winfrey's alleged death which had lead many to believe the reports to be a hoax. A user commented on the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReddit"&gt;Reddit.com&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ website that "there are over 9000 reporters currently converging on Chicago". According to ♡❤Encyclopedia Dramatica♡❤, the term "Over 9000!" has been known to refer to an internet 'meme' which is derived from an &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; television show called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADragon%20Ball%20Z"&gt;Dragon Ball Z&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and was often used to exaggerate the numbers of protesters attending recent anti-&lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20Scientology"&gt;Scientology&lt;/a&gt; rallies.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APost%20Chronicle"&gt;Post Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ state that the reports are nothing more than a hoax created by members of the internet website ♡❤4chan.org♡❤. According to the Post's report who quote the ♡❤4chan♡❤, they are vowing to create "joker-like chaos" for at least the "next week".

"Let us take control, create "Joker-Like" chaos, this week has been a cute start, but I believe we can do more, much more. We are the new world order. The Illuminati are like children compared to our stature. To put it simply, my point is, Kill the Oprah," stated the Chronicle.

A video posted on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ which shows a broadcast of Winfrey's show, shows her talking about the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; senate bill 1738 which is aimed at establishing "a Special Counsel for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction within the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, to improve the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, to increase resources for regional computer forensic labs, and to make other improvements to increase the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute predators." The bill is sponsored by 2008 vice presidential hopeful &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;'s running mate. 
Near the end of Winfrey's statement on the bill, she states that on her message board on her show's website, someone claims to be "part of a known pedophile network."

"[He] doesn't forgive. [He] doesn't forget. His group has over 9,000 penises, and they are all raping children," stated Winfrey. "I want you to know they are organized, and they have systematic ways of hurting children". 'We don't forgive, we don't forget' is a phrase common among the group ♡❤Anonymous♡❤. ♡❤4chan♡❤ has claimed responsibility for the post, and in return allegedly began to spread the rumor of Winfrey's death.

One individual who claims to be part of the hoax, tells ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ that it "was fun as hell [spending] all day ♡❤/b/♡❤ [4chan] photoshopping screenshots of news stories. She got what she deserved. She called anonymous a bunch of pedophiles. Believed a troll on her message boards".

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has contacted ♡❤The Oprah Winfrey Show♡❤ to get a statement on the incident, but has yet to receive a response.

The group ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ has claimed responsibility for several pranks, or hacks against famous people in recent days. Hackers first started by hacking into &lt;a href="w%3ASarah%20Palin"&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; e-mail account and the information contained in it was posted to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikileaks"&gt;Wikileaks.org&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. After the incident, &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News%20Channel"&gt;FOX News&lt;/a&gt; commentator &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20O%27Reilly"&gt;Bill O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt; made comments against ♡❤Wikileaks♡❤ and other press agencies who posted the material, which was met with retaliation by hackers who broke into his website, ♡❤BillO'Reilly.com♡❤.

An email accidentally sent to Jeff Crouse of the ♡❤Anti-Advertising Agency♡❤ recently brought the controversial techniques of the advertising firm ♡❤Kluger Agency♡❤ under fire. 

"I'm writing because we feel you may be a good company to participate in a brand integration campaign within the actual lyrics of one of the worlds most famous recording artists upcoming song/album," the email read, offering to place &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Crouse"&gt;Jeff Crouse&lt;/a&gt;'s fake brand, Double Happiness Jeans, into the songs of popular artists. It was posted on his blog along with a reply that mocked Kluger and brought ridicule and criticism against Adam Kugler and his agency. According to Crouse, Kluger emailed him once again to claim it had been an automated email, and later requested that Crouse remove the post and comments criticizing himself and his agency, threatening a $150,000 lawsuit against Crouse for defamation. 

Kluger and his PR team have come forward defending the advertising techniques, stating that they do not have songs made just for the products in question and do not infringe on artistic integrity. "Now, we don't want an artist to write a song specifically to promote a brand, we just feel that if it's a product that's admired by the artist and fits his/her image, we now have the capability of leveling out the playing field and making things financially beneficial for all parties involved," he was quoted saying to ♡❤Wired♡❤.

However, the agency's website shows video examples of its product placement, with brand images and names often being repeated, pointed at, praised, or being the basis of the song. The website also advertises that "a successful 'brand-dropping' campaign will imprint [the] brand name and product into your market's subconscious".

]
&lt;a href="w%3AEliteXC"&gt;EliteXC&lt;/a&gt; Lightweight champion &lt;a href="w%3AKarl%20James%20Noons"&gt;K.J. Noons&lt;/a&gt; was stripped of the title on Friday by EliteXC officials for failure to defend the title. Outlined in a press release, EliteXC Head of Fight Operations, Jeremy Lappen stated that Noons turned down two opportunities to defend the title against top contender &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Diaz"&gt;Nick Diaz&lt;/a&gt;. 
"It's a very unfortunate situation but we cannot have belt-holders who refuse to fight the top contenders," Lappen said in the release. "We want champions who will fight anyone, anytime, anyplace. That's the mentality all champions should have." In June 2008 Noons reportedly turned down an opportunity to defend the title against Diaz in a rematch as the main event on the October 4 EliteXC show on CBS Sports. In August 2008, Noons again turned down an opportunity to fight Diaz for the belt on a future ♡❤ShoXC♡❤ card on Showtime Networks. "From my view, it is a fight against a top-named opponent in Diaz," Lappen went on to say, "a fighter KJ has bad blood with and a fight the fans really wanted to see. It seemed like a great opportunity for KJ to me."

K.J. Noons won the EliteXC Lightweight Championship on November 10, 2007 after the fight was stopped in the first round due to a cut over the eye of then-champion Nick Diaz. Noons has since successfully defended the title against veteran fighter &lt;a href="w%3AYves%20Edwards"&gt;Yves Edwards&lt;/a&gt; after Edwards was pummeled into a TKO 48 seconds into the first round. In an interview with ♡❤Sherdog.com♡❤ on August 29, however, Noons contends that the issue isn't over not wanting the rematch, but compensation by EliteXC. 

"I always wanted to fight Nick Diaz," Noons told reporter Loretta Hunt. "It's the most marketable fight for me, the best style fight for me. I think the fans want to see it. But you have to pay for something you want to see." Noons went on to explain that he took exception with the fact while he made $84,000 in the last two years, Diaz was paid $60,000 to take on lower-ranked opponent Thomas Denny on July 26. "It is about the money and how they were paying somebody I already beat three times more."

The future of K.J. Noons in EliteXC is uncertain. "KJ has two more fights remaining on his contract," said Jeremy Lappen, "We are still looking forward to having him fight for us again soon, but not as our world champion." However, recent public finding have revealed that EliteXC is $55 million in debt. Whether or not they can pay out the remainder of Noons' contract remains to be seen. Nonetheless, Noons is determined to continue on. "I can guarantee you that for MMA, I won't be sitting on the sidelines," he said. "I want to continue with my dream of pursuing two sports." 

EliteXC is expected to announce a fight for the vacant Lightweight title in the near future.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALarge%20Hadron%20Collider"&gt;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a&gt; (LHC) in &lt;a href="w%3ACERN"&gt;CERN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Geneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; suffered light damage on September 19, 2008 when one of the giant &lt;a href="w%3Asuperconducting%20magnets"&gt;superconducting magnets&lt;/a&gt; that guide the protons failed during a test. A large amount of &lt;a href="w%3Ahelium"&gt;helium&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to cool the magnets to 1.9 Kelvin (-271C; -456F) leaked into the collider tunnel. LHC will now be shut down for at least two months for repairs. Physicists say such setbacks are an inevitable part of starting up such a large and complicated machine.

Several mishaps, including the failure of a 30 ton &lt;a href="w%3Aelectrical%20transformer"&gt;electrical transformer&lt;/a&gt;, have slowed LHC's progress since the initial start-up on September 10, 2008. The laboratory said in a statement that an electrical connection between the magnets had melted because of the high current. The machine has more than 1,200 &lt;a href="w%3Adipole"&gt;dipole&lt;/a&gt; magnets arranged end-to-end in the underground ring. These magnets carry and steer the &lt;a href="w%3Aproton"&gt;proton&lt;/a&gt; beams which will accelerate around the machine at close to the speed of light. One of the LHC's eight sectors will now have to be warmed up to well above its operating temperature so that repairs can take place.

The collider is designed to accelerate protons to energies of seven trillion &lt;a href="w%3Aelectron%20volts"&gt;electron volts&lt;/a&gt; and collide them together in search of new particles and forces. After the initial success of accelerating protons through the machine, physicists had hoped they could move ahead quickly to low energy collisions at 450 billion electron volts and then 5 trillion electron volt collisions as early as mid-October.

The recent setbacks, however, mean that hopes the first trial collisions would be carried out before the machine's official inauguration on October 21, 2008 now look doubtful. It even looks uncertain whether this can be achieved before 2009.

&lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20Award"&gt;Grammy Award&lt;/a&gt; winning singer &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Michael"&gt;George Michael&lt;/a&gt; has been cautioned over drug use. The 45 year old singer was caught with class A and C drugs in the &lt;a href="w%3AHampstead%20Heath"&gt;Hampstead Heath&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. He was arrested on 19 September after being caught in the public toilet. British &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Office"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt; Minister Tony McNulty said drug laws needed to be "flexible". He stated he did not know the details of the case when questioned why Michael was given a mild sentence. 

Michael was banned from driving for two years after being caught slumped behind the wheel of his car twice. He pleaded guilty to driving while unfit through drugs. On May 15, 2006 Michael was found semi-conscious apparently snoozing at traffic lights while in his &lt;a href="w%3ARange%20Rover"&gt;Range Rover&lt;/a&gt;. In the early hours of October 1, 2006, Michael was found unconscious in his &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz%20S-Class"&gt;Mercedes-Benz S-Class&lt;/a&gt; car, causing an obstruction. 
Michael found his fame as front man of pop band &lt;a href="w%3AWham%21"&gt;Wham!&lt;/a&gt;. He won two Grammy awards as well as 12 British number one singles. Michael announced that he would be retiring from touring after completing his first tour in 15 years last month. He announced that he would release a Christmas single in December.

A &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; couple have died after their car collided with a bus carrying a group of children. The crash took part on the &lt;a href="w%3AA64"&gt;A64&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AStaxton"&gt;Staxton&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AScarborough"&gt;Scarborough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Yorkshire"&gt;North Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday morning. The bus continued on through a hedge line and hit an unoccupied &lt;a href="w%3Acamper%20van"&gt;camper van&lt;/a&gt;. Six passengers on the bus were treated for minor injuries.

Detective Inspector Geoff Carey of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Yorkshire%20Police"&gt;North Yorkshire Police&lt;/a&gt; said that "The coach was carrying a group of young people as well as adults and they are very shocked. They have slight injuries but a great deal of shock." He also commented on the after crash saying that "Had the Winnebago not been there the bus could have gone into the house."

The bus was traveling from Pelsall to Primrose Valley holiday park in North Yorkshire to attend &lt;a href="w%3Amarching%20band"&gt;marching band&lt;/a&gt; competition when the accident happened.

The North Yorkshire police were unable to give any more details. The A64 was closed in both directions at Staxton at the junction with the B1249. Motorists were advised to avoid the area, which has become congested, according to police.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2008-09-21%3A%20CCTV%20footage%20shows%20bombing%20of%20Marriott%20Hotel%20in%20Islamabad%2C%20Pakistan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ACCTV"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt; footage has been released showing a truck bomb exploding outside the &lt;a href="w%3AMarriott"&gt;Marriott&lt;/a&gt; Hotel in &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad%2C%20Pakistan"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. The footage shows a camera, which was manually controlled to focus specifically on the developments as they happened.

The nearly four minutes of footage, shows a large truck pulling up in front of the hotel at a guarded gate. After the truck attempted to ram through the barrier, some reports stated that guards began to fire shots into the truck.

"The truck was stopped at the barrier and there was an altercation between the attacker and the guards," said Pakistani Interior Ministry official Rehman Malik in a statement to the press.

Guards began to run away once the truck slammed into the gates, but began to approach the truck seconds later. The cabin of the truck then explodes sending sparks and debris in all directions, with some of it hitting the camera. The truck begins to catch fire and people can be seen returning to the scene in an attempt to put out the blaze. Unsuccessful, the truck explodes, taking the camera out with it.

Officials believe &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for the attack which killed 53 people and injured almost 300. Rescuers are searching for survivors, as an unknown number of people are still missing. At least 21 of those killed were from foreign countries.

Officials say the target was aimed for a residence a block away which was said to be housing Asif Ali Zardari, Pakistan's new prime minister. He was attending a dinner with several other Pakistani officials.

Almost 13,000 children in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have fallen sick in a wave of sickness caused by baby's milk contaminated with &lt;a href="w%3Amelamine"&gt;melamine&lt;/a&gt;, a banned chemical which can cause kidney stones, irritation, and ulcers. Most of the sickened children are infants two years or younger, and four children have died from the chemical so far. 

The Chinese Health Ministry has stated that most of the tainted milk was produced by Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co.'s infant milk powder and have pulled several dairy products off the shelves of Chinese stores. Sanlu, Mengniu and Yili were among the largest brands recalled, and have been attempting to repair their damaged public image. Yili announced that it would be reviewing its manufacturing process and making necessary safety changes. Yang Wenjun, president of Mengniu, apologized for the contamination and promised to make changes as well. Sanlu, meanwhile, has stopped production and is checking all products.

The Ministry is conducting an investigation into why the number of illnesses doubled Saturday. Ten percent of yogurt, milk and ice cream is also contaminated, however adults will not be affected if they drink less than two litres a day of the contaminated products. 

Melamine is an industrial byproduct, infamous for poisoning thousands of pets in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. Investigators believe it was used by desperate dairy companies to disguise diluted milk in dairy products in order to pass quality tests and make higher profits.

A car bomb exploded early Monday near a military academy in the coastal town of &lt;a href="w%3ASantona"&gt;Santona&lt;/a&gt;, in northern &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, killing a soldier and wounding several others. The authorities blame the &lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20people"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aseparatism"&gt;separatist&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href="ETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt; for the attack. It was the third car bombing in 24 hours believed to have been caused by ETA.

The first bomb exploded early Sunday near the headquarters of the &lt;a href="w%3ACaja%20Vital%20Kutxa"&gt;Caja Vital Kutxa&lt;/a&gt; bank in the &lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20Country"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt; political capital, &lt;a href="w%3AVitoria-Gasteiz"&gt;Vitoria-Gasteiz&lt;/a&gt;. No one was injured, but the building suffered heavy damage.

A few hours later a second bomb exploded near an &lt;a href="w%3AErtzaintza"&gt;Ertzaintza&lt;/a&gt; (Basque police) station in the coastal town of &lt;a href="w%3AOndarroa"&gt;Ondarroa&lt;/a&gt;. Three police officers and seven civilians were injured. Officials said two suspected bombers parked a car close to the outside wall of the station, threw a Molotov cocktail to attract attention, and then detonated about 100kg of explosives. 

The latest blast happened at about 01:00 (2300 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; Sunday) and was preceded by a warning call in the name of ETA. The army officer Brigadier Luis Conde de la Cruz was killed and another soldier severely injured while the police were securing the area.

The attacks come at a time of increased turbulence in Basque politics. This week Spanish courts outlawed two Basque &lt;a href="w%3Anationalism"&gt;nationalist&lt;/a&gt; political parties (which have hundreds of elected town councillors and regional parliament deputies) charged of being directly linked to ETA and jailed 21 people who work on behalf of ETA prisoners and their relatives.

The first play written by former &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3AV%C3%A1clav%20Havel"&gt;Václav Havel&lt;/a&gt; after his presidential retirement saw a great success at its first showing outside of the Czech Republic. ♡❤Leaving♡❤ was staged by the London &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20Tree%20Theatre"&gt;Orange Tree Theatre&lt;/a&gt; starting on September 20.

The audience in the sold-out theatre reacted spontaneously to the play’s text and to Havel’s own notes. The playwright commented his play and characters' acts through his pre-recorded words. He was not present at the premiere himself, his visit is expected on Friday, September 26.

Geoffrey Bevers played the main role of chancellor who is suffering when leaving politics. The play was translated to English by Canadian writer Paul Wilson and directed by Sam Walters, the artistic leader of the Orange Tree.

Wilson knows Czech society and language because he stayed in Prague in the 1970s (he was also member of a famous underground musical group The &lt;a href="w%3APlastic%20People%20of%20the%20Universe"&gt;Plastic People of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;). In 1977, he was forced to leave former Czechoslovakia after The Plastic People were disbanded. Wilson has rich experiences from translating Havel’s texts into English; he has translated two more Havel plays. He thinks ♡❤Leaving♡❤ can be the work that can be best accepted outside Czech Republic because of its dateless topic.

Director Sam Walters named the play "funny and sad, about big things, about politics, but also about personal fortunes." His company will perform ♡❤Leaving♡❤ till the middle of December and it will add other Havel plays ♡❤Mountain Hotel♡❤, ♡❤Audience♡❤, ♡❤Private View♡❤ and ♡❤Protest♡❤.

Havel's ♡❤Leaving♡❤ was first staged in Czech language in &lt;a href="w%3APrague"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; May 22, 2008. Havel tried to have the play in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Theatre%20%28Prague%29"&gt;National Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, but the premiere took place in the Archa Theatre at the end. The expected participation of Havel's wife Dagmar Havlová was also cancelled.

&lt;a href="w%3AStrikeforce"&gt;Strikeforce's&lt;/a&gt; return to action in Beverly Hills, CA draws to a close as &lt;a href="w%3AKazuo_Misaki"&gt;Kazuo Misaki&lt;/a&gt; earns a controversial win over &lt;a href="w%3AJoe_Riggs"&gt;Joe Riggs&lt;/a&gt; after a second round fight stoppage. 

Capitalizing on its successful debut a year ago at the private residence of ♡❤Playboy♡❤ founder Hugh Heffner, &lt;a href="w%3AStrikeforce%3A_At_The_Mansion_II"&gt;Strikeforce at the Mansion II&lt;/a&gt; was an invitation-only event where elite guests were treated to a wine tasting and gourmet buffet dinner before the show, with the fight being carried live on pay-per-view. There were nine fights on the card scheduled for the evening. 

The first round of the main event saw very little action as Misaki and Riggs were feeling each other out. Fans expressed their displeasure over the lack of action. A pair of low kicks by Misaki put him ahead in the scoring 10-9 after the first round. The second round saw the action open up. Misaki started to throw more punches and combinations in the first minute, with Riggs blocking most of the blows and only offering a timid response. Riggs found an opening after a straight left, and followed it up with another powerful left punch that stunned Misaki. Misaki immediately got to his feet and answered with a right cross punch that knocked Riggs staggering backwards. Misaki quickly jumped on Riggs and pummeled him with punches, with Riggs covering up to block them. 

The controversy came several seconds later as referee Josh Rosenthal stopped the fight, awarding the win to Kazuo Misaki at 2:29 of Round Two by technical knockout (TKO) due to unanswered repeated strikes. In an interview with MMA Weekly, Rosenthal said that he warned Riggs three times that he needed to advance his defensive position, but he failed to do so. Riggs, upset by the stoppage, said in an interview, "I'm really upset, I thought it was an early stoppage. That's twice Josh Rosenthal's fucked me over, first with Alex Stiebling, now with Misaki." Misaki said in his post-fight interview that he didn't feel qualified to comment on whether the stoppage was premature.

According to &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i intelligence officials, at midnight last night, two &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military helicopters entered Pakistani airspace and were fired on by local troops, a second such event to occur this week. Pakistani officials call the incident a "violation" of its airspace.

The helicopters, suspected of chasing militants, reportedly left the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Waziristan"&gt;North Waziristan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tribal region they had entered and retreated to &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; without returning fire. Pakistani troops have been given orders to open fire at any foreign troops crossing the border.

On October 14, 2008, Canadians will be heading to the polls for the federal election. ♡❤♡New Democratic Party candidate Michael McMahon♡❤♡ is standing for election in ♡❤♡the riding of &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Edward%E2%80%94Hastings"&gt;Prince Edward—Hastings&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. McMahon moved to Windsor in 1951, getting a degree in education, teaching locally and in Papua New Guinea. He served as Branch President of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF), served on multiple of their major committees, and recently retired from the Hastings and Prince Edward District School Board.

Wikinews contacted Michael McMahon, to talk about the issues facing Canadians, and what they and their party would do to address them. Wikinews is in the process of contacting every candidate, in every riding across the country, no matter their political stripe. All interviews are conducted over e-mail, and interviews are published unedited, allowing candidates to impart their full message to our readers, uninterrupted.

Since being redefined in 2003, the riding includes the County of Prince Edward and the County of Hastings (except the City of Quinte West). Conservative Party member Daryl Kramp currently represents the riding, after beating a Liberal in 2004. Ken Cole of the Liberals and Alan Coxwell of the Greens are also running in the riding.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡Why are you running for political office, why at the federal level, why this party, and why in this riding?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?♡❤♡ 

♡❤♡As you campaign around your riding, it's likely that some issues are mentioned more often by voters, than other issues. What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding? What would you and your party do to address these issues?♡❤♡ 

♡❤♡Is there any misconceptions about you, your leader, or your party and platform?♡❤♡

♡❤♡There's a more ways than ever to get your message out, from the traditional campaign fliers and lawn signs, to new media like websites, Facebook, and YouTube. The tried-and-true routes get the message out to the masses much easier, but digital alternatives are much more measurable in how many are seeing or interacting with your campaign. What seems to be the most effective, from your experience?♡❤♡

<h1>2% of British pound coins are counterfeit according to research</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2%25%20of%20British%20pound%20coins%20are%20counterfeit%20according%20to%20research&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Research has found that approximately two per cent of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20pound%20coin"&gt;British pound coin&lt;/a&gt;s in circulation are counterfeit, since the number of fake £1 coins has doubled in the past five years. This means approximately 30 million of these fake coins are currently in circulation.
Despite these large increases, the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Mint"&gt;Royal Mint&lt;/a&gt; has claimed that these figures show "a comparatively low incidence of counterfeit coins by international monetary standards." Other people, however, disagree with the mint's assessment.

Robert Matthews, a coin consultant who was formerly the Queen's Assay master expressed his disagreement with the opinion of the Royal Mint to &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News%20Online"&gt;BBC News Online&lt;/a&gt;. "In 2004, people started refusing to take the South African 5 Rand coin, due to concerns about the number of counterfeits, and eventually the coin had to be redesigned and re-circulated," he pointed out. "Independent surveys showed the number of counterfeits to be 2% - the same as we've got here - and I'm worried that if we're not careful the same thing will happen to the pound coin." 

It is illegal to make or use counterfeited coins, according to the Royal Mint, who said that all people who believe they are in possession of a fake must hand it in.

In comparison, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt; has been estimated as having less than 0.1% counterfeit coins among the circulation of 50c, €1 and €2 coins.

On October 14, 2008, Canadians will be heading to the polls for the federal election. ♡❤♡New Democratic Party incumbent &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Christopherson"&gt;David Christopherson&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is standing for re-election in ♡❤♡the riding of &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%20Centre"&gt;Hamilton Centre&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

From 1985-1990, he served as a Hamilton City Councillor for Ward Four. He was elected to Ontario legislature in 1990, defeating a Liberal cabinet minister. Under Bob Rae, Christopherson served as Minister of Correctional Services and Solicitor-General. He did not seek re-election to legislature in 2003, opting to run for mayor of Hamilton. Considered a frontrunner, he lost to Larry Di Ianni.

He returned to politics just months later, changing his focus to federal politics. Christopherson beat Liberal cabinet minister Stan Keyes, the incumbent, serving as NDP critic for cities, community infrastructure, labour and steel policy. He has served as a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and Deputy Chair of the Parliamentary Steel Caucus.

Wikinews contacted &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Christopherson"&gt;David Christopherson&lt;/a&gt;, to talk about the issues facing Canadians, and what they and their party would do to address them.

All interviews are conducted over e-mail, and interviews are published unedited, allowing candidates to impart their full message to our readers, uninterrupted.

First elected in 2004, David Christopherson is the only MP to have represented Hamilton Centre, which was created in 2003 from parts of three other ridings. Only 38 km², small versus other area ridings, its located on the south side of Hamilton Harbour. Alphabetically, Christopherson's challengers are Anthony Giles (Libertarian), John Livingstone (Green), Lisa Nussey (Marxist-Leninist), Leon O'Connor (Conservative), Ryan Sparrow (Communist), and Helen M. Wilson (Liberal).

&lt;a href="w%3AJulie%20Ditty"&gt;Julie Ditty&lt;/a&gt; won the singles title of the ColemanVision Tennis Championship in &lt;a href="w%3AAlbuquerque"&gt;Albuquerque&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, defeating No. 1 seeded Paraguayan native &lt;a href="w%3ARossana%20de%20los%20Rios"&gt;Rossana de los Rios&lt;/a&gt; 6-4, 7-6 (3). It was the first singles title of the year for Ditty, the No. 2 seed from Ashland, &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.

In the first set, Ditty started strong, leading 4-0 and later 5-2. However, de los Rios rallied, closing to 5-4. Ditty then broke de los Rios’s serve to close out the set. Throughout the match, de los Rios had the more powerful groundstrokes, but Ditty adopted a strategy featuring numerous lobs and moonballs that drove de los Rios back nearly to the fence surrounding the court and neutralized her power.

Ditty took a 5-2 lead in the second set, then failed to convert on six match points before de los Rios fought back to tie the match at 6-6, sending the second set to a tiebreak. Ditty lead throughout the tiebreak and eventually won it 7-3, on a double fault by de los Rios.

Later in the day, Ditty and American teammate &lt;a href="w%3ACarly%20Gullickson"&gt;Carly Gullickson&lt;/a&gt;, the tournament’s No. 2 doubles seed, defeated the No. 4 seeded team of &lt;a href="w%3AJorgelina%20Cravero"&gt;Jorgelina Cravero&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABetina%20Jozami"&gt;Betina Jozami&lt;/a&gt;, both from &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, by a score of 6-3, 6-4.

A species of treefrog that was three years from being declared extinct was found in July in the tropical northeast of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Cook%20University"&gt;local university&lt;/a&gt; Ph.D. candidate, Robert Puschendorf, along with volunteer researchers stumbled upon the armoured mistfrog (♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALitoria%20lorica"&gt;Litoria lorica&lt;/a&gt;♡❤) while surveying a related species near &lt;a href="w%3AMareeba%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Mareeba, Queensland&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers thought they were catching a similar torrent treefrog (♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALitoria%20nannotis"&gt;Litoria nannotis&lt;/a&gt;♡❤), until they examined a specimen more closely.

The &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reported that &lt;a href="w%3APolymerase%20chain%20reaction"&gt;PCR&lt;/a&gt; lab results showed that the mistfrogs were not unaffected by the devastating &lt;a href="w%3Achytridiomycosis"&gt;chytridiomycosis&lt;/a&gt;, a pandemic disease affecting almost all frog species. Remarkably, they may actually be immune to fatal effects of the fungal infection. Puschendorf plans to publish a paper on the new findings of this &lt;a href="w%3ALazarus%20taxon"&gt;Lazarus species&lt;/a&gt;.

Several mainstream news outlets have misstated and overstated a possible link between cellular phone use and decreased fertility in men. A single experiment, which has not yet been published in any peer reviewed journal or replicated by other scientists, observed an average decrease in sperm motility and an increase in &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20radical"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt; among laboratory sperm samples that were exposed to &lt;a href="w%3Aradiation"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt; similar to the radiation produced by cellular phone use. 
Dr. Ashok Agarwal of the &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland%20Clinic"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; estimates the overall health impact of cellular phones as "very safe" and reassured a &lt;a href="w%3ACable%20News%20Network"&gt;Cable News Network&lt;/a&gt; reporter that the research was too premature to advise lifestyle changes for the public. "Our study has not provided proof that you should stop putting cell phones in your pocket. There are many things that need to be proven before we get to that stage." He noted that his own cell phone was in his trouser pocket while he was giving the interview. Dr. Agarwal is the lead researcher for the study and Director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. 

Cell phone industry spokesman Joe Farren agreed with Dr. Agarwal's assessment about the devices' overall safety: "The weight of the published scientific evidence, in addition to the opinion of global health organizations, shows that there is no link between wireless usage and adverse health effects."

The controlled experiment used sperm samples from thirty-two donors: twenty-three healthy men and nine men who had fertility problems. Sperm were then exposed to radiation for one hour at 850 megahertz, the most common frequency for cell phones in the United States. Dr. Agarwal's study raises a possible concern that cell phones kept on belts or trouser pockets and used in conjunction with wireless &lt;a href="w%3Abluetooth"&gt;bluetooth&lt;/a&gt; earpieces "could cause harmful effects due to the proximity of the phones and the exposure that they are causing to the gonads." He also noted that follow-up research is needed to determine whether the body's skin and other tissue affords protection from the potential damage.

Several news sources ran misleading reports that overstated the risk.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ asserted a &lt;a href="w%3ACorrelation%20does%20not%20imply%20causation"&gt;fallacious&lt;/a&gt; causal relationship that Dr. Agarwhal had not drawn and ignored his opinions that cellular phones are safe and no change in phone use is necessary. Instead, the piece opened by ordering men to stop keeping cell phones in their pockets:

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACiol%20News"&gt;Ciol News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ ran a similar account:

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20Magazine"&gt;Mobile Magazine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ went a step further, also alluding to &lt;a href="Media%20reports%20exaggerate%20cell%20phone%20cancer%20risk"&gt;previous media exaggerations&lt;/a&gt; about cellular phone dangers:

♡❤Mobile Magazine♡❤ also ended in a misleading manner with "I wonder if it's healthier to put your phone in your shirt pocket instead," failing to mention that Dr. Agarwal had addressed that concern and had called it an unnecessary precaution.

Not all news sources overplayed the findings. CNN and &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Press%20International"&gt;United Press International&lt;/a&gt; ran balanced reports that did not suggest dangers or precautions beyond the lead researcher's conclusions.

<h1>Mass delivery of anti-Islamic DVDs in swing voting states</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mass%20delivery%20of%20anti-Islamic%20DVDs%20in%20swing%20voting%20states&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Voters in swing states across the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; began receiving a one-hour DVD of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AObsession%3A%20Radical%20Islam%E2%80%99s%20War%20Against%20the%20West"&gt;Obsession: Radical Islam’s War Against the West&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ over the weekend. The video was produced and distributed by &lt;a href="w%3AClarion%20Fund"&gt;Clarion Fund&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit organization connected with Zionist and pro-Israeli organizations. The DVDs were delivered with leading newspapers mostly in swing states such as Ohio, Florida, and Michigan.

The film focuses on drawing parallels between "&lt;a href="w%3AIslamofascism"&gt;Islamo-fascists&lt;/a&gt;" and &lt;a href="w%3ANazism"&gt;Nazis&lt;/a&gt;, and opens with a series of videos of terrorist acts. It features interviews with &lt;a href="w%3Acounter-terrorism"&gt;counter-terrorism&lt;/a&gt; analysts, footage from Arabic TV, and interviews with former &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorists&lt;/a&gt;. 

The film's website states that the filmmakers "are against the Radical Islamists [sic] who want to impose their violent, oppressive world view, with little value for life and the manifold pleasures within", but that they feel they share the same values and fears as most Muslims. The goal of the film, they say, is to raise public awareness, link isolated terrorist events to global origins, correct media misinformation, recognize efforts for Muslim tolerance, and promote efforts to fight "the Radical Islamic threat".

♡❤Obsession♡❤ has drawn both criticism and praise in the U.S. "Obsession is without exaggeration one of the most important films of our time," wrote &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AGlenn%20Beck"&gt;Glenn Beck&lt;/a&gt;. The film received awards at numerous film festivals like the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberty%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Liberty Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. 

But outraged &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; have objected to the film and its distribution. According to the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20on%20American-Islamic%20Relations"&gt;Council on American-Islamic Relations&lt;/a&gt; (CAIR), which has received a large amount of calls over the matter, Muslims feel it is "an attempt to not only marginalize and demonize the American Muslim community, but also to sway the election by targeting swing states". 

The film has been criticized for misquoting sources, poor fact checking, and including biased witnesses and testimony. Several of the analysts featured in the film have been criticized as being racist and anti-Islamic. &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Pipes"&gt;Daniel Pipes&lt;/a&gt;, one of the talking heads in the film, was reported as saying that Muslims in America present "true dangers to American Jews". Nonie Darwish, also featured in the film, has been widely criticized for his belief that "Islam is the devil" and thinks "Islam is cruel, anti-women, anti-religious freedom and anti-personal freedom in general."
&lt;a href="w%3AClarion%20Fund"&gt;Clarion Fund&lt;/a&gt;, which also sells a DVD titled ♡❤The Third Jihad♡❤, states copies are being distributed to 28 million homes but there is no intent to sway voters. The organization's focus, however, is only on radical Islamic threats to national security, and the group also runs a website RadicalIslam.org which recently endorsed &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;. 

An investigation by &lt;a href="w%3AInter%20Press%20Service"&gt;Inter Press Service&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 revealed that ♡❤Obsession♡❤♡s production was... closely tied to right-wing Zionists both in America and &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. Rabbi Ephram Shore, brother of Clarion Fund's founder &lt;a href="w%3ARaphael%20Shore"&gt;Raphael Shore&lt;/a&gt;, is the head of an Israeli group which was involved in the film. Various weblinks on the group's website focus on &lt;a href="w%3AAntisemitism"&gt;anti-Semitism&lt;/a&gt; and Israel.

The funds for the production of the movie were reported as having been borrowed, but there is no word on where the funds for the distribution came from. A spokesman for CAIR, &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20Hooper"&gt;Ibrahim Hooper&lt;/a&gt;, commented that he "can't imagine that you can produce, package, distribute and advertise this product for less than 50 million dollars".

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=American%20war%20deserter%20given%20stay%20of%20deportation%20in%20Canada&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An American soldier who served in Afghanistan, &lt;a href="w%3AJeremy%20Hinzman"&gt;Jeremy Hinzman&lt;/a&gt; was granted a surprise stay of deportation by the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Court%20of%20Canada"&gt;Federal Court of Canada&lt;/a&gt; one day before he was scheduled to be sent back to face trial for &lt;a href="w%3Adesertion"&gt;desertion&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. The move has put the issue of &lt;a href="w%3AList_of_Iraq_War_resisters%23Objectors_who_have_fled_to_Canada"&gt;American deserters who fled to Canada&lt;/a&gt; following the 2003 &lt;a href="w%3AInvasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; back in the national spotlight.

Judge Richard Mosley heard arguments from Hinzman's lawyer that suggested that while desertion was not an unfairly punished crime south of the border, the sentencing of deserter Robin Long several weeks ago proved that the country was targeting those deserters who had also been &lt;a href="w%3AOpposition%20to%20the%20Iraq%20War"&gt;vocal opponents of the Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; with harsher sentences. Prosecutors had pointed to a media interview in which Long criticised the invasion as being illegal and immoral, arguing that it constituted an aggravating factor worthy of additional punishment. 

Mosley ruled Hinzman would likely "suffer irreparable harm" if Canada were to forcibly return him to the United States.

One of the first American soldiers to cross the border in January 2004, Hinzman cited his religious conversion to the &lt;a href="w%3AReligious%20Society%20of%20Friends"&gt;Quaker&lt;/a&gt; church which forbids violence, but was ordered deported back to the United States along with eight other soldiers who had entered Canada. 
A non-binding vote in Canadian Parliament in June overturned the orders and supported allowing the deserters to remain in the country legally. However, &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;the ruling Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; ignored the vote and ordered the deportations to continue. 

A number of &lt;a href="w%3Agrassroots"&gt;grassroots&lt;/a&gt; protests spread across the country, demanding that Hinzman, his wife and two children, and as many as 40 other soldiers and their families now hiding in Canada be allowed to remain.

During the &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;, more than 20,000 American men fled to Canada to avoid serving in combat, with as many as 125,000 family members, supporters and protesters following them. It marked the largest political emigration from the United States since the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Revolution"&gt;American Revolution&lt;/a&gt; two centuries earlier.

On Monday night, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Football%20League"&gt;Australian Football&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Cooney"&gt;Adam Cooney&lt;/a&gt; won the Australian Football League's most prestigious award, the &lt;a href="w%3ABrownlow%20Medal"&gt;Brownlow Medal&lt;/a&gt;, awarded to the AFL's best and fairest. He received 24 votes, ahead of &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Black"&gt;Simon Black&lt;/a&gt; with 23 votes and &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Ablett%20Jr"&gt;Gary Ablett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Richardson"&gt;Matthew Richardson&lt;/a&gt; with 22 votes. Cooney took the lead after 20 rounds of votes had been cast (from twenty-two), and is the first &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Bulldogs"&gt;Western Bulldogs&lt;/a&gt; player to win the medal since &lt;a href="w%3A1992"&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;.

Cooney was surprised to win the medal, after having been locked out of the vote count for two rounds (after having been to the toilet), and at one point, about to leave the vote count, believing he had little chance of winning the medal. However, he returned, and took the lead.

The Brownlow Medal is the start of AFL Grand Final week, which ends on Saturday, September 29, with the &lt;a href="w%3AAFL%20Grand%20Final"&gt;AFL Grand Final&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href="w%3AGeelong%20Football%20Club"&gt;Geelong Cats&lt;/a&gt; playing against the &lt;a href="w%3AHawthorn%20Football%20Club"&gt;Hawthorn Hawks&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Cricket%20Ground"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;.

It should also be noted that AFL CEO, Andrew Demetriou mistakenly started reading out the votes for Round 2 first, instead of the votes for Round 1.

Despite repeatedly saying that he would not endorse a particular candidate for this November's &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election"&gt;U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Paul"&gt;Congressman Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; made a surprise statement Monday afternoon in which he announced that he was supporting &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20Party"&gt;Constitution Party&lt;/a&gt; nominee &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Baldwin"&gt;Chuck Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;.

This comes after &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Libertarian%20Party"&gt;Libertarian Party&lt;/a&gt; nominee former congressman &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Barr"&gt;Bob Barr&lt;/a&gt;'s controversial last minute refusal to attend Paul's third party unity conference at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Press%20Club%20%28USA%29"&gt;National Press Club&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20DC"&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt; nearly two weeks ago. 

Instead, Barr held a press conference of his own a few hours later at the same location. In it he announced that he did not care about third party candidates getting a large amount of votes in the election, only himself. This statement caused Barr to rapidly decrease in voter popularity over the following week. Many of his former supporters have since joined Baldwin's and Independent &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Nader"&gt;Ralph Nader&lt;/a&gt;'s presidential campaigns.
"I’ve thought about the unsolicited advice from the Libertarian Party candidate," Paul said Monday. "He has convinced me to reject my neutral stance in the November election. I’m supporting Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party candidate."

<h1>Stressed plants produce aspirin-like chemical</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Stressed%20plants%20produce%20aspirin-like%20chemical&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20for%20Atmospheric%20Research"&gt;National Center for Atmospheric Research&lt;/a&gt; have found that stressed plants produce an &lt;a href="w%3Aaspirin"&gt;aspirin&lt;/a&gt;-like chemical, &lt;a href="w%3Amethyl%20salicylate"&gt;methyl salicylate&lt;/a&gt;. Methyl salicylate is also known as oil of &lt;a href="w%3AWintergreen"&gt;wintergreen&lt;/a&gt;. This semi-volatile plant &lt;a href="w%3Ahormone"&gt;hormone&lt;/a&gt; was detected in the air above the plants in the experiments conducted in a walnut grove near &lt;a href="w%3ADavis%2C%20California"&gt;Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. According to the scientists the chemical may be a sort of immune response that help protect the plants. 

Acetylsalicylic acid, commonly called aspirin, had originally come from the bark of &lt;a href="w%3AWillow"&gt;Willow&lt;/a&gt; trees. It had never been observed to be emitted as a gas. The researchers observed spikes in methyl salicylate after nighttime temperatures dipped low, which suggested the plants were reacting to cold stress. The peaks were higher during a dry period, pointing to combined stress of cold nighttime temperatures and mild drought.

Laboratory observations have shown that numerous plants produce methyl salicylate, but this is the first time the phenomenon has been observed in nature. Previous studies have shown that plants being eaten by animals produce chemicals that can be sensed by other plants. A study conducted in 1997 found that methyl salicylate is produced by tobacco plants inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus. Emitting methyl salicylate may be a means for the plants to warn other plants about a threat.

The finding may help to more readily identify plants under stress by monitoring for the airborne distress signal.

At approximately 11:00 a.m. Central European Summer Time, a man in his twenties entered the ♡❤Kauhajoen koti- ja laitostalousoppilaitos♡❤ vocational school in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKauhajoki"&gt;Kauhajoki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFinland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; with a gun and began to open fire, killing 11 people.

The man identified as Matti Juhani Saari, 22, was wearing a mask when he entered the school. Reports say he was a student at the school. The shooting is reported to have occurred in the school's cellar, where students were taking an exam. At least 150 students are reported to have been in the school when the shooting started.

According to superintendent Urpo Lintala, the shooter was apprehended by police, but suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was transported to Tampere central hospital, but later died of his injuries. Police state he made a video of himself shooting a gun and later posted it on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. On Monday after finding the video, authorities questioned him, but no charges were filed due to a lack of evidence.

At approximately the time the shooting started, police say a fire had been started, but was quickly extinguished by firefighters. There have also been reports of a bomb threat to a nearby building.

This is the deadliest school shooting in Finland since November 2007 when eight people were killed at a high school in &lt;a href="w%3AJokela%2C%20Finland"&gt;Jokela&lt;/a&gt;.

The first phone that runs on &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Android"&gt;Google Android&lt;/a&gt; was unveiled today by &lt;a href="w%3AT-Mobile"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement of this new handset, named the &lt;a href="w%3AHTC%20Dream"&gt;T-Mobile G1&lt;/a&gt;, was made in an event run by T-Mobile &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; which took place today.

The event started at 14:30 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; (10:30 &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;local time&lt;/a&gt;) when Cole Brodman, the chief technology and innovation officer of T-Mobile USA, started introducing the people who were going to be present at the launch. These people were Andy Rubin, who represents &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and Christopher Schlaffer, who is the &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20technology%20officer"&gt;CTO&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ADeutsche%20Telekom"&gt;Deutsche Telekom&lt;/a&gt;.

Five minutes later Schlaffer announced that Google Android will be available for Christmas 2008 on T-Mobile for customers of Deutsche Telekom. The new phone was then revealed by Cole Brodman, who described the phone as "iconic." 

Commentators, however, dismissed claims that the phone was iconic. Marguerite Reardon from CNET said that Android looks rather like the &lt;a href="w%3AiPhone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result she does not think the phone can be described as iconic. She also said that the Android device looks the &lt;a href="w%3ADanger%20Hiptop"&gt;Danger Hiptop&lt;/a&gt; device, which is also known as the T-Mobile Sidekick.

The new phone will be available free in the UK for users with contracts that cost over 40&lt;a href="w%3AGB%C2%A3"&gt;GB£&lt;/a&gt; (Approximately 74 &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;) per month. These planned tariffs are expected to include unlimited web access.

Android is completely open source, and was developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance, a partnership of over thirty companies working to develop open source software for mobile phones.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Gordon%20Brown%3A%20I%20can%20lead%20Britain%20through%20economic%20crisis&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Prime Minister of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, today spoke at the 2008 &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; conference. In his speech he described his determination to lead his party and country, in addition to claiming that the current financial situation meant that this was no time for a novice to claim a country, saying that he is the right man to lead. This speech comes as questions are raised over Brown's suitability as a leader. 

Brown introduced the speech by telling the conference attendees that he wanted to discuss his reasons for leading the country. "I want to talk with you today about who I am, what I believe, what I am determined to lead this party and this great country to achieve," he said. "I know people have real concerns about the future of the country, the future of the economy and people in this hall have concerns about the future of our party too."

He then claimed that he "didn't come into politics to be a celebrity or thinking I'd always be popular." "Perhaps, that's just as well," he continued. "No, 25 years ago I asked the people of &lt;a href="w%3AFife"&gt;Fife&lt;/a&gt; to send me to parliament to serve the country I love."
He then said that he "didn't come to London because I wanted to join the establishment, but because I wanted and want to change it."
"And so I want to give the people of this country an unconditional assurance - no ifs, no buts, no small print - my unwavering focus is taking this country through the challenging economic circumstances we face and building the fair society of the future," he said, later in the speech. "The British people would not forgive us if at this time we looked inwards to the affairs of just our party when our duty is to the interests of our country."

Brown then made more in depth comments on the &lt;a href="w%3Acredit%20crunch"&gt;credit crunch&lt;/a&gt;. "Each generation believes it is living through changes their parents could never have imagined - but the collapse of banks, the credit crunch, the trebling of oil prices, the speed of technology, and the rise of &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; - nobody now can be in any doubt that we are in a different world and it's now a global age," he claimed. "In truth, we haven't seen anything this big since the industrial revolution. This last week will be studied by our children - as the week the world was spun on its axis - and old certainties were turned on their heads."

Later in the speech, Brown discussed how he believes his government should deal with climate change. He also said that targets for an 80% cut in &lt;a href="w%3Agreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emissions should be considered. "I am asking the climate change committee to report by October on the case for, by 2050 not a 60% reduction in our carbon emissions, but an 80% cut - and I want &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; companies and British workers to seize the opportunity and lead the world in the transformation to a low carbon economy and I believe that we can create in modern green manufacturing and service one million new jobs."
Labour ministers reacted positively to the speech. &lt;a href="w%3AJacqui%20Smith"&gt;Jacqui Smith&lt;/a&gt;, the current Home Secretary, said that "I think today's speech showed that he is a great leader and a great prime minister." Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="David%20Miliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, described the speech as 'excellent'.

Shadow chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Osborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;, however, responded to the speech by saying that "there was nothing really new in the speech - no apology for the mess he's got the country into and no new ideas that show us how he's going to get us out of it."

Monday evening was the 800th episode of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWWE_Raw"&gt;WWE Raw&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, although not as celebrated as last year's 750th "♡❤Raw♡❤ Family Reunion" episode, it was "business as usual" for the show, pushing towards the &lt;a href="w%3AWWE_No_Mercy_2008"&gt;WWE ♡❤No Mercy♡❤&lt;/a&gt; pay-per-view in two weeks. 

The show opened with WWE World Heavyweight Champion &lt;a href="w%3AChris_Jericho"&gt;Chris Jericho&lt;/a&gt; coming to the ring and climbing atop a tall ladder where the WWE World Heavyweight Championship belt was hanging overhead. Chris Jericho will face current antagonist Shawn Michaels in a Ladder Match for the championship at the pay-per-view. Jericho talked about the fact that while fans applauded Michaels' remarks regarding his accomplishments in ladder matches fans have forgotten that Jericho has won three championship titles in ladder matches, and has participated in more high-profile ladder matches than Michaels. This would draw out former champion Randy Orton, who has been injured with a shoulder injury for the last three months. Orton on a tear criticizing current and former champions as well as top contenders as to their worthiness of holding the title, and Chris Jericho was no exception. Just as it looked like Jericho was ready to pummel Orton, Orton declared that WWE ♡❤Raw♡❤ General Manager &lt;a href="w%3AMike_Adamle"&gt;Mike Adamle&lt;/a&gt; made a new proclamation that anybody who attacked Orton would be suspended indefinitely. 

Jericho withdrew from the ring, but was immediately replaced by &lt;a href="w%3ACM_Punk"&gt;CM Punk&lt;/a&gt;, a man Orton attacked a few weeks ago, costing him the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in a four-way match at the WWE &lt;a href="w%3AWWE_Unforgiven_2008"&gt;Unforgiven&lt;/a&gt; pay-per-view. Punk and Orton would come nose-to-nose before Punk slapped Orton in the face, sending him reeling to the corner. General manager Mike Adamle came out along with acting on-air representative Shane McMahon. Together they diffused the situation between Punk and Orton, and announce the main event match, champion Chris Jericho and John "Bradshaw" Layfield against Shawn Michaels and Dave Batista. 

Before that main event happened, Jericho would talk with Mike Adamle in his office, speculating that the reason Shane McMahon was at the show was to test Adamle's skills as a leader rather than a company yes-man, and that rather than following Mr. McMahon's directions to the letter, that he should use them as a suggestion for his own ideas. This would result in the main event becoming a three-on-two match, with the addition of Lance Cade to the team of Jericho and Layfield. Cade, a former protégé for Shawn Michaels and current ally of Jericho, played a major factor in the match. Cade's presence in the ring was a distraction to Shawn Michaels, who spent the majority of the match fighting off double-team efforts and cut off from making a tag to his partner. Dave Batista would eventually make that tag, but would be quickly overpowered by Jericho and Layfield. Michaels would tag in one last time while Batista would continue to fight outside of the ring with Layfield. Michaels appeared to have Cade defeated, but a distraction by Jericho allowed Cade to recover and attack Michaels from behind, pinning him after executing a sit-out powerbomb.

The messages reportedly were simply to be alert and ready to be called upon, and were sent both physically and electronically. 

According to Ted Gistaro, a US intelligence officer, the government is "not aware of any specific, credible al-Qaida plot to attack the U.S. homeland, but [does] receive a steady stream of threat [sic] reporting from sources of varying creditability". 

Intelligence agents are expecting an increase in the number of related messages as October nears. 

Ex-&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; agent Gary Berntsen said that Al-Qaeda was likely not capable of carrying out another attack on the US, but would target its allies "to peel them off from the coalition that George Bush has built to defeat them". Roger Cressey, once a counter-terrorism official, agreed that the attacks would likely be global and not focused on the US. 

An advisor to &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; noted that in the past, Al-Qaeda have used three different tactics to influence elections: public bombings, assassinations, and messages to voters. 

Recently, Al-Qaeda attempted an attack on the new Pakistani President Zardari after his anti-terrorism speech, targeting the Islamabad Mariott hotel where he was expected to eat. According to the vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, the attack would have been devastating if it had succeeded in killing the new President. "Think of the symbolic value if they were able to kill Zardari after his first address as president of Pakistan in a speech announcing his fight against the terrorists," he said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Explosion%20at%20new%20shopping%20centre%20in%20Bath%2C%20United%20Kingdom&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An explosion has taken place in the city centre of &lt;a href="w%3ABath%2C%20Somerset"&gt;Bath, United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in a new shopping centre which is still being built. The explosion is said to have been caused by a gas canister that caught fire and exploded, setting fire to the building. Firefighters responded and were able to extinguish it at around 18:00 BST, approximately one hour after the explosion took place.

Several shops including &lt;a href="w%3AMarks%20%26amp%3B%20Spencer"&gt;Marks and Spencer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABoots%20Group"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGAME%20%28retailer%29"&gt;Game&lt;/a&gt; were evacuated. &lt;a href="w%3ABath%20Spa%20railway%20station"&gt;Bath Spa railway station&lt;/a&gt; was also closed off. &lt;a href="w%3AAvon%20and%20Somerset%20Constabulary"&gt;Avon and Somerset police&lt;/a&gt; spokeswoman Jenny Bigwood said "The area has been cordoned off at the request of the fire and rescue service as there are believed to be a number of gas cylinders on the site." The fire service spokesperson also said that "officers were called just after 5pm today to a report of a fire at the SouthGate building site."

According to eyewitness reports there was "black smoke, ...a few bangs and a series of fairly large explosions."

Bath Spa railway station has since reopened but several people cannot get their cars out of the area due to closed roads. A shelter has been set up at the Pavilion near the &lt;a href="w%3Aleisure%20centre"&gt;leisure centre&lt;/a&gt; in North Parade Road. The centre was due to open in 2009 but is due to be delayed. 

Despite the large size of the explosion, it is believed that no one has suffered from any injuries as a result of the incident.

Archaeologists Timothy Darvill of &lt;a href="w%3ABournemouth%20University"&gt;Bournemouth University&lt;/a&gt; and Geoff Wainwright, President of the &lt;a href="w%3ASociety%20of%20Antiquaries%20of%20London"&gt;Society of Antiquaries&lt;/a&gt;, claimed to have found evidence that &lt;a href="w%3AStonehenge"&gt;Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt; was once a center of healing. In an excavation conducted at the site, a large number of human remains were found that display signs of physical injury or disease. Study of the teeth from the skeletons indicates that about half of them were from outside the area.
A large number of &lt;a href="w%3ABluestones"&gt;bluestone&lt;/a&gt; or spotted &lt;a href="w%3APreseli%20Hills"&gt;Preseli&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Adolerite"&gt;dolerite&lt;/a&gt; chips found during the excavation led the researchers to conclude the stones were venerated for their healing properties. It is believed that about 80 of such bluestone blocks were transported from the Preseli Hills in &lt;a href="w%3APembrokeshire"&gt;Pembrokeshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ASalisbury%20Plain"&gt;Salisbury plains&lt;/a&gt;. The inner circle of bluestones are the earliest stone structures found in this site. Later bluestones were encircled by the imposing sandstone monoliths of &lt;a href="w%3ASarsen"&gt;sarsen&lt;/a&gt; stones. "It could be that people were flaking off pieces of bluestone, in order to create little bits to take away... as lucky amulets," said Professor Darvill.
&lt;a href="w%3ARadiocarbon%20dating"&gt;Radiocarbon dating&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the original bluestone circle was built around 2300 BC. This date coincides with the burial of "&lt;a href="w%3AAmesbury%20Archer"&gt;Amesbury Archer&lt;/a&gt;", whose tomb was discovered near Stonehenge. The skeleton of this man reveals that he had serious knee injury and tooth problems. Researchers therefore conclude that the Archer came to Stonehenge to be healed.

Dating of charcoal fragments revealed that the site was inhabited as early as 7200 BC by groups of &lt;a href="w%3AHunter-gatherer"&gt;hunter-gatherers&lt;/a&gt;. This is more than 3500 years earlier than previously known.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20investigation"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; is investigating 26 firms and 1,400 individuals involved in the US financial crisis for fraud and "sub-prime lending practices". &lt;a href="w%3AFreddie%20Mac"&gt;Freddie Mac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALehman%20Brothers"&gt;Lehman Brothers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFannie%20Mae"&gt;Fannie Mae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20International%20Group"&gt;AIG&lt;/a&gt; are among the firms being scrutinized after recently receiving federal bailouts. 

Investigators, who are cooperating with the IRS, Postal Office, and other federal offices to complete their investigation, are concerned that major corporations may have also forced or bribed ratings agencies to favor them.

The probe, which is in early stages, began eight months ago when the FBI began taking a close look at the mortgage industry and widespread irresponsible loaning practices. At least one corporation has been raided, but so far no evidence of fraud has been found.

The FBI has questioned executives of each of the firms closely, and arrested two in June. An anonymous source told The Times that the firms had been ordered to "hold all papers and e-mails under lock and key" as the FBI scours the finances of each firm. 

Many of the companies and individuals being investigated are at the center of the nationwide financial crisis and controversial bailout plans, and have been widely blamed for the country's financial crisis. The investigation has come at a time when the eyes of many in the US and around the world are turned towards the financial markets, as Congress and politicians scramble to fix the crisis while the election date looms closer. 

Officials told CNN that it would be a long time before the investigations were finished, adding a warning: "Don't expect indictments tomorrow or next week or next month".

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Incomplete%20data%20may%20mislead%20doctors%20into%20overprescribing%20expensive%20medicines&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Medical doctors have not been getting the full picture about newly &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Food%20and%20Drug%20administration"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;-approved drugs, concludes a research team from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Francisco"&gt;University of California, San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;. This is because not all the studies required for FDA approval get published. New drug studies that do see publication tend to be ones where the medicine appears to perform well while poor and middling results are less likely to appear in &lt;a href="w%3AMedical%20journal"&gt;medical journals&lt;/a&gt;. The result appears to be that doctors who read the available literature may get an inflated impression of new medications and may prescribe expensive new drugs in place of older medicines that perform as well or better. As Jordan Lite of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AScientific%20American"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ wonders, ♡❤are drug companies cherry-picking the studies they publish to make their drugs look better than they actually are?♡❤

The University of California team reviewed trials that had supported new drugs approved from 1998 to 2000 and examined 909 trials of 90 medications. The search was conducted upon &lt;a href="w%3APubMed"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt; and other search tools that a typical medical doctor or patient could access. They concluded that less than half of the studies had been published five years after drug approval and a publication bias existed. 

Erick Turner, who coauthored a similar study earlier this year, expressed concerns to ♡❤Scientific American♡❤ that the problem was not merely the raw percentage of studies published, but that a disproportionate share of the research that appeared in journals are examples where new medications appear to perform well:

Ken Johnson, senior vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), defended the pharmaceutical industry by saying FDA review of new drug applications is more important than publishing the results of medication trials in medical journals. Approved medications come with labels that give patients and doctors enough information, assures Mr. Johnson.

Yet concerns about full and appropriate disclosure have been serious enough that a new law was enacted last year. FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) requires that all trials which support FDA-approved drugs be registered at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institutes%20of%20Health"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; website. The requirement goes into effect this coming Saturday. Congress enacted the legislation in response to hearings that determined pharmaceutical companies were less likely to publish studies that indicated significant side effects. One shortcoming in the legislation, according to UCSF associate professor Ida Sim, is that the FDA is still not required to specify which trials it weighs when considering applications for drug approvals. Yet she praises the new law as a major improvement. ♡❤It's critically important that we know trials exist and that we get the summary results, positive and negative, into the public domain—that's a huge step and more than any [other] country is doing now.♡❤

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; announced today that he is suspending his campaign and sought to postpone a scheduled debate with his opponent, &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, to focus on the country's financial crisis and says that Obama should also suspend his campaign.

McCain said he would be asking president &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; to call a meeting for members of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; in order to support Bush's controversial $700 billion bailout plan, but also said that there is no consensus for the proposal and it will not pass in its current form.

"I am calling on the president to convene a meeting with the leadership from both houses of Congress, including Senator Obama and myself. It is time for both parties to come together to solve this problem. It has become clear that no consensus has developed to support the administration's proposal and I do not believe that the plan on the table will pass as it currently stands. We are running out of time," said McCain during a press conference.

Early this morning, Obama had called McCain and asked for the two to put aside partisanship and focus on the economic troubles. The two agreed to issue a joint statement supporting an economic fix, just minutes before McCain made his announcement. Bush is scheduled to speak to the people of the U.S. in a televised speech at 9:01 PM EDT tonight. 

Obama responded to McCain's speech minutes later, confirming that he would still attend the debate. He expressed a desire for fairness to taxpayers and an objection to rewarding those responsible for the financial crisis. Both candidates have stated that they intend to put politics aside to work on the financial crisis. Obama said, a president "is going to have to deal with more than one thing at a time."

The proposal comes in the wake of Congressional hearings where &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Federal%20Reserve"&gt;US Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; chief &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Bernanke"&gt;Ben Bernanke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATreasury%20Secretary"&gt;Treasury Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Paulson"&gt;Henry Paulson&lt;/a&gt; have urged support of the measures proposed by the administration. Despite such appeals, both McCain and Obama have expressed skepticism over the proposed bailout, and the U.S. Congress has shown a noted concern that the measure may not benefit ordinary home owners as well as those on Wall Street.

So far, the news on the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election"&gt;U.S. presidential election&lt;/a&gt; has been dominated by &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; nominees &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;. However, recently, some "third party" candidates have begun to gain notoriety, namely &lt;a href="w%3ALibertarian"&gt;Libertarian Party&lt;/a&gt; nominee &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Barr"&gt;Bob Barr&lt;/a&gt; and independent &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Nader"&gt;Ralph Nader&lt;/a&gt;. 

Unbeknownst to many, there are several other minor party candidates in the race. One of them is &lt;a href="New%20American%20Independent%20Party"&gt;New American Independent Party&lt;/a&gt; nominee &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20McEnulty"&gt;Frank McEnulty&lt;/a&gt;. McEnulty has been interviewed several times by ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ over the past few months, but in one held earlier this week with reporter , he went into detail on why he'd be a good president, why its necessary to support a third party candidate this year, and most importantly, why you should give him your vote.

The interview can be read below.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; addressed the nation on the economic financial crisis from inside the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; saying the economic situation is "serious" and is "in danger" of becoming "a long and painful recession."

"We are in the midst of a serious financial crisis and the federal government is responding with decisive action," Bush said in 

Bush called for the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt; to pass a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;700 billion bill intended to keep struggling companies afloat. He asked the two presidential candidates along with leaders from both parties of Congress to join him for a conference on Thursday.

Last Friday, Treasury Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Paulson"&gt;Henry Paulson&lt;/a&gt; called for a bailout plan that would allow for the United States government to purchase devalued &lt;a href="w%3Amortgage%20backed%20securities"&gt;mortgage backed securities&lt;/a&gt;, resulting from the &lt;a href="w%3Asubprime%20mortgage%20crisis"&gt;subprime mortgage crisis&lt;/a&gt;, from troubled financial institutions. Paulson has said that the plan could cost up to $700 billion. Congressional leaders have said that some form of the plan will pass; however, there is considerable debate over several key issues.

White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that Bush "believes it is important for the American people to fully understand the depth of the crisis in our financial markets, how that crisis affects them, and the urgent need to agree on a solution." Bush has been criticized for waiting too long to speak in prime time. 

John McCain suspended his campaign to return to Washington and work on the bailout bill. Barack Obama has called for another form of the bill to pass and said that Congress should not package the bailout bill with any other bills — such as an economic stimulus plan.

Meanwhile, Congress has held a second round of hearings on the proposed bailout bill. &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Paulson"&gt;Paulson&lt;/a&gt; and Chairman of the Federal Reserve &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Bernanke"&gt;Ben Bernanke&lt;/a&gt; testified in front of the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20Financial%20Services%20Committee"&gt;House Financial Services Committee&lt;/a&gt;. They felt it was a serious problem in need of an immediate solution.
Rep. Barney Frank, Chairman of House Financial Services Committee, says it is "clear" that the financial bailout bill will pass.

Director of the &lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Budget%20Office"&gt;Congressional Budget Office&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20R.%20Orsza"&gt;Peter R. Orsza&lt;/a&gt; said while testifying before Congress that "ironically, the intervention could even trigger additional failures of large institutions, because some institutions may be carrying troubled assets on their books at inflated values."

The bailout plan has been called a "blank check" by many, with members of both parties divided on the issue.

&lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; has banned nuclear inspectors from the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (IAEA) from inspecting its nuclear facility, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYongbyon%20Nuclear%20Scientific%20Research%20Center"&gt;Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This comes after N. Korean officials said the facility would begin to reprocess plutonium which could begin in as little as a week.

"From here on, the IAEA inspectors will have no further access to the reprocessing plant," said the U.N. in a statement on its website.

"The DPRK has also informed the IAEA inspectors that they plan to introduce nuclear material to the reprocessing plant in one week's time," added the statement. The U.N. finished removing their security seals and surveillance equipment from the plant on Thursday.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the U.S. Secretary of State, has urged N. Korea to dismantle their facility and return to six-party talks, but &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APyongyang"&gt;Pyongyang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has refused and no new talks are scheduled to take place.

"We strongly urge the North to reconsider these steps and come back immediately into compliance with its obligations," said Rice, referring to an agreement reached during the last round of six-party talks.

N. Korea restarted its nuclear program when the U.S. failed to follow through with its agreement to take North Korea off the national list of state-sponsored terrorism supporters.

<h1>Voluntary sterilization of poor women proposed by Louisiana state legislator</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Voluntary%20sterilization%20of%20poor%20women%20proposed%20by%20Louisiana%20state%20legislator&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; representative has proposed a controversial solution to "generational welfare," which would pay women on welfare to get sterilization. Republican &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20LaBruzzo"&gt;John LaBruzzo&lt;/a&gt; said he thought of the idea because of his constituents' outrage over paying for welfare. 

"You have these people who are just fed up with working their buns off to try to provide for their own family and being forced by the government [to] provide for others’ families who just want to have unlimited kids", he commented. He is currently working with Baton Rouge to gather data in support of his proposal.

The idea, which LaBruzzo has not finished forming, would award any woman on government assistance a check of $1,000 if she gets a &lt;a href="w%3ATubal%20ligation"&gt;tubal ligation&lt;/a&gt; operation. LaBruzzo is also considering rewarding sterilization in poor men and giving tax incentives for higher-income families to have more children. 
LaBruzzo, who is &lt;a href="w%3APro-life"&gt;pro-life&lt;/a&gt;, said that the people "on the other side of the political spectrum are &lt;a href="w%3APro-choice"&gt;pro-choice&lt;/a&gt;. Well, let's give these people the ability to choose."

While LaBruzzo has stated that he has received an outpouring of support over his idea, the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt; spoke out against the proposal and called it a "meanspirited attempt to eliminate the poor." Planned Parenthood representative Julie Mickelberry called it a "bribery", suggesting a solution which attacked the root of the problem was needed and that the representative needed to "go back to addressing issues of education about unintended pregnancy and opening healthcare access."

♡❤♡Why are you running for political office, why at the federal level, why this party, and why in this riding?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?♡❤♡

♡❤♡As you campaign around your riding, it's likely that some issues are mentioned more often by voters, than other issues. What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding?♡❤♡

What would you and your party do to address these issues?

♡❤♡Is there any misconceptions about you, your leader, or your party and platform?♡❤♡

♡❤♡There's a more ways than ever to get your message out, from the traditional campaign fliers and lawn signs, to new media like websites, Facebook, and YouTube.

On October 14, 2008, Canadians will be heading to the polls for the federal election. ♡❤♡New Democratic Party candidate Don Davies♡❤♡ is standing for election in ♡❤♡the riding of &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Kingsway"&gt;Vancouver Kingsway&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

A lawyer, he has spent the last 25 years fighting for human rights. A two-time student government representative, Davies was involved in the anti-apartheid, third world and peace movements. Admitted to the Alberta Bar in 1989, Davies and family moved to Vancouver in 1991, where he became the Director of Legal Resources for Teamsters Canada (Local 31), the next year. He is a long-time volunteer for children's charity Variety, is Chair of the Parent Advisory Council at Mount Pleasant school, and a Director of the Meridian Cultural Society, among other things.

Wikinews contacted Don Davies, to talk about the issues facing Canadians, and what they and their party would do to address them. Wikinews is in the process of contacting every candidate, in every riding across the country, no matter their political stripe. All interviews are conducted over e-mail, and interviews are published unedited, allowing candidates to impart their full message to our readers, uninterrupted.

The riding is vacant, after Conservative Minister of International Trade David Emerson's resignation. Emerson was elected in 2004 as a Liberal, serving as the Minister of Industry. Two weeks after re-election in 2006, he crossed the floor to join then-new Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who had won a minority government. Emerson was the first MP in Canadian history to cross the floor before a new government was sworn in. He has stepped down, after pressure from other parties.

Besides Davies, major party candidates include Liberal Wendy Yuan, Conservative Salomon Rayek, and Green Doug Warkentin. Also putting their hat in the ring are Matt Kadioglu (Libertarian), Kimball Cariou (Communist), and Donna Peterson (Marxist-Leninist).

This Saturday at 11 am, Davies will host NDP leader &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt; in the Commodore Ballroom at "rally4change".

She had been on maternity leave since August 21. Kaplinsky had only been working with &lt;a href="w%3AFive%20News"&gt;Five News&lt;/a&gt; just over a month when she announced she was pregnant. Her husband of three years, investment banker Justin Bower announced "We're absolutely thrilled."

Kaplinsky first started to work for the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 after a two year tenure with &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt;.

She left the BBC in October 2007. She also spent a short time with &lt;a href="w%3AITV%20News"&gt;ITV News&lt;/a&gt;.

Five News released a statement saying "Her colleagues here at Five News are delighted too - and we've sent our best wishes." They also said both Kaplinsky and the baby are doing fine.

According to media reports, ground troops with the &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; army exchanged gunfire with troops from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; after Pakistani troop fired at two American &lt;a href="w%3AOH-58%20Kiowa"&gt;OH-58 Kiowa&lt;/a&gt; helicopters on a patrol mission inside &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. Also included in the patrol were Afghan border police.

The helicopters were said to have been fired on by Pakistani troops when they flew near an outpost on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. U.S. troops on the ground then moved in on the outpost and began to exchange fire with Pakistani troops. No one on either side was injured, and no one on the helicopters were injured.

Officials for the Pakistani army said in a statement to the press that they only fired upon the helicopters after they "were well within" Pakistan's border. "On this, the helicopters returned fire and flew back." Pakistan's president, &lt;a href="w%3AAsif%20Ali%20Zardari"&gt;Asif Ali Zardari&lt;/a&gt; states that his troops only fired "flares" and that the border is "so mixed" that mistakes could be made in determining ones location.

"Sometimes the border is so mixed that they don't realize they have crossed the border," added Zardari.

The U.S. military denies that there was ever a firefight stating that the U.S. helicopters never fired a single shot, despite the fact they were fired upon. The &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; also denies the reports of the helicopters ever crossing into Pakistan.

"They were U.S. helicopters. The flight path of the helicopters at no point took them over Pakistan," said White House spokesman, Bryan Whitman, during a press conference. Whitman also said that a "very serious" situation was avoided. 

Afghan military officials stated in a statement that they had two helicopters also with the U.S. patrol, which were fired upon, but also were not in Pakistani airspace.

"ISAF helicopters received small-arms fire from a Pakistan military checkpoint along the border near Tanai district, Khowst. At no time did ISAF helicopters cross into Pakistani airspace," said the Pakistani military in a statement.

Reports say the battle lasted nearly five minutes before both sides retreated. Pakistan's military has been ordered to fire on any vehicle, person or aircraft that is unauthorized to cross into Pakistan. That order was given after a similar incident on September 3. The U.S. has denied any other incidents have taken place.

Law enforcement officials raided Alamo's compound in &lt;a href="w%3AFouke%2C%20Arkansas"&gt;Fouke, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday and removed six girls aged 10 to 17. Over 100 federal and state agents participated in the raid on the compound, which followed a two-year investigation into Alamo and his organization. 

Law enforcement officials were searching for evidence that minors had been videotaped performing sexual activities or had been molested. The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; searched Alamo's property for &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20pornography"&gt;child pornography&lt;/a&gt;. Alamo, who claims he is legally blind and wouldn't be able to see child pornography, preaches that girls should marry young and sex with post-puberty girls is 'okay' because "in the Bible it happened".
"It's the transportation of minors with the intent to engage in criminal activity. The state concerns are children living at the facility may have been sexually and physically abused," said &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas"&gt;Little Rock, Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; FBI representative Tom Browne in a statement to &lt;a href="w%3AKABC-TV"&gt;KABC-TV&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (AP) has reported that Alamo will likely appear in federal court Friday in Flagstaff, Arizona, on charges that he violated the &lt;a href="w%3AMann%20Act"&gt;Mann Act&lt;/a&gt; by facilitating transport of minors across state lines for inappropriate sexual conduct. Documents produced by the FBI referred to Alamo by his birth name, Bernie Lazar Hoffman. Alamo has stated that he was born into &lt;a href="Judaism"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt; but later &lt;a href="w%3AReligious%20conversion"&gt;converted&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Christianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;. According to the FBI, Alamo's court appearance Friday is intended to determine when he will be transported from Arizona back to Arkansas to face charges there.
Hearings have been scheduled for Friday and Monday by a state judge, to decide if the Department of Human Services of Arkansas can retain custody of the six girls. "We will transport them to and from hearings. We will take part in any future hearings. Our job right now is to basically take care of them," said agency representative Julie Munsell in a statement reported to the AP. The six girls will be present at the hearings in Arkansas: hearings for two of the girls will take place Friday and hearings for the other four on Monday. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Poverty%20Law%20Center"&gt;Southern Poverty Law Center&lt;/a&gt;, an organization which maintains data on &lt;a href="w%3AHate%20group"&gt;hate groups&lt;/a&gt;, has described Alamo's organization as a "&lt;a href="w%3ACult"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt;". ♡❤The Ross Institute Internet Archives for the Study of Destructive Cults, Controversial Groups and Movements♡❤ maintains a web page on Tony Alamo and his organization. AP reported that many former members of Alamo's organization also characterize the Tony Alamo Christian Ministries as a "cult".
Anna Pugh, a former member of the organization for 11 years, recounted some of her experiences in what she referred to as "Tony's Cult" to &lt;a href="w%3AKOCO-TV"&gt;KOCO-TV&lt;/a&gt;. She stated that while she was living at Alamo's compound she felt she was &lt;a href="w%3ABrainwashing"&gt;brainwashed&lt;/a&gt;. Pugh says that while she was a member of the group a seven-year-old girl took her aside and told her Alamo had sexual conduct with minors while watching pornography. "I think that congregation in there needs to see what that man is. He is a monster. He is a very unmerciful, malicious, vindictive, judgemental, condemning person," said Pugh. 
Former member Anthony Lane told &lt;a href="w%3AKSLA-TV"&gt;KSLA-TV&lt;/a&gt; he was kicked out of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries when he questioned some of Alamo's teachings. "He is definitely a man who arranges marriages of little girls, and orders beatings of little children," said Lane. He has been getting help from a support group called Partnered against Cult Activities (PACA). Lane is trying to gain custody of his three children who are still in the group with his wife. 

Alamo was convicted of tax evasion in 1994, and was released from prison in 1998 after serving four years out of a six year sentence. The &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt; said Alamo owed the U.S. government &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;7.9 million. Prosecutors in the tax evasion case argued prior to Alamo's sentencing that he was a flight risk, and a polygamist who conducted inappropriate activities with women and girls in his organization.

The Tony Alamo Christian Ministry organization promotes a philosophy and belief system which asserts sex with underage girls and polygamy is acceptable. The organization is critical of &lt;a href="w%3ACatholicism"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHomosexuality"&gt;homosexuality&lt;/a&gt;, and the government. Tony Alamo Christian Ministry has compounds in Arkansas, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, and Alamo himself lives near &lt;a href="Los%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AYves%20Rossy"&gt;Yves Rossy&lt;/a&gt;, 49, an airline pilot from &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, has successfully completed a trip across the &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20Channel"&gt;English Channel&lt;/a&gt; using a jet propelled pack. He is said to be the first human to successfully complete any such trip.

Rossy flew between &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 22 miles, with his top speed reaching 120 miles an hour. Rossy, who has named himself 'Fusion Man' began his trip in a plane. When they reached an altitude of 8,000 feet, Rossy jumped out of the plane and started his jet pack. The trip took just about 10 minutes to complete with Rossy landing via parachute in &lt;a href="w%3ADover"&gt;Dover&lt;/a&gt; in England.

The pack is described as &lt;a href="w%3Ahang%20glider"&gt;hang glider&lt;/a&gt; like, with a wing span of eight feet. When the fuel tank is filled, the device weighs about 120 pounds. Rossy was protected by a fire proof suit in case anything went wrong, an extra parachute and a helmet.

Rossy had spent nearly five years designing and building the jet pack.

<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Why did you choose to run for office?♡❤♡

made, I am eager to continue to do more. Our community continues to inspire me to improve the lives of Thornhill residents and all Canadians.

<h1>More worries of further contamination of food from China</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=More%20worries%20of%20further%20contamination%20of%20food%20from%20China&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) is warning that more food imported from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; may be contaminated with &lt;a href="w%3Amelamine"&gt;melamine&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical used in the manufacturing of plastics. Melamine, although nontoxic in very small amounts, can cause severe &lt;a href="w%3Akidney"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; problems in large doses.

Guanshengyuan, a Chinese company that makes children's candy, has stopped selling its popular brand White Rabbit, which is sold nationally in China, after tests confirmed the presence of melamine. Bright foods owns the candy company. Earlier their powdered milk was found to contain melamine which sickened over 53,000 people and was responsible for the deaths of at least four infant children. Guanshengyuan has stopped exporting their goods to the nearly 50 companies overseas that buy them.

Melamine has also been found in &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; in baby cereal and vegetable formula made by &lt;a href="w%3AHeinz"&gt;Heinz&lt;/a&gt;. It has also been found in &lt;a href="w%3Awasabi"&gt;wasabi&lt;/a&gt; crackers which are manufactured by the Chinese company, Silang House.

Another Chinese food company called Marudai Food Co. has also halted the sales of several items such as meat buns, cream buns and corn crepes made with cream over fears that melamine laced powered milk has contaminated their products. So far there have been no reports of any illnesses associated with Marudai Foods.

Further items recalled or other products that feared to be contaminated with melamine are Mr. Browns Instant Coffee and tea products, along with their powdered milk.

The first report of contamination came last week when the Chinese health ministry confirmed that the companies responsible for producing the milk were trying to repair their damaged public image by increasing output using melamine. The Chinese Health Ministry has stated that most of the tainted milk was produced by Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co.

The WHO says that women with infants should consider breast feeding for the time being on infants aged at least six months, until the contaminated milk can be removed from the consumption chain.

"WHO recommends that all infants should be fed exclusively with breast milk for the first six months of life. No other liquid or food, not even water, is needed during this period. Thereafter, infants should receive adequate and safe complementary foods while breastfeeding continues up to two years of age and beyond," said the WHO in a statement on their website. 

In 2007, the &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) confirmed the presence of melamine in pet food that was imported from China. Samples indicated that &lt;a href="w%3AWheat%20gluten%20%28food%29"&gt;wheat gluten&lt;/a&gt;, used as an ingredient in the pet food, was contaminated with the chemical. As a result of the contamination, the FDA said some of the contaminated gluten entered the human food chain. At least 45 people ate contaminated pork which was traced to pigs from a farm in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. The pigs had eaten feed that had been contaminated. There were no reports of deaths or illnesses.

The two major party presidential candidates in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Of%20America"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, faced each other yesterday in the first TV debate. Despite that &lt;a href="McCain%20delays%20campaign%2C%20Obama%20says%20continue%20the%20debates"&gt;McCain had asked to postpone the debate&lt;/a&gt;, both were present at the University of Mississippi. The debate, which was moderated by &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Broadcasting%20Service"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Lehrer"&gt;Jim Lehrer&lt;/a&gt;, was planned to be focused on foreign policy, however due to concerns about the US financial crisis, the debate began focused on economy.

McCain repeatedly referred to his experience, drawing on stories from the past. Often, he joked of his age and at one point seemed to mock his opponent. Obama spoke of mistakes and repeatedly laid out detailed plans.

The debate was widely seen as a draw. A &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; poll conducted after the debate on independent voters found that 38% felt it was a draw, 40% felt Obama had won, and 22% thought that McCain had won. Voters and analysts agreed that Obama had won on the economy, but that McCain had done better on foreign policy issues, which were the focus of the debate. However, Obama had a more substantial lead on the economy than McCain did on foreign policy.

The McCain campaign faced some ridicule prior to the debate, after airing an internet ad declaring McCain had won the debate hours before it had started.

<h3>Financial &amp; bailout plans</h3>
The candidates were asked where they stood on the country's financial plans.

Obama put forward four proposals for helping the economy. First, to "make sure that we've got oversight over this whole [bailout] process". Second, to "make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains". Third, to "make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes". And lastly, "make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country".

He then went on to say, "we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down".
Lehrer then turned to McCain, giving him two minutes as well. 

McCain, on the other hand, stressed the urgency of the crisis and the partisanship present in Washington before going on. "This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it," he told viewers, pausing to briefly mention energy and jobs before Lehrer stopped him.

Lehrer asked the two to come back to his question and urging them to speak to each other, first turning to Senator Obama.

"We haven't seen the language yet," Obama began, speaking to Lehrer and not McCain. "And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there", he said, before noting he was optimistic a plan would come together. "The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?"

He continued, stressing his foresight on the issues two years ago, before Lehrer turned to McCain, asking if he planned to vote for the bailout plan.

McCain stammered that he hoped so. Lehrer asked again, and McCain replied, "Sure. But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming."

McCain then continued, giving a story about former US President Dwight Eisenhower, who "on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letter". Eisenhower, he said, had taken accountability for his actions.

Obama then agreed with McCain, adding that more accountability was needed but not just when there's a panic. "There are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place," Obama continued, "and that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound".

Obama was asked to say it to McCain. Obama replied, "I do not think that they are". Lehrer asked him to say it more directly to McCain, and Obama laughed, repeating himself to McCain.

McCain joked about his age, saying, "Are you afraid I couldn't hear him?"

Obama said that he and McCain disagreed fundamentally and that he wanted accountability "not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on. They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments". Tax policies, he said, were a good example.

McCain disagreed. "No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system. We've got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and on Wall Street. So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis".

<h3>Fundamental differences</h3>
Lehrer went on to the next question, asking if there were fundamental differences between the approaches of the two.

McCain began by saying he wanted to lower "completely out of control" spending. He promised as president to "veto every single spending bill" He then attacked Senator Obama's use of earmarks, citing it as a fundamental difference.

Senator Obama agreed that earmarks were being abused, but not that it was a large problem. "Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important." He then attacked McCain's tax plans, saying, "you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out". 

He then stressed his focus on the middle class, saying, "We've got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent". 

McCain was called on.

"Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs," McCain said, attacking his opponent. He also said that Obama had only suspended pork barrel spending after he started running for president.

"What I do is I close corporate loopholes," Obama objected, "stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage".

He then turned to McCain, asking him to look at his tax policies, which he said were ignoring the middle class and a continuation of Bush policies. 

Lehrer asked McCain to respond directly to Obama's attack on his tax policies.

"Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax," McCain began. He then explained the reasoning behind his business tax cuts, saying that companies would want to start in countries where they would pay less taxes. "I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs". 

Obama explained that his tax cuts would affect 95% of taxpayers, then replied, "Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right. Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world".

McCain, he said, opposed closing loopholes but just wanted to add more tax breaks on top of that.

McCain responded with an example of Obama voting for tax breaks of oil companies.

Obama cut in, "John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion", he pointed out.

McCain shot back, attacking Obama's earmark spending and tax policies. "Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?", he said, referring to himself. "And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it".

He then accused Obama of voting "to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year". Obama repeated several times that McCain's accusations were untrue.

McCain then accused him of giving tax cuts to oil companies, which Obama once again said was untrue. "The fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out,"he said. "We've got an emergency bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies."

<h3>Post-financial crisis plans</h3>
Lehrer then broke in, stopping the argument. He switched to a new question, asking what priorities and goals for the country the candidates would give up as a result of the financial crisis.

He allowed Obama to answer the question first, who said many things would have to be delayed but not forgotten. He then began to list what he felt the country had to have to continue to compete.

"We have to have energy independence," he said, "so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel".

He continued, saying that the health care system had to be fixed because it was bankrupting families.

"We've got to make sure that we're competing in education," he continued. "We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science." He also mentioned making sure college was still affordable. 

He also stressed making sure the country was still stable structurally, "to make sure that we can compete in this global economy".

Lehrer then turned to McCain, asking him to present his ideas.

"Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending", McCain began and reminded the audience that he "saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong".

Lehrer broke in, asking if it was correct that neither of them had any major changes to implement after the financial crisis. 

Obama replied that many things would have to be delayed and put aside, and that investments had to be made. He then agreed with McCain that cuts had to be made. "We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesn't work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare work".

McCain then made a suggestion. "How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs". Lehrer repeated "spending freeze?" and McCain went on, "I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions the caring of veterans, national defense and several other vital issues".

Obama disagreed with McCain's idea, saying it was "using a hatchet". Some vital programs, he said, were seriously underfunded. "I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy doesn't make sense".

The two candidates began to argue more directly. 

"We have to have," McCain argued, "wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power".

He accused Obama of opposing storing nuclear fuel.

Lehrer interrupted the two with another question, asking how the financial crisis would affect how they ran the country.

Obama replied first. "There's no doubt it will affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it". He went on to stress that it was a critical time and the country's long term priorities had to be sorted out.

He went on to speak about the national debt and stressing the importance of low taxes.

Obama went on the offensive, attacking McCain's record of voting. "John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending", he said, accusing him of voting for an "orgy of spending".

McCain countered that he had opposed Bush "on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay. On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted". He called himself a maverick, and referred to his running mate as a maverick as well.

<h3>Lessons of Iraq</h3>
Lehrer asked the two what the lessons of Iraq were.

McCain answered first, stressing that the war in Iraq was going well. "I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear," he answered, "that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict".

He went on to praise the efforts in Iraq, saying the strategy was successful and the US was winning. "And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds", and continued that Iraq would make a stable ally.

Lehrer asked Obama how he saw the lessons of Iraq, who began by questioning the fundamentals of the war and whether the US should have gone in the first place.

"We took our eye off [bin Laden]. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government".

The lesson, he said, was to "never hesitate to use military force", but to use it wisely.

McCain was asked if he agreed on the lesson, though he did not comment on a lesson learned. Obama, he said, had been wrong about the surge.

The two opponents then began arguing, as Lehrman tried to mediate them.

McCain felt it was remarkable that "Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan. To this day, he has never had a hearing". 

"The issues of Afghanistan," Obama responded, "the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole".

He then began to attack McCain's optimism. "You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shiite and Sunni. And you were wrong".

McCain responded to the criticism by telling a story of when he spoke to troops who were re-enlisting. "And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win. They said, let us win. We don't want our kids coming back here. And this strategy, and this general, they are winning. Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq".

McCain repeatedly accused Obama of opposing funding to troops.

Obama responded by speaking to Lehrer, to explain why he had voted against funding troops. "Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable".

"Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America," McCain cut in once Obama had finished.

Obama said it was not the case, that the wording was "a precipitous withdrawal would be dangerous".

McCain then argued that Iraq, and not Afghanistan, was the central battle ground against terrorism. He also attacked Obama's surprise that the surge had worked.

<h3>Troops in Afghanistan</h3>
Lehrer switched to a new question. "Do you think more troops -- more U.S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?"

Obama mentioned he had been saying more troops in Afghanistan were needed for over a year. He argued that no Al-Qaeda were present in Iraq before the invasion, and the people there had nothing to do with 9/11.

He then went on to list a three part plan beginning with pressuring the Afghani government to work for it's people and control it's poppy trade. He also pressed the need to stop giving money to Pakistan.

"If you're going to aim a gun at somebody," he said, "you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger".

Obama responded by arguing that if the Pakistani government would not take care of terrorists in it's borders, action had to be taken. He then commented on past US policies with Pakistan, saying that the US support of Musharraf had alienated the Pakistani people. 

"And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they weren't going after al Qaeda, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan. That's going to change when I'm president of the United States", he finished. 

McCain quickly replied that Pakistan was a failed state at the time. He then went on to talk about his voting record. "I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way".

Obama argued that Afghanistan could not be muddled through, and that problems were being caused by not focusing on Al-Qaeda. As he finished, Lehrer attempted to announce a new question, but McCain quickly attacked Obama, saying his plans would have a "calamitous effect" on national security and the region.

<h3>Iran</h3>
Lehrer directed his next question towards McCain, asking about his thoughts on Iran and it's threat to the US. 

McCain's reading of the threat in Iran was "if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and to other countries in the region". He stressed the need to avoid another Holocaust, and the need for a league of democracies to battle Iran. "I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior". 

Obama went next, focusing on the Iraq war's effect on Iran. Iraq, he said, was Iran's "mortal enemy" and had kept Iran from becoming a threat. "That was cleared away. And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon".

He then went on to say that refusing to use diplomacy with hostile nations has only made matters worse and isolated the US.

<h3>Diplomacy</h3>
Lehrer turned to McCain, asking him how he felt about diplomacy as a solution.

McCain hurried through his response, attacking Obama on his willingness to meet with hostile leaders without preconditions. People like Ahmadinejad, he said, would have their ideas legitimized if a President met with them.

Obama responded by pointing out that Ahmadinejad was only a minor leader. Meeting leaders without preconditions, he said, "doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day". He then turned to attacking McCain, who he said "would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally".

McCain retorted that he was not yet President so it would be out of place. The two then began to argue over the comments of Dr. Kissinger's stance on meeting foreign leaders.

McCain argued that meeting with and legitimizing ideas was dangerous and naive, and said it was a fundamental difference of opinion.

Obama accused McCain of misrepresentation, stressing that he would not speak without low level talks and preparations.

McCain responded by mocking Obama. "So let me get this right. We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, 'We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,' and we say, 'No, you're not'? Oh, please".

<h3>Relationship with Russia</h3>
The two started arguing among each other, as Lehrer attempted to interject, finally succeeding with a new question. He turned to Obama, asking how he saw the relationship with Russia and it's potential.

Obama began spelling out his opinion, stating that he felt the US approach to Russia had to be evaluated. He then continued that the US has to press for a unified alliance and for Russia to remove itself from other nations, adding that the US had to "explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship". 

He went on, stressing the importance of diplomacy and affirming relationships, and inviting Russian-influenced countries into NATO. "Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation".

McCain responded by attacking Obama's reaction to the Russian-Georgian conflict, criticizing his initial comment that both sides should show restraint, calling it naive. "He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government".

Lehrer asked Obama if there were any major differences between the two's opinion on Russia, who answered that he and McCain had similar opinions on Russia. He then stressed foresight in dealing with Russia, as well as reducing dependence on foreign oil through alternative energy.

<h3>Alternative energy</h3>
"Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel," he mentioned.

The two began to argue over alternative energy. As Lehrer began announcing the next question, McCain interjected. "No one from Arizona is against solar. And Senator Obama says he's for nuclear, but he's against reprocessing and he's against storing So," he continued, as Obama objected, "it's hard to get there from here. And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge". 

McCain continued, as Obama interrupted to correct him, saying that he had voted for storing nuclear waste safely. 

The two began interrupting each other, each trying to get a word in, before Lehrer stopped them and moved on.

<h3>Likelihood of another 9/11</h3>
"What do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental United States?" asked Lehrer.

McCain said that America was far safer since 9/11, which he claimed a hand in. He went on to stress better intelligence and technology in keeping America safe, but that he felt the US was far safer.

Lehrer then turned to Obama.

Obama disagreed slightly, saying America was safer in some ways, but "we still have a long way to go". He also felt that the US was not focusing enough on Al-Qaeda and fighting in Iraq was not making the US safer.

McCain accused Senator Obama of not understanding that "if we fail in Iraq, it encourages al Qaeda. They would establish a base in Iraq".

Lehrer asked if Obama agreed.

Obama argued that the sole focus was currently Iraq, but that "in the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed". He noted that $10 billion was spent in Iraq every month, instead of going to healthcare. He argued that veterans were not getting the benefits they deserved, and that the next president's strategies had to be broader. 

McCain responded by attacking Obama saying he didn't think Obama had the knowledge or experience to be President.

Obama then said that the job of the next President would be to repair America's image and economy.

McCain concluded by citing his POW experience. "Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad. And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home".

"And that ends this debate tonight," finished Jim Lehrer.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; actor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Newman"&gt;Paul Newman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; died on Friday at age 83 of cancer. He pulled out of directing a stage production of John Steinbeck's ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOf%20Mice%20and%20Men"&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ in &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; because of unspecified health problems.

Later in his career he starred in several films including ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AButch%20Cassidy%20and%20the%20Sundance%20Kid"&gt;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hustler"&gt;The Hustler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHemingway%27s%20Adventures%20of%20a%20Young%20Man"&gt;Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHud"&gt;Hud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. He won an Oscar for best actor in 1987 for his appearance in ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Color%20Of%20Money"&gt;The Color Of Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. This was his only Oscar win but was nominated a total of 10 times. He also worked as both a director and a producer. He also voiced the part of Doc Hudson in the 2006 &lt;a href="Pixar"&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt; film ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACars"&gt;Cars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤
Newman married actress &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoanne%20Woodward"&gt;Joanne Woodward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1958; they had three children. He was previously married with three other children. His son Scott from his first marriage died in 1978 of a drug overdose. He set up a center for drug abuse in memory of his son. Newman opened up his own company, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANewman%27s%20Own"&gt;Newman's Own&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which made a line of food products including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asalad%20dressing"&gt;salad dressing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asalsa"&gt;salsa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alemonade"&gt;lemonade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and others. He donated all of the company's profits to charity.

Newman retired in May 2007. He told broadcaster &lt;a href="ABC%20News%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; "I'm not able to work anymore... at the level that I would want to."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; is set to become the second &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; country to place graphic images on &lt;a href="w%3Acigarette"&gt;cigarette&lt;/a&gt; packets. 15 different images are to be placed on the packs of all brands of cigarettes. They will be introduced on October 1. The images will be introduced onto all other forms of tobacco by 2010. 

The written warnings were introduced in 2003 and have been deemed a success by the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Health"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;. A spokesman said that the written warnings had been a success with research showing more than 90,000 smokers had been motivated to call the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; quit line because of them. 

Despite being the only the second country in Europe to introduce the images several other countries have already placed them onto packets. These include &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. 

Not everyone is welcoming the new images. The smoking lobby group, Forest, said smokers were being unfairly targeted and called the images intrusive and offensive. Simon Clark, director of Forest, said the group supported education efforts "but these pictures are designed not just to educate but to shock and coerce people to give up a legal product".

&lt;a href="w%3ARadiometric%20dating"&gt;Radiometric dating&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3Aschist"&gt;schists&lt;/a&gt; of Nuvvuagittuq &lt;a href="w%3Agreenstone%20belt"&gt;greenstone belt&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; have indicated an age of 4280 million years. This is the oldest date obtained for any rock on earth. The study, reported in the latest issue of &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20%28journal%29"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, was carried out by scientists of &lt;a href="w%3AMcGill%20University"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACarnegie%20Institution%20for%20Science"&gt;Carnegie Institution of Washington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversit%C3%A9%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec"&gt;Université du Québec&lt;/a&gt;, Montreal.

The study relying on &lt;a href="w%3Asamarium-neodymium%20dating"&gt;samarium-neodymium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aisotope"&gt;isotopic&lt;/a&gt; data place the age of rocks 250 million years older that the previously dated &lt;a href="w%3AAcasta%20Gneiss"&gt;Acasta gneiss&lt;/a&gt;. The Acasta gneiss in Canada's &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Territories"&gt;Northwest Territories&lt;/a&gt; is dated at 4030 million years. Previous studies on the mineral ages of &lt;a href="w%3Azircon"&gt;zircon&lt;/a&gt; found in younger rocks from &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; have indicated 4360 million years. If correct, the new data will give more information on the formation of the earliest &lt;a href="w%3Acrust%20%28geology%29"&gt;crust of earth&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AHadean"&gt;Hadean&lt;/a&gt; era, about 300 million years after the &lt;a href="w%3Aage%20of%20the%20Earth"&gt;formation of Earth&lt;/a&gt; itself. 

The age data of the oldest rocks named "faux amphibolite" indicate a range from 3800 - 4280 million years. The scientists favor 4280 million years as the age of the rock, that was later &lt;a href="w%3Ametamorphic%20rock"&gt;metamorphosed&lt;/a&gt; to another rock 3800 million years ago. The original rocks may represent part of an ancient &lt;a href="w%3Aoceanic%20crust"&gt;ocean floor&lt;/a&gt;.

The scientists also speculate that a &lt;a href="w%3Abanded%20iron%20formation"&gt;banded iron formation&lt;/a&gt; associated with the rocks may indicate presence of the &lt;a href="w%3Aevolutionary%20history%20of%20life"&gt;earliest life&lt;/a&gt; on earth. The &lt;a href="w%3Abacteria"&gt;bacterial&lt;/a&gt; origin of this formation is yet to be established. 

Stephen J. Mojzsis, a professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado suggest that the rocks may be actually younger, with some &lt;a href="w%3AXenolith"&gt;remnants&lt;/a&gt; of 4280 million year rocks included in it. "I hope that I'm wrong," Dr. Mojzsis said. "If that happens, I believe there will be a land rush by geologists to northern Quebec."

&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Thomas%20%28Information%20Commissioner%29"&gt;Richard Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20Commissioner%27s%20Office%20%28UK%29"&gt;Information Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; has criticized the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3Acold%20calling"&gt;cold calling&lt;/a&gt; 250,000 British people automatically to encourage them to support their party. The commissioner announced in a press release made public on Thursday that "the Information Commissioner’s Office has taken enforcement action against the Liberal Democrats after finding the party in breach of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations."

In the enforcement notice, which has been seen by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the Liberal Democrats are told that "in view of the matters referred to above the Commissioner hereby gives notice that, in exercise of his powers under section 40 of the [Data Protection] Act, he requires that the Liberal Democrats within 30 days of the date of service of this Notice shall, in accordance with Regulation 19 of the Regulations, cease using an automated calling system to transmit communications comprising recorded matter for direct marketing purposes to subscribers who have not previously notified the Liberal Democrats that they consent to such communications being sent to them."
The Liberal Democrats have been given 28 days to appeal against the action, although the party has said that they accept the decision. In 2005, the party successfully stopped the Scottish National Party for continuing to carry out a similar cold calling campaign. &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Clegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, defended the party's actions by saying that "I rather hope it won't disturb. People don't have to pick up the phone if they don't like the time at which the call is made."

If the Liberal Democrats continue to cold call users in thirty days time, they are at risk of prosecution and an unlimited fine.

<h1>Anti-Scientology protest material removed from YouTube following threats of legal action</h1>

According to ♡❤YouTube♡❤ the 11 videos were removed by direct DMCA requests from Schaper. The videos have been reported to be of anti-Scientology protests, recorded by various members of the group ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAnonymous%20%28group%29"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

In early September, an entity named American Rights Counsel LLC -- which has described itself as a 'rights group', but without provision of contact details -- requested the removal from ♡❤YouTube♡❤ of over 4,000 anti-Scientology videos. Many of these videos consisted entirely of self-made content by anti-Scientology protesters; others were quite explicitly extracts from official Church of Scientology footage. Users had initially speculated that Schaper was responsible for these requests; no evidence, however, has been obtained to this effect, nor has official comment been obtained from American Rights Counsel.

When comment was requested further to these earlier removal requests, Schaper stated that he was a "... very strong advocate for the Church of Scientology, the religion of Scientology and a free speech advocate." Schaper alleged that he had "...to this date no information about the American Rights Counsel" and "no connection, knowledge or involvement in this company [American Rights Counsel]". 

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ contacted Schaper to find out why he made the new requests. According to him, the videos were not of protests against Scientology, but instead were videos of alleged hate-crimes and hate-speech, which were allegedly attacking Schaper personally. 

"None of the videos are accounts of any protests. The videos in question have been produced by an YouTube (U.K.) user to directly attack me and my companies. I made the requests in accordance with YouTube’s terms and condition, after confirming directly with YouTube and the local ECTF office in Los Angeles, to remove material that infringes on my copyright. None of the videos removed by YouTube fall under the fair use guidelines or can be considered news-worthy. The content of the videos has been classified by law-enforcement as hate-speech and frivolous attack. The producers of these videos are based in the U.K. and local law-enforcement has been contacted by the FBI," said Schaper to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.
When ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ asked Schaper if he was acting on behalf of the Church, Schaper denied any such involvement. He also stated that he was not attempting to remove videos critical of him, or the Church, but also emphasizes other videos still on ♡❤YouTube♡❤ that are "a personal attack against me and my beliefs."

"Despite the fact that I am a Scientologist, none of the videos removed, where removed on behalf of the Church of Scientology or any organization associated with the church. In addition I like to point out that I have not removed any video, critical of me personally which does not violate my copyrights and I have no intention to do so," said Schaper.

In addition, Wikinews invited Dr. Schaper to comment on the apparent discrepancy between his actions and his advocacy of free speech. Dr. Schaper feels that that the two stated aims are not in conflict, stating, "I believe the First Amendment but I also see how Anonymous tries to abuse these liberties. Not everything is protected under the free speech clause and laws have been enacted to protect each citizen from abuse."

Schaper also stated that ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ is "breaking the law" by uploading material to ♡❤YouTube♡❤ which could be considered hate crimes. He also states that he would not mind a one-on-one conversation with some members of ♡❤Anonymous♡❤, but "these guys don’t have the balls for a direct sit-down because they should get their facts straight."

"Anonymous is overstating a case and claims that their abuse and online bullying would be protected under the First Amendment forgetting the fact that they indeed are breaking the laws," added Schaper.

Schaper does not plan on enforcing the Church's copyrights saying, "they can handle their own content" and that he "will continue to enforce my copyrights and seek full prosecution in cooperation with federal law-enforcement."

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has contacted ♡❤YouTube♡❤ for a statement regarding this incident, but has yet to receive a response.

<h1>US pastors plan to defy law and endorse candidates</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20pastors%20plan%20to%20defy%20law%20and%20endorse%20candidates&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The ADF launched the effort to protest a 50-year-old law which bans churches, religious groups, and non-profit groups that accept tax deductions from endorsing candidates. Erik Stanley, a legal adviser with the ADF, said the group would be sending copies of the sermons to the IRS and would be seeking a Supreme Court case. The law, he said, was unconstitutional because "being tax-exempt is part of freedom of religion; otherwise the government could tax churches out of existence."

Minnesota reverend Gus Booth, who is participating in the protest, says he will be endorsing &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;Senator McCain&lt;/a&gt; and has forbidden his congregation from voting for &lt;a href="w%3ABarack%20Obama"&gt;Senator Obama&lt;/a&gt; due to his position on abortion. He defended his actions, saying "I have a &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; right to say whatever I want to say."

"Pulpit Freedom Sunday," as the event is being called, has drawn criticism from both religious and secular groups.

A group of former IRS officials and pastors held a conference on September 8, submitting a complaint to the IRS and urging other ministers to preach against the endorsements. One of the participants, former director of the IRS Marcus Owens, says the group may be facing a loss of its own tax exempt status and compared it to teaching people how to cheat on taxes.

&lt;a href="w%3AAmericans%20United%20for%20Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State"&gt;Americans United for Separation of Church and State&lt;/a&gt; and the IRS are monitoring the situation.

Documents recently made public by the Internet site Wikileaks reveal that several large newspapers have removed or censored content related to the Iraqi-British fraudster &lt;a href="w%3ANadhmi%20Auchi"&gt;Nadhmi Auchi&lt;/a&gt;, who has been publicly linked to &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; via payments to former fundraiser, Antino "Tony" Rezko . A Guardian article, which no longer exists, stated that Auchi is also linked to senior members of the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;UK Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has confirmed that at least some of the articles involved definitely previously existed but have now been removed, including from newspapers that usually keep all of their articles online. 

A &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Statesman"&gt;New Statesman&lt;/a&gt; article included the Wikileaks documents confirms that "Mr Auchi's lawyers have written to ask us to remove the names of the articles concerned", and that this is what lead them to remove the content. The New Statesman removed a list of censored articles regarding the incident after receiving complaints. 

The articles were taken down following letters from the Carter-Ruck law firm, which points out on its website that "A libel claimant does not have to prove that the words are false or to prove that he has in fact suffered any loss. Damage is presumed.”

One of the removed articles was published by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. It pointed out Auchi's "past links to &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;'s regime." It also said, "[a]ttempts by a French investigating magistrate to have Mr Auchi arrested during corruption inquiries had been blocked by Britain since July 2001." The article also claimed that Auchi may have had a role in the channeling of &lt;a href="w%3AGBP"&gt;GBP&lt;/a&gt; 28 million to a &lt;a href="Kuwait"&gt;Kuwaiti&lt;/a&gt; oil refinery. 

Several articles published by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Observer"&gt;The Observer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the sister paper of the Guardian, were also removed after reporting similar facts to the above. 

In addition, an article published by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Telegraph"&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was deleted. It reported on "France's longest-running political and corporate corruption scandal," which resulted on a two year suspended sentence for Auchi.

Four people have been arrested on &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt; charges in &lt;a href="w%3AIslington"&gt;Islington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, after a suspected &lt;a href="w%3Apetrol%20bomb"&gt;petrol bomb&lt;/a&gt;ing on the house of Martin Rynja, owner of book publishing company Gibson Square.

The bombing, which occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning, led to the evacuation of the &lt;a href="w%3A%C2%A3"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;2.5 million property in &lt;a href="w%3ALonsdale%20Square"&gt;Lonsdale Square&lt;/a&gt;. Three men, aged 22, 30 and 40, were arrested at 2:25am &lt;a href="w%3ABST"&gt;BST&lt;/a&gt; by armed officers, two in Lonsdale Square, and one after being stopped near &lt;a href="w%3AAngel%20tube%20station"&gt;Angel tube station&lt;/a&gt;.

Police comments suggested that the trio had been under surveillance, and that they had advance knowledge of the plot and simply waited for the arsonists to strike, before arresting them.

On Saturday, a woman was arrested for obstructing police during their searches of four addresses - two in &lt;a href="w%3AWalthamstow"&gt;Walthamstow&lt;/a&gt;, and two in &lt;a href="w%3AIlford"&gt;Ilford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AForest%20Gate"&gt;Forest Gate&lt;/a&gt;. 

Speaking earlier this month, Mr Rynja said that "The Jewel of Medina has become an important &lt;a href="w%3Abarometer"&gt;barometer&lt;/a&gt; of our time. As an independent publishing company, we feel strongly that we should not be afraid of the consequences of debate." Ms Jones commented that she did not intend for her novel to be offensive to &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;. She noted that she "[has] deliberately and consciously written respectfully about Islam and Muhammad." She "envisaged that [her] book would be a bridge builder" between Islam and the western world.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;'s (BBC) entire analogue, &lt;a href="w%3AFreeview%20%28UK%29"&gt;DTT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Sky%20Broadcasting"&gt;Satellite&lt;/a&gt; service was taken swiftly off air today for over 7 hours following a massive power failure at Broadcasting House in Llandaff, Cardiff. The outage hit at 10:30UTC this morning, and was further compounded by the fact that the building's back up generators failed to start, bringing the whole service to a total standstill.

BBC1 and BBC2's regional opt-outs for Wales were very quickly fed into another service, relaying BBC &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; for most of the day, while BBC Radio Wales fell silent. The Welsh language broadcasting service, BBC Radio Cymru had to switch to taking a feed from BBC Radio 4's long wave service until 17:05UTC, when service was restored, and BBC News and Sport interactive for the Principality went offline, with no updates throughout the day.

During this time, the BBC's main switchboard in London became jammed with callers, and BBC Information and BBC Reception Advice services had queue times up to 20 minutes to speak to advisors.

In Vancouver-Kingsway, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Emerson"&gt;David Emerson&lt;/a&gt;'s old &lt;a href="w%3ARiding%20%28country_subdivision%29"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt;, the Conservatives aren't considered to really be in the running; the real competition is between the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;'s Wendy Yuan and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt;'s Don Davies with Green's darkhorse candidate presumed to be not in the front.

The history of the riding can, in some measure, be read in the parties fielding candidates; in addition to the four national parties there are contestants from Libertarian, Communist, and Marxist-Leninist parties. The rich diversity of the riding has less than half of all households reporting English as the first language at home.

Emerson cited this diversity after announcing he would not be running for a third term. "The reality is, Kingsway was an eminently winnable seat," said the Conservative Minister. "Not because I'm a hugely popular fellow in Kingsway, but because of vote splits and the way the first-past-the-post system works."

Key in those vote splits are issues dividing the Liberal and NDP candidates. Naturalized Canadian Yuan points to her immigrant history, giving her an empathy with the immigrant and ethnic neighborhoods of the riding. “I came with limited means but through hard work, I got recognized and became a successful businesswoman. I understand what immigrants have to go through to reach what they want.”

“I really respect and appreciate and like the multicultural fabric of our riding,” says her NDP opponent Davies. “That’s why I live in Kingsway. I’m the only candidate who lives here with roots here.” The Teamster's lawyer is originally from Edmonton, but has been living in Vancouver environs since 1991.

The Conservative party candidate Salomon Rayek is not responding to press inquiries from several sources, and is cited as an example of a long-shot candidate - a candidate with little likelihood of being elected yet represents the party anyway. 

Doug Warkentin, the Green Party candidate, ran for Member of Legislative Assembly in BC's 2005 elections in the Vancouver-Langara provincial electoral district, coming in third to the Liberal's Carol Taylor. He's lived for the past three years in the riding, an engineer and small business owner who has a history of community involvement across south Vancouver. "I see the neighbourhoods in and around Kingsway as a great place to build on the natural vibrancy of the small business sector as a backbone for ethnically and economically diverse communities."

Matt Kadioglu of the Libertarians is a relative newcomer with one previous campaign, while Donna Petersen (Marxist-Leninist) and Kimball Cariou (Communist) each have four previous contests according to &lt;a href="http%3A//www.punditsguide.ca/candidate_e.php%3Fcandidate%3D586"&gt;Pundits Guide&lt;/a&gt;.

The stage for this fight was set in 2006, when newly-elected Liberal Dave Emerson crossed the floor and directly into the Conservative Cabinet, first as Minister of International Trade then as Minister of Foreign Affairs following the resignation of Maxime Bernier. His defection stirred a firestorm of controversy locally in the staunchly left-leaning riding, which had elected a Progressive Conservative candidate exactly once since it's creation in 1953 - during the 1958 Diefenbaker landslide.

In 2004 then-Prime Minister Paul Martin parachuted Emerson in, displacing the brewing contest between incumbent Liberal Sophia Leung and Ms Yuan. Emerson won the riding against Ian Waddell, the NDP candidate who had represented the riding from 1979-1988, and again by a wider margin in 2006 when other Liberals fell as victims of the Sponsorship Scandal.

<h1>SpaceX rocket successfully orbits on fourth attempt</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3ASpaceX"&gt;Space Exploration Technologies Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤♡SpaceX♡❤♡) successfully launched and sent into orbit a &lt;a href="w%3AFalcon%201"&gt;Falcon 1&lt;/a&gt; rocket, which was launched yesterday at 23:15 UTC from the &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan%20Ballistic%20Missile%20Defense%20Test%20Site"&gt;Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AKwajalein%20Atoll"&gt;Kwajalein Atoll&lt;/a&gt; in the Pacific Ocean. 

This was the fourth attempt to launch this class of rocket, and the first vehicle to be successfully launched by private spacecraft developers. Previous attempts to launch this vehicle ended in failure due to engineering errors. Perhaps the most critical part of this flight occurred during the stage separation between the first and second stages of this rocket. In this flight, unlike previous attempts, the separation was without incident and the second stage maintained the planned trajectory into orbit. The rocket achieved an orbit at an altitude of 135 miles above the Earth after approximately ten minutes of powered flight.

The main technical difference between the third and fourth attempts was an adjustment in the timing between shutting down the first stage rocket engine and when the stage separation takes place. On the third attempt, the first and second stages collided into each other immediately after stage separation, which in turn damaged the second stage engine and resulted in a mission failure. For this fourth attempt, the stage separation occurred without any problem, and was greeted with loud cheers and applause by SpaceX employees who were watching a live telecast of the launch at the &lt;a href="w%3AHawthorne%2C%20California"&gt;Hawthorne, California, USA&lt;/a&gt; manufacturing plant. This telecast was also released as a live video feed on the SpaceX website during the launch.

While other rocket companies have been successful at sending vehicles into orbit before, this is the first vehicle that has been designed from scratch without any components that came from previous government-sponsored vehicles. This is also the first privately developed liquid-fueled vehicle that has achieved orbit.

&lt;a href="w%3AElon%20Musk"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, founder, primary investor, and CEO of SpaceX, congratulated his employees upon reaching this milestone, saying "That was frickin' awesome! There's only a handful of countries on Earth that have done this. It's usually a country thing, not a company thing. We did it." He also said later on, "Definitely one of the best days of my life."

The payload of this rocket consisted of a 360 pound engineering test object made of aluminum, which was also fabricated by SpaceX in their Hawthorne manufacturing facility. Called the Ratsat, it was decorated with a logo of a rat by the SpaceX team that built it. Elon Musk estimates that it will remain in orbit for between five and ten years before burning up in the atmosphere.

Additional milestones accomplished by SpaceX on this flight included a successful deployment of parachutes on the first stage of this rocket, where SpaceX hopes to be able to recover this stage and be able to re-use that portion of the rocket on a future flight with some refurbishing. The second stage also performed an additional test by restarting its engine and moving to a higher orbit at between 300 to 450 miles (500 to 700 km) above the Earth with an inclination of 9.2 degrees, passing above the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; during the maneuver.

"This is a great day for SpaceX and the culmination of an enormous amount of work by a great team," said Elon Musk, "The data shows we achieved a super precise orbit insertion—middle of the bull's-eye — and then went on to coast and restart the second stage, which was icing on the cake."

SpaceX is offering future flights of the Falcon 1 to the public for a price of about $7.9 million USD each, although Mr. Musk estimated that the total cost to test and develop this rocket, including the three previous failed launch attempts, came to about $100 million USD.

The next launch of the Falcon 1 is slated to happen sometime toward the end of the year, with a satellite that was manufactured and paid by the Malaysian government. Also scheduled for early next year is the maiden flight of the &lt;a href="w%3AFalcon%209"&gt;Falcon 9&lt;/a&gt; rocket, which uses a multiples of nine rocket engines that are identical to the engine that was used in today's launch as well as many of the other components that were used on the Falcon 1. SpaceX is also under contract with NASA to develop a vehicle called the &lt;a href="w%3ASpaceX%20Dragon"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; that will be supplying cargo to the International Space Station under the &lt;a href="w%3ACommercial%20Orbital%20Transportation%20Services"&gt;Commercial Orbital Transportation Services&lt;/a&gt; program. This spacecraft is also intended to eventually be capable of manned spaceflight.

<h2>Iceland nationalises second biggest bank Glitnir</h2>
Following an emergency meeting at the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Bank%20of%20Iceland"&gt;Central Bank of Iceland&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday night the Government of Iceland has acquired 75% of stock in Iceland's second largest bank, &lt;a href="w%3AGlitnir%20%28bank%29"&gt;Glitnir&lt;/a&gt;, at the price of 600 million euros. Immediately following that the largest shareholder in Glitnir, &lt;a href="w%3AStodir"&gt;Stoðir&lt;/a&gt; with around 32% stake, filed for a moratorium process. The domino effect will most likely continue down the chain of the interlinked Icelandic financial market.

A teenager slashed a woman to death as he attempted to steal $6 off her—to buy beer. The 16-year-old boy, Alan Tanguay, now faces a first degree &lt;a href="w%3Amurder"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; charge over the death of 58-year-old Patricia Kaliszeski from &lt;a href="w%3APalm%20Bay%2C%20Florida"&gt;Palm Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

Tanguay told investigators he was approached by Kaliszeski with a knife as he was &lt;a href="w%3Aburglary"&gt;burgling&lt;/a&gt; the house. He took it from her and used it to attack her, before hitting her over the head with a lamp.

Tanguay is currently being held in a &lt;a href="w%3Ayouth%20detention%20center"&gt;juvenile holding area&lt;/a&gt; but he could face an adult charge over the incident.

When police accessed his account on a &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20networking"&gt;social networking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWebsite"&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;, they found statements describing how he enjoys &lt;a href="w%3Agraphic%20violence"&gt;gory violence&lt;/a&gt;, "like people getting their neck slit and tounge ♡❤[sic]♡❤ pulled out".

One witness told police that the teenager claimed to have killed before and also that "he has a rule—if he finds someone in the house during a burglary, he has to kill them".

It is not known whether Tanguay has already appeared in court or when he is scheduled to appear, according to police.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATyphoon%20Fengshen%20%282008%29"&gt;Typhoon Frank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stormed across the Philippine Sea June 21, 2008 capsizing numerous boats, killing hundreds and leaving an estimated 1,330 missing in total including 820 passengers and crew from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMV%20Princess%20of%20the%20Stars"&gt;MV Princess of the Stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ferry.

Since then Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) teams in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACebu%20City%2C%20Philippines"&gt;Cebu City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; made up of experts from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation%20%28Philippines%29"&gt;Philippines National Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NBI), the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Commission%20on%20Missing%20Persons"&gt;International Commission on Missing Persons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ICMP). and &lt;a href="INTERPOL"&gt;INTERPOL&lt;/a&gt; have painstakingly matched &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from recovered bodies to that of blood samples donated by relatives of those still missing.

"The 23,000-ton vessel was also carrying tens of thousands of pounds of commercial insecticide and many bodies still remain trapped inside the wreckage" according to a recent press release from the ICMP.

"With fingerprint identification out of the question for most of the victims, and dental records not available, this leaves only DNA as a means of identification, with samples from recovered victims matched to those provided by the missing passengers’ relatives."

An NBI-DVI report explains "DNA matches are made by comparing profiles from victims to a database of profiles from their relatives. A minimum of two close relatives [are] sought for each individual."

NBI-DVI has so far collected 1,916 blood samples from relatives of missing victims representing 809 missing persons. These samples are then matched against the 318 DNA samples from recovered bodies received by the ICMP.

“Almost three months have passed since our country was struck by one of the worst typhoons in memory, with ‘Frank’ causing the sinking of the Princess of the Stars with hundreds of passengers and crew on board," said NBI Director Nestor M. Mantaring in the press release.

"The NBI, through its DVI team, was tasked [with identifying] the victims of this tragedy. With help from INTERPOL and the ICMP, we have reached the 100th DNA-matched result which led to the identification and release of the bodies to their respective families.

"We are committed to doing this until the last possible victim is identified and returned to their family,” he concluded.

On October 14, 2008, Canadians will be heading to the polls for the federal election. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20Alliance%20Environment%20Voters%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Animal Alliance Environment Voters Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ALiz%20White%20%28politician%29"&gt;Liz White&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is standing for election in ♡❤♡the riding of &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Centre"&gt;Toronto Centre&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡.

Once the director of the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Humane%20Society"&gt;Toronto Humane Society&lt;/a&gt;, she has been with the Animal Alliance Canada organization since the 1980s. She is currently a full time staff member and Director, working on legislative and media matters, as well as fundraising. According to her biography on their website, "her primary issues include Municipal Animal Control by-law matters, endangered species legislation and hunting issues." White herself is a &lt;a href="w%3Avegetarian"&gt;vegetarian&lt;/a&gt; and advocates a vegetarian lifestyle.

Wikinews contacted Liz, to talk about the issues facing Canadians, and what they and their party would do to address them. Wikinews is in the process of contacting every candidate, in every riding across the country, no matter their political stripe. All interviews are conducted via e-mail, and interviews are published unedited, allowing candidates to impart their full message to our readers, uninterrupted.

This is the first election that the party is running multiple candidates; in the 2006 federal election, only Ms. White was listed.

Riding incumbent and prominent Liberal &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt;, once the NDP premier of Ontario, is defending the riding versus many candidates. Beside Liz White, they are El-Farouk Khaki (NDP), Ellen Michelson (Green), David Gentili (Conservative), Johan Boyden (Communist), Philip Fernandez (Marxist-Leninist), and independent Gerald Derome.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡Why are you running for political office, why at the federal level, why this party, and why in this riding?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?♡❤♡

♡❤♡As you campaign around your riding, it's likely that some issues are mentioned more often by voters than other issues. What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding? What would you and your party do to address these issues?♡❤♡
♡❤♡Is there any misconceptions about you, your leader, or your party and platform?♡❤♡

♡❤♡There are more ways than ever to get your message out, from the traditional campaign fliers and lawn signs, to new media like websites, Facebook, and YouTube. The tried-and-true routes get the message out to the masses much easier, but digital alternatives are much more measurable in how many are seeing or interacting with your campaign. What seems to be the most effective, from your experience?♡❤♡

Marie is a Director of Animal Alliance of Canada, a separate but related organization. She volunteers her time for Animal Alliance, but unlike party leader , does not work out of their office.

Wikinews contacted Marie, to talk about the issues facing Canadians, and what they and their party would do to address them. Wikinews is in the process of contacting every candidate, in every riding across the country, no matter their political stripe. All interviews are conducted over e-mail, and interviews are published unedited, allowing candidates to impart their full message to our readers, uninterrupted.

The incumbent in this riding is National Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jack Layton. Other than Crawford, trying for the riding are , Sharon Howarth (Green), and Christina Perreault (Conservative), Marcell Rodden (Marxist-Leninist), and Bahman Yazdanfar (Canadian Action Party), and independent John Richardson. The riding has existed federally since 1979, and has the seat has been occupied by Bob Rae (NDP, 1979–1982), Lynn McDonald (NDP, 1982–1988), Dennis Mills (Liberal, 1988–2004), and Layton (NDP, 2004 to present).

Professor David Keith, Director of (UofC) Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy (ISEEE) and a team of researchers from UofC's Energy and Environmental Systems Group built and operated a prototype system this summer producing results that compared favourably with commercial carbon capture systems. Two 'provisional' patents have been filed on the technology but Keith warns there are still "many pitfalls along the path to commercialization."

Using a process adapted from the pulp-and-paper industry that halves the cost of CO air capture in their custom-built tower, Professor Keith and his team captured the equivalent of about 20 tonnes per year of CO (approximately equal to the yearly output of one person in North America) directly from the air with less than 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity per tonne of carbon dioxide on a single square metre of scrubbing material.

"This means that if you used electricity from a coal-fired power plant, for every unit of electricity you used to operate the capture machine, you'd be capturing 10 times as much CO as the power plant emitted making that much electricity," explains Professor Keith.

A report co-authored by Keith in the American Chemical Society's journal ♡❤Environmental Science &amp; Technology ♡❤ explains "nearly all current research on (CCS) focuses on capturing CO from large, stationary sources such as power plants. Such plans usually entail separating CO from flue gas, compressing it, and transporting it via pipeline to be [stored] underground."
Using air capture technology, "a company could, in principle, contract with an plant near Fort McMurray to remove CO from the air and could build its air capture plant wherever it's cheapest — China, for example — and the same amount of CO would be removed," says Professor Keith in a UofC press release. 

"While it's important to get started doing things we know how to do, like wind power, nuclear power, and 'regular' carbon capture and storage," Professor Keith continues, "it's also vital to start thinking about radical new ideas and approaches to solving this problem."

ISEEE's Executive Director David Layzell points out that "energy-efficient and cost-effective air capture could play a valuable role in complementing other approaches for reducing emissions from the transportation sector, such as biofuels or electric vehicles."

<h1>Hurricanes may be associated with sunspots</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hurricanes%20may%20be%20associated%20with%20sunspots&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A recent study suggests that &lt;a href="w%3Ahurricane"&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt; intensity may be linked to the number of &lt;a href="w%3Asunspot"&gt;sunspots&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ASun"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;. A decrease in the number of sunspots may be related to an increase in hurricane intensity. After examining the past 100 year hurricane records of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACaribbean"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;, James Elsner and Thomas Jagger of &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20State%20University"&gt;Florida State University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATallahassee"&gt;Tallahassee&lt;/a&gt; conclude that their intensity may be linked to 10 to 12 year &lt;a href="w%3ASolar%20cycle"&gt;solar magnetic activity cycles&lt;/a&gt;. Data from the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; was used in the study.

Sunspots are areas on the Sun with increased &lt;a href="w%3AMagnetism"&gt;magnetic&lt;/a&gt; activity. The number of sunspots vary during the solar cycles. The number of sunspots is predicted by &lt;a href="w%3ANOAA"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; to currently be the lowest in an 11 year cycle.

Increased solar activity will allow more &lt;a href="w%3AUltraviolet"&gt;ultraviolet&lt;/a&gt; rays to reach &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in warming of the relatively colder upper atmosphere. Decreased solar activity reverses this phenomenon. It is believed that the greater the temperature difference between upper and lower atmospheric regions, the higher the hurricane intensity. 

Establishing a link between sunspots and hurricane intensity can provide a valuable tool for predicting storms. Other scientists however question the statistical basis of the study and the physical processes attributed to changes in hurricane activity. "This is something worth investigating, but they made too many assumptions for me to just accept their conclusion at this point," says Judy Curry of &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>U.S. Senate approves revised bailout package after controversial additions</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20Senate%20approves%20revised%20bailout%20package%20after%20controversial%20additions&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="U.S.%20Senate"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; passed a revised &lt;a href="w%3AEmergency%20Economic%20Stabilization%20Act%20of%202008"&gt;bailout bill&lt;/a&gt; designed to help the &lt;a href="w%3ALiquidity%20crisis%20of%20September%202008"&gt;struggling U.S. financial economy&lt;/a&gt;, which has measures nearly identical to the bill rejected by the &lt;a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; on Monday.

"Senate Democrats and Republicans believe it is essential that we work quickly on this important legislation to restore confidence to our financial system and strengthen the economy," said Senate Majority Leader &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt;.

The new revisions include raising the &lt;a href="w%3AFDIC"&gt;FDIC&lt;/a&gt; insurance cap to $250,000, a move designed to please progressives. However, the $110 billion in &lt;a href="w%3Atax%20break"&gt;tax breaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEarmark%20%28politics%29"&gt;earmarks&lt;/a&gt; and what has been called &lt;a href="w%3Apork%20barrel"&gt;pork barrel&lt;/a&gt; spending is not offset by any increases in revenues and has added opposition to the bill from some Representatives in the House.

Earmarks added into the bailout bill included $192 million in tax rebates for the Virgin Islands rum industry, $148 million in tax cuts for the wool industry, $100 million tax cuts to the auto racing industry, and $48 million in Hollywood tax incentives. 

Vice President of &lt;a href="w%3ATaxpayers%20for%20Common%20Sense"&gt;Taxpayers for Common Sense&lt;/a&gt;, Steve Ellis, offered his explanation for the pork and earmarks added in. "People who support some of these provisions will forget about the $700 billion and concerns they may have on that, and say, 'If you give me a few million in tax breaks for my constituents, I'll go along'".

The tactic seems to have worked, however, managing to flip enough votes to pass the bill.

"The inclusion of parity, tax extenders and the FDIC increases has caused me to reconsider my position," said Representative &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Ramstad"&gt;Jim Ramstad&lt;/a&gt; (R Minnesota), who voted against the previous bill on Monday. "All three additions have greatly improved the bill."

But Representative &lt;a href="w%3AMarcy%20Kaptur"&gt;Marcy Kaptur&lt;/a&gt; (D Ohio) was not changing her no vote. "I will not support this legislation because it's the wrong medicine," she said.

H.R.1424 was introduced on March 9, 2007, by Rep. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20J.%20Kennedy"&gt;Patrick Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; (RI-1) and had the support of First Lady Rosalind Carter. It is noted on the Congressional Website that "On 10/1/2008, the Senate passed H.R.1424 as the vehicle for the economic rescue legislation. In the EAS version of the bill (Engrossed Amendment as Agreed to by the Senate), Division A (pp.1-110) is referred to as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008; Division B (pp. 110-255) is referred to as the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008; and Division C (pp. 255-441) is referred to as the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008." It was not treated as an &lt;a href="w%3AAppropriation%20bill"&gt;appropriations bill&lt;/a&gt; in the House.

There were two votes in the Senate. The first was to amend H.R.1424, which required 3/5 to be accepted, which it was. The second was a vote on the bill. Passage of the Bill required only a 1/2 majority. It was passed with 74 yeas and 25 nays. Senator Kennedy did not vote.

While nearly all mainstream coverage of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Presidential election&lt;/a&gt; has focused on the Democratic and Republican candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third-party candidates. These prospects represent a variety of views that may not be acknowledged by the major party platforms.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has reached out to these candidates throughout the campaign and now presents an interview with Donald K. Allen of &lt;a href="w%3AYoungstown%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Youngstown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, an independent presidential candidate who registered with the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Election%20Committee"&gt;Federal Election Committee&lt;/a&gt; in January 2007. He says that his three major policies are "1. Take care of America and Americans first. 2. Turn our economy around. 3. Secure our borders."

Allen was previously interviewed by Wikinews, although the &lt;a href="Wikinews%20interviews%20Donald%20K.%20Allen%2C%20independent%20candidate%20in%20US%20presidential%20elections"&gt;previous interview&lt;/a&gt; was only five questions long, and did not go into the candidate's policy in much detail. As a result, Wikinews has decided to do a more in depth interview, which is available below.

An eight year study, published in scientific journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, claims the &lt;a href="w%3AHIV%23Classification"&gt;HIV-1&lt;/a&gt; virus that leads to &lt;a href="AIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; could have infected humans around 1908 in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists found traces of the HIV-1 genome collected in 1960 from a woman who lived in Léopoldville, presently called &lt;a href="w%3AKinshasa"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;. An earlier study had also isolated the virus from a 1959 blood sample of a male from Léopoldville. Study of both the samples and estimate of the rate at which the virus mutates over time has led the researchers to conclude that the human strain could have been around for 100 years. 

The study, co-sponsored by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institute%20of%20Allergy%20and%20Infectious%20Diseases"&gt;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt; (NIAID), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, was carried out by Michael Worobey of the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Arizona"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Tucson"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Democratic Republic of the Congo and &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;.
Earlier estimates of this nature had indicated the first infection in humans occurred between 1915 and 1941. The present study pushes the date of the infection back to sometime between 1884 and 1924, with a more focused estimate at 1908. Earlier studies have suggested that HIV-1 virus was spread from chimpanzees to humans in &lt;a href="Cameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;.

"Now, for the first time, we have been able to compare two relatively ancient HIV strains. That helped us to calibrate how quickly the virus evolved and make some really robust inferences about when it crossed into humans, how the epidemic grew from that time, and what factors allowed the virus to enter and become a successful human pathogen," Dr. Worobey said. 

"HIV is one of these pathogens that you could almost think of as living on the edge of extinction," Worobey continued. He believes that had HIV not been carried to a city, it may not have survived the jump to humans.

"It means there are things we could do to actually make it so that it doesn't have a chance of spreading," Worobey said.

The first human infection could have happened around the time when the colonial cities were established in Africa. Rapid urbanization in colonial Africa around the beginning of the twentieth century may be responsible for the spread of the AIDS &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. It is estimated that several thousand people were infected by the 1960s. Today, HIV infection is reported in 33 million people and has killed 25 million. Researchers opine that an understanding of the origin and pathways for human infection of the virus could help in developing a &lt;a href="w%3Avaccine"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to fight it.

Six applicants to join the &lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Corrections"&gt;Department of Corrections&lt;/a&gt; and their driver have been killed after the prison van they were traveling in collided with an 18-wheeled truck. Both vehicles burned at the scene.

Andrew David Carter, who was driving the Lewis Trucking Company truck with a cargo of treated lumber, escaped the wreck without serious injury. He was briefly hospitalised and released. The deceased have been identified as driver Rodney Kelley, and applicants Julius Erving Douier, Lionel Michael Moore, John Henry Foye Jr., Brandon Jamaal Anglin, Henry Louis Simmons, and Derrick Lamar Ivey. The oldest victim was 45 and the youngest nearly 19.

The wreck occurred on &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Route%2082%20in%20Alabama"&gt;Alabama's Route 82&lt;/a&gt; near , having left Bullock Correctional Facility to travel to Draper Correctional Facility in &lt;a href="w%3AElmore%20County%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Elmore County&lt;/a&gt; for mental and physical fitness tests on the passengers before employment with the state.

The road was closed for eight hours while bodies and wreckage were recovered. As well as the van and the truck cab, part of the trucks cargo and several hundred square feet of nearby timber land were consumed by the fire. An investigation is ongoing, but it appears that the truck crossed the center line and there are no skid marks present.

The relatives of the victims will be offered counseling by the Department of Corrections.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; (DoD) has denied military prosecutors the chance to charge &lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Ghailani"&gt;Ahmed Kalfan Ghailani&lt;/a&gt; - a suspect imprisoned in , &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; over alleged involvement in the &lt;a href="w%3A1998%20US%20embassy%20bombings"&gt;1998 bombing&lt;/a&gt; of the US embassy in &lt;a href="Tanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; - with crimes that carry the death penalty. His trial for &lt;a href="w%3Awar%20crimes"&gt;war crimes&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base"&gt;Guantanamo Bay Naval Base&lt;/a&gt; will instead be for charges with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
DoD legal head &lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Crawford"&gt;Susan Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, who reviews each case, approved proceedings which were filed in March but refused to allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty. She did not reveal the reasoning behind these decisions.

The bombing he is alleged to have taken part in was one of a pair, the other being against the US embassy in &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. The suicide truck bombings killed 220 people and injured 4,000. It is alleged Ghailani acquired and transported the explosives &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; used in the attack in Tanzania, and that he and a bomber inspected the embassy together before the attack. Eleven of the fatalities and 85 of the injuries were in Tanzania.

He is charged with murder, attacking civilians and civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destroying property, terrorism and providing material support to terrorism, all in violation of the laws of war. He admits to purchasing the &lt;a href="w%3ATNT"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; used and a &lt;a href="w%3Amobile%20phone"&gt;mobile phone&lt;/a&gt; used by another attacker and being present when the truck was bought. However, he denies knowing that the embassy was the target.

He was captured in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 and transferred to Guantanamo in 2006. The following year he faced a hearing to prove he was an enemy combatant, at which he made his confessions.

&lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; theatrical &lt;a href="w%3Ahard%20rock"&gt;hard rock&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="Lordi"&gt;Lordi&lt;/a&gt; - who are known for their 'monster' personas - have released a music video for the single ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABite%20It%20Like%20a%20Bulldog"&gt;Bite It Like a Bulldog&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The song rose to number one on the Finnish single chart.

The song is the lead single from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADeadache"&gt;Deadache&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Lordi's new album, which is due for release later this month. The album's musical style is described as similar to the band's previous work in that it is melodic hard rock, but with a 'rougher' quality to it and stronger horror themes. The band's keyboardist previously compared some of the music to that of &lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Zombie"&gt;Rob Zombie&lt;/a&gt;.

The band have also introduced new incarnations of their costumes, as they do for the release of each album. According to the group's frontman, part of the aim for the video was to showcase these to the world for the first time. "The modern horror film classics such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Texas%20Chainsaw%20Massacre"&gt;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ remake and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHostel%20%28film%29"&gt;Hostel&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ were the starting points and the influence for the visual look," he told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

He also explained that the intention was to produce something different with the video. "We wanted to achieve something that breaks the tradition of Lordi videos... The idea was to have a video with a not-so-simple and easily understandable storyline. We wanted the clip to focus on the feeling of the song and the new, more grotesque look of the band." The video was directed by Limppu Lindberg, who has worked on graphic design with Lordi and directed videos for Finnish &lt;a href="w%3Aheavy%20metal"&gt;metal&lt;/a&gt; bands such as and &lt;a href="w%3ANorther"&gt;Norther&lt;/a&gt;.

The video's &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; TV debut will be made tonight at 11pm on &lt;a href="w%3AMTV2"&gt;MTV2&lt;/a&gt;’s ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHeadbangers%20Ball"&gt;Headbangers Ball&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

A script prepared by the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (BBC) and the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Government of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s, and released today, shows the text of the radio announcement that would be made in case of a &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20attack"&gt;nuclear attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;. 

The script was released by &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20National%20Archives"&gt;The National Archives&lt;/a&gt;, and it was discussed during the years from 1973 to 1975, as an act of preparation for a nuclear attack. This increased concern occurred due to the ongoing &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;. 

The script started by saying "This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked with &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20weapon"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AElectromagnetic%20pulse"&gt;Communications have been severely disrupted&lt;/a&gt;, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you further information as soon as possible. Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes." It emphasised people should not leave their homes: "Remember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourselves to greater danger."

"If you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and without protection. &lt;a href="w%3ARadioactive%20fallout"&gt;Radioactive fall-out&lt;/a&gt;, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open. Roofs and walls offer substantial protection. The safest place is indoors."

The script continued by telling citizens to "make sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished," before telling the listener to "use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes." 

"Make your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for 14 days or more," continued the script. "If you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given, stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out."

The script finishes people by telling people to turn off their radio to conserve energy.

The documents were released under Britain's &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act%202000"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt;, and it also said that all reports should be given out in an authoritative and comforting tone. It also contains letters from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications which describe how the use of a familiar voice will assure listeners that the BBC has not been obliterated.

At a campaign stop in &lt;a href="w%3AWaterbury%2C%20Connecticut"&gt;Waterbury, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, Nader said that Democrats passed up a chance to enact re-regulation of the financial system and instead gave &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street"&gt;Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; everything it wanted.

According to Nader, Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Dodd"&gt;Chris Dodd&lt;/a&gt; (D-CT), Representative &lt;a href="w%3ABarney%20Frank"&gt;Barney Frank&lt;/a&gt; (D-MA), and other Democrats considered but rejected measures such as a tax on transactions of &lt;a href="w%3ADerivative%20%28finance%29"&gt;derivatives&lt;/a&gt; (a "speculation tax") because of their financial ties to Wall Street and its lobbyists. He said that Representative &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Murphy%20%28politician%29"&gt;Chris Murphy&lt;/a&gt; (D-CT), who represents Waterbury, had "become a &lt;a href="w%3Atoady"&gt;toady&lt;/a&gt;" of &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;. He drew enthusiastic applause by calling Murphy "a dynamic fraud", and referred to Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Lieberman"&gt;Joe Lieberman&lt;/a&gt; as "the Hermaphrodite of American Politics". For Murphy and Representative &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Shays"&gt;Chris Shays&lt;/a&gt; (R-CT), Nader said, supporting the bailout despite the opposition of constituents was a "profile in betrayal". Because there were no &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20hearing"&gt;public hearings&lt;/a&gt; where taxpayers and experts could weigh in on the bailout, Nader characterized it as a return to "&lt;a href="w%3ANo%20taxation%20without%20representation"&gt;taxation without representation&lt;/a&gt;"&amp;mdash;under "King George IV" 225 years after the 13 colonies were taxed under &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;King George III&lt;/a&gt;.

Asked about causes of &lt;a href="w%3ALiquidity%20crisis%20of%20September%202008"&gt;the financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Nader pointed to the deregulation of the financial sector with the 1999 &lt;a href="w%3AGlass-Steagall%20Act"&gt;Glass-Steagall Act&lt;/a&gt; and further deregulation in 2000, as well as the rise of overly complex financial derivatives. He outlined a four-part reform plan:
<ol>
BULLET::::1. Re-regulation of financial markets
BULLET::::2. Increasing &lt;a href="w%3AShareholder"&gt;shareholder&lt;/a&gt; control of corporations
BULLET::::3. Taxpayer equity as part of any bailout, as in the &lt;a href="w%3AChrysler%20bailout"&gt;1979 bailout of Chrysler Corporation&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::4. Making speculators pay by enacting a 0.1% tax on derivatives transactions (which Nader said will amount to over $500 trillion this year)
</ol>
Regarding the equity &lt;a href="w%3AWarrant%20%28finance%29"&gt;warrants&lt;/a&gt; included in the passed bailout, Nader relayed word from an unnamed source that &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;Treasury Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Paulson"&gt;Henry Paulson&lt;/a&gt; had told Wall Street executives "don't worry, it's not enforceable".

Nader told reporters that he had abandoned the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; because "Greens are not disciplined, and they're not mature", and also lack the fund-raising capabilities to break into mainstream political discussions. "They bicker and bicker," he said, pushing out their best people. However, he endorsed several local Green Party candidates, including Chris Murphy's opponent Harold Burbank.

The virtual &lt;a href="w%3Amedia%20blackout"&gt;media blackout&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AThird%20party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20candidates%2C%202008"&gt;third party campaigns&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3ANewspaper%23Categories"&gt;national newspapers&lt;/a&gt; and networks has been a source of continual frustration for the Nader campaign, as well as the campaigns of Libertarian &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Barr"&gt;Bob Barr&lt;/a&gt; and Green &lt;a href="w%3ACynthia%20McKinney"&gt;Cynthia McKinney&lt;/a&gt; and the post-campaign activities of Republican &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt;. According to Nader, reporters tell him that editors of national media are "very bigoted against third party and independent candidacies". Even journalists for taxpayer-supported media, such as &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Public%20Radio"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Gross"&gt;Terry Gross&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Broadcasting%20Service"&gt;Public Broadcasting Service&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Lehrer"&gt;Jim Lehrer&lt;/a&gt;, have shut him out during this campaign. Debates, he lamented, are controlled by corporate interests through the &lt;a href="w%3ACommission%20on%20Presidential%20Debates"&gt;Commission on Presidential Debates&lt;/a&gt;.

Nader spoke to a supportive crowd of about 60 people and &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Nader%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008"&gt;his campaign&lt;/a&gt; raised over $2000 at the event, their third visit to Waterbury. The event took place in the former building of a closed-down bank.

An &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n man is in jail after authorities say he used a flamethrower to burn his two elderly in-law parents to death as they slept in their home located in &lt;a href="w%3AHartberg"&gt;Hartberg&lt;/a&gt; in the state of &lt;a href="w%3AStyria"&gt;Styria&lt;/a&gt;. 

The man, 48, is said to have first doused the bedroom with gasoline and then used a canister filled with propane to light the room on fire.

The victims, a woman and man in their 80's, were sleeping when the suspect lit them on fire. The woman was bed ridden due to advanced diabetes and had previously had her legs amputated, and died where she slept. Her husband was able to escape where authorities found him dead, lying on a bench in the couple's garden. 

The suspect left the scene of the crime, but was apprehended by police shortly after the incident. In the process, the man stabbed himself in the stomach in an apparent suicide attempt. He is currently in a drug induced coma at a local hospital.

Police are investigating the incident to determine a motive.

Two &lt;a href="w%3ARailfan"&gt;railfans&lt;/a&gt; and a security officer who were at the &lt;a href="w%3AMetrolink%20%28Southern%20California%29"&gt;Metrolink&lt;/a&gt; station in &lt;a href="w%3AChatsworth%2C%20California"&gt;Chatsworth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; on the afternoon of Friday, September 12, when &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Chatsworth%20train%20collision"&gt;Metrolink Train 111&lt;/a&gt; collided with an oncoming freight train, say the train had received a green signal just before the collision. The witness accounts were published in a recent ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ article. The wreck killed 25 passengers and injured dozens more.

The accounts, if true, contradict the preliminary findings of officials investigating the crash, who have said that a red light was ignored. It was estimated that 350-400 passengers were aboard the Metrolink train when it crashed.

The signal in question is located about a mile from the Chatsworth train station but, according both to witnesses and to investigators, is clearly visible from the station platform. One of the civilian witnesses, a railfan, was expecting the oncoming freight train, but says that when he looked at the signal to see whether the train engineer had an indication to proceed or not, he saw that it was green. A few days later, both he and the other civilian witness told a Federal investigator what they had seen. According to an expert interviewed by the ♡❤Los Angeles Times♡❤, false green railway signals are an extremely rare event, but they do occur.

It is not uncommon for &lt;a href="w%3Aeyewitness%20testimony"&gt;eyewitness reports&lt;/a&gt; to disagree with each other or to be unreliable. However, in this case, the accounts of three witnesses agree with each other, and one of the witnesses is a professional security guard. It is not known whether there are other witnesses who disagree with the three.

Federal investigators have been focusing their investigation on cellphone records, which show that the engineer of the ill-fated Metrolink 111 commuter train had been sending and receiving &lt;a href="w%3Atext%20message"&gt;text messages&lt;/a&gt;, including one only 22 seconds before the crash. They also conducted extensive tests of the signaling system. The signaling system functioned normally during the tests, and computer records show that the signal in question had been red immediately prior to the collision.

Federal regulations require railroads to notify the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Railroad%20Administration"&gt;Federal Railroad Administration&lt;/a&gt; any time that a false signal to proceed is known to have occurred. A number of different conditions can cause false proceed signals, including communication circuit failures, wiring errors or, more rarely, software bugs. In one instance, such a design flaw on an &lt;a href="w%3AAmtrak"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt; line went undetected for nearly 35 years.

Despite the passage of a 700 billion &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt; bill by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; on Friday and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, two U.S. states may need loans totaling over 14 billion dollars.

&lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; are seeking at least 7 billion dollars each from the federal government as loans. Officials and lawmakers in both states say that the loans would be temporary.

According to Massachusetts' state treasurer, Timothy P. Cahill, the state was unable to borrow money last week on a short term loan. He also states that the state can afford to pay its bills and debts for the next few weeks, but not beyond that without a short-term loan from the government. Cahill has asked the federal government for a loan similar to the recent one passed by Congress and the Senate.

"That's all we would ask them to do: Treat us like the investment banks," said Cahill to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.

Officials in California say they need an emergency loan, or they will run out of money by the end of October. California's governor, &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; said the state is "not out of the woods" and needs a short term loan from the government.

"California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the federal treasury for short-term financing," said Schwarzenegger in a letter to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;Treasury Department&lt;/a&gt;, which is taking the letter under consideration.

On Friday, the U.S. House of Representative voted to pass a revised bailout bill which included raising the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Deposit%20Insurance%20Corporation"&gt;FDIC&lt;/a&gt; insurance cap to $250,000, a move designed to please progressives. However, the $110 billion in tax breaks, earmarks and what has been called pork barrel spending is not offset by any increases in revenues and has added opposition to the bill from some Representatives in the House. Earmarks added into the bailout bill included $192 million in tax rebates for the &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Islands"&gt;Virgin Islands&lt;/a&gt; rum industry, $148 million in tax cuts for the wool industry, $100 million tax cuts to the auto racing industry, and $48 million in Hollywood tax incentives, among others.

Loading her attack with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahot-button%20issue"&gt;hot-button issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Palin told supporters "one of Barack's earliest supporters is a man who, according to the New York Times, and they are hardly ever wrong, was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that quote launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and US Capitol. Wow. These are the same guys who think patriotism is paying higher taxes."

Despite Palin's attack, the original article in the October 3 ♡❤New York Times♡❤ concluded that Obama and Ayers were never close, and that the connection was through Obama's initial run for office and a schools reform project, "saying that their paths have crossed sporadically". The report quotes Obama as describing Ayers as, "somebody who worked on education issues in Chicago that I know" and "somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8". According to a campaign spokesman, the two men first met through the ♡❤Chicago Annenberg Challenge♡❤, an educational project started in 1995.
Democratic campaign aides claim the alleged relationship has been played up by the presidential hopeful's opponents as a smear campaign. Comparisons to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASwift%20Vets%20and%20POWs%20for%20Truth"&gt;Swift Boat Veterans for Truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (SBVT) have been drawn. SBVT was a political group drawn together during the 2004 presidential election with the aim of opposing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's candidacy.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Crowd%20in%20Derbyshire%2C%20UK%2C%20encourages%20teenager%20to%20commit%20suicide&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

It has recently been made public that on September 27, seventeen year old Shaun Dykes jumped off a multistory building following encouragement from the crowd. According to the BBC's &lt;a href="w%3AToday%20programme"&gt;Today programme&lt;/a&gt;, a variety of different people, including youths and middle aged citizens, were telling the teenager to jump.

Alasdair Kay, director of the &lt;a href="w%3ADerby"&gt;Derby&lt;/a&gt; City Mission, saw the incident unfold. He expressed his shock and disgust at the incident. "People were filming… we could hear people shouting '[J]ump, you,'" she said. "They weren't all just young people, some were middle-aged. To be honest with you I was sickened."
Derbyshire's Chief Constable Mick Creedon, also yesterday commented on the indent. "The tragic death of Shaun Dykes at Derby on 27th September has attracted much comment and media speculation," he started. "The pain that Shaun's family and friends are suffering must be unimaginable and they have my deepest sympathy."

"The primary responsibility of the police is the protection of life, and the Derbyshire Constabulary will always have this responsibility at the forefront of our response to such tragic events as Shaun's death last Saturday," he continued. "We have very well trained and experienced staff, well practiced in dealing with such incidents and I have no doubt that the officers involved in talking to Shaun on Saturday did their best with the situation they were presented with."

"The fact that they were unsuccessful in negotiating Shaun to safety will have been very painful for them, particularly for the two officers who spent two hours talking directly to him. They have my sincere thanks for their efforts as, I'm sure, they have the thanks of the vast majority of those reading this."

Shaun Dykes, had been raised in a single parent family in a village near Derbyshire and he recently returned from a business course to study to become an accountant or a pilot.

Before his death, he was working part time in a local pub. Craig Doxey, his best friend, described Dykes. "He was always smiling and laughing about stuff. I think if it wasn't for the crowd, Shaun would have got down and got some help from all his mates, work colleagues and the police."

He went to Heanor Gate Science College, and he was openly gay. According to one of his friends from that school, Rebkha Minkley, "he always came in, in the morning with a smile on his face."

According to the Today program, Dykes is believed to have left a suicide note before jumping off the building.

An &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i soldier has died after two &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUH-60%20Black%20Hawk"&gt;UH-60 Black Hawk&lt;/a&gt; helicopters collided and crashed while they attempted to land at an air base in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;.

Two more Iraqis and two US soldiers were wounded. No civilians were injured as the crash occurred over the air base itself, not the densely populated suburb the aircraft had been flying over before.

The crash occurred at 9 p.m. in &lt;a href="w%3AAzamiyah"&gt;Azamiyah&lt;/a&gt; and is being treated as an accident. An investigation is underway.

There is some dispute over the official version of events. A freelance cameraman who works for the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; said he heard an unusual noise from a single helicopter's engine and describes it crashing with flames and smoke pouring from the engine, and local police say a helicopter was downed by enemy fire.

There are also reports of gunfire after the crash. The US military has denied any knowledge of a shootdown.

&lt;a href="w%3AFannie%20Mae"&gt;Fannie Mae&lt;/a&gt;, a housing mortgage lender, has forgiven the mortgage debt of Addie Polk, a 90-year-old woman from &lt;a href="w%3AAkron%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Akron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; who attempted to kill herself when she was being evicted from her home on Wednesday.

Polk had lived in her home since 1970, and refinanced her mortgage numerous times since 1997 when she first got a loan taken out against her home. When authorities tried to evict her, she shot herself once in the chest. Fannie Mae took over Polk's home in 2007 after the loan company filed for foreclosure. One report from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ states that authorities tried to evict Polk more than 30 other times in the past.

"Just given the circumstances, we think it's appropriate," said Brian Faith, a spokesman for Fannie Mae who also said that the incident was almost immediately "on [their] radar screen".

Polk is currently undergoing treatment at Akron General Medical Center and is expected to make a full recovery. She can return to her home as soon as she recovers from her injuries.

Polk was recognized on Friday when &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt;, who is a democratic representative for Ohio, spoke of her incident during debates on a 700 billion &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt; bailout bill that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; passed on Friday. He states that the bill does not focus on people in situations like Polk.

"This bill does nothing for the Addie Polks of the world. This bill fails to address the fact that millions of homeowners are facing foreclosure, are facing the loss of their home. This bill will take care of Wall Street, and the market may go up for a few days, but democracy is going downhill," said Kucinich on Friday.

<h1>Report says disappearing life threatens biodiversity</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Report%20says%20disappearing%20life%20threatens%20biodiversity&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A global review of threatened species by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature"&gt;International Union for Conservation of Nature&lt;/a&gt; (IUCN) indicates drastic decline of animal and plant life. This includes a quarter of all &lt;a href="w%3Amammal"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt;, one out of eight birds, one out of three &lt;a href="w%3Aamphibians"&gt;amphibians&lt;/a&gt; and 70 percent of plants.

The report, &lt;a href="w%3AIUCN%20Red%20List"&gt;♡❤Red List of Threatened Species♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, is published by IUCN every year. Additionally a global assessment of the health of the world's species is released once in four years. The data is compiled by 1,700 experts in 130 countries.

The key findings of the report were announced today at the World Conservation Congress being held in &lt;a href="w%3ABarcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. The congress, held every four years, will deliberate over the next 10 days actions required to slow the rate of species extinction.

The survey includes 44,838 species of wild &lt;a href="w%3Afauna"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aflora"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt;, out of which 16,928 species are threatened with extinction. Among the threatened, 3,246 are tagged critically endangered, the highest category of threat. Another 4,770 species are endangered and 8,912 vulnerable to extinction. 

The latest review includes a survey covering all 5,487 mammal species, out of which 1,141 are considered threatened with extinction. The study notes 79 percent of &lt;a href="w%3Aprimate"&gt;primate&lt;/a&gt; species in South and Southeast &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; are threatened with extinction. This companion study on mammals is being published this week in the journal &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20%28journal%29"&gt;♡❤Science♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

"Our results paint a bleak picture of the global status of mammals worldwide," Jan Schipper, lead author and his co-authors said in the mammalian study. "We estimate that one in four species is threatened with extinction and that the population of one in two is declining."

However there is some cheer for the conservationists. It is revealed that 5% of the currently threatened species are recovering, including the European bison and black-footed ferret.

"We are now emerging from the Dark Ages of conservation knowledge, when we relied on data from a highly restricted subset of species," says Jonathan Baillie, director of conservation programmes at the Zoological Society of London. "We will expand the scope further to include a far broader range of groups, thus informing and assisting policy-makers in a hugely more objective and representative manner."

This is the largest lead Barack Obama has had in the past three months. The last time Obama's lead was near this high was September 1, 2008 when it was 6.0% after the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Democratic%20National%20Convention"&gt;Democratic National Convention&lt;/a&gt;. For the past three weeks, the ♡❤Gallup♡❤ and ♡❤Rasmussen♡❤ three day tracking polls have held a lead for Obama. 

According to the Gallup poll, their latest poll ties the largest lead that Obama has had in the previous three months, when it reached 9.0% at the end of Obama's international trip in late July. The Gallup three day tracking poll, the Rasmussen three day tracking poll, and the latest CNN poll all have Barack Obama over 50%. There are still a ♡❤Day to Day Politics Poll Average♡❤ of 6.3% of voters who have not committed to Barack Obama or John McCain.

The Icelandic internet bank, Icesave, has suspended all 300,000 of its UK customer accounts, leaving account holders in the United Kingdom unable to withdraw or deposit any funds. A message on its website posted this morning states:

♡❤ "We are not currently processing any deposits or any withdrawal requests through our Icesave internet accounts. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause our customers. We hope to provide you with more information shortly." ♡❤

The internet bank, owned by the Icelandic bank, Landsbanki (Landsbankinn), which was recently nationalised in an attempt to rescue it, has been hit by the global financial crisis. Reports from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the traders and city are preparing for the parent company to be declared insolvent, leaving customers to recover their monies through a financial compensation scheme being backed by the Icelandic Government. The plan will cover the first € 20,887 (Approx £16,300 / $28,720), the remainder of the customers funds being recovered through the UK's own financial compensation system.

Following the decision to nationalise Landsbanki, the Icelandic Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AGeir%20Haarde"&gt;Geir Haarde&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced and signed the emergency legislation into law, stated:

In describing and explaining its actions in nationalising the bank, the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority issued this brief statement: 

In response to the deepening world financial situation, the Dutch government has this afternoon increased its savers protection from €38,000 to €80,000 effective immediately, to help secure the financial status of its savers within Holland. Icesave also has a Dutch branch, icesave.nl - their website was unreachable at the time of this article.

Stock markets around the world continued to fall dramatically today. This is following the &lt;a href="w%3AEconomic%20crisis%20of%202008"&gt;ongoing events in the financial world&lt;/a&gt;, including the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Government"&gt;US Government's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATroubled%20Assets%20Relief%20Program"&gt;700 billion bail out of the financial sector&lt;/a&gt;.

As of 18:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, the primary UK index, the &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100"&gt;FTSE 100&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the few indexes to increase in value. It went up by 0.16% (16.03 points), but stayed below 5000 mark at 4605.22. Some shares in this index, however, fared very poorly, with shares in &lt;a href="w%3AHBOS"&gt;HBOS&lt;/a&gt; falling by an incredible 41.54% to end the day on 94 points. 

The Dow Jones index continued to fall today, and, as of 18:00 UTC, it had fallen 260.77 points, or 2.62% to 9694.73, continuing its run below 10,000. &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20America"&gt;Bank of America&lt;/a&gt; fared worse, with a fall of 17.38%.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANasdaq"&gt;Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt; index also fell dramatically today, down 2.95% (54.97 points) to 1807.99 points. YRC Worldwide, Inc. was the biggest faller in this index, with its loss of 27.30% that took the company's share price down to 5.13.

Dana Perino, a spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;, commented today on the recent falls in the stock market that are described above. "One of the things that the President can do is to remind them what this rescue package would do. One of the most important things that it would do is to make sure that everybody knows that their bank deposit is safe, insured by the FDIC, and the legislation allowed for a temporary increase from $100,000 to $250,000. This reassures people that their bank accounts are safe, and that's an important message," she stated, trying to reassure citizens.

"But remember, with this rescue package, we asked the American people to do a really big thing and commit a lot of money in order to help prevent the credit freeze from affecting everybody lower on down the food chain. And to that extent, yes, the President thinks that it's important that they hear from the President of the United States about how he understands that nobody wanted to do this legislation, however, it was the right thing to do. And now that we've done it, the most important thing is that Treasury move in the most expeditious way possible, to be efficient and to be effective, to make sure that the plan will do what it's supposed to do and un-freeze these credit markets."

Heffermehl compares the works of all the Peace Prize Laureates to date with his interpretation of the intentions and will of the prize's founder.

In the book, the author asserts that &lt;a href="w%3AStortinget"&gt;Stortinget&lt;/a&gt; (the Norwegian Parliament), has in effect broken Norwegian and Swedish law by failing to follow the intentions of Nobel's will. It is the Norwegian parliament which selects the five members of the committee which decide on the recipients of the Peace Prize. 

Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist and industrialist that built a fortune on dynamite after having invented it and patented the process. Alfred Nobel spent many years finalising his will, and had close contact with &lt;a href="w%3ABertha%20von%20Suttner"&gt;Bertha von Suttner&lt;/a&gt;, an upper-class peace activist, during parts of the process. While Swedish institutions were trusted with the choosing of recipients of prizes for chemistry, physics, medicine and literature, Nobel decided that a Norwegian institution should choose the recipient of the price for peace. 
Heffermehl claims that the reason was the anti-militaristic stance of leading forces in the Norwegian parliament. One year prior to his death, Nobel finalised his will in 1895. 

The relevant portion of the will, stating the criteria for what has later become known as the ♡❤Nobel Peace Prize♡❤ is :

&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

According to Heffermehl, prior to World War II about 85% of recipients were awarded in accordance with the will, but since the end of the war only 45% of the recipients fit the criteria. Recent recipients Al Gore and the UN's &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; do not suit the requirements, according to the author. Neither do &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad%20Yunus"&gt;Muhammad Yunus&lt;/a&gt; and his Grameen Bank, nor &lt;a href="w%3AWangari%20Maathai"&gt;Wangari Maathai&lt;/a&gt;. 

"Disarmament and anti-militarism was what Nobel wanted to promote," says Heffermehl to Aftenposten.
Geir Lundestad, Director of the &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Institute"&gt;Nobel Institute&lt;/a&gt; and secretary of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorwegian%20Nobel%20Committee"&gt;Norwegian Nobel Committee&lt;/a&gt; has said he does not wish to enter into a debate with Heffermehl due to potential political and legal actions from Heffermehl.

Heffermehl denies having any plans for political or legal action: In Aftenposten he is quoted as saying to the newsagency NTB : "I have no idea what Lundestad is thinking of. I have no plans about taking action, legal or political, against the Committee. This is not an attack, but an exhortation to look at a number of questions".

Critical disputes and protests of Nobel Prize awards, especially of the Peace prize, are as predictable as the prize itself. Of particular note has been that &lt;a href="w%3AMohandas%20Karamchand%20Gandhi"&gt;Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; never received the prize, but the committee tacitly admitted this error when in 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, they elected to not award the Peace Prize saying "there was no suitable living candidate", referring to an interpretation of Nobel's will, to the effect that the prizes be awarded to living persons. It should be noted, however, that &lt;a href="w%3ADag%20Hammarskj%C3%B6ld"&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld&lt;/a&gt; was given the award shortly after his death in 1961, having died in (peacemaking) action as it were. 

The Danish newspaper "Information" has received further comments from the chairman of the Nobel Committee, Ole Danbolt Mjøs. His reply is in three parts: Firstly, the Committee has interpreted the three items in the portion of the will describing the scope of the price as three separate items, and they are confident that they can be interpreted separate from each other, each as a sufficient criteria for the prize. Heffermehl contends that they should primarily be seen as an integral whole. Secondly, the committee chairman points to the tradition that has evolved. Lastly he also says that deliberate re-interpretations and widening of the criteria for the prize has taken place during the latter years, in view of a modern understanding of the underpinnings of peace.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, the current hot-spot for describing new &lt;a href="w%3Afrog"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt; species, may be in danger of seeing population declines due to an epidemic. A recent scientific paper has found the mysterious fungal disease, &lt;a href="w%3Achytridiomycosis"&gt;chytridiomycosis&lt;/a&gt;, has begun to establish into eastward &lt;a href="w%3APanama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt;, heading across the Panama Canal boundary towards Colombian &lt;a href="w%3Aamphibian"&gt;amphibian&lt;/a&gt; populations. The publication predicts that at the current rate, the fungus will spread into Tortí (&lt;a href="w%3APanama%20Province"&gt;Panamá Province&lt;/a&gt;) before 2012. The chytrid fungus is believed to be the leading cause of population mortality of amphibians. Species like the &lt;a href="w%3AColostethus%20panamensis"&gt;common rocket frog&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Colostethus panamensis♡❤) are succumbing to the effects of the pathogen at an alarming rate. For the last 30 years, the infection has decimated amphibian communities, mostly because of increased temperatures resulting from &lt;a href="w%3Aclimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;.

The culprit skin fungus, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABatrachochytrium%20dendrobatidis"&gt;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, is still not fully understood. It can be transmitted by touch, including contact with other amphibians and even rocks and water. Not only has it decimated frogs, salamanders and caecilians in the Americas, but has affected tropical Australia and Asia as well. Scientists think that the fungus may have come from an African &lt;a href="w%3AXenopus"&gt;clawed frog&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Xenopus sp.♡❤), because of its worldwide popularity in the pet trade.

Captive breeding programs, like &lt;a href="w%3AAmphibian%20Ark"&gt;Amphibian Ark&lt;/a&gt; are preparing for the worst. There are still many species in the jungles of Central and South America that have not been properly documented, and could be fated to be studied after extinction.

They believe the programme, which will create a massive database for storing the information and installs thousands of probes, is necessary to fight threats to national security. One of the reasons cited for creating the database is to keep links between terrorists intact before they are wiped from systems, which often hold any needed information only temporarily.

Under the UK's current law a warrant is required to intercept communications, but that will change with the implementation of the new database.

Critics like &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Parker"&gt;Michael Parker&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-ID card activist, have called the proposal 'sinister', and accused the UK government of 'stalking' British citizens. "If an individual carried out this sort of snooping," Parker said, "it would be a crime".

But other critics like &lt;a href="w%3ADominic%20Grieve"&gt;Dominic Grieve&lt;/a&gt;, Shadow Home Secretary, have a different concern. The government has a record of leaking sensitive information, making such a database insecure&amp;mdash;which could be dangerous in the wrong hands. "Seeing how significant an increase in power this would be, we need to have a national debate and the Government would have to justify its need," he finished.

A public debate is being considered after the request of the UK's Information Commissioner, who has warned that the programme would be unacceptable to most of the UK's citizens.

Details will be given in the Queen's speech next month.

A passenger plane carrying tourists, has crash-landed at an airport near &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Everest"&gt;Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt; killing 18 of the 19 people on board. Of those killed were 12 &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; and two Nepalese tourists. The remaining three were the plane's crew who were of Nepalese decent. The only survivor was the pilot-in-command.

The twin engine &lt;a href="w%3Ade%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-6%20Twin%20Otter"&gt;DeHavilland DHC-6 Twin Otter&lt;/a&gt; plane, operated by &lt;a href="w%3AYeti%20Airlines"&gt;Yeti Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, was flying in &lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; from the nation's capital of &lt;a href="w%3AKathmandu"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ALukla"&gt;Lukla&lt;/a&gt;. It was landing at the &lt;a href="w%3ALukla%20Airport"&gt;Lukla Airport&lt;/a&gt; when its wheels got caught on a fence at the end of the runway, causing it to hit the runway and burst into flames. Firefighters fought for nearly two hours before bringing the fire under control.

Officials blame the crash on heavy fog and bad weather. Reports state that visibility was only 1,310 feet (400 meters), which was considered to be just enough for the plane to land.

"According to initial reports we have it crashed before it was to land and caught fire. The accident was probably caused by a last minute change in the weather," said Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal chief, Yagya Prasad Gautam.

There was at least one accident at the airport in 2005 when nine people survived a crash, only suffering minor injures. That plane was operated by Gorkha Airlines.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; deployed the 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team to a new role on United States soil last Wednesday, training for dealing with national crises. Critics claim that act of the Executive Branch violates the &lt;a href="w%3APosse%20Comitatus%20Act"&gt;Posse Comitatus Act&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits military participation in domestic matters.

In 2007, the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Defense%20Authorization%20Act"&gt;John Warner National Defense Authorization Act&lt;/a&gt; was introduced; it overturned the Posse Comitatus Act by allowing the Commander in Chief to suppress 'insurrection' and 'restore order'. When it was repealed in 2008, Bush stated that he did not respect the later repeal.

The combat team, renamed CCMRF (C-hemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosive C-onsequence M-anagement R-esponse F-orces), has been assigned for year-long duty and training at Fort Stewart to prepare them for "civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios" such as security or natural disasters. After a year, a new unit will take its place.

CCMRF will be under the control of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Northern%20Command"&gt;Northern Command&lt;/a&gt; (NORTHCOM), and now has the same legal authority as a unit deployed to Iraq under the direct control of the Executive Branch. The unit will have use of engineer and medical units, the Marine Corps Chemical, Biological Initial Reaction Force, and a Navy weather team, as well as members of the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. A spokeswoman for NORTHCOM added that both wheeled and tank vehicles would be available for the CCMRF. 

In July the unit was assigned a new commander, Col. Roger Cloutier. "If we go in," he said proudly of the deployment, "we’re going in to help American citizens on American soil". CCMRF will be training in both traffic and riot control equipment, and will be the first to use the Army's new nonlethal package, which is intended for war-zone and not domestic use. 

NORTHCOM's September 30th statement includes a quote attributed to "future operations division chief" Colonel Michael Boatner saying, “This response force will not be called upon to help with law enforcement, civil disturbance or crowd control, but will be used to support lead agencies involved in saving lives, relieving suffering and meeting the needs of communities affected by weapons of mass destruction attacks, accidents or even natural disasters.” 
The action has raised concerns for some citizens like journalist &lt;a href="w%3ANaomi%20Wolf"&gt;Naomi Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, an author critical of the Bush administration, who referred to the deployment as a 'coup' in a well-circulated viral video and issued Americans a call to action.
NORTHCOM is a joint command established post-9/11 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities. When Hurricane Katrina damaged Mississippi and Louisiana, several active-duty units were pulled from various posts and mobilized to those areas, but were not assigned to NORTHCOM, but instead individual commands under provisional authorities. 

Military officials have not yet responded to a request for comment.

More than forty passengers have been hospitalised, fourteen of whom are seriously injured, after an &lt;a href="Airbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A330"&gt;A330-300&lt;/a&gt; owned and operated by &lt;a href="w%3AQantas"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt; suddenly departed level flight, hurling people into the airliner's ceiling.

The flight between &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; was cruising at 37,000 feet when a cockpit alert was triggered warning the flight crew of a possible malfunction with the aircraft's &lt;a href="w%3Aelevator%20%28aircraft%29"&gt;elevator&lt;/a&gt;, which controls pitch.

The aircraft then performed an uncommanded climb of 300 feet, before nosing down hard and falling an undetermined distance believed to be several thousand feet. During this descent, many of the 303 passengers and 10 crew were thrown against the ceiling, injuring many of them. The flight crew declared '&lt;a href="w%3Apan-pan"&gt;pan-pan&lt;/a&gt;', one level below a full life-threatening emergency, and performed an &lt;a href="w%3Aemergency%20landing"&gt;emergency landing&lt;/a&gt; at an air base at &lt;a href="w%3ALearmonth"&gt;Learmonth&lt;/a&gt; after informing &lt;a href="w%3Aair%20traffic%20control"&gt;air traffic control&lt;/a&gt; of flight control difficulties and injured passengers.

The injured people were flown to hospital by &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Flying%20Doctor%20Service"&gt;Royal Flying Doctor Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASkywest%20Airlines"&gt;Skywest Airlines&lt;/a&gt;. The most seriously injured were suffering from broken bones and three people had concussions.

An investigation has been launched. Although such events are often blamed on &lt;a href="w%3Aturbulence"&gt;turbulence&lt;/a&gt;, it has been suggested by industry experts that the circumstances of the accident are more in keeping with a computer malfunction. The A330 is a &lt;a href="w%3Afly-by-wire"&gt;fly-by-wire&lt;/a&gt; aircraft.

&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt; - The very first newscaster to ever appear on Sky News in the UK, and one of their primary anchors for almost 14 years, &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Friend%20%28newscaster%29"&gt;Bob Friend&lt;/a&gt;, has died at the age of 70.

Bob joined &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt; back in 1989 from the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, where he had been based for over 20 years and was a major face on the channel. He anchored their primetime evening news slots at 7 and 10pm, in partnership with his co-anchor &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Botting"&gt;Anna Botting&lt;/a&gt;.

He retired from Sky News through ill health, his last broadcast being in 2003. Bob's death from a malignant &lt;a href="w%3ABrain%20tumour"&gt;brain tumour&lt;/a&gt; was announced this morning on Sky News' website. 

Leading the tributes, &lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;, president of News Corporation and British Sky Broadcasting, owners of Sky News, said Bob was:

&lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; writer &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Marie%20Gustave%20Le%20Cl%C3%A9zio"&gt;Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio&lt;/a&gt; has been awarded by the &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Academy"&gt;Swedish Academy&lt;/a&gt; with the 2008 &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature"&gt;Nobel Prize in Literature&lt;/a&gt;. Le Clézio thus wins the prestigious prize of 10 million &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20krona"&gt;Swedish krona&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1.4 million), for being "an author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, an explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilisation," according to the Academy.

His first book, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Proc%C3%A8s-verbal"&gt;Le Procès-verbal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, was published in 1963, when the novelist was 23 years old. Now, aged 68, he receives the Nobel Prize in Literature being recognised as a key figure of French literature.

"As a young writer in the aftermath of existentialism and the nouveau Roman, he was a conjurer who tried to lift words above the degenerate state of everyday speech and to restore to them the power to invoke an essential reality," the Academy wrote in its communiqué. "The emphasis in Le Clezio's work has increasingly moved in the direction of an exploration of the world of childhood and of his own family history."

The writer, now a juror of the &lt;a href="w%3APrix%20Renaudot"&gt;Prix Renaudot&lt;/a&gt;, wrote pieces such as ♡❤La Fièvre♡❤, ♡❤L'Extase matérielle♡❤, ♡❤Terra amata♡❤, ♡❤Le Livre des fuites♡❤, ♡❤La Guerre♡❤, ♡❤Désert♡❤ and ♡❤Le Chercheur d'or♡❤.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AM6%20motorway"&gt;M6 motorway&lt;/a&gt; was closed for several hours earlier due to a woman in a "distressed state" who was standing on the bridge above the road. The road reopened after police convinced the woman to come down at 1725 BST.

The motorway was closed just south of junction 15 as a result of the incident. The woman is now being examined by paramedics and taken to hospital.

The nearby &lt;a href="w%3AA519%20road"&gt;A519 road&lt;/a&gt;, which is smaller than the M6, was also closed as a result of the incident.

As of 18:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, the road remained heavily congested in both directions. The severe congestions was in junctions 14 to 17 southbound and junctions 13 to 15 northbound.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHighways%20Agency"&gt;Highways Agency&lt;/a&gt; advised motorists to avoid the above roads until 1930 local time today (1830 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). That time has now passed.

The head of the &lt;a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt; (IMF) says the world is on the brink of a global recession but predicts the economy will begin to recover by late 2009.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20Strauss-Kahn"&gt;Dominique Strauss-Kahn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Managing Director of the IMF, stressed nations must work together to avert a global recession and warns there is "no domestic solution" to the crisis. He also said this week's coordinated interest rate cuts around the world are a good example of the international cooperation needed to restore faltering economies.

Furthermore, he announced the IMF has activated an emergency program Wednesday that allows the fund to provide loans more easily and quickly to emerging countries in economic trouble. This program was first used during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A1997%20Asian%20Financial%20Crisis"&gt;1997 Asian crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The program might be used in &lt;a href="Iceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, which has seen major problems hitting the financial sector. Iceland has been forced to nationalize the three largest banks and, most recently, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKaupthing%20Bank"&gt;Kaupthing Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The IMF chief made these remarks in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Thursday, as top officials from IMF nations and the G-7 industrialized countries are gathering for meetings on economic issues. &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is set to meet with G-7 finance ministers at the White House on Saturday.

When 24-year-old Andrew Vactor of &lt;a href="w%3AUrbana%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Urbana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; was convicted of violating the city's noise ordinance, Judge Susan J. Fornof-Lippencott offered to reduce the normal fine of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;150 to $35 if he agreed to listen to 20 hours of classical music. Fifteen minutes into the sentence the rap music fan changed his mind and paid the full fine in order to end his probation.

The sentence would have included selections from &lt;a href="w%3ALudwig%20van%20Beethoven"&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin"&gt;Frédéric Chopin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohann%20Sebastian%20Bach"&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AClaude%20Debussy"&gt;Claude Debussy&lt;/a&gt;. Chief Probation Officer Glenda Runkle says the department keeps three CDs for this type of sentence. 

&lt;a href="w%3AChampaign%20County%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Champaign County&lt;/a&gt; Municipal Court Judge Fornof-Lippencott told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASpringfield%20News-Sun"&gt;Springfield News-Sun&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ she often assigns creative sentencing options. "I think a lot of people don't like to be forced to listen to music. And I think sometimes the defendants ... are put in the position the general public is put in." She also selects episodes of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADr.%20Phil%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20Show"&gt;The Oprah Winfrey Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that she considers relevant to other misdemeanor offenses and supplies copies to the probation department. "The idea, hopefully, is that it will inspire people not to come back for the same violation. It offers an opportunity for them to cut down on their fines and costs and at the same time broaden their horizons."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Markets%20down%20across%20the%20world%3B%20Dow%20Jones%20falls%20below%209%2C000&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Stock markets across the world fell dramatically this week on worries that recent government moves might not prevent a global recession. The largest drop was with the &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones"&gt;Dow Jones&lt;/a&gt; (DJIA), which fell 678 points or more than 7.3% to below 9,000, closing at 8,579.19. The index fell over 2,000 points in the past nine days to reach its lowest level since 2003. The &lt;a href="w%3AS%26amp%3BP%20500"&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt; was down more than 7%.

The U.S. markets opened on the positive side, but with bad news coming from several different areas such as uncertainty over whether the 700 billion &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollars"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt; bank bailout bill passed by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; will be effective. Concerns over the lack of trading within the credit market was a primary cause of the drop.

This was the seventh straight day of markets closing in severely negative numbers.
One of the biggest stocks to drop was &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, which lost more than 33% of its value.

In the UK, the &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100"&gt;FTSE 100&lt;/a&gt; dropped from a day high of 145 points to 52.9 points lower, at a 4 year low. The biggest drop was &lt;a href="w%3ABarclays"&gt;Barclays&lt;/a&gt;, which dropped 13.1%.

The only major world indexes that gained any value were the &lt;a href="w%3AHang%20Sang"&gt;Hang Seng&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, which closed up 511.51 points or 3.31%, and the Russian &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Trading%20System"&gt;RTS&lt;/a&gt;, which partly recovered from yesterday's fall with a 10.91% increase.

"Markets are still sceptic with regards to the international coordination to face the problems of the financial system," explained &lt;a href="w%3ABarclays%20Capital"&gt;Barclays Capital&lt;/a&gt; economists, and they predicted stocks would continue to be volatile.

Investors are awaiting the outcome of several meetings that will be held this weekend. Finance ministers from the G7 will be gathering in Washington, and the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will be holding their autumn meetings.

<h3>Emergency rescues</h3>

In response to the financial tsunami, the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Central%20Bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt; (ECB) opened an unlimited emergency credit line on Thursday to stimulate liquidity in the institutions that are facing bankruptcy. Through six-day credits, the ECB plans to financially aid the 15 countries which are part of the Eurozone. Furthermore, it injected $100 billion dollars into the market, duplicating the figure it had originally offered.

&lt;a href="Iceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; nationalized &lt;a href="w%3AKaupthing"&gt;Kaupthing Bank&lt;/a&gt;, the most important bank in the country. The Nordic state &amp;ndash; whose economy is highly dependent on the banking system &amp;ndash; is having great financial problems after the government nationalized the three most important banks, and could face bankruptcy.

Central banks in &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; also decided to intervene in the market to stop the rapid devaluation of their currencies, fearing a capital flight out.

Germany's Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; did not rule out nationalizing banks.

&lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Cowboys"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acornerback"&gt;cornerback&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Jones%20%28American%20football%29"&gt;Adam "Pacman" Jones&lt;/a&gt; was not available to speak with reporters Thursday after a Tuesday night incident involving Jones and a bodyguard in a hotel bathroom in the south-Central American city of &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Officials are calling the incident private and said charges are not likely to be filed. As of Thursday, the Cowboys have not disciplined Jones.

Police were notified by hotel staff after workers heard a disturbance in the hotel lobby men's bathroom where Jones and his bodyguard arguing. Jones and his bodyguard told police everything was fine and were driven away by a friend. 

Cowboys owner &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Jones"&gt;Jerry Jones&lt;/a&gt; spoke with members of the media on Thursday, saying that he was "very disappointed in that we're having to deal with this," saying that the altercation was not a big deal.

"They were literally kidding each other," Jerry Jones told the Associated Press on Thursday. "They were jiving around ... and all of a sudden one of them starting saying some things, and here you go."

Cowboys nose tackle &lt;a href="w%3ATank%20Johnson"&gt;Tank Johnson&lt;/a&gt; said everything was overblown and shouldn't distract the team.

"This is not that big of a deal," Johnson told the Associated Press. "Nobody's in jail, nobody's in trouble, nobody's hurt. We're all here ready to practice, ready to work."

&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt; Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Goodell"&gt;Roger Goodell&lt;/a&gt; told ESPN radio that he was frustrated that the league was even discussing the incident involving Jones and his bodyguard. Goodell also said the NFL league is investigating the matter. 

Jones has already been in police trouble in connection with a shooting at a &lt;a href="Las%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; strip club and other incidents which have led to his arrest six times since he was drafted in 2005 by the Tennessee Titans. Jones was suspended in April 2007 by Goodell and allowed to return to play in August.

Jones said this after his reinstatement: "I know my responsibilities to the NFL and I'm going to hold my own and do what I need to do to make sure I stay where I am right now, which is reinstated. I work hard every day to make sure I don't make the same mistakes. Can I say I would never ever make the same mistakes? No, I can't say that. I'll make sure I put myself in way better situations than I have put myself in the past."

The Dallas Cowboys are a professional &lt;a href="American%20football"&gt;American football&lt;/a&gt; team in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20Conference%20East%20Division"&gt;Eastern Division&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20Conference"&gt;National Football Conference&lt;/a&gt; (NFC) in the NFL. They are based in the Dallas suburb of &lt;a href="w%3AIrving%2C%20Texas"&gt;Irving&lt;/a&gt;.

The Nobel Peace Committee announced that &lt;a href="w%3AMartti%20Ahtisaari"&gt;Martti Ahtisaari&lt;/a&gt;, former president and &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; diplomat, has received the &lt;a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; for 2008. 

Norway's Nobel committee praised Martti Ahtisaari for his efforts to help secure peace in a number of conflict torn countries during his lengthy career as a &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; diplomat, Finnish president and later, peace activist with his organization, the &lt;a href="w%3ACrisis%20Management%20Initiative"&gt;Crisis Management Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.

Over the past 20 years, the Nobel statement said, Ahtisaari has played a prominent role in resolving serious and long-lasting conflicts in &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kosovo"&gt;Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; - among other areas.

In an interview on &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; television, Ahtisaari cited peace talks in 1989-1990 in the southwestern African nation of Namibia as his greatest achievement. Those talks helped pave the way for Namibia's independence from &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.

Ahtisaari began his career as a school teacher before joining Finland's foreign ministry. He served as a United Nations undersecretary and secretary of state for the Finnish foreign ministry before being elected president of Finland in 1994.

Ahtisaari founded the &lt;a href="w%3ACrisis%20Management%20Initiative"&gt;Crisis Management Initiative&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. The &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;-based non-profit organization provides solutions for ending conflicts around the world.

Former &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Vice-President &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Gore"&gt;Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; won last year's Nobel peace prize along with the U.N. panel on &lt;a href="climate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; for their work on raising attention to the threat of global warming. 

Prior to the announcement &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; human rights activists were high on the lists of speculations about the prospective receivers. Norwegian lawyer, author and activist, &lt;a href="w%3AFredrik%20Heffermehl"&gt;Fredrik Heffermehl&lt;/a&gt; published a book criticising the interpretation of the will of Nobel, just a few days prior to October 10. His interpretation is that human rights activists do not fall within the scope of the prize. Even peace mediators fall on the very edge, if the intentions of Alfred Nobel are to be taken seriously. Heffermehl points to former &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Nunn"&gt;Sam Nunn&lt;/a&gt; as a long-term and 2008 nominee to the Nobel Peace Prize, that has worked much more clearly in line with the will of Nobel. Sam Nunn is an activist for disarmament of Soviets arsenals left in &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.

Some commentators of the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize, criticise the Committee, for not daring to stand up to the Chinese. The &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; peace researcher Øberg, however criticises the choice of Ahtisaari, the recipient of the prize for 2008, because of his role in the Balkans, claiming that the work of Ahtisaari added to hostilities there, instead of reducing them. Furthermore Øberg, says the Nobel Peace Committee is not comprised of experts in the relevant field, unlike the committees for the scientific prizes.

In an attempt to speak with as many candidates as possible during the 2008 Canadian federal election, Wikinews has talked via email with &lt;a href="w%3AAnne%20Lagac%C3%A9%20Dowson"&gt;Anne Lagacé Dowson&lt;/a&gt;. Dowson is a candidate in &lt;a href="Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWestmount%E2%80%94Ville-Marie"&gt;Westmount—Ville-Marie riding&lt;/a&gt;, running under the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (NDP) banner.

There is no incumbent in Dowson's riding, as the area's &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; MP resigned earlier this year. A by-election was scheduled, but cancelled at the last minute, once Prime Minister &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; called a national election. Candidates in the riding are Dowson (NDP), former astronaut Marc Garneau (Liberal), Charles Larivée (&lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt;), Guy Dufort (&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;), and co-deputy party leader for the Greens Claude William Genest. Judith Vienneau of the joke party Neorhino.ca is also on the ballot.

The riding includes the City of Westmount, parts of Old Montreal, the Borough of Ville-Marie, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, and The Plateau.

The following is an interview with Ms. Dowson, conducted via email. The interview is published unedited, as sent to Wikinews.

♡❤♡Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your 
previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?♡❤♡
for those concerns in Ottawa.

♡❤♡As you campaign around your riding, it's likely that some issues are mentioned more often by voters, than other issues. What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding? What would you and your party do to address these issues?♡❤♡

♡❤♡There are more ways than ever to get your message out, from the traditional campaign fliers and lawn signs, to new media like websites, Facebook, and YouTube.

Also running in the Toronto riding are Liberal Rob Oliphant, Conservative John Carmichael, Green Georgina Wilcock, and Communist Catherine Holliday.

In an attempt to speak with as many candidates as possible during the 2008 Canadian federal election, Wikinews has talked via email with &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20R.%20Heather"&gt;Larry R. Heather&lt;/a&gt;. Heather is a candidate in &lt;a href="Alberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary%20Southwest"&gt;Calgary Southwest riding&lt;/a&gt;, running under the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Heritage%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Christian Heritage Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; (CHP) banner. The CHP is a minor, registered political party running a significant number of candidates across the country, looking to earn its first ever seat in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;.

Best known as an anti-abortion activist, this shipper-receiver holds a Bachelor of Religious Education from Saskatchewan's &lt;a href="w%3ABriercrest%20College%20and%20Seminary"&gt;Briercrest College and Seminary&lt;/a&gt;, and a BA in religion from Calgary's &lt;a href="w%3ARocky%20Mountain%20College"&gt;Rocky Mountain College&lt;/a&gt;. He hosts the ♡❤Gospel Road♡❤ program on AM1140 in High River, and is remembered by many for his ketchup-soaked run-in with abortion law activist &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Morgentaler"&gt;Henry Morgentaler&lt;/a&gt;.

He has run in the federal election of 1984 (Calgary South, ind.), 1988 (Calgary Southwest, ind), 1993 (Calgary West, CHP), 1997 (Calgary Southwest, CHP), 2004 (Calgary Southwest, CHP), and 2006 (Calgary Southwest, CHP), provincial elections of 1986 (Calgary Glenmore, ind), 1989 (Calgary Elbow, ind), and 2004 (Calgary Glenmore, Alberta Social Credit), and for various public school board ridings in 1989 and 1992. He has run against some big names, including Ralph Klein (1989), Preston Manning (1997), and Stephen Harper (1993, 2004, 2006). His 2006 campaign featured controversial and graphic images, to illustrate his pro-life and anti-same sex marriage messages.

His major opponent in the riding is economist and lecturer &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;, who just so happens to be the current Prime Minister. Harper previously represented Calgary West. Other names on the ballot include Liberal Marlene Lamontagne, New Democrat &lt;a href="w%3A/Holly_Heffernan%23Holly_Heffernan_.28Calgary_Southwest.29"&gt;Holly Heffernan&lt;/a&gt;, Libertarian Dennis Young, and Green Party candidate Kelly Christie. The riding is any part of Calgary that is west of the Canadian Pacific rail line, and south of the Glenway Trail.

The following is an interview with Heather, conducted via email. The interview has had very limited editing, to eliminate in-text mentions of website addresses, but is otherwise left exactly as sent to Wikinews.

&lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; foreign minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Kouchner"&gt;Bernard Kouchner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has claimed that &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; has failed to honour obligations agreed as part of a ceasefire brokered by the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The deal ended a war with &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28country%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt;.

In August, Russian troops joined on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Ossetia"&gt;South Ossetia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's side after Georgia moved in in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway region. Russia also moved troops into &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbkhazia"&gt;Abkhazia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and nearby areas to create security zones. These buffer zones were vacated by troops this week, and today Russia was due to completely withdrawal from Georgia.

France - who lead the brokering efforts as the EU's current presidential nation - say that Russian troops remain in the South Ossetian towns of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAkhalgori"&gt;Akhalgori&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APerevi"&gt;Perevi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to the ceasefire, troops were supposed to return to their positions before the five-day conflict. However, Kouchner's phrasing was optimistic as he spoke to reporters today.

When asked if Russia had withdrawn, he said "I think so, but partly. This is not complete. This is not perfect. It's just the beginning. This is not the end," and that "Not everything has been achieved... That's why we'll continue talks in Geneva."

However, Russia's President, &lt;a href="Dmitry%20Medvedev"&gt;Dmitry Medvedev&lt;/a&gt;, says Russia has fully complied with the terms agreed on. "We have met all the obligations we accepted in the first document, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMedvedev-Sarkozy%20plan"&gt;Medvedev-Sarkozy plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the second document, which was agreed on not long ago in Moscow," he told reporters. Russia has recognized South Ossetia as an independent nation, and had entered into a supporting military alliance.

In an attempt to speak with as many candidates as possible during the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Canadian%20federal%20election"&gt;2008 Canadian federal election&lt;/a&gt;, Wikinews has talked via email with Stefan Jetchick, who is a candidate in &lt;a href="Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALouis-H%C3%A9bert%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Louis-Hébert riding&lt;/a&gt;, running under the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Heritage%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Christian Heritage Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; (CHP) banner. The CHP is a minor, registered political party running a significant number of candidates across the country, looking to earn its first ever seat in the House of Commons. Jetchick is their only candidate running in the province.

The Quebec riding of Louis-Hébert, in the Capitale-Nationale region, has existed in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; since 2004. It includes the west section of Quebec City, primarily Sainte-Foy—Sillery and Laurentien's south end. The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; incumbent in the riding is &lt;a href="w%3ALuc%20Harvey"&gt;Luc Harvey&lt;/a&gt;; also running are Pascal-Pierre Paillé (&lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt;), Denis Blanchette (&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;), Jean Beaupré (&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;), and Michelle Fontaine (&lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;).

The following is an interview with Mr. Jetchick, conducted via email. The interview is published unedited, as sent to Wikinews; this includes Mr. Jetchick's separation of multipart questions into fragments, and his formatting relating to his applicable experience.

<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Why are you running for political office?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Why at the federal level?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Why this party?♡❤♡

♡❤♡And why in this riding?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved?♡❤♡

♡❤♡How will you apply your previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?♡❤♡

♡❤♡As you campaign around your riding, it's likely that some issues are mentioned more often by voters, than other issues. What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding?♡❤♡
Actually, I prefer forechecking to backchecking, so I'm trying to control the agenda in my riding. Hence &lt;a href="http%3A//www.chp-louishebert.ca/en/varia/defi.htm"&gt;my Challenge issued to all candidates&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤♡What would you and your party do to address these issues?♡❤♡
♡❤♡Are there any misconceptions about you, your leader, or your party and platform?♡❤♡

♡❤♡There are more ways than ever to get your message out, from the traditional campaign fliers and lawn signs, to new media like websites, Facebook, and YouTube. The tried-and-true routes get the message out to the masses much easier, but digital alternatives are much more measurable in how many are seeing or interacting with your campaign. What seems to be the most effective, from your experience?♡❤♡

In Wikinews' attempt to speak with as many candidates as possible during the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20election%2C%202008"&gt;2008 Canadian federal election&lt;/a&gt;, Wikinews has talked via email with Jo-Anne Boulding. Jo-Anne is a candidate in &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;'s Parry Sound—Muskoka &lt;a href="w%3Ariding%20%28country_subdivision%29%23Canada"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt;, running under the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; (NDP) banner.

The riding's &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; incumbent is &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Clement"&gt;Tony Clement&lt;/a&gt;, Minister of Health and Minister for &lt;a href="w%3AFedNor"&gt;FedNor&lt;/a&gt;. Other candidates in the riding are &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; Jamie McGarvey, &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green&lt;/a&gt; Glen Hodgson, and independent David Rowland.

The following is an interview with Ms. Boulding, conducted via email, over a week ago.

She did not respond to two of the main questions: “Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?” and “What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding? What would you and your party do to address these issues?” Being unanswered, these questions were edited out of the interview, which otherwise is published as received.

The following is an interview with Arbour, conducted via email. The interview has had very limited editing, to eliminate in-text mentions of website addresses, but is otherwise left exactly as sent to Wikinews.

Gunn is a candidate in &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AYork%E2%80%94Simcoe"&gt;York—Simcoe riding&lt;/a&gt;, running under the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Heritage%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Christian Heritage Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; (CHP) banner. The CHP is a minor, registered political party running a significant number of candidates across the country, looking to earn its first ever seat in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;.

The riding has existed from 1968 to 1979, from 1988 to 1997, and from 2004 to present. As of the next provincial election in Ontario, it will be recognised as a provincial electoral district as well. Over the years, the riding has been represented by the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Progressive Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, again by the Progressive Conservatives, again by the Liberals, and since its recreation, the seat has been held by the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Van%20Loan"&gt;Peter Van Loan&lt;/a&gt;, the Conservative incumbent, is the Minister Responsible for Democratic Reform and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons. The other candidates in the riding, besides Van Loan and the CHP's Gunn, are &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democrat&lt;/a&gt; Sylvia Gerl, Liberal Judith Moses, and the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt;'s John Dewar.

<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Why are you running for political office, why at the federal level, why this party, and why in this riding?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?♡❤♡

♡❤♡As you campaign around your riding, it's likely that some issues are mentioned more often by voters, than other issues. What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding? What would you and your party do to address these issues?♡❤♡
<ol>
BULLET::::1. ♡❤♡Constituents in York Simcoe spend a lot of time travelling to and from work.♡❤♡ Gas prices are high and the other political parties offer no real solutions. We offer a "Fair Tax". This would be a tax on everything except essentials. Gas prices would be lower because there would not be layer upon layer of hidden taxes. We would also eliminate the income tax because it penalises industrious people for working. If 1/3 of your paycheque, what you have earned by your own labour, goes to the government before you see it, that is theft. A consumer tax would be paid when you purchase items or services, which means you control how much tax you pay. It is a much simpler form of book keeping. Our present tax laws are understood by extremely few people.
BULLET::::2. ♡❤♡Important to constituents of York Simcoe is also a healthy environment.♡❤♡ It IS possible to decrease pollution without government digging deeper into OUR pockets. The hype around global warming has cooled. People recognise that a healthy environment can be worked on by dealing with the controllable causes of pollution. We dump many toxic chemicals into our atmosphere not just the naturally occurring ones such as Carbon Dioxide and Water. We can and must start controlling these toxic chemicals. We must do the same for our lakes and environment. Reducing the pollution we can control is environmentally friendly. It may not be as glamourous as a global movement but it is much more effective.
BULLET::::3. ♡❤♡We see a continued deterioration of our infrastructure.♡❤♡ There is no need for government to borrow money from the major banks, basically renting the money supply, to improve infrastructure. The government is entitled to create money. By putting this money is circulation for the purpose of improving our infrastructure and charging municipalities no interest, we are not piling further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren. As the money is repaid it is withdrawn from circulation thus making it noninflationary. This was done after WW2, when the return of 2 million soldiers seeking employment threatened our economy. This launched the biggest building boom in Canadian history and Canada was left with healthy infrastructure.

In an attempt to speak with as many candidates as possible during the 2008 Canadian federal election, Wikinews has talked via email with ♡❤♡John Kittredge♡❤♡. John is a candidate in ♡❤♡Toronto, Ontario's St. Paul riding♡❤♡, running under the ♡❤♡Libertarian Party♡❤♡ banner. Libertarians are a minor, registered political party; they are looking to earn their first ever seat in the House of Commons.

Incumbent Carolyn Bennett of the Liberals is running against Libertarian Kittridge, Conservative Heather Jewell, New Democrat Anita Agrawal, and Justin Erdman, a Green. Bennett was the Minister of Health under previous Prime Minister Paul Martin's Liberal government. Since it was created in 1935, the riding has been batted about between the Liberals and the now defunct Progessive Conservative party.

The following is an interview with Mr. Kittridge, conducted via email. The interview has had very limited editing, to eliminate in-text mentions of website addresses, but is otherwise left exactly as sent to Wikinews.

<h2>Interview</h2>
♡❤♡Why are you running for political office, why at the federal level, why this party, and why in this riding?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?♡❤♡

♡❤♡As you campaign around your riding, it's likely that some issues are mentioned more often by voters, than other issues. What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding? What would you and your party do to address these issues?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Are there any misconceptions about you, your leader, or your party and platform?♡❤♡

In the midst of the intensifying &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20financial%20crisis%20of%20September%E2%80%93October%202008"&gt;global financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;, finance ministers and central bankers of the &lt;a href="w%3AG7"&gt;G7&lt;/a&gt; nations &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; met in Washington, D.C. and released a joint statement. 

With failures of large financial institutions in the United States, the crisis rapidly evolved into a global crisis resulting in bank failures in Europe and the Americas, and sharp reductions in the value of stocks and commodities worldwide. The crisis further lead to a liquidity problem and the de-leveraging of world assets, which further accelerated the problem. The crisis has roots in the &lt;a href="w%3Asubprime%20mortgage%20crisis"&gt;subprime mortgage crisis&lt;/a&gt; and is an acute phase of the &lt;a href="w%3Afinancial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008"&gt;financial crisis of 2007–2008&lt;/a&gt;.

After the meeting, a joint statement was released with a commitment to "stabilize financial markets and restore the flow of credit." The statement outlined five steps to achieve these goals:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Take decisive action and use all available tools to support systemically important financial institutions and prevent their failure.
BULLET::::2. Take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets and ensure that banks and other financial institutions have broad access to liquidity and funding.
BULLET::::3. Ensure that our banks and other major financial intermediaries, as needed, can raise capital from public as well as private sources, in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses.
BULLET::::4. Ensure that our respective national deposit insurance and guarantee programs are robust and consistent so that our retail depositors will continue to have confidence in the safety of their deposits.
BULLET::::5. Take action, where appropriate, to restart the secondary markets for mortgages and other securitized assets. Accurate valuation and transparent disclosure of assets and consistent implementation of high quality accounting standards are necessary.

</ol>
"Central banks from around the world have acted together to provide additional liquidity for financial institutions, taking the necessary steps to support the global economy," said &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;US Secretary of the Treasury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Paulson"&gt;Henry Paulson&lt;/a&gt; in a statement after the meeting.

"We have taken a lot of actions," said &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Central%20Bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Claude%20Trichet"&gt;Jean-Claude Trichet&lt;/a&gt;. "My experience of markets is that it always takes a little time to capture the elements [of the decisions taken]."

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20the%20Bank%20of%20England"&gt;Governor of the Bank of England&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMervyn%20King%20%28economist%29"&gt;Mervyn King&lt;/a&gt; said: "Central banks will work together as we demonstrated this week, to ensure sufficient short term liquidity is provided to stabilise banking systems. But it is also vital that governments work together to ensure their banking systems are recapitalised to enable them to lend to finance spending in the real economy."

<h1>'Troopergate' investigation finds Palin abused her power</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27Troopergate%27%20investigation%20finds%20Palin%20abused%20her%20power&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
An &lt;a href="w%3AAlaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;n legislative investigation, nicknamed '&lt;a href="w%3AAlaska%20Public%20Safety%20Commissioner%20dismissal"&gt;Troopergate&lt;/a&gt;', concluded Friday that Vice Presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3ASarah%20Palin"&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/a&gt; had abused her power during her time as &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Alaska"&gt;Alaskan governor&lt;/a&gt;.

The report, released by a bipartisan investigative committee, found that Palin had violated the state Ethics Act when she allowed her husband to pressure former Commissioner of Public Safety &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Monegan"&gt;Walt Monegan&lt;/a&gt; into firing state trooper Mike Wooten; however, she was well within her rights to fire Monegan because of disagreement on budget cuts.

Sarah Palin had "knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda," the report went on to say. 

&lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20Palin"&gt;Todd Palin&lt;/a&gt;, her husband, admitted to trying to forcefully remove Wooten because of alleged actions such as driving under the influence, threatening Palin's father, and using a Taser gun on his son. The pressure came after a hostile divorce between the governor's sister and ex-husband, who was accused of threatening the family.

The governor's explanations of her reasons for firing Monegan had been inconsistent, from denying a "personality conflict" to insubordination and incompetence. She consistently denied, however, the firing being related to Wooten.
"The Palins make no apologies," a statement released by her campaign said, "for wanting to protect their family and wanting to bring attention to the injustice of a violent trooper keeping his badge and abusing the workers' compensation system".

While the investigative committee had agreed unanimously to release the report, a few Republicans on the panel had attempted to halt the investigation, citing political bias. Republican Senator &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Stevens%20%28Alaska%20politician%29"&gt;Gary Stevens&lt;/a&gt; warned voters to be "cautious" and to "realize there's much more in it than just the one-page findings".

<h1>PAD plan protest for Monday; Thai political crisis ongoing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=PAD%20plan%20protest%20for%20Monday%3B%20Thai%20political%20crisis%20ongoing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Alliance%20for%20Democracy"&gt;People's Alliance for Democracy&lt;/a&gt; (PAD) announced a planned rally this coming Monday at the national stadium and march to police headquarters in protest at action taken against demonstrators last Tuesday. Tuesday's protest, where attempts were made to block MPs access to and from parliament, turned ugly when police employed &lt;a href="w%3Atear%20gas"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt; and other measures to disperse the PAD crowd. Two protesters died, over four hundred were injured, and reports indicate that as many as ten may be missing. The ongoing protests and demonstrations are aimed at toppling the governing &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Power%20Party%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;People's Power Party&lt;/a&gt; (PPP) who are accused of being a proxy for deposed prime minister &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;'s outlawed &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party.
Friday saw the remaining seven PAD protest leaders surrender to police and be issued on bail. Leaders &lt;a href="w%3AChamlong%20Srimuang"&gt;Chamlong Srimuang&lt;/a&gt; and Chaiwat Sinuwong were also bailed, having been arrested and detained earlier. This follows the charges of treason being thrown out by the country's appeals court; lesser charges, including inciting unrest, still stand.

The activist political group, founded by media firebrand &lt;a href="w%3ASondhi%20Limthongkul"&gt;Sondhi Limthongkul&lt;/a&gt; has occupied Government house for some time now, their demands are for a revision of the Thai political landscape which would see professionals and those in the more prosperous parts of the country a bigger say in the government. Outstanding charges of corruption against Thaksin Shinawatra who the military removed from power in September 2007 are the result of Sondhi and the PAD's long-standing battle against what they view as vote-buying populist policies. Questionable land deals and allegations of &lt;a href="w%3Aneoptism"&gt;neoptism&lt;/a&gt; saw an increasing number of people becoming involved in protests prior to the 2007 coup.

The ongoing crisis has impacted the country both domestically and internationally. The deputy prime minister, &lt;a href="w%3AChavalit%20Yongchaiyudh"&gt;Chavalit Yongchaiyudh&lt;/a&gt; resigned on Friday for his part in ordering the police into action against protesters blockading parliament. In an interview with the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;Bangkok Post&lt;/a&gt;, the former general implied the solution - once again - lies with the army, and suggested a second coup may be the only solution to the crisis. Army chief, Anupong Paochinda, faced scorn from the PAD following his dismissal of the call for a second coup; this despite his issuing harsh criticism of the current administration.
On the international front, Thailand's troubles saw the Prime Minister, &lt;a href="Somchai%20Wongsawat"&gt;Somchai Wongsawat&lt;/a&gt;, cancel a number of foreign visits. The beleaguered PM had planned to visit five &lt;a href="w%3AASEAN"&gt;ASEAN&lt;/a&gt; partner countries in a tour that would have started next week. Additional trips to &lt;a href="Laos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Myanmar"&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Burma) were cancelled. According to a member of the PPP this is due to the current unrest.

Adding to the woes of the ruling PPP, the Attorney General's office has asked for a ruling from the country's Constitutional Court outlawing the People's Power Party. Office spokesman, Thanapit Mulpruek, outlined the content of the petition specifying that the key 37 leaders of the PPP should have their voting rights revoked for five years in light of the allegations of election fraud, or knowingly allowing such to continue. The party's former deputy leader was disqualified during the December 2007 general election, being accused of graft. The party's members of parliament are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss this issue and the ongoing political crisis.

A preliminary report has been released into the disastrous crash of &lt;a href="w%3ASpanair%20Flight%205022"&gt;Spanair Flight 5022&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; on August 20, which killed 154. The report confirms an earlier leaked finding that the &lt;a href="w%3AFlap%20%28aircraft%29"&gt;wing flap&lt;/a&gt;s failed and no warning sounded to alert the pilots.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMD-82"&gt;MD-82&lt;/a&gt; was headed from &lt;a href="w%3ABarajas%20airport"&gt;Barajas airport&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ACanary%20Islands"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt;. Video footage from airport security cameras shows the airliner travelling across an unusually long distance of runway before take-off. It failed to maintain altitude and quickly dropped back down at the runway's end, before bursting into a fireball. Just eighteen people survived the accident.

The report confirms that the aircraft failed to get beyond forty feet off the ground before entering a &lt;a href="w%3AStall%20%28flight%29"&gt;stall&lt;/a&gt; and crashing. The tail of the jet struck the ground first, and the Spanish &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Aviation%20Accident%20Investigation%20Commission"&gt;Civil Aviation Accident Investigation Commission&lt;/a&gt; (CIAIAC)'s report also notes that the aircraft was carrying 10,130 litres (2,673 gallons) of fuel.
The wing flaps were "fully retracted" at "0 degrees" according to the 12-page report, which also notes that the &lt;a href="w%3Acockpit%20voice%20recorder"&gt;cockpit voice recorder&lt;/a&gt; indicates a complete failure of the &lt;a href="w%3Atake-off%20warning%20system"&gt;take-off warning system&lt;/a&gt; (TOWS) - which is supposed to alert pilots attempting to take off in a plane that is not properly configured - to sound prior to the failed ascent. Spanair checks the TOWS each day and after every change in flight crew, but neither of these occurred between the accident flight and the flight before.

It is not known when the CIAIAC's final report will be ready, but estimates vary from a few months to two years. The latest report notes "The investigation continues. It will be necessary to carry out tests and an exhaustive examination of the recovered parts of the plane." A separate judicial investigation also continues.

A police officer at the annual &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%201000"&gt;Bathurst 1000&lt;/a&gt; motorsport event in &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst, New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; has been assaulted by a dildo, with another man arrested for publically displaying pornography.

Police allege that a 22-year-old man from &lt;a href="w%3AMoss%20Vale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Moss Vale&lt;/a&gt; approached a male police officer seated inside a police vehicle. It is alleged the man launched at the officer hitting him in the head with a "sex toy". The officer was uninjured in the incident.

The man was arrested and charged with assaulting police.

Earlier in the evening, police from the Public Order and Riot Squad came across a man displaying pornographic material on a television he had mounted on a trolley walking around the McPhillamy Park Campsite. The 35 year-old man from &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Helen%27s%20Park%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;St Helen's Park&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and taken to the on site police station where he was questioned. Police conducted a search of the man's tent where around 20 pornographic DVDs were located.

The man was charged with displaying pornographic material.

Assistant Commissioner Shearer said, “Camping on the mountain are families with young children and for someone to deliberately walk around displaying pornographic material is completely unacceptable.”

“Police are working tirelessly to ensure that the event remains a family friendly event where by all spectators can enjoy the V8 Super cars as they intended. The behaviour displayed by some individuals is extremely disappointing, however, overall the fans have been very well behaved.”

Both men were ejected from the event and cannot return to the Mount Panorama circuit for the remainder of the event.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, has attempted to reassure Americans on the economy in his weekly radio address.

"Over the past few days, we have witnessed a startling drop in the stock market -- much of it driven by uncertainty and fear," he said, introducing the address. "Many Americans have serious concerns about their economic well-being."

Bush then pointed out the action that the government is taking. "Here are the problems we face and the steps we are taking: First, key markets are not functioning because there is a lack of liquidity. So the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Reserve"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; has injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the system. The Fed has joined with central banks around the world to coordinate a cut in interest rates -- a step that should help free up credit. The Fed has also announced a new program to provide support for a vital tool that many American businesses use to finance their day-to-day operations -- the commercial paper market, which is freezing up. As this program kicks in over the next week or so, it will help revive a key source of short-term financing for businesses and financial institutions."

"Second, some Americans are concerned about whether their money is safe," continued the president. "So the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Deposit%20Insurance%20Corporation"&gt;Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Credit%20Union%20Administration"&gt;National Credit Union Administration&lt;/a&gt; have significantly expanded the amount of money insured in savings accounts and checking accounts and certificates of deposit. That means that if you have up to $250,000 in one of these insured accounts, every penny of that money is safe. The Treasury Department has also acted to restore confidence in a key element of America's financial system by offering government insurance for money market mutual funds."

Bush then said that there was an issue with fraud in the economy. He stated that, to address this issue, "the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; is launching rigorous enforcement actions to detect fraud and manipulation in the market."
The &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; yesterday fell to its lowest level in five years at 8,579.19, falling 679 points in one day. This, at 7.3%, is the eleventh largest percentage fall in the history of the index. The growth then continued, with the index being up over 150 points on the start of the day at one point.

The index, did however, recover, and as of 19:30 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; was up 17.68 points, or 0.21%, pushing the index up to almost 8600.

<h1>Florida officials investigating controversial MMA fight</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Florida%20officials%20investigating%20controversial%20MMA%20fight&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Boxing regulators in the state of Florida have started a preliminary investigation into allegations of corruption and fight fixing after mixed martial arts fighter &lt;a href="w%3ASeth_Petruzelli"&gt;Seth Petruzelli&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AKimbo_Slice"&gt;Kevin "Kimbo Slice" Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; in the main event of the &lt;a href="w%3AEliteXC%3A_Heat"&gt;EliteXC: Heat&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, October 4, 2008. 

Petruzelli, who was scheduled to fight Aaron Rosa on an untelevised undercard match, was approached by EliteXC officials to take on Ferguson, who fights under the nickname Kimbo Slice. Slice's announced opponent, legendary mixed martial arts and professional wrestling veteran Ken Shamrock, was declared medically ineligible to fight after injuring himself during a Saturday morning workout session, requiring stitches to be applied to a cut over his eye. News of the injury and substitution was not made until after CBS Sports started broadcasting the show. 
The show had been heavily promoted over the last two months on Shamrock's reputation and the credibility of his name, along with the media buzz around Kimbo Slice. CBS Sports was expecting to cash in with a huge ratings success after securing a record-setting 4.85 million viewers on their inaugural broadcast of EliteXC, the highest ratings ever for a MMA broadcast. Fourteen seconds into the main event, however, Petruzelli scored an upset win over Slice. Petruzelli hit Slice with a right cross to Slice's jaw that sent the phenom staggering backwards. Petruzelli moved in, as Slice was not defending himself, and finished off his opponent with a flurry of punches. The referee stopped the fight a few seconds later. 

The controversy started the next morning after Petruzelli was interviewed on the "Monster in the Morning" radio show on WTKS-FM 104.1 in &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;FL&lt;/a&gt; and simulcast on XM Satellite channel 152. In the 18-minute interview, Petruzelli made the statement, "The promoters kind of hinted to me and they gave me the money to stand and trade with him. They didn't want me to take him down, let's just put it that way. It was worth my while to try to stand up and punch with him." 
It was inferred through this statement that an EliteXC official approached Petruzelli and attempted to influence the outcome of the fight. Slice, whose fight strategy is largely based on punching power, had been training to face Shamrock, another noted strike artist. Petruzelli, on the other hand, has a much stronger ground offensive. Critics during the fight noted that if Petruzelli could force Slice to the mat that it would be a humiliating upset, but if Slice could maintain control through his striking it would be an easy win. 

With the statement from Petruzelli about being paid to stand up and fight on Slice's skill level, allegations of tampering with the fight began to arise within hours. EliteXC's Jeremy Lappin, Director of Fight Operations, responded to MMA Weekly's inquiries, saying "Press reports that EliteXC suggested or paid money to heavyweight fighter Seth Petruzelli to keep his fight against Kimbo Slice off the ground are false. Let me be perfectly clear with no ambiguity – that did not happen." Lappin stated that they offered him a "Knockout of the Night" bonus if he could score a win by KO. Bonuses such as "Knockout of the Night", "Submission of the Night" and "Match of the Night" are often offered to fighters who can deliver entertaining and crowd-pleasing performances. Lappin also stated, "Elite XC organizes and promotes fights. We have not, do not, and will not suggest or dictate fighters' strategies or tactics. How the fighters perform in the cage is at the sole discretion of the athletes involved."

Petruzelli also started making immediate amends the next day, blaming himself for misrepresenting his intentions. In a blitz of media interviews in an effort to retracts his statement, he said, "Honestly, when I woke up in the morning my words were jumbled and obviously my head was in a daze from drinking (laughs) the entire night. Reading the transcript, I actually now feel I worded it perfectly in what I wanted to say. I wanted to keep the fight standing and they offered a knockout bonus and I wanted to get the knockout bonus."

Florida officials from the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) did not appear to be interested in performing an investigation. In an interview with MMAWeekly.com, DBPR press secretary Alexis Antonacci said, "Our interpretation is that the comments made were in reference to the promoter asking [Petruzelli] to join a fight that he wasn’t originally scheduled for. We don’t believe any wrongdoing occurred." The DBPR regulates all business and professional licenses in the state, including promotion of sports such as boxing, professional wrestling and mixed martial arts.
After being hounded by the media and fight critics all week long, the DPBR announced on Thursday that they would start a preliminary investigation. Communications director Jennifer Meale made a statement to the press. "While the Department of Business and Professional Regulation doesn't have any reason to believe there was a problem with the Slice-Petruzelli fight, given the interest in it, the Department has begun a preliminary investigation to thoroughly review the circumstances of the fight." 
Pro Elite, Inc, the parent company of EliteXC, has struggled over the last year. The company is over $50 million in debt, with $24.4 million of that debt accrued in the first half of 2008. Trailing behind industry leader Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), EliteXC has rallied behind Kimbo Slice to drive up ratings on their specials with CBS Sports and Showtime Networks, attendance at live events and other merchandise sales. The October 4 broadcast drew in 4.56 million viewers, making it the third most-watched viewed event in MMA history to go along with its record-setting May 31 debut of 4.85 million viewers. Both events featured Kimbo Slice in the main event.

The corruption issue could go deeper than just fixing a fight for the company's star fighter. Further fueling the allegations are the actions of EliteXC's president, Jared Shaw. Immediately after the fight was stopped, Shaw rushed to the side of the cage and yelled to the referee that Slice was hit illegally.

"He spent a lot of money to build up Kimbo," Seth Petruzelli said. "If I saw one of my guys I spent millions on getting his face pounded I’d get upset also." Shaw later apologized for his actions, calling them improper. 

EliteXC's Lappin told ESPN, "We were not trying to protect Kimbo. He had been training to fight a guy in Shamrock who has a better ground game than Seth. If we were trying to protect Kimbo we would have sent him home. We put him in a dangerous fight." &lt;a href="w%3AFrank_Shamrock"&gt;Frank Shamrock&lt;/a&gt;, MMA color analyst for CBS Sports, and brother of Ken Shamrock, feels that EliteXC is looking out for Slice's best interests. "As for Pro Elite, are they looking after their baby? I hope so. Are they conspiring to ensure he wins? I don't think so."

<h1>Canadian scientists protest Harper's attacks on science</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Canadian%20scientists%20protest%20Harper%27s%20attacks%20on%20science&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Citing actions taken by the Conservative government &lt;a href="w%3A39th%20Canadian%20Parliament"&gt;since winning a minority government in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, 85 scientists across Canada have signed an to all national party leaders calling on them to state how they will 'improve Canada’s track record' regarding the objectivity of science. This is the second such initiative within the week, the letter on 7 October being signed by 120 scientists.

The scientists signing the latest letter represent hundreds of researchers such as Deans, Department Heads, Research Chairs, and research team leaders. They come from academic fields of Anthropology, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Biology, Community Health and Epidemiology, Criminology, Earth &amp; Ocean Sciences, Educational Psychology, Environmental &amp; Engineering Sciences, Land Resource Science, Medicine, Nursing, Philosophy, Physics, Psychiatry, Social Work, and Sociology.

&lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20University"&gt;Queen's University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20research"&gt;climate researcher&lt;/a&gt; John Smol lamented the need for scientists to protest in a public forum. "I think scientists tend to be conservative when it comes to voicing their opinions. But as far as the environment is concerned, the problem is so bad and the consequences are so terrible if we do not act," he told CBC News.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHarper%20government"&gt;Harper government&lt;/a&gt; was cited for actions across the academic spectrum, from nuclear safety to human health to climate science. A repeated charge is misreprestation and/or suppression of scientific finds, as well as acting to prevent the dissemination of research, to silence scientists.
Within the government's own &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironment%20Canada"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt; the Conservatives have been accused of muzzling the department, even interfering with the release of one researcher's science fiction novel. The novel, entitled "♡❤Hotter than Hell♡❤", deals with a not-too-distant future strongly affected by global warming. Then-Environmental Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARona%20Ambrose"&gt;Rona Ambrose&lt;/a&gt; ordered the scientist not to attend talks to promote his novel where his job title was given.

“It’s absolutely &lt;a href="w%3AOrwellian"&gt;Orwellian&lt;/a&gt; what’s going on here in science in Canada,” said environmental scientist Andrew Weaver in an interview with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Georgia%20Straight"&gt;The Georgia Straight&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Weaver, lead author on three &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; reports and the recently published "♡❤Keeping Our Cool: Canada in a Warming World♡❤", was not surprised when references to the UN's IPCC reports were removed from Canadian government websites. He wrote in his book about new rules the Harper government put in place, requiring journalist questions for Environment Canada scientists be submitted in writing, and responses must first be presented to media-relations staff for editing and approval.

Vancouver's Safe Injections Site project, &lt;a href="w%3AInsite"&gt;Insite&lt;/a&gt;, a program designed to provide intravenous drug users with a medically-supervised location, is an internationally recognized model of successful harm-reduction public health policy, supported by both provincial and municipal governments. The national police force, the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt;, engaged in a campaign to undermine the project according to documents discovered in a &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt; query, including financing politically-motivated research.

The conservative government has been antagonistic to the program since coming to power, and though losing its case at every level of courts has appealed the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Supreme Court of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; ruling which struck down portions of &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20drug%20laws"&gt;Canada's drug laws&lt;/a&gt; as unconstitutional. The judge gave the government one year to pass replacement legislation which addresses the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Charter%20of%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms"&gt;Charter Right&lt;/a&gt; of addicts to health care which may save their life.

Conservative Health Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Clement"&gt;Tony Clement&lt;/a&gt; has questioned the ethics of physicians who support the harm-reduction model of Insite. "Is it ethical for health-care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance, or purity or potency — drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed?" he said at the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Medical%20Association"&gt;Canadian Medical Association's&lt;/a&gt; annual meeting. 

"The minister was off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians involved in harm reduction," CMA president &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Day"&gt;Brian Day&lt;/a&gt; responded. "It's clear that this was being used as a political issue." More than 80% of physicians support the &lt;a href="w%3AHarm%20reduction"&gt;harm-reduction&lt;/a&gt; model, he said.

In the United States, there are two major political parties; the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are several other minor - commonly referred to as "third" - parties. One of these is the &lt;a href="w%3AModern%20Whig%20Party"&gt;Modern Whig Party&lt;/a&gt;, which has been steadily increasing in popularity over recent months. 

Last week, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ reporter Joseph Ford was able to speak with MWP Chairman Mike Lebowitz about how his party was formed, what it stands for, and why you should consider joining. The interview can be read below.

<h2>Interview</h2>

&lt;a href="Cook%20Islands"&gt;Cook Islands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWakefield%20Trinity%20Wildcats"&gt;Wakefield Trinity Wildcats&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20league"&gt;rugby league&lt;/a&gt; player &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Watene"&gt;Adam Watene&lt;/a&gt; has died. The Wildcats announced the death of the 31-year-old earlier today. They reported he collapsed in the gym shortly after a training session.

A spokesman said, "The Wakefield Trinity Wildcats are sad to announce the sudden passing of Adam Watene. The circumstances surrounding Adam’s death were sudden and unexpected. Everyone at the Wildcats' thoughts are with Adam’s family, and we ask for their privacy to be respected at this difficult time."

Watene started his rugby league with the &lt;a href="w%3ACastleford%20Tigers"&gt;Castleford Tigers&lt;/a&gt; and was later signed by the &lt;a href="w%3ABradford%20Bulls"&gt;Bradford Bulls&lt;/a&gt;. After a year of playing for the bulls of which he only made five first team appearances, he was allowed to sign for the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats. He played a total of 28 games in the two seasons he was with the club. 

The Wildcats also said "There will be no further comment from the club at this stage." Watene is survived by his wife and two children.

The blazes, known as the Marek fires, have burned over 3700 acres and caused the evacuation of more than 1200 people. Furthermore, at least 30 mobile homes were destroyed.

One confirmed fatality has been reported and described as an unidentified transient who had been using a cardboard shelter beneath a freeway overpass. However, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports a second related death from a traffic accident.

Authorities expect to order more evacuations before the fires can be brought under control.

Fires started Sunday due to Santa Ana wind conditions in the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Fernando%20Valley"&gt;San Fernando Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAngeles%20National%20Forest"&gt;Angeles National Forest&lt;/a&gt; on the northern outskirts of Los Angeles. Affected communities include Porter Ranch and the Lopez Canyon area.

&lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Ana%20wind"&gt;Santa Ana winds&lt;/a&gt; as strong as 65 miles per hour fanned the flames, which jumped the eight-lane &lt;a href="w%3A210%20Freeway"&gt;210 Freeway&lt;/a&gt;. Both the 210 Freeway and &lt;a href="w%3A118%20Freeway"&gt;118 Freeway&lt;/a&gt; were closed during Monday morning rush hour. Firefighters have contained smaller blazes that occurred elsewhere in Southern California near the Los Angeles suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Clarita"&gt;Santa Clarita&lt;/a&gt; and in neighbouring &lt;a href="w%3AVentura%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Ventura County&lt;/a&gt;.

Local resident Glenn Bell told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ about his last minute evacuation. "The sparks were flying down on us," he said, recalling how a locked gate nearly trapped him and his family, "and as I'm busting the gate... I see the cypress trees that are right next to our house on fire."

&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/a&gt; fire inspector Frank Garrido described the problem as "a blowtorch we can’t get in front of," according to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. "Wind is king here, it’s dictating everything we are doing," he continued.

Scott Stephens of the Center for Fire Research &amp; Outreach at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley"&gt;University of California, Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; calls Southern California's Santa Ana winds "some of the strongest, most severe fire winds in the world."

Among the problems caused by Santa Ana winds, which blow from the nearby &lt;a href="w%3AMojave%20Desert"&gt;Mojave Desert&lt;/a&gt; toward the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, is a tendency for hot embers to leapfrog and start new fires. Santa Ana conditions tend to occur from autumn through spring and can reach peak speeds of 70 miles per hour (113 kilometers per hour).

The &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; suburb of &lt;a href="w%3AChula%20Vista%2C%20California"&gt;Chula Vista&lt;/a&gt; has responded to the recent housing crisis with an aggressive blight control ordinance that compels lenders to maintain the appearance of vacant homes. As foreclosures increase both locally and throughout the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, the one year old ordinance has become a model for other cities overwhelmed by the problem of abandoned homes that decay into neighborhood eyesores. 

Chula Vista city code enforcement manager Doug Leeper told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Union%20Tribune"&gt;San Diego Union Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that over 300 jurisdictions have contacted his office during the past year with inquiries about the city's tough local ordinance. &lt;a href="w%3ACoral%20Springs%2C%20Florida"&gt;Coral Springs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and California towns &lt;a href="w%3AStockton%2C%20California"&gt;Stockton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASantee%2C%20California"&gt;Santee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARiverside%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Riverside County&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMurietta%2C%20California"&gt;Murietta&lt;/a&gt; have all modeled recently enacted anti-blight measures after Chula Vista's. On Wednesday, 8 October, the &lt;a href="w%3AEscondido%2C%20California"&gt;Escondido&lt;/a&gt; City Council also voted to tighten local measures making lenders more accountable for maintenance of empty homes.
Under the Chula Vista ordinance lenders become legally responsible for upkeep as soon as a notice of mortgage default gets filed on a vacant dwelling, before actual ownership of the dwelling returns to the lender. Leeper regards that as "the cutting-edge part of our ordinance". Chula Vista also requires prompt registration of vacant homes and applies stiff fines as high as &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1000 per day for failure to maintain a property. Since foreclosed properties are subject to frequent resale between mortgage brokers, city officials enforce the fines by sending notices to every name on title documents and placing a lien on the property, which prevents further resale until outstanding fines have been paid. In the year since the ordinance went into effect the city has applied $850,000 in fines and penalties, of which it has collected $200,000 to date. The city has collected an additional $77,000 in registration fees on vacant homes.

Jolie Houston, an attorney in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, believes "Lenders will respond when it costs them less to maintain the property than to ignore local agency requirements." Traditionally, local governments have resorted to addressing blight problems on abandoned properties with public funds, mowing overgrown lawns and performing other vital functions, then seeking repayment afterward. Chula Vista has moved that responsibility to an upfront obligation upon lenders. 
As one of the fastest growing cities in the United States during recent years, Chula Vista saw 22.6% growth between 2000 and 2006, which brought the city's population from 173,556 in the 2000 census to an estimated 212,756, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Census%20Bureau"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau&lt;/a&gt;. Chula Vista placed among the nation's 20 fastest growing cities in 2004. A large proportion of local homes were purchased during the recent housing boom using creative financing options that purchasers did not understand were beyond their means. Average home prices in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20County%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego County&lt;/a&gt; declined by 25% in the last year, which is the steepest drop on record. Many homeowners in the region currently owe more than their homes are worth and confront rising balloon payment mortgages that they had expected to afford by refinancing new equity that either vanished or never materialized. In August 2008, Chula Vista's eastern 91913 zip code had the highest home mortgage default rate in the county with 154 filings and 94 foreclosures, an increase of 154% over one year previously. Regionally, the county saw 1,979 foreclosures in August.

Professionals from the real estate and mortgage industries object to Chula Vista's response to the crisis for the additional burdens it places on their struggling finances. Said San Diego real estate agent Marc Carpenter, "that kind of measure will add additional costs to banks that have been hit really hard already and ultimately the cost will be transferred down to consumers and investors." Yet city councils in many communities have been under pressure to do something about increasing numbers of vacant properties. Concentrations of abandoned and neglected homes can attract vandals who hasten the decline of struggling neighborhoods. Jolie Houston explained that city officials "can't fix the lending problem, but they can try to prevent neighborhoods from becoming blighted." 
CEO Robert Klein of Safeguard, a property management firm, told the ♡❤Union Tribune♡❤ that his industry is having difficulty adapting to the rapidly changing local ordinances. "Every day we discover a new ordinance coming out of somewhere", he complained. Dustin Hobbs, a spokesman from the California Association of Mortgage Bankers agreed that uneven local ordinances are likely to increase the costs of lending. Hobbs advised that local legislation is unnecessary due to &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Senate"&gt;California State Senate&lt;/a&gt; Bill 1137, which was recently approved to address blight. Yet according to Houston, the statewide measure falls short because it fails to address upkeep needs during the months between the time when foreclosure begins and when the lender takes title.

Wikinews recently &lt;a href="Bush%20deploys%20military%20in%20the%20US%20for%20active%20duty%20as%20federal%20response%20force"&gt;published an article&lt;/a&gt; which explained that &lt;a href="w%3AUnited_States_Northern_Command"&gt;NorthComm&lt;/a&gt;, through an &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20order%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Executive Order of the President of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, directed the &lt;a href="w%3A3rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;3rd Infantry Division's&lt;/a&gt; 1st Brigade Combat Team to return to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; from active duty missions in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; to begin training in a new role. NorthComm says that these troops will be used to protect the United States from threats within the United States, as well as to provide a support role to local and state agencies during times of emergency, such as with &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. 

Critics, however, believe that moving an active military unit back to United States soil represents a violation of the &lt;a href="w%3APosse%20Comitatus%20Act"&gt;Posse Comitatus Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1878, which makes it illegal for federal military resources to act as law enforcement agencies against civilians. The article included citations from critic Namoi Watts, who based part of her opinion on an interview with retired U.S. Air Force Colonel David Antoon. Ret. Col. Antoon stated that a military coup was already under way through the actions of NorthComm, and that other branches of the government would be powerless. 

Wikinews reporter Kevin Fields had an opportunity to speak with an active duty member of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;, a sergeant who is currently deployed to a peace keeping mission in Iraq. Federal laws officially prevents him from giving making any statement on military policy, however he agreed to do so on the condition of anonymity. The initials used here are not his initials of his name, only used as a pseudonym. Sgt. P.S.N. was asked to review a source article from the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AArmy%20Times"&gt;Army Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ website which provided the original breaking information, and to provide his opinions on the article as well as follow-up questions.

&lt;hr&gt;

♡❤♡Kevin Fields: In summary, what do you believe is happening here, from a military standpoint?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Kevin Fields: Right, but before they've always been under the control of state officials, such as a governor or local law enforcement, correct?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Kevin Fields: So it is possible that the President can assign federal troops to act in law enforcement officials, and it NOT violate Posse Comitatus? Or would such a case clearly violate it, but nothing can be done about it?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Kevin Fields: What would be the difference?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Kevin Fields: Critics have suggested that this is part of a strategy to usurp power and consolidate it in the Presidency. Is it possible for a President of the United States to stage a coup by deploying the CCMRF and NorthComm to permanently take over an area where there is rioting or a national disaster?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Kevin Fields: So even though this unit, and NorthComm, are under the direct command of the President, Congress can still stop his actions?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Kevin Fields: Critics say that such hearings would not be swift, and that such action would not directly affect the President or any action he takes through this unit. Would you agree with that?♡❤♡

♡❤♡Kevin Fields: Thank you for your input into this story.♡❤♡

With the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Alliance%20for%20Democracy"&gt;People's Alliance for Democracy&lt;/a&gt; (PAD) having called off Monday's demonstration and march on &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;'s police headquarters, &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s Queen &lt;a href="w%3ASirikit"&gt;Sirikit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AThai%20language"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt;: สมเด็จพระนางเจ้าสิริกิติ์ พระบรมราชินีนาถ) and HRH Princess &lt;a href="w%3AChulabhorn"&gt;Chulabhorn Valayalaksana&lt;/a&gt; (Thai: สมเด็จพระเจ้าลูกเธอ เจ้าฟ้าจุฬาภรณวลัยลักษณ์ อัครราชกุมารี) attended the cremation and funeral of Angkana Radubpanyawoot, one of the protesters killed in clashes between police and PAD protesters last Tuesday.

Queen Sirikit spoke with Angkhana's father, Jinda Radappanyawut during the &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhism"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; cremation ceremony. He later discussed their conversation, detailing that the queen had given moral support and said that his daughter was a decent person who had been helping the King and working for the good of the nation. Jinda's wife, Angkhana's mother, was not present at the funeral; she continues to be treated for injuries sustained during the protest outside parliament. The &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;Bangkok Post&lt;/a&gt; report detailing this meeting mentions that the king has donated funds to help those injured in the police clampdown.

At the closing of the funeral services there were scuffles between PAD protesters and the Army's Commander-in-Chief, Anupong Paojinda, as he attempted to leave. Security guards had to assist him in reaching his car and protesters banged on the car as it drove away.
With a sub-committee appointed by the country's Human Rights Commission due to report within the week, details are beginning to emerge accounting for the number of injuries and severity of some in last Tuesday's clashes outside parliament. Nearly 500 were injured as police employed &lt;a href="w%3Atear%20gas"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt; to try and disperse the crowd of PAD protesters blockading parliament. The group, originally formed seeking to topple deposed former prime minister &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party, had disbanded in September 2006 following &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin&lt;/a&gt; being removed by a coup. The 2007 general election saw them reform to oppose the new government formed by the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Power%20Party%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;People's Power Party&lt;/a&gt; (PPP) who are widely regarded as a proxy for the ex-PM living in exile in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. The PAD protest aimed to stop the PPP government from announcing their legislative programme which included measures to amend the constitution and rehabilitate Thaksin and others from the now-outlawed Thai Rak Thai party. Investigations started during the coup period leave Thaksin and others accused of vote buying and electoral fraud.

Porntip Rojanasunan, the director of Thailand's Central Institute of Forensic Science has indicated that the tear gas employed was likely responsible for the many injuries during the October 7 crackdown. A number of the canisters were found to contain &lt;a href="w%3ARDX"&gt;RDX&lt;/a&gt;, a militarily employed explosive. RDX is considered a powerful explosive and the quantities likely involved would have left craters. Other types of tear gas were employed, manufactured in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, but during the protest it was the RDX-laced variety which originated in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; that had been favoured. Porntip's agency demonstrated the firing of these tear gas canisters from a shotgun to the Human Rights Commission committee on Sunday, noting that one exploded canister "left a hole in a metal pipe". It is claimed that the lethal tear gas was sourced from a third party and not directly from China.

Along with the two fatalities, fifteen people remain hospitalised from last week's police action, with one critically injured having lost his right arm.

Monday's planned PAD protest and march on Bangkok police HQ was cancelled to allow people to attend the cremation and funeral services for the two dead. No new date for the protest has been announced.

&lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; released version 3.0 of its &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20and%20open%20source%20software"&gt;free and open source&lt;/a&gt; (FOSS) office suite &lt;a href="w%3AOpenoffice.org"&gt;Openoffice.org&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. It has been reported that the new version comes with a number of performance enhancements and new features. Openoffice.org 3.0 now claims to work out of the box in &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS%20X"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; as a native &lt;a href="w%3AAqua%20%28user%20interface%29"&gt;Aqua&lt;/a&gt; application.

News sources report the official download servers of OpenOffice.org crashed soon after the release due to heavy downloads. Downloads are however available from a number of mirror sites.

Openoffice.org 3.0 suite includes &lt;a href="w%3Aspreadsheet"&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWord%20processor"&gt;word processor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFormula%20editor"&gt;equation editor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APresentation%20program"&gt;presentation tool&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARelational%20database"&gt;relational database&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVector%20graphics%20editor"&gt;vector drawing software&lt;/a&gt;. Full interoperability is available for &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Office"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt; 98/XP formats, but offers read only support for &lt;a href="w%3AOOXML"&gt;OOXML&lt;/a&gt; file formats. This version supports the new 1.2 document format. The software is available for many platforms including &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/a&gt; and Mac, as well as in multiple languages.

Users report OpenOffice.org 3.0 has introduced a new graphical and text-based hybrid equation editor, a wizard, improved label templates and better interface for outlining. Solver, a spreadsheet add-on for &lt;a href="w%3ACombinatorial%20optimization"&gt;combinatorial optimization&lt;/a&gt; problems is included in this version.

Other enhancements highlighted by enthusiasts include collaborative options that allow multiple users to edit documents at the same time and improved drawing and charting tools. OpenOffice.org 3.0 can now display multiple pages during editing and workbooks up to 1024 columns in each spreadsheet.

The download size of OpenOffice.org 3.0 is 163 MB for Mac and requires OS X Tiger or later and an Intel Mac. The installer for Windows is about 145 MB in size. 

"As government after government, enterprise after enterprise adopt the Open Document Format, they frequently adopt OpenOffice.org and love it. With 3.0, the application is more interoperable with MS Office, more capable, more extensible. It frees the desktop from vendor lock-in," claimed Louis Suárez-Potts, community manager of OpenOffice.org.

At least 10% of the increase in &lt;a href="w%3AMedicare"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; expenditures since the mid-1990s is due to increased rates of one type of elective surgery, according to a recent study, and many of the patients may not need it. &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Francisco"&gt;University of California, San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; found that only 44% of patients who undergo an elective cardiac surgery called &lt;a href="w%3Aangioplasty"&gt;angioplasty&lt;/a&gt; get the recommended test to determine whether the procedure is appropriate.

As a result, patients may be receiving a procedure that they either do not need or for which the risk outweighs the benefit. The operation opens partially clogged arteries in patients with heart disease and the annual rate of elective angioplasties has tripled in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; during the last decade. 

Angioplasties are currently being performed at a rate of over 800,000 per year in the U.S. The average cost was $44,110 per procedure in 2004. Since the operation tends to be performed on older Americans, Medicare covers most patients and compensates &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;10,000 to $15,000 for each case.

&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; reporter Julie Steenhuysen writes that angioplasty is "big business for medical device makers including Boston Scientific Corp, Medtronic Inc, Abbott Laboratories Inc and Johnson &amp; Johnson". Dr. Raymond Gibbons, a professor of medicine who specializes in cardiology at the &lt;a href="w%3AMayo%20Clinic"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARochester%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Rochester, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;, criticizes the current U.S. health care system for compensating doctors based upon procedures performed rather than for following recommended practices.
A stress test in which the patient walks on a treadmill is recommended to determine whether a partial obstruction impairs heart function. Although not all patients who need angioplasty are strong enough to undergo the stress test, UC San Francisco researchers were surprised that testing preceded so few of the surgeries.

Professor of medicine Dr. Rita F. Redberg told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20News%20and%20World%20Report"&gt;U.S. News and World Report&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "We didn't expect to find 100 percent, but we expected a much higher percentage than 44". Dr. Redberg co-authored a report on the findings for the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJournal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ this month.

Dr. Grace Lin, another co-author of the study, noted: "What really matters is whether or not that blockage is affecting blood flow to the heart. That is why the stress test is important." Their research analyzed over 23,000 Medicare cases and over 1,600 commercial insurance cases.

&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Heart%20Association"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; president Timothy Gardner called the study "a good wake-up call" to remind medical doctors to make sure they do not perform unnecessary procedures. Dr. Gardner regards the study as evidence that many unnecessary angioplasties are being performed.
The study found great variation in the rate of stress testing. Geographic areas ranged from 22% to 76% with the highest rate of testing in the Northeastern and Midwestern states. Testing rates also varied by gender, with men more likely to receive a stress test than women, and by other factors including the age of the physician. Dr. Gibbons points to some of these variances as indications that some physicians may be performing angioplasties indiscriminately.

Not all physicians agree. Although the various types of stress testing usually cost a few hundred dollars instead of tens of thousands, the chief cardiologist at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin%20Hospital%20and%20Clinics"&gt;University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Matthew Wolff notes that stress tests yield false negative results in about 10% of cases. In his opinion, doctors who rely on stress tests "are going to be missing people with severe disease." Although he agrees that some angioplasties are unnecessary, he contends that the new study does not offer a solution to the dilemma. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20College%20of%20Cardiology"&gt;American College of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; plans to release new guidelines soon to help doctors determine when a stress test is appropriate, yet the payment system lacks a financial incentive to abide by testing guidelines. Dr. Eric Topol of &lt;a href="w%3AScripps%20Translational%20Science%20Institute"&gt;Scripps Translational Science Institute&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Jolla%2C%20California"&gt;La Jolla, California&lt;/a&gt; noted the underuse of stress tests in a study of private insurance records 14 years ago. Dr. Topol agrees that testing guidelines "should be much more clear-cut", and adds that stress tests ought to be performed annually. "You can do a stress test every year to be sure things are normal. That is an important baseline that is being ignored all too frequently."

Cardiologist, Dr. Anthony DeFranco of &lt;a href="w%3AAurora%20St.%20Luke%E2%80%99s%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Aurora St. Luke’s Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, considers stress testing to be appropriate in at most 65% of cases, since a substantial minority of patients have other health problems that prevent them from undergoing the test.

Today, the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20Court%20of%20Thailand"&gt;Constitutional Court of Thailand&lt;/a&gt; (Supreme Court) issued the sixth arrest warrant for &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s deposed premier, &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;. Following on from a string of corruption charges, the latest centres on the country's telecommunications industry. The former Prime Minister was removed by a bloodless military coup in September 2006 while at the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; in New York. Prior to the coup the country experienced widespread unrest, demonstrations, and allegations against Thaksin and his &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party of corruption and vote buying.

The &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Government has stated that children in Britain will no longer be required to take compulsory, externally marked tests at the age of fourteen.

The change takes effect immediately, meaning that children who were due to take the test this year no longer have to do so.

Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Balls"&gt;Ed Balls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yesterday announced his plans to radically change the UK testing system, in parliament.

Currently, almost ten million tests are sat each year by British pupils. This change is expected to cut the number of tests taken in half, according to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

The tests for seven and eleven year olds are not being abolished. A review group is being set up, however, to research the effect of these tests on eleven-year-olds.

Instead of league tables showing test results, the government will produce report cards for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asecondary%20school"&gt;secondary schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to Ed Balls, the results from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGCSE"&gt;GCSEs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will be adequate to judge the performance of schools by their test results.
The decision to abolish the tests for fourteen year olds came as a result of a situation earlier this year, when there were long delays with the delivery of test results to students of this age.

According to Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Union%20of%20Teachers%20%28UK%29"&gt;National Union of Teachers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the government is admitting that the previous test system failed by making this move.

"For too long English, mathematics and science teachers in secondary schools have found themselves skewing everything to enable their pupils to jump through a series of unnecessary hoops," she claimed, while Chris Keates, general secretary of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20Schoolmasters%20Union%20of%20Women%20Teachers"&gt;National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that "the sound of a deep collective sigh of relief will emanate from secondary schools across the country."

Both major UK opposition parties welcomed this move. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shadow Secretary of State for Children &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Gove"&gt;Michael Gove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stated that his party have "argued for fewer national tests and more rigor and we want to work constructively to improve the assessment and qualifications regime."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Laws"&gt;David Laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Shadow Secretary of State for Children for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that "the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Curriculum%20assessment"&gt;Sats tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; taken by 14-year-olds are not only a waste of time but have been highly unreliable over the last few years."

<h1>Secret memos reveal Bush administration endorsed enhanced interrogation techniques</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Secret%20memos%20reveal%20Bush%20administration%20endorsed%20enhanced%20interrogation%20techniques&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Classified memos have revealed that the &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration knowingly endorsed &lt;a href="w%3Aenhanced%20interrogation%20techniques"&gt;enhanced interrogation techniques&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href="w%3Awaterboarding"&gt;waterboarding&lt;/a&gt; and other methods, that critics call &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt;, for use against terror suspects. 

The memos were issued to the &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 and 2004 as classified documents in response to the department's former director &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Tenet"&gt;George Tenet&lt;/a&gt;'s request for &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; approval. The administration responded to the concerns with explicit approval. 

"The CIA believed then, and now, that the program was useful and helped save lives," commented a former CIA official, explaining the memos. "But in the agency's view, it was like this: 'We don't want to continue unless you tell us in writing that it's not only legal but is the policy of the administration'."

In private meetings led by then-National Security Adviser &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, top administration officials Vice President &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, Attorney General &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Ashcroft"&gt;Ashcroft&lt;/a&gt; and several former members of the administration discussed the endorsement of the programs. No one at the meetings had questioned the methods because the CIA had them "boxed in", a former official noted. "They were saying, 'It's the only way to get the information we needed, and — by the way — we think there's another attack coming up"."

Another official, however, called the idea that the CIA had coerced the Bush administration into approving the torture methods "ridiculous". The CIA, he said, understood the methods were "controversial and would be widely criticized if it became public".

Tenet said that in a 2001 meeting with top administration officials, Rice had warned those attending of an impending attack by a top Al-Qaeda suspect, &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Zubaydah"&gt;Abu Zubaydah&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3APulitzer%20Prize"&gt;Pulitzer Prize-winning&lt;/a&gt; investigative journalist &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Suskind"&gt;Ron Suskind&lt;/a&gt; reported that Bush had become 'obsessed' with Abu Zubaydah and "fixated on how to get Zubaydah to tell [him] the truth". Bush had asked a CIA staffer if the methods really worked.

Ashcroft had commented during the meetings that "history will not judge us kindly". Last month, Rice stated that there was concern over the legality of the program and that she was investigating if any laws had been broken.

A report released by the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20on%20Oversight%20and%20Government%20Reform"&gt;Committee on Oversight and Government Reform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today found that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had "used the political affairs office to orchestrate an aggressive strategy to use taxpayer-funded trips to help elect Republican candidates" during the 2006 Congressional elections. The actions of the White House may have breached the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHatch%20Act%20of%201939"&gt;Hatch Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which prohibits government involvement with taxpayer dollars in political affairs.

The Office of Political Affairs coordinated the efforts, and while it has been used in the past to support political parties, the Committee called the level of involvement "unprecedented" and a "gross abuse of public trust". A total of 99 Republican candidates were supported by the actions.

Political Affairs requested that its officials attend events of and support key members of the 2006–2007 Congressional race. Administration officials attended a total of 425 events, including parties, fundraising dinners, speeches, and appearances with Republican candidates — an average of more than an event each day of the election season. A third of the events were paid for with tax dollars. 

White House emails used in the report referred to the taxpayer-funded events as "top priorities". 

Former Political Affairs director &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Melhman"&gt;Ken Melhman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said during an investigative interview that it was a "big part" of his job was to "help elect allies of the President". The job was legal, he said, because it promoted executive allies. Mehlman had discussed his actions with the White House Counsel of the time, &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;, who approved of the efforts.
The Committee noted that the director of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20National%20Drug%20Control%20Policy"&gt;Office of National Drug Control Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20P.%20Walters"&gt;John Walters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , helped with nineteen events though his position was restricted from campaign activities.

Mehlman said that his department had worked directly with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Republican%20Congressional%20Committee"&gt;National Republican Congressional Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the strategy. They had worked together to pick "vulnerable Republican incumbents", "battleground races" and "places where they agreed the most help was needed". The White House kept a 'target list' of 'allies' who were in tight races. 

Investigators also questioned &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASara%20Taylor"&gt;Sara Taylor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a former director of Political Affairs and &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt; aid. According to the report, Taylor resisted questioning and "misled the Committee about her actions". Taylor said the trips were efforts to be helpful but could not remember why some were helped and others not.

The report recommended an amendment of the Hatch Act and for the Political Affairs department to be abolished.

Republican Representative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20M.%20Davis"&gt;Tom Davis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a senior member of the Committee, said that every administration since &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADwight%20D.%20Eisenhower"&gt;Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has done similar things. He said the Democrats had set out to find banned activity and had "feigned shock", calling their response "righteous indignation".

A White House spokesman accused the Committee of trying to "score political points", and that the report was a waste of time and taxpayer money.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal%20Canadiens"&gt;Montreal Canadiens&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest and most successful &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hockey%20League"&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; team, played their 100th home opener against rivals the on the night of October 15, 2008. The Canadiens won the game in a shootout, 4-3.

<h2>Pre-Game Ceremonies</h2>

During the opening ceremonies the Canadiens brought out 12 Hall of Famers onto the ice. The players were Emile "Butch" Bouchard, Elmer Lach, Jean Beliveau, Dickie Moore, Henri Richard, Yvan Cournoyer, Guy Lafleur, Bob Gainey, Guy Lapointe, Steve Shutt, Larry Robinson and Dick Duff. While they were on the ice, the Canadiens unveiled a new installation in their home arena, the &lt;a href="w%3ABell%20Centre"&gt;Bell Centre&lt;/a&gt;: a "ring of honour" that stretched around the top of the entire arena above the last row of seats, depicting in a mural the 54 former Montreal Canadiens who are now in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Bouchard and Lach, the two oldest Canadiens Hall of Famers, were chosen to drop the ceremonial puck to start the game.

<h2>The Game</h2>

Barely two minutes into the game, newly acquired enforcer Georges Laraque got into his first fight as a Canadien, fighting Scott Thornton. Both players were given five-minute majors for the incident.

Montreal opened the scoring with three quick goals in the first period. Alexei Kovalev scored first on the power play, collecting a rebound off his own shot 15 minutes into the game, and scoring from the crease. Team captain Saku Koivu scored less than two minutes later by stuffing a loose puck from the side of the net. Another two minutes after that, Maxim Lapierre scored a short-handed goal to give the Canadiens a three-goal lead.

But after that, it was all Boston as the Bruins would hold an advantage in shots in every period thereafter. David Krejci scored in the second period, and it would have been more except for some terrific saves by Canadiens goaltender Carey Price.

In the third period, Marc Savard struck twice, first on a power play goal seven minutes into the frame. Then in the last minute of regulation, Price was fooled by a fluke bounce off the boards, and Savard easily guided the puck into the vacated net to tie the game.

There was little action in the extra frame, leading to a &lt;a href="w%3APenalty%20shootout"&gt;shootout&lt;/a&gt;. Phil Kessel, Patrice Bergeron, and former Canadien Michael Ryder were designated for the Bruins, while Andrei Markov and Alex Tanguay replied for the Habs. Tanguay scored the only goal, ensuring that Montreal's 100th home opener would go down as a victory for the home team.

<h2>Future Celebrations</h2>

The Canadiens will continue to celebrate their 100th year all season long, with future highlights expected to be the retiring of former Habs great Patrick Roy's number 33 in November, and the NHL all-star game in January. As well, the Canadiens are considered to be strong contenders for the &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Cup"&gt;Stanley Cup&lt;/a&gt; this season, so it is possible the Bell Centre will see one more celebration in June.

Today saw high-level talks between &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Cambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;n military leaders following a border skirmish yesterday which left two Cambodian soldiers dead, injuries on both sides, and ten &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; troops captured. Several hours of talks have led to an agreement for joint military patrols along the disputed border.

A medical helicopter has crashed near &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; killing three crew members and the patient, a thirteen-month-old baby girl. The crew aboard the helicopter included the pilot, a nurse and a paramedic.

The helicopter, operated by Air Angels Inc., was transporting the baby to Children's Memorial Hospital from Valley West Hospital, when it hit a wire connected to a 734-foot (224-meter) radio tower in &lt;a href="w%3AAurora%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt; and burst into flames around 12:00 a.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;). The baby was suffering from &lt;a href="w%3AEpilepsy"&gt;epileptic&lt;/a&gt; seizures. 

The cause of the crash is not known, and there were no reported problems with the helicopter before it took off. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is ongoing.

This is the third crash which involved an Air Angels helicopter. In 2003, a pilot was killed when his chopper crashed. An investigation concluded that the cause was pilot error, and bad weather. Another chopper crashed in 2007, but there were no injuries.

International oil prices sank on Thursday as investors worried that a looming global recession will lower demand.

Crude oil for future delivery fell to below &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;71 a barrel in electronic trading on the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mercantile%20Exchange"&gt;New York Mercantile Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price in more than a year. In &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20crude%20oil"&gt;Brent crude oil&lt;/a&gt; for November dropped below $66 a barrel.

Oil prices have dropped more than 50 percent since hitting a record high of $147 a barrel in July. A report released today showed an unexpected increase in inventories. Analysts expected only a 1.9 million barrel increase last week, but the actual amount was 5.6 million barrels

The &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20Petroleum%20Exporting%20Countries"&gt;Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries&lt;/a&gt; (OPEC) cut its estimate for crude oil demand next year in a report released Wednesday. OPEC, which was planning on having an emergency meeting next month on the issue of lower oil prices, pushed forward the meeting to next week. The cartel is expected to cut production by 500,000 barrels a day, in a bid to boost oil prices. &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, which initially did not support the cut a few weeks ago, now supports such a move.
Some &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n governments are under pressure to reduce domestic fuel prices in light of the decline of the price of oil. In &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, some drivers are paying more for gas than drivers in the United States, which last occurred several years ago. &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, China, and &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; appear to be to content to keep the price at the same level; however, some other Asian governments have lowered the price already. &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; have cut prices and are expected to do the same if oil drops some more.

<h1>Clash of cultures: Somali and Latino workers at U.S. meat packing plants</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Clash%20of%20cultures%3A%20Somali%20and%20Latino%20workers%20at%20U.S.%20meat%20packing%20plants&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Muslim &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somali&lt;/a&gt; workers at a meat packing plant in &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Island%2C%20Nebraska"&gt;Grand Island, Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; wanted to pray. Their colleagues from Latin America wanted to work. A dispute over the company's break schedule led to formal discrimination claims, mass job walk-offs and public protests by both sides last month, and a reported 200 firings.

Tensions at the plant began after a Federal government raid in December 2006 removed 200 undocumented workers. An equal number of employees quit shortly afterward. Altogether, six government immigration raids at meat packing plants of &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt;-owned JBS Swift &amp; Co. had removed 1,200 employees from the company's work force, which caused substantial production problems. Management at the Nebraska plant responded by hiring approximately 400 Somali immigrants who resided in the United States legally as political refugees. Stricter Federal enforcement of immigration laws has had a significant impact on the meat packing industry because few native-born Americans are willing to work in its low-wage factories. Employers advertise to immigrant communities and after the immigration crackdowns the company turned to the Somali community, which was unlikely to be targeted for deportation.
Many of the new Somali workers were observant Muslims who wanted to practice the traditional religious prayer schedule, and few spoke English. The existing union contract had been negotiated before Muslims became a significant part of the factory work force, when religious needs had not been an issue, and break times were assigned according to a rigid schedule to ensure continuous production and prevent workers from working too long without a break. The sharp knives the meat packers wield for their job pose a substantial risk of accidental injury.

At first the Somali workers prayed during scheduled breaks and visits to the rest room. A few Somalis were fired for "illegal breaks" they had spent praying. Rima Kapitan, a lawyer who represents the Muslim meat packers of Grand Island, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "they shouldn't be forced to choose between their job and their religion." The Somalis offered to let their employer deduct pay for time at prayer, but supervisors considered it unworkable to lose the labor of hundreds of people simultaneously, even if the interruptions lasted less than five minutes.
Plant worker Fidencio Sandoval, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, had polite reservations. "I kind of admire all the effort they make to follow that religion, but sometimes you have to adapt to the workplace." An immigrant from &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Salvador"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt; was less sympathetic. "They used to go to the bathroom," said José Amaya, "but actually they're praying and the rest of us have to do their work." Raul A. García, a 73-year-old Mexican meat packer, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, “The Latino is very humble, but they [the Somalis] are arrogant... They act like the United States owes them.”

Differences of opinion arose over whether the prayers, which are a religious obligation five times a day for practicing Muslims and vary in exact time according the position of the sun, constitute a reasonable accommodation or an undue burden upon non-Muslim coworkers. Abdifatah Warsame, a Somali meat packer, told ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ that "Latinos were sometimes saying, ‘Don’t pray, don’t pray’".
As the Muslim holy month of &lt;a href="w%3ARamadan"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; approached during 2007 the Somalis requested time off for religious reasons. Observant Muslims fast throughout daylight hours during Ramadan. Management refused, believing it would affect the production line. Dozens of Somali workers quit their jobs temporarily in protest. Negotiations between the Somali workers and management broke down in October 2007. Some of the fired Somalis filed religious discrimination complaints with the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AEqual%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission"&gt;Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&lt;/a&gt;.

Problems resurfaced after September 10, 2008 when Somali workers approached plant general manager Dennis Sydow with a request to start their dinner half an hour before the usual schedule in order to break their Ramadan fast closer to sundown. Sydow refused due to concern the request would slow production and burden non-Muslim workers. During the same month a Somali woman complained that a plant supervisor had kicked her while she was praying. The union investigated the charge and the supervisor responded that he had not seen her while she bent in prayer and had only kicked the cardboard that was underneath her.

Somali workers walked out on strike September 15 and protested at Grand Island City Hall, asking for prayer time. The following day the union brokered a compromise with plant management to move the dinner break by 15 minutes. Plant scheduling rules would have reduced the work day by 15 minutes with resulting loss in pay for the hourly workers.

A Somali worker, Abdalla Omar, told the press "We had complaints from the whites, Hispanics and [Christian] &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt;". False rumors spread about further cuts to the work day and preferential concessions to the Somalis. Over 1,000 non-Somalis staged a counterprotest on September 17. Union and management returned to the original dinner schedule. Substantial numbers of Somali workers left the plant afterward and either quit or were fired as a result. Sources differ as to the number of Somalis who still work at the plant: ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ reports union leadership as saying 300 remain, while Somali community leaders assert the number is closer to 100. 

The EEOC has sent staff to determine whether treatment of Somali workers has been in compliance with the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964"&gt;The Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;/a&gt;. Under the law, employers must make reasonable accommodation for religious practices, but the law grants exceptions if religious practice places substantial hardship on an employer's business.

Doug Schult, the JBS Swift manager in charge of labor relations, expressed frustration at the inability to resolve the problem, which had surfaced in a &lt;a href="w%3AColorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; plant as well as the Nebraska plant. He told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Wall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that his office had spent months trying to understand and comply with new EEOC guidelines in light of conflicting pressures. Local union chapter president Daniel O. Hoppes of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Food%20and%20Commercial%20Workers"&gt;United Food and Commercial Workers&lt;/a&gt; worries that similar problems could continue to arise at the plant. "Right now, this is a real kindling box".

BULLET::::- Republicans

BULLET::::- At the Republican National Convention in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;St. Paul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , some notable moments included &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20S.%20Steele"&gt;Michael Steele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ’s coining of the phrase “&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adrill%20baby%20drill"&gt;drill baby drill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ” during a convention speech not carried on the major networks. &lt;a href="Rudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Lieberman"&gt;Joe Lieberman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; each gave keynote addresses that attacked Senator &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt;, especially in Giuliani’s case. The most memorable moment was Governor &lt;a href="Sarah%20Palin"&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/a&gt;’s speech, seen by as many Americans as Obama’s during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Democratic%20National%20Convention"&gt;Democratic Convention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in which she gave a critically acclaimed performance that overshadowed &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;McCain&lt;/a&gt;’s speech on the final day.
BULLET::::- Congressman and former Presidential candidate &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; held a counter convention of his own at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATarget%20Center"&gt;Target Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that drew a crowd of 12,000 people. The convention featured former Minnesota governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJesse%20Ventura"&gt;Jesse Ventura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , widely speculated to make a presidential run in &lt;a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202012"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;. During the convention Ventura &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A9/11%20Truth%20Movement"&gt;questioned the mainstream account of responsibility for the 9/11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .
BULLET::::- Following the Republican Convention McCain experienced a surge in polling, which greatly reduced Obama’s slight lead and showed McCain with a lead in most polling for the first time since May 2008. The selection of Palin also increased Republican voter enthusiasm in the polls.
BULLET::::- Following the stock market crash later in September and the subsequent negotiations for a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEmergency%20Economic%20Stabilization%20Act%20of%202008"&gt;bailout plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Senator McCain suspended his campaign and returned to &lt;a href="Washington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; to try to reach an agreement. He asked Senator Obama to join him and postpone the debate scheduled for later in the week but Obama responded that he could do both and that he would show up for the debate at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Mississippi"&gt;University of Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .
BULLET::::- On the day of the debate, questions swirled over whether or not McCain would show, he did and the debate was held. The debate moderated by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Lehrer"&gt;Jim Lehrer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was supposed to surround foreign policy but the economic crisis took center stage, which Obama and McCain mostly agreed upon. The differences surrounded McCain’s differences with Obama on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War%20troop%20surge%20of%202007"&gt;surge policy in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Obama’s earlier suggestion that he would meet with leaders of rogue nations without preconditions.
BULLET::::- Democrats
BULLET::::- As most media attention surrounded Sarah Palin in the beginning of September, Obama-&lt;a href="Joe%20Biden"&gt;Biden&lt;/a&gt; fell in the polls and were not at the focus of most news stories, however on September 11, Obama and McCain called a truce and met in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; for the seventh anniversary of &lt;a href="9/11"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- Barack Obama launched an ad campaign that criticized John McCain as “out of touch” and “out of date” highlighting his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20literacy"&gt;computer illiteracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Biden criticized his running mate’s ad as “terrible” and also criticized an ad by the McCain campaign from earlier in the month that suggested that Obama supports &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asex%20education"&gt;sex education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akindergarten"&gt;kindergarten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; level children.
BULLET::::- Later in September Obama abandoned his earlier 50-state strategy withdrawing resources from traditional red states such as &lt;a href="North%20Dakota"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Montana"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28US%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; that Obama stated he would contest. The campaign removed staffers from some states and sent them to nearby states considered to be winnable, such as from Georgia to &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- Following the economic crisis, Obama’s numbers raised significantly in the polls leading McCain by as many as seven points by the end of the month. Obama asked McCain to appear with him at a press conference to restore consumer confidence. Obama also joined McCain in Washington to help with the negotiations on a bailout plan. But he rejected McCain’s call to postpone the presidential debate.
BULLET::::- At the presidential debate many critics believed Obama presented himself as presidential, the task many claimed he needed to accomplish. During the debate Obama linked the financial crisis to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush%20Administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; policies and spoke out against the lead up to the &lt;a href="war%20in%20Iraq"&gt;war in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and the need for more troops in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

BULLET::::- Third parties
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALibertarian%20Party"&gt;Libertarian Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; presidential nominee &lt;a href="Bob%20Barr"&gt;Bob Barr&lt;/a&gt; asked Congressman and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201988"&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Libertarian Party presidential nominee &lt;a href="Ron%20Paul"&gt;Ron Paul&lt;/a&gt; to run with him as his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arunning%20mate"&gt;running mate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Barr’s running mate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Allyn%20Root"&gt;Wayne Allyn Root&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; volunteered to step down if Paul accepted, but he declined.
BULLET::::- Congressman Ron Paul appeared at a press conference with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution%20Party"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Green%20Party"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ’s presidential nominees &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Baldwin"&gt;Chuck Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACynthia%20McKinney"&gt;Cynthia McKinney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as well as Independent candidate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Nader"&gt;Ralph Nader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He announced that he was endorsing all four major third party candidates including Libertarian nominee Bob Barr.
BULLET::::- After Barr admonished Paul for his endorsement of four candidates, believing the congressman should endorse &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Barr%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008"&gt;his campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Paul removed his endorsement for Barr and decided in a statement to endorse Constitution Party nominee &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Baldwin%20presidential%20campaign"&gt;Chuck Baldwin’s campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a candidate whom he called a “friend” and an “active supporter” of his campaign.
BULLET::::- Following the presidential debate in which he was not allowed to participate in, Barr criticized both presidential candidates for their support of the bailout plan; he called it a “debate between big government and bigger government.” Barr then referred to himself as the “change” candidate.

<h1>Fire ruins historical building of Prague Exhibition Grounds</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fire%20ruins%20historical%20building%20of%20Prague%20Exhibition%20Grounds&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The left wing of the Industrial Palace (Průmyslový palác) – central building of the &lt;a href="w%3APrague"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; Exhibition Grounds (Výstaviště) in the capital city of &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by fire yesterday night. The fire began at the roof and flames were visible from kilometers away. Two hundred firefighters fought the fire and got it under control in less than three hours. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries.

The left wing of the &lt;a href="w%3AArt%20Nouveau"&gt;Art Nouveau&lt;/a&gt; building was destroyed, the roof and most of enclosure walls collapsed. The amount of damage can rise up to 1 billion Czech crowns (approx. 40 million euro). Although a student music festival was organized in close surroundings, none were injured.

Mayor of Prague &lt;a href="w%3APavel%20B%C3%A9m"&gt;Pavel Bém&lt;/a&gt; promised the city will rebuild the Palace, but refused to comment immediately on the view of the new or renewed building.

The Industrial Palace was inaugurated in 1891. It was the biggest building on the exhibition grounds. Architect Bedřich Münzberger used the glassed-in steel structures for the first time in the Czech lands. The building was 238 meters long and its main tower was 51 meters tall. It was used mainly for trade fairs and exhibitions, but also for concerts and other culture events.

The cause of the fire is under investigation, and could take a week to discover the cause. Press reports suggest the fire is connected to the October 9 murder of businessman Václav Kočka junior, whose father is engaged in the Incheba company and has been leasing the exhibition grounds since 2001. Václav Kočka senior is a friend of former Czech prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AJi%C5%99%C3%AD%20Paroubek"&gt;Jiří Paroubek&lt;/a&gt;. However, authorities mentioned an accident – explosion of pressure gas cylinder – was the probable cause. Incheba said they have video of the explosion recorded from the security cameras.

A judge in &lt;a href="Nebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; has dismissed a lawsuit that was filed against '&lt;a href="w%3AGod"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;' saying that no address can be located to serve the higher power the court papers.

"Given that this court finds that there can never be service effectuated on the named defendant this action will be dismissed with prejudice," said Judge Marlon Polk.

In 2007, Nebraska state Senator &lt;a href="w%3AErnie%20Chambers"&gt;Ernie Chambers&lt;/a&gt;, who represents legislative District 11 in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Omaha%2C%20Nebraska"&gt;North Omaha&lt;/a&gt;, filed the lawsuit on Friday September 18. According to court documents obtained by &lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;, Chambers had decided to sue God, looking for a judge to issue a "permanent injunction" against the highest power.

Chambers said in his suit that God has spread fear across the globe causing "widespread death, destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of the Earth's inhabitants. [God also caused] fearsome floods, horrendous hurricanes, earthquakes, plagues, &lt;a href="w%3AFamine"&gt;famine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocidal&lt;/a&gt; wars, birth defects, terrifying tornadoes and the like", and he wants the courts to order God "to cease certain harmful activities and the making of terroristic threats."

Chambers is examining Polk's ruling and has not yet decided if he will file an appeal. Chambers says that "God knows everything", and therefore is well aware of the lawsuit that was filed against the higher power. Chambers also states that the court acknowledged his existence which "is a recognition of God's omniscience."

"The court itself acknowledges the existence of God. Since God knows everything, God has notice of this lawsuit," said Chambers.

If Chambers decides to appeal the decision, he must do so within 30 days of the Judge's ruling.

The suit was an apparent retaliation for a 2007 ruling where the words 'rape' and 'victim' were banned from a criminal case involving a sexual assault incident. The woman who was assaulted, Tory Bowen, filed a lawsuit against Jeffrey Cheuvront, a district judge in the city of &lt;a href="w%3ALancaster%2C%20Nebraska"&gt;Lancaster&lt;/a&gt; when he banned the use of those words in her criminal case. Chambers says that her lawsuit is "frivolous" and he filed his suit to show people that "anybody can sue anybody."

"This lawsuit having been filed and being of such questionable merit creates a circumstance where my lawsuit is appropriately filed. People might call it frivolous but if they read it they'll see there are very serious issues I have raised," stated Chambers in 2007.

Today in &lt;a href="w%3ADawson%20Creek%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Dawson Creek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, at 9:15 a.m. local time, police reported that two gas pipeline bombs have now hit the area. 

As a result of these incidents, local residents are now concerned for their safety. The two explosions were targeting gas pipelines operated by &lt;a href="w%3AEnCana"&gt;EnCana&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt; border. 

The most recent blast was discovered yesterday, and the reports show that terrorists weren’t involved in this incident. 

Despite this, the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; (RCMP) have stated that they have brought in their terrorism unit to help investigate the incident, as the bombs targeted the province’s infrastructure. 

The latest explosion site was discovered on Thursday by the pipeline workers, and the fact that the explosion resembles another pipeline blast in the area earlier this month which has caused the residents to be worried. The explosion damaged the pipeline, but it was quickly sealed by the workers as reported by the officials.

Investigators are looking to find a link between these two explosions, and have asked the residents not to panic.

Brazilian police participating in a protest march in São Paulo found themselves under attack from military police last night. Clothed as civilians, the officers were striking against low wages and protesting human rights violations by the government when rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas were fired at them.

The civil police officers had been on strike for a month, demanding a 15% pay increase. They had hoped their demands for a meeting with the governor would be met during the demonstration.

The attacks started as the demonstrators and strikers met a police barricade blocking the Palacio dos Bandeirantes, the city's government center, where the governor was working. The governor responded by ordering the riot police on the demonstrators, and later defended himself by accusing many of the marchers of not being police officers but 'political opportunists'.

At least 22 people were injured, including a police negotiator who was treated in a nearby hospital. One officer was wounded by a shot in the leg.

Russ Tolman was one of the first people to complain about the issue. "I work in a large school district that doesn't like Macs. One thing that has allowed us to keep them has been the ability to image them with firewire ports," he stated. "In my unknowledgeable opinion Apple really screwed up with no Firewire port. Schools without much money will be moving to cheap PC's."

Apple's MacBook Pro computers will continue to have a FireWire port, although cost significantly more than the MacBook.

Apple responded to these criticisms in a statement by saying that "Actually, all of the new HD camcorders of the past few years use USB 2." While camcorders are a popular FireWire peripheral, &lt;a href="http%3A//macspeedzone.com/archive/5.0/de/firewire.html"&gt;FireWire is used for a variety of other devices&lt;/a&gt;.

Apple's press release did not mention the fact the FireWire was removed from the MacBook, although it did mention that the MacBook Pro has one FireWire port. 

The MacBook Pro costs &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt; 1,999, while the standard MacBook costs $1,299.

The long-lost tomb of&lt;a href="w%3A%20Marcus%20Nonius%20Macrinus"&gt;Marcus Nonius Macrinus&lt;/a&gt;, the inspiration of the character Maximus Decimus Meridius in &lt;a href="w%3ARidley%20Scott"&gt;Ridley Scott&lt;/a&gt;'s popular film '&lt;a href="w%3AGladiator%20%282000%20film%29"&gt;Gladiator&lt;/a&gt;', was discovered off the ancient &lt;a href="w%3AVia%20Flaminia"&gt;Via Flaminia&lt;/a&gt; road in Rome this Thursday.

Pieces of the tomb first began to emerge from the ground during construction for a residential complex along the &lt;a href="w%3ATiber%20River"&gt;Tiber River's&lt;/a&gt; banks.

The archaeological finding was "the most important ancient Roman monument to come to light for 20 or 30 years", said Daniela Rossi, who was a top member of the effort in finding the tomb. The Superintendent of Archaeology in Rome, Angelo Bottini, described the tomb as "a monument of great beauty". 

Cristiano Ranieri led the effort along with other archaeologists, who are still working hard to fully uncover the site. The team hopes to find the sarcophagus of the ancient hero among the sprawling tomb.

Marble columns fifteen meters wide, inscriptions, decorations, writings and other priceless treasures have been preserved thanks to an ancient flood from the Tiber River. 

The massive tomb details the life of the ancient gladiator through ten inscriptions, whose history differed greatly from the movie's version. The two had only shared being close friends and generals of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. The historical version of the character had lived on to become wealthy and famous, while the character played by &lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Crowe"&gt;Russell Crowe&lt;/a&gt; had a tragic ending.

Plans are underway to turn the area into the Via Flaminia Archaeological Park, with the tomb as the central attraction.

The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) has released a report saying that an illness they named 'mobile phone dermatitis', in which individuals owning a cell phone have developed a rash on the side of their face, is likely linked to &lt;a href="w%3Anickel"&gt;nickel&lt;/a&gt; deposits in the metal of some &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20phone"&gt;cellular phones&lt;/a&gt;. Nickel has been known to cause rashes on those who have a sensitivity to, or are allergic to the metal. Nickel is also mixed with other metals to make jewelry.

The Association says that the condition is likely to affect people who spend too much time talking on the phone. They found that those who spend too much time text messaging or talking for long periods on the phone, were most likely to develop a rash, sometimes severe, on their face and ears, or the tips of their fingers.

Tests in January, performed on 22 cellular phones by scientists at &lt;a href="w%3ABrown%20University"&gt;Brown University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Rhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, had found that just under half, a total of 10, contained nickel while the rest had rubber buttons and a plastic case. Initially the rashes were unexplained, and researchers could not find a reason why so many individuals began to experience the symptoms. In most cases the rashes were untreatable. 

"Cell phones intended for rugged use ... often have rubber coating and no surface nickel. Those with more fashionable designs often have metallic accents and are more likely to contain free nickel in their casings," said Lionel Bercovitch MD., one of the researchers, in a report in the journal for the Canadian Medical Association on January 1, 2008.

Researchers also state that although some people may not be allergic to nickel, "prolonged" and continuous exposure to it can cause severe reactions.

"Prolonged or repetitive contact with a nickel-containing phone is more likely to cause a skin reaction in those who are allergic," said BAD dermatologist Dr. Graham Lowe in a press release. In the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; alone, BAD says nearly 30% of the population suffers from rashes brought on by prolonged exposure to the metal.

The researchers also recommend individuals to buy swab test kits to test for traces of nickel.

On August 21, the &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; weekly ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APrzekr%C3%B3j"&gt;Przekrój&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ published an advertisement for Dan-Mark exercise books, bearing the logo of &lt;a href="w%3Apl%3A4fun.tv"&gt;4fun.tv&lt;/a&gt;, a Polish music/interactive TV station. Part of the advertisement contained a definition of the word "exercise book". The wording looked familiar, and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ consulted ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the collaborative online encyclopedia.

Upon seeing the ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ definition, it appeared that the entry quoted in the promotional material was identical to the initial two paragraphs of the relevant ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ entry.

Freelance reporters for the Polish ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ decided to find out the reason for such a similarity and whether either of the texts (the advertisement's or Wikipedia's) might be a case of &lt;a href="w%3ACopyright"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt; violation. 

The reporters contacted a Jarosław Janas, Creative Director of ♡❤4fun.tv.♡❤, where the ad appeared. His reply included the following claim:

Copyright on text does not last for fifty years as claimed by Janas, but for 70 years after the death of the author.

To investigate the authenticity of the above claims, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ asked the main author of the two paragraphs in question, Wikipedian &lt;a href="w%3Apl%3AWikipedysta%3AJulo"&gt;Julo&lt;/a&gt;, about the sources used to write the entry. He confirmed that he had written the text in question, and not copied it from an encyclopedic publication as claimed by Jana.

It is therefore impossible that both Julo and the people responsible for the exercise book advertisement have used the same uncopyrighted encyclopedia, thus coincidentally creating identical texts. The reporters also noted that the first draft of the introduction to the article was written by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Apl%3Auser%3AWaldemarWolskiHuta"&gt;WaldemarWolskiHuta&lt;/a&gt; (February 2006). Afterward the text had undergone some modifications by Julo (September 2006), as well as &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Apl%3Auser%3APicus%20viridis"&gt;Picus viridis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Apl%3Auser%3ABeno"&gt;Beno&lt;/a&gt; (March 2008). However, the text presented in the press promotional material, which - according to 4fun.tv - came from an old-print encyclopedia is identical to the Wikipedia entry after the changes mentioned above had been made. Julo added that he was still alive, together with the other authors of the article in question who constituted the group of the copyright co-holders. This naturally led to a conclusion that neither 50 nor 70 years could have passed since their death. He left 4fun.tv's actions with a comment that although the contents he and the other Wikimedians had made public and free, they are far from making them available in any "free style", but under a specified license.

In follow up messages to Jarosław Janas, Wikinews reporters confronted the creative director over his seemingly inaccurate claims. 

Wikinews was told in a reply that 4fun.tv would ignore the claims unless they see permission from the author of the original content to investigate this story. They were also informed that further e-mails without any ♡❤specifics♡❤ sent by the reporter would be qualified as spam. 4fun.tv's creative director further added that he found the reporter's picture on the Internet and asked how the person would feel if this picture was to appear on billboards or press releases that advertised the TV station.

Wikipedia does allow copying of its content under certain conditions. The encyclopedia's content is released under the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGFDL"&gt;GNU Free Documentation License&lt;/a&gt;, which means that it can be copied, modified, and used commercially and non-commercially - under the conditions that the license's text is included with the copied content and the five main authors are mentioned. If a part of the article is used, like in the example quoted in this news story, a "right to quote", recognized by Polish law, may be used. In such a case it suffices to mention the source of the text (Polish Wikipedia) and the author of the excerpt. 4fun.tv met none of these conditions, meaning that copyright has been violated.

Over a year ago Polish Wikinews reported on . Since that time such "borrowings" have become less frequent, however photos are still being used in discordance with the license. Journalists have gotten used to citing sources, e.g. Wikipedia, although licensing conditions require attributing the actual author, not the source. So instead of attributing John Doe for his contribution, agencies like Polska Agencja Prasowa (♡❤Polish Press Agency♡❤) are attributing the source, Wikipedia.

In early September 2008 a similar situation occurred in relation to the Polish edition of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWiktionary"&gt;Wiktionary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGazeta%20Wyborcza"&gt;Gazeta Wyborcza&lt;/a&gt;, a Polish daily, published an IKEA advertisement, on the opening page of which an almost word-for-word Wiktionary entry was placed; additionally the advertisement used the characteristic MediaWiki layout. The reference to the external source used was missing.

In April 2008, an example of an Australian professor was cited; the scientist, in a reply to a news story, quoted a Wikipedia definition almost word-for-word. The same professor condemned the use of Wikipedia in his previous press appearances.

In 2005 Wikipedia material was discovered in the German weekly magazine &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ADer%20Spiegel"&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/a&gt;, which acknowledged its fault and published appropriate apologies in place of the article in the online edition.

&lt;a href="w%3AFrontline%20%28magazine%29"&gt;♡❤Frontline♡❤&lt;/a&gt; magazine in 2007 was found using an image from Wikipedia without proper credit. When pointed out the magazine acknowledged the failing and a correction was promptly given in the subsequent issue.

In a rare one-on-one interview with the editor in chief of the journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AScience%20%28journal%29"&gt;Science Magazine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ published online on Friday, &lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Premier of the People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;, acknowledged that although companies were to blame, the government was also partially responsible in the recent &lt;a href="w%3AMelamine"&gt;melamine&lt;/a&gt; contamination of milk and infant formula from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

"We feel that although problems occurred at the company, the government also has a responsibility," said the Premier. He added that testing requirements should be installed for all important steps in the production process, and that all food should meet international standards. Responsibility for food safety implementations will lie with the Chinese Ministry of Health.

The two-hour conversation between chief editor &lt;a href="w%3ABruce%20Alberts"&gt;Bruce Alberts&lt;/a&gt; and Premier Wen already took place on September 30th. A Chinese version of the interview was published in the communist party newspaper &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Daily"&gt;People's Daily&lt;/a&gt;.

Earlier this week, batches of an injectable herbal medication based on &lt;a href="w%3Aginseng"&gt;ginseng&lt;/a&gt; were recalled after three people died. Wandashan Pharmaceutical all of its injectable herbal remedies. On Saturday, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; suspended imports of a leavening agent used in baking because it tested positive for melamine.

In the milk incident, melamine was added to make the milk appear richer in protein. It caused an estimated 53,000 to become ill, mostly young children. The chemical can cause &lt;a href="w%3Akidney%20stone"&gt;kidney stones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARenal%20failure"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt;.

However, the issues of China's food industry are only mentioned tangentially. The Premier spoke about social, economic and scientific issues facing his country. Wen explained his "scientific outlook on development", which tries to found social and economic progress for the people, in a sustainable fashion and with decreased disparities, on a scientific basis. An example is the use of &lt;a href="w%3ATransgenic%20plant"&gt;transgenic crops&lt;/a&gt; in rural areas, which decreases the need for pesticides.

On the matter of fossil fuels, the Premier explained how "every year, China produces about 180 million tons of crude oil and imports about 170 million tons. China’s dependency on foreign oil is almost 50%. China’s coal production exceeds 2.5 billion tons a year. This kind of huge consumption of energy, especially non-renewable fossil fuel, will not be sustainable." He reiterated China's belief in the "common but differentiated responsibility" principle, in agreement with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Framework%20Convention%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;.

At the end of the interview, the Premier agreed that the scientific communities could build bridges between countries, even if their governments disagreed. "More scientific language and less diplomatic rhetoric could make this
world even better," he concluded.

The 66-year-old engineer specialised in &lt;a href="w%3Ageomechanics"&gt;geomechanics&lt;/a&gt; began his second 5-year term as head of the cabinet last March. During his office, China witnessed highlights like the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;Olympics in Beijing&lt;/a&gt; and the recent &lt;a href="w%3AShenzhou%207"&gt;Shenzhou 7 space launch&lt;/a&gt;, but also international criticism, for example on the situation in &lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;.

In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3A%20P%C3%BAblico%20%28Spain%29"&gt;Público&lt;/a&gt;, a Spanish newspaper, the prime minister of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Luis%20Rodriguez%20Zapatero"&gt;Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;, has stated that " if there is a global recession, it seems logical to expect that Spain will enter the recession in 2009 ."

In the interview Zapatero also described the worldwide economic situation as "difficult." He recognized that " the developed countries are or are going to experience &lt;a href="wikt%3Anegative%20growth"&gt;negative growth&lt;/a&gt;, and developing countries are also going to see falling growth; resulting in a worldwide loss of jobs."
Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero continued by saying that "the financial system is a part of the economy, a crucial part. We have a year-long financial crisis, which has had its most acute moment in the past two months, and I think now the financial markets are beginning to recover."

Asked about whether it would be desirable to another plan to help those overwhelmed by the size of their mortgage, Zapatero reiterated the falls in the &lt;a href="w%3AEuro%20Interbank%20Offered%20Rate"&gt;Euro Interbank Offered Rate&lt;/a&gt; . 

Zapatero then claimed that the average Spanish citizen would see their mortgage decrease by &lt;a href="w%3A%E2%82%AC"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;28 a month (€330 per year) as result of the recent drops in interest rate, lead by seven central banks, including the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Central%20Bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt; which covers Spain, dropped their interest rate by 0.5%.

The prime minister then said that he was pleased with the role of Spain in the recent summits discussing the financial crisis, before adding that he believes the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; will lead the way in solving the current issues in the markets.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AInterstellar%20Boundary%20Explorer"&gt;Interstellar Boundary Explorer&lt;/a&gt; (IBEX) to map the boundary between the solar system and interstellar space will be launched on a &lt;a href="w%3APegasus%20rocket"&gt;Pegasus XL rocket&lt;/a&gt; today. The two year mission, costing US$165 million, will study the region in space where the solar wind from the sun suddenly slows down as it reaches the thin, cold gas of interstellar space. This region, called the &lt;a href="w%3AHeliosphere"&gt;heliospheric&lt;/a&gt; boundary of the solar system, helps to deflect most of the potentially life-threatening forms of radiation coming from elsewhere in our galaxy.

IBEX will ride Pegasus to around 200 kilometres from earth, before boosting itself into its final earth orbit 322,000 kilometres away. The probe will capture energetic neutral atoms (ENAs), which are formed when positive ions in the solar wind hit neutral atoms of interstellar material and rip out electrons from them. IBEX-Lo and -Hi detectors will collect data on the ENAs to create a three-dimensional map of the heliosphere.

The heliospheric boundary was first probed by &lt;a href="w%3AVoyager%201"&gt;Voyager 1&lt;/a&gt; in 2004 and later by &lt;a href="w%3AVoyager%202"&gt;Voyager 2&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. The data from the two missions indicated several indentations on the heliospheric boundary. It is hoped that IBEX studies may reveal the cause of these indentations. 

Recent observations indicate the solar wind pressure has weakened by 25 percent over the past decade and is presently at its weakest level in 50 years. Ibex studies could help confirm whether and why the heliosphere is shrinking. Scientists postulate that if the heliosphere continues to weaken, the amount of cosmic radiation reaching the inner parts of our solar system, including earth will increase. This could trigger growing levels of disruption to electrical equipment, damage satellites and possibly harm life on earth.

"Around 90 per cent of the galactic cosmic radiation is deflected by our heliosphere, so the boundary protects us from this harsh galactic environment," said Nathan Schwadron, co-investigator on the IBEX mission at &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20University"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;. "IBEX gives us a chance to look at how our Solar System's bubble fits in as a tiny piece of the entire Galaxy," claimed David McComas of the &lt;a href="w%3ASouthwest%20Research%20Institute"&gt;Southwest Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and IBEX's principal investigator.

Dmitriy Guzner, aged 18, will admit to the charges related to carrying out the DDoS attack. He now faces a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment.

In response to incidents such as these, Scientology have called Anonymous "cyber-terrorists."

A DDoS attack occurs when multiple computers are used to attack a certain website with so much traffic that it is not accessible. The hackers attack the servers taking up all the available space, preventing the legitimate user from accessing. 
United States Attorney's Office released a statement on this issue. "A New Jersey man was charged today for his role in an attack on Church of Scientology websites in January 2008 that rendered the websites unavailable," they said. "Dmitriy Guzner, 18, of Verona, New Jersey, has agreed to plead guilty to computer hacking for his role in the distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack against the Scientology websites. "

In &lt;a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, a suspicious package was received by National Action Financial Services, a subsidiary of &lt;a href="w%3ASitel"&gt;Sitel, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson Earl Gould Buffalo, the initial call was placed at 10:30AM EST Yesterday. The mail department found the package, evacuated the building, and contacted the local police department. The package has been described as containing some type of white powder.

The police department then contacted the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;, who finished at the scene by 3:00PM EST.

After interviews with several employees were refused, one agreed - after being only identified as ♡❤KR♡❤. He said management was being very "hush hush" about the incident, but when he came in he jokingly said that it was a "regular day at work now".

National Action Financial media contacts were not available for comment, and the Amherst Police Department referred Wikinews to the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI%20Buffalo%20Field%20Office"&gt;local FBI office&lt;/a&gt;.

Special Agent Earl Gould stated as of 4:30PM no hospitalizations were required, but could not comment further as it is an ongoing investigation. He also stated the first responders to the scene did "everything right, and contained it immediately."

The Church, on October 18, 2008 accused ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ of being involved in the November 2007 shooting at &lt;a href="w%3AJokela%20school%20shooting"&gt;Jokela High School&lt;/a&gt;, in which a man named Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot and killed nine people, including himself.

"Anonymous member Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot and killed seven students, a nurse and a teacher at Jokela High School in Finland before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life," said the Church in the October 18 press release. On October 17, the President of the Church of Scientology in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Carmichael%20%28Scientologist%29"&gt;John Carmichael&lt;/a&gt;, also accused ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ of being behind the shooting. 
One month ago, an article on &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;'s citizen journalism wing, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AI-Report"&gt;iReport&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, also accused Anonymous of being behind the shooting, and several other alleged terrorist plots. The article also went on to accuse ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ of being behind the suicide of 14-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ASuicide%20of%20Megan%20Meier"&gt;Megan Meier&lt;/a&gt; who killed herself after being 'cyber-bullied'. Scientology says the initial attack was done by a member of ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ named Josh Evans, who later turned out to be a false alias created by Lori Drew, the mother of one of Meier's friends. Meier's mother had previously had a falling out with Drew.

♡❤Wikinews♡❤ contacted the &lt;a href="w%3AKeskusrikospoliisi"&gt;National Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (NBI) in Finland by e-mail, seeking evidence or a statement to confirm or deny any connection to ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ and verify or debunk the claim made by the Church. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ was able to confirm that there was no connection between ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ and the 2007 shooting.

"According to the leader of the criminal investigation of the Jokela High School Shooting in 2007, there was no link between the group called 'Anonymous' and the offender [Auvinen]," said Tapio Ahola, Detective Chief Inspector of the NBI to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.

The Church also accuses ♡❤Anonymous♡❤ of plotting terrorist attacks against other schools, stadiums and even plotting a mall massacre which would allegedly have taken place in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. 
The Church says that Jarrad Willis, who was arrested and questioned after posting the hoax massacre threat on ♡❤4chan.org♡❤, committed suicide while awaiting charges of internet crimes. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ found that his suicide happened just one day before he was to be charged for a crime unrelated to the threat and that authorities had dropped all other charges against him, in relation to the hoax.

The accusations appear to be part of a Scientology tactic developed by the organization's founder, &lt;a href="w%3AL.%20Ron%20Hubbard"&gt;L. Ron Hubbard&lt;/a&gt; called "&lt;a href="w%3AFair%20Game%20%28Scientology%29"&gt;fair-game&lt;/a&gt;". The Church uses this tactic to harass people, often fabricating lies and defamation against those who protest or criticize their beliefs. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ contacted the Church several times by e-mail for a statement, but the Church has yet to reply.

Dr. Jerald Block is a &lt;a href="w%3Apsychiatrist"&gt;psychiatrist&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href="w%3APortland"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Block has attracted some media attention due to one theory of his - the idea that &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; addiction can be viewed as a distinct mental condition.

In an interview with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤, Dr. Block discusses this theory, including what needs to be done about it, and the alleged violent response that can arise from an addict's withdrawal. Below is the full exclusive interview.

<h2>Interview</h2>

 ♡❤♡When and how did you first come up with the idea that it is possible to become addicted to the Internet?♡❤♡

&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s first unmanned lunar mission was launched off of the shore of Andhra Pradesh this morning. India now joins the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; as the only powers that have demonstrated their ability to launch satellites to the moon.

The &lt;a href="w%3AChandrayaan-1"&gt;Chandrayaan-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20probe"&gt;lunar probe&lt;/a&gt; was launched from the &lt;a href="w%3ASatish%20Dhawan%20Space%20Centre"&gt;Satish Dhawan Space Centre&lt;/a&gt; at 6:22 am (00:52 UTC) in &lt;a href="w%3ASriharikota"&gt;Sriharikota&lt;/a&gt;, which is about 88 km (55 mi) north of the southern Indian city of &lt;a href="w%3AChennai"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt;. The cost of this mission is estimated at 3.4 billion rupees (US$78 million). While the launch has been criticized for being a waste of Indian government funds, when the money can go towards more humanitarian causes, India is hopeful that its venture will put it into competition for commercial satellite launch services. The satellite features five components built by India's technology sector, and six components from foreign nations.

The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) C-11 is the rocket which will carry the Chandryaan-1 satellite probe. The probe is being sent on a two-year orbital mission around the moon for achieving substantial goals for a detailed map of the mineral resources, chemical and topographical characteristics of the moon's surface. Some of the mission will include examining the surface for sources of water, and taking comparison photos of the light side and dark sides of the surface.

Both China and Japan already have satellites of their own orbiting the moon, and just last month China became the third country in the world to carry out its own independent space walks. India's previous space endeavors have mainly been related to launching weather and communications satellites.

In reading the court's verdict, one judge stated, "Thaksin violated the article of the constitution on conflict of interest, as he was then prime minister and head of government, and was supposed to work for the benefit of the public, ... He is sentenced to two years in jail."

Despite his wife, &lt;a href="w%3APotjaman%20Shinawatra"&gt;Potjaman Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, having escaped sentencing in the Ratchadaphisek land deal case, she still faces jail time on return to Thailand. During July she was convicted of tax evasion and a warrant is outstanding for her to face three years in jail for that conviction. The Ratchadaphisek case centred around approximately thirteen acres of land in central Bangkok that was sold to her in 2003 for a knock-down price of 772 million baht (US$ 22.5 million).

With the law in Thailand barring ministers and their partners from doing business with government agencies, groups who protested for the removal of Thaksin are pleased with the result. &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Alliance%20for%20Democracy"&gt;People's Alliance for Democracy&lt;/a&gt; (PAD) supporters were reportedly shouting, "We've won!" at the announcement of the verdict. They had watched a live telecast of the court's ruling, hailing activist Veera Somkwamkid who filed the case as a hero.
&lt;a href="w%3ASomchai%20Wongsawat"&gt;Somchai Wongsawat&lt;/a&gt;, the country's current Prime Minister and Thaksin's brother-in-law, has given assurances that the current government will not interfere in the court's ruling. In speaking to journalists after the ruling was handed down he stressed that the case only covered violation of the National Counter Commission Act barring government officials from involvement where they may have oversight. This was seen as the reason for Thaksin's wife, Potjaman escaping prosecution in this case.

The case's chief prosecutor has called on Britain to speedily extradite ex-PM Thaksin so he may begin his jail term. A number of other warrants for his arrest remain outstanding from additional cases brought over his time in office.

"Having taken action on the banking system, we must now take action on the global financial recession," he said, speaking to &lt;a href="w%3AMembers%20of%20Parliament"&gt;Members of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (MPs). "[There will be a] recession in America, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and - because no country can insulate itself from it - Britain too," he continued.

These comments echo those made recently by &lt;a href="w%3AMervyn%20King"&gt;Mervyn King&lt;/a&gt;, governor of the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20England"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;.

Leader of the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; said that Brown should take some of the blame for the crisis. "He claimed the credit in the boom, why won't he take responsibility in the bust?"

Sushil Wadhwani, who was formerly a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee also reacted to these recent comments. "The committee has been too slow to acknowledge the risks of a recession and they have fallen behind the curve," he said. "The consequence of their relative inactivity so far is that the recession is likely to be deeper and more prolonged than was necessary."

Markets today continued to fall dramatically. As of 15:30 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100"&gt;FTSE 100&lt;/a&gt; index had fallen by 152.18 point to a value of 4077.55, while the &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; fell back below 9,000 with a 2.89% drop.

__NOEDITSECTION__

Monday saw the latest edition of the vetted version of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which is aimed at educational use, go quietly online. The extensively revised version covers over five thousand topics, targeting the eight to seventeen years age group. Partnerships with the &lt;a href="w%3AShuttleworth%20Foundation"&gt;Shuttleworth Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and the Hole in the Wall project will see it distributed in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; as well as copies being available globally via the offices of SOS Children UK's umbrella organisation, SOS Kinderdorf worldwide.
First launched in 2006 as a 4,000 article edition, the extract of ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ has employed hi-tech distribution methods, as well as offering a website version which has steadily climbed up in ranking to above other reviewed ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ rivals and copies; the 2007 version was available on the &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apeer%20to%20peer"&gt;peer to peer&lt;/a&gt; network to keep distribution costs down and was equivalent to a fifteen-volume printed encyclopedia. Monday's release is compared to a twenty-volume print edition.
Key to the process for selecting articles is the English National Curriculum and similar educational standards around the world. The initial vision was to bring this wealth of knowledge to schools where access to the Internet was poor or unavailable, but copies of ♡❤Wikipedia for Schools♡❤ can be found on many first world school intranets and web servers. Among the compelling reasons to adopt the project are the vetting and additional study materials which overcome the oft-publicised concerns many educators have with the million article plus ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ that anyone can edit.

In today's press release announcing the launch, Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director &lt;a href="w%3ASue%20Gardner"&gt;Sue Gardner&lt;/a&gt; expressed delight at seeing the project bring out a new version, "Our goal is to make Wikipedia accessible to as many people as possible around the world, and SOS Children is a great partner that helps us make that happen. Wikipedia is released under a free content license so that individuals and institutions can easily adapt, reuse and customize its content: we encourage others, like SOS Children, to do exactly that."

Running 192 schools in the developing world, SOS Children sees ♡❤Wikipedia for Schools♡❤ as a key piece in fulfilling the educational aspect of their mission. SOS Children's Chairwoman, Mary Cockcroft gave us an introduction and, a ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤ administrator himself, the charity's CEO Andrew Cates spoke to ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ at length about the project.

♡❤♡♡❤Mary Cockcroft:♡❤♡♡❤ SOS Children['s Villages] is a "club" of member charities in 130 countries helping orphans and vulnerable children. The club elects SOS-Kinderdorf International as secretary. SOS is a large organisation whose members in aggregate turned over $1bn in 2007, and whose projects include owning and running 192 schools and family-based care for 70,000 children. However much of these funds are raised locally, with for example the member charities in each of India, Pakistan and South Africa raise considerably more funds in their own country than SOS UK does from the UK. Nonetheless SOS Children UK principally raises funds to finance projects in the developing world, and has only financially small projects in the UK (such as the Schools Wikipedia, which is very low cost because of extensive use of volunteers). This year we expect about 80% of our UK income will leave the UK for overseas SOS associations, and some of the remaining 20% will pay for project oversight. We do not spend money in the UK on Direct Mail or TV advertising. Our UK office is involved in overseeing projects we finance and a small number of high-skilled volunteers from the UK help overseas. However around 98% of SOS staff worldwide are local nationals, as are most volunteers.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; How much work does the UK charity actually carry out within the home country? Are there failings within the government system for orphans and other needy children that you feel obliged to remedy?

♡❤♡♡❤MC:♡❤♡♡❤ We are deeply unhappy about the situation of children in out-of-home care in the UK. However our care model of 168 hour-a-week resident mothers does not fit with the UK philosophy for children without parental care. Internationally SOS always has a policy of sharing best practice and we are working to improve understanding of our way of working, which appears to us to have far better outcomes than the existing one in the UK. Ultimately though the legal responsibility for these children lies with government and we cannot remedy anything without their invitation.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Who first came up with the idea of doing a vetted Wikipedia extract? What was the impetus? Was it more for the developing world than first world?

♡❤♡♡❤Andrew Cates:♡❤♡♡❤ I honestly cannot remember who first suggested it, but it came from somewhere in the Wikipedia community rather than from the charity. The original product was very much pitched at the developing world where the Internet is only available if at all over an expensive phone line. I worked in West Africa 1993-1996 and I know well at how thirsty for knowledge people are and how ingenious they will be in overcoming technical obstacles if the need for infrastructure is removed.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; In reading past year's announcements there's some pride in the project being picked up and used in the first world, was this expected or a pleasant surprise?

♡❤♡♡❤AC:♡❤♡♡❤ It was a pleasant surprise. I don't think we had realised what the barriers schools faced in using the main Wikipedia were. It isn't just pupils posting material about teachers or meeting strangers: the "Random Article" button on every page could potentially deliver an article on hardcore porn. We had already started when discussion broke on banning Wikipedia from classrooms and I am sure we benefited from it.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Can you give an outline of the selection and vetting process? Is it primarily Wikipedians working on this, or are people from the educational establishment brought in?

♡❤♡♡❤AC:♡❤♡♡❤ It was a long and painful process, even with a really good database system. Articles were taken into the proposal funnel from three main sources: direct proposals for inclusion from Wikipedians, lists which came from the Release Version team and proposals drawn up from working through National Curriculum subjects by SOS volunteers. In a few cases where we felt articles were missing we asked the community to write them (e.g. Portal:Early Modern Britain, which is a curriculum subject, was kindly written just for us): These "proposals" 
were then looked at by mainly SOS volunteers (some onwiki, some offline). Our offices are in the middle of Cambridge and we get high quality volunteers, who skim read each article and then compared two versions from the article history by credible WP editors a significant period apart (this picks up most graffiti vandalism which runs at about 3% of articles). Once they had identified a "best" version they marked any sections or text strings for deletion (sections which were just a list of links to other articles not included, empty sections, sex scandals etc). A substantial sample of each volunteers work was then doubled checked for quality by one of two office staff (of whom I was one). We then have a script which does some automated removals and clean ups. Once we had a selection we posted it to relevant wikiprojects and a few "experts" and got any extra steers.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Will you be making use of BitTorrent for distribution again this year? Was it a success in 2007?

♡❤♡♡❤AC:♡❤♡♡❤ BitTorrent was a bit disappointing in that it got us the only substantial criticisms we received online. A lot of people find it too much effort to use. However for the period we offered a straight &lt;a href="w%3Ahttp"&gt;http&lt;/a&gt;: download we had huge problems with spiders eating vast bandwidth (the file is 3.5G: a few thousand rogue spider downloads and it starts to hurt). As per last year therefore our main two channels will be free download by BitTorrent and mailing the DVDs free all over the world. At a pinch we will (as before) put straight copies up for individuals who cannot get it any other way, and we have some copies on memory sticks for on distributors.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Is it your opinion that the UK Government should be encouraging the adoption of projects like this as mainstream educational resources?

♡❤♡♡❤AC:♡❤♡♡❤ Clearly yes. We have had a very enthusiastic reaction from schools and the teaching community. We think every school should have an intranet copy. We expect the Government to catch on in a few years. That is not to say that Wikipedia is as good as resources developed by teachers for teachers such as lesson plans etc. but it is a fantastic resource.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; You're a Wikipedia administrator, all too often a thankless task. What prompted you to get involved in the first place? What are the most notable highs and lows of your involvement with the project?

♡❤♡♡❤AC:♡❤♡♡❤ Funnily the thing I have found most amazing about Wikipedia is not widely discussed, which is the effect of Wikipedia policies on new editors. I have seen countless extreme POV new editors, who come in and try to get their opinions included slowly learn not only that there are other opinions to consider but that elements of their own opinion which are not well founded. Watching someone arrive often (on pages on religions for example) full of condemnation for others, gradually become understanding and diplomatic is one of the biggest buzzes there is. The downside though is where correcting things which are wrong is too painfully slow because you need to find sources. I was a post-doc at Cambridge University in combustion and I know the article on Bunsen burners has several really significant errors concerning the flame structure and flow structure. But sadly I cannot correct it because I am still looking around for a reliable source.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Do you believe schools should encourage students to get involved contributing to the editable version of Wikipedia? Does SOS Children encourage those who are multilingual to work on non-English versions?

♡❤♡♡❤AC:♡❤♡♡❤ I think older students have a lot to learn from becoming involved in editing Wikipedia.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; To close, is there anything you'd like to add to encourage use of ♡❤Wikipedia for Schools♡❤, or to persuade educators to gain a better understanding of ♡❤Wikipedia♡❤?

♡❤♡♡❤AC:♡❤♡♡❤ I would encourage people to feed back to the project online or via the charity. The Wikipedia community set out to help educate the world and are broadly incredibly well motivated to help. As soon as we understand what can be done to improve things people are already on the task.

&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;((&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;font-size:smaller;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="desktop-only"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mobile-only"&gt;&lt;b&gt;))&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Thank you for your time.

An unknown person or persons wrote graffiti and vandalized the exterior of homes belonging to six members of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; congressional delegation from the state of &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; late last Monday night or early Tuesday morning.

According to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Tribune"&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Laurie Coleman, wife of U.S. Senator &lt;a href="w%3ANorm%20Coleman"&gt;Norm Coleman&lt;/a&gt;, found the words "U R A CRIMINAL, RESIGN OR ELSE! PSALM 2" written on the family's garage. The word "SCUM" was also written in three places on another side of the garage. &lt;a href="w%3AClaimed_Messianic_prophecies_of_Jesus%23Psalm_2"&gt;Psalm 2&lt;/a&gt; is a biblical reference.

The homes of senator &lt;a href="w%3AAmy%20Klobuchar"&gt;Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt;, and U.S. representatives &lt;a href="w%3AMichele%20Bachmann"&gt;Michele Bachmann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20Ellison%20%28politician%29"&gt;Keith Ellison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kline%20%28politician%29"&gt;John Kline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Ramstad"&gt;Jim Ramstad&lt;/a&gt; were also targeted by vandals. Ellison's house was the only one that sustained damage.
Peter Panos, St. Paul Police spokesman, told the ♡❤Star Tribune♡❤ that threatening message in the graffiti were cause for concern.

"We're looking at this as an actual threat," he told the ♡❤Star Tribune♡❤. "We're taking it quite seriously. Vandalism threats are pretty rare in this city."

Bachmann, Coleman, Kline and Ramstad are Republicans. Klobuchar and Ellison are Democrats. All live in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. Reps. &lt;a href="w%3ACollin%20Peterson"&gt;Collin Peterson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Oberstar"&gt;Jim Oberstar&lt;/a&gt;, who live in out state Minnesota, along with Rep. &lt;a href="w%3ABetty%20McCollum"&gt;Betty McCollum&lt;/a&gt; — who lives in a condominium, did not receive vandalism to their homes. 
Senate candidates &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Franken"&gt;Al Franken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADean%20Barkley"&gt;Dean Barkley&lt;/a&gt;, who are running against Coleman in the November elections, condemned the vandalism.
"There's no place for this unacceptable behavior in our political process, or in our communities," Franken's campaign told the &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Paul%20Pioneer%20Press"&gt;St. Paul Pioneer Press&lt;/a&gt;. The paper said that the Franken campaign office was the victim of graffiti attacks including the words "Crazy" and "No New Taxes."

&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Federal&lt;/a&gt; and local authorities are still investigating these incidents, as well as similar incidents that took place in &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;.

Over the weekend, a &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; hair salon was targeted. Police say it may have been a &lt;a href="w%3Acopycat"&gt;copycat&lt;/a&gt; vandal, though the salon is said to be patronized by Norm Coleman.

&lt;a href="w%3AKirk%20Shepherd"&gt;Kirk Shepherd&lt;/a&gt; is a professional &lt;a href="w%3Adarts"&gt;dart&lt;/a&gt;s player from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Kirk began playing competitively at 13 for his local pub, and was soon crowned Boys Champion at the &lt;a href="w%3AWinmau%20World%20Masters"&gt;Winmau World Masters&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. Shepherd was voted Young Player of the Year by the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Darts%20Organisation"&gt;British Darts Organisation&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 and 2006.

Shepherd is perhaps best known for his performance at the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20PDC%20World%20Darts%20Championship"&gt;2008 PDC World Darts Championship&lt;/a&gt;. Forced to qualify for the televised tournament, he then proceeded to knock out a number of well-known players live on television, including &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Jenkins"&gt;Terry Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Mardle"&gt;Wayne Mardle&lt;/a&gt; and former finalist &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Manley"&gt;Peter Manley&lt;/a&gt;. He ultimately went on to come second in the tournament, becoming the youngest ever finalist, and losing out to &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Part"&gt;John Part&lt;/a&gt; in the final.

He has also previously managed to defeat the then world number one, &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Anderson"&gt;Gary Anderson&lt;/a&gt;. Due to his performance at the world championship he will play in this year's &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Slam%20of%20Darts"&gt;Grand Slam of Darts&lt;/a&gt; next month. Ahead of that appearance Wikinews was able to conduct an interview with Kirk, which is now available below:

<h1>McCain volunteer fakes mutilation by Obama supporter</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=McCain%20volunteer%20fakes%20mutilation%20by%20Obama%20supporter&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Ashley Todd, a campaign volunteer for &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, who on Wednesday reported that she was attacked by an &lt;a href="w%3AObama"&gt;Obama&lt;/a&gt; supporter while using an &lt;a href="w%3AAutomated%20teller%20machine"&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, admitted on Friday that she had made up the story.

Todd had described her attacker as a tall, "dark-skinned African-American," who pressed a knife against her neck while she was using an ATM. She claimed that after she gave him $60, he noticed a McCain sticker on her car and proceeded to beat her before pinning her down and scratching a backwards "B" for "Barack" into her cheek with the knife. He then fled the scene, she said, though later she could not recall to which direction he fled.

He wanted to teach her a lesson, she said, and make her a &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt; supporter.

"It’s not like her cheek was carved out," a police spokeswoman said of the mutilation, referring to it as a "scratch" or "scrape." Todd did not seek medical attention, instead leaving for a friend's apartment and calling police almost an hour after the time she said she had been attacked.

The &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Police"&gt;Pittsburgh Police Department&lt;/a&gt; administered a polygraph test on Todd after spotting several inconsistencies in her story and finding that bank and video records showed she had not used the ATM machine. 

Police Commander Larry Ross said Todd's story began to change with subsequent interviews. "She added other things to it that we didn’t have at first, that she didn’t tell the initial officer," he said. Todd had added that the alleged attacker had "fondled" her in a follow-up interview, and later changed her story to say that she had been unconscious during the attack. 

Police say that Todd has suffered "mental problems" in the past. They do not believe anyone made her pull this hoax.

The story received widespread attention across the internet and mass media outlets, and was featured in a massive headline on conservative news aggregation website Drudge Report.

The McCain campaign said McCain and Palin had both spoken to her over the phone, offering their condolences. Obama later condemned the attack and called for the attacker to be brought to justice.

&lt;a href="w%3AStock%20markets"&gt;Stock markets&lt;/a&gt; around the world have fallen dramatically today. This is following the &lt;a href="w%3AEconomic%20crisis%20of%202008"&gt;ongoing events in the financial world&lt;/a&gt; and related statements by several &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; politicians, including Prime Minister &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;.

The British &lt;a href="w%3AFTSE%20100"&gt;FTSE 100&lt;/a&gt; index was one the indices that today suffered from large falls. It fell by 5.00% to slip below the four thousand mark, at 3,883.36 points.

Two of the major &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; indices saw falls of over two per cent. The &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; fell by 252.01 points (2.90%) to 8,439.24 by 17:30 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href="w%3ANasdaq%20Composite"&gt;Nasdaq Composite&lt;/a&gt; index experienced a 2.30% drop.

&lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;n markets performed particularly badly today. By 17:30 UTC, the Argentinean &lt;a href="w%3AMERVAL"&gt;MERVAL&lt;/a&gt; index had fallen by almost six per cent to 906.160 points, while the &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABovespa"&gt;Bovespa&lt;/a&gt; fell by 6.89% (2,328.45 points) to a value of 31,490.04.

David Buik of &lt;a href="w%3ABGC%20Partners"&gt;BGC Partners&lt;/a&gt; commented on today's falls. "It's carnage," he said. "Confidence is shot to ribbons. We need action now. It is a catastrophe that we have got to recession, but we have got to learn to live with it, and that means saving the markets."

In what appears to be a domestic disturbance, the mother and brother of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; singer and &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; winning actress &lt;a href="w%3AJennifer%20Hudson"&gt;Jennifer Hudson&lt;/a&gt; were shot and killed in their home in &lt;a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. Hudson's nephew has also been reported kidnapped from the crime scene and his mother cannot be located.

Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, and brother, Jason, were found dead at about 2:44 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;CDT&lt;/a&gt;) in Southern Chicago. Reports indicate that a relative found the bodies and called &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt;. Police say that there is no evidence of forced entry into the house.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAMBER%20Alert"&gt;AMBER Alert&lt;/a&gt; has been issued for Julian King, the 7-year-old nephew of Hudson. Police say that he was taken from the scene in a 1994 white &lt;a href="w%3AChevrolet%20Suburban"&gt;Chevrolet Suburban&lt;/a&gt; or a teal-green &lt;a href="w%3AChrysler%20Concorde"&gt;Chrysler Concorde&lt;/a&gt;. Police previously thought it likely that the boy was with William Balfour, whose relationship to Hudson or her family is not yet known, except that he listed Hudson's mother's address as a place of residence with the Illinois Department of Corrections. Balfour is currently in police custody and is being questioned, but King was not with him. Police say that the AMBER Alert remains in effect.

&lt;a href="w%3ATMZ.com"&gt;TMZ.com&lt;/a&gt; reports that Balfour is currently on parole from serving time in prison for attempted murder. Authorities consider him armed and dangerous. TMZ also notes that Hudson's sister Julia, Julian's mother, cannot be located and has not been seen since she ended her bus driving shift earlier in the day.

Unconfirmed reports have stated that Hudson was not at the house at the time of the incident. While some reports indicate that she was in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; where she was scheduled to begin filming a new music video on Monday, &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt; says that Hudson was in &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%2C%20Florida"&gt;Tampa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and is now on her way back to Chicago.

Two train stations in &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; have been bombed. No-one was injured in the attacks on the &lt;a href="w%3ABasque"&gt;Basque&lt;/a&gt;-area buildings, but there was some damage.

At 12:30 a.m. Saturday a small bomb described as being comprised of a mixture of explosives detonated in the ticket hall of the station in &lt;a href="w%3ABerriz"&gt;Berriz&lt;/a&gt;, bringing down the ceiling. This was followed by two homemade bombs being thrown at ticket machines at &lt;a href="w%3AAmorebieta"&gt;Amorebieta&lt;/a&gt;'s train station at 2:30.

Police cordoned off Amorebieta's station as a precaution. No claim of responsibility has been made, but one report comments that the Basque regional government had intended to hold a referendum today before being blocked from doing so last month by the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20Court%20of%20Spain"&gt;Constitutional Court of Spain&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Electoral%20College"&gt;Electoral College&lt;/a&gt; will officially elect Obama on December 15 and he will be inaugurated as the 44th President on January 20, 2009 at noon.

"We have come to the end of a long journey. The American people have spoken and spoken clearly. This is an historic election and I realize the significance this has for African-Americans [...] Let there be no reason now, for any American should fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth," said McCain at a final event in Arizona.

Barack Hussein Obama was born on August 4, 1961 in &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu%2C%20Hawaii"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; to Barack Obama, Sr. from &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; and Ann Dunham from &lt;a href="w%3AWichita%2C%20Kansas"&gt;Wichita&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. He grew up in Hawaii and &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. He graduated from high school in 1979 and attended &lt;a href="w%3AOccidental%20College"&gt;Occidental College&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;, receiving his B.A. in political science in 1983. Afterwards he moved to &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and worked as a community organizer. 

He enrolled in Harvard Law School in 1988, became the first black president of the &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20Review"&gt;Harvard Law Review&lt;/a&gt;, and graduated magna cum laude in 1991. He returned to Chicago, lecturing at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Chicago"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and practicing as a civil rights attorney. 

He was elected to the &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois%20State%20Senate"&gt;Illinois State Senate&lt;/a&gt; in 1997, and became the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senator from Illinois in March 2004. The following July, he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention, catapulting him into the national spotlight. 

He won election to the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; with 70% of the vote. On February 20, 2007 he announced his candidacy for President and clinched the Democratic nomination on June 3, 2008, after a tense primary battle with &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;. Obama is married to &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Obama"&gt;Michelle née Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he has two daughters.

<h2>Victory speech</h2>

At 05:00 UTC, Obama commemorated his victory with a speech to thousands in Chicago. He launched the speech by stating that his victory shows the power of &lt;a href="w%3Ademocracy"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt;, the people and the United States. He then stated that people voted for him because "people believe this time must be different."

The new &lt;a href="w%3Apresident-elect"&gt;president-elect&lt;/a&gt; then praised the McCain campaign team for their work, before stating that the time for change has come.

Obama then thanked people for their work in ensuring the victory. He thanked his family, and said that even though his grandmother has passed away, she would be watching his victory from heaven. He also thanked his campaign organizer, chief strategist and staff members who ensured his victory in this election. Obama then thanked the people who have donated or volunteered for his campaign.

The new leader then said that an Obama government is a government of the people, for the people and by the people, before warning that there would be a long steep road ahead for his office, and stating that all his goals may not even be achieved in one term. 

He then pledged to be honest as leader before stating that the victory is not change, but an opportunity for change, and that people must work to achieve this in this "new dawn of American leadership."He added, "change is coming to America" while speaking in front of 65,000 people.

A &lt;a href="w%3AFell"&gt;fell&lt;/a&gt; running event, the Original Mountain Marathon, has been abandoned under appalling weather conditions,
which left a number of competitors stranded.

The event's abandonment was confirmed (according to web reports) at midday by race director Jen Longbottom.

The disruption of the event that occurred at the top of one of the highest mountains in the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Borrowdale"&gt;Borrowdale Valley&lt;/a&gt;
(a region of the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20District"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt;) left hundreds of runners stranded due to flooding.
The runners were taking part in the Original Mountain Marathon (OMM), until flooding and heavy rain forced them to stop. Around three hundred people were forced to take shelter at the nearby Honister Slate Mine.

"The weather is absolutely horrendous and it's a scene of chaos up here," stated Mark Weir, the owner of the slate mine. "I believe there were up to about two thousand people who entered this race and I advised the organizers not to go ahead with the event."

"The mountain rescue teams are still trying to account for everyone," added Weir. "We have had people coming in throughout the day in pretty bad states. They are dripping wet through and very cold. Our staff are helping to transport them off the mountain pass and down to Cockermouth where the emergency services are taking over. But we need more help and more buses as there are still plenty of people up here."

12 people have suffered from &lt;a href="w%3Ahypothermia"&gt;hypothermia&lt;/a&gt;, and one of them has been taken to the nearby Cumberland Infirmary Hospital for treatment.

The largest private &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n airline &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Airways"&gt;Jet Airways&lt;/a&gt; has posted its biggest quarterly loss in three years. The Indian air industry was recently hit by rapidly increasing fuel costs.

The airline lost Rs 384 crore (€61,000,000) this quarter, compared to a Rs 28 crore profit (€4,500,000) in the same period last year. There was an increase in expenditure of 143% on fuel costs to wipe out a 45% income increase. The total cost of fuel has risen from Rs 696 crore (€110,700,000) last year to Rs 1690 crore (€268,800,000), and income rose from Rs 2,254 crore (€358,400,000) to Rs 3,258 crore (€518,150,000) in the same period.

Faced with an economic slowdown and surging fuel prices, last month Jet entered an alliance with &lt;a href="w%3AKingfisher%20Airlines"&gt;Kingfisher Airlines&lt;/a&gt;. The pair hope to offset their crippling costs by collaboration.

<h1>FBI asked to assist in murder, kidnap investigation of Jennifer Hudson's relatives</h1>

Local authorities in &lt;a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; have asked that the &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; help in the murder and kidnap investigation of the relatives of singer and &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Award"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt; winning actress &lt;a href="w%3AJennifer%20Hudson"&gt;Jennifer Hudson&lt;/a&gt;.

On Friday, Hudson's Mother Darnell Donerson, 57 and brother, Jason, 29, were shot and killed in the Southern Chicago home in what authorities are calling a domestic dispute. A cousin had found the bodies at around 2:44 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29"&gt;CDT&lt;/a&gt;) and called &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt;. Hudson's nephew, 7-year-old Julian King, was kidnapped from the scene and has not been seen since. An &lt;a href="w%3AAMBER%20Alert"&gt;AMBER Alert&lt;/a&gt; was issued and police are looking for a 1994 white &lt;a href="w%3AChevrolet%20Suburban"&gt;Chevrolet Suburban&lt;/a&gt; or a teal-green &lt;a href="w%3AChrysler%20Concorde"&gt;Chrysler Concorde&lt;/a&gt;.

King's mother, Julia Hudson, who was previously reported missing, is pleading for whoever has her son, to release him.

"I don't care who you are, just let the baby go. I just want my son. He don't deserve this. We're in a state of shock. I don't know what else to do but pray," said Hudson during a press conference on Saturday. The FBI was called in because authorities suspected King might have been taken over state lines.

Police have detained and questioned several people, and some reports say that includes William Balfour, who police previous thought to have kidnapped King. Reports say he is Julia's ex-boyfriend, having since been separated. Police deny that he is a suspect in either the murders or kidnapping and will not confirm or deny if he is or was in custody. So far no charges have been filed against anyone for the crimes.

At least 58 people are now dead as a result of the recent flooding in &lt;a href="Yemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, and at least 20,000 in the country have no access to shelter. Five people are also reported missing.The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Yemen"&gt;Yemeni government&lt;/a&gt; has pledged to send tents to help the homeless.

The flooding is caused by the recent heavy rain in Yemen, which came as a shock due to the fact that the country only receives several centimeters of rain per year.

In addition to the 58, four people were also killed by lightning, which struck Yemen during the large storms. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20of%20the%20Islamic%20Conference"&gt;Organization of the Islamic Conference&lt;/a&gt; (OIC) released a statement regarding the floods. "The Secretary General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), Professor Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, extended his sincere sympathy to the government and people of Yemen following the devastating floods caused by torrential rains, causing a grave humanitarian crisis in the governorates of Hadramaut and Mahra," it stated.

"Ihsanoglu pointed up the heavy death toll and the massive destruction that hit the infrastructure, such as roads, power and water distribution networks, describing the situation as a national disaster. He urged the international community to provide aid and assistance to the victims."

&lt;a href="w%3ABrigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Brigadier General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20W.%20Hartmann"&gt;Thomas W. Hartmann&lt;/a&gt;, an officer in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force%20Reserve"&gt;Air Force Reserve&lt;/a&gt;, is the subject of two new investigations. Both center on whether Hartmann abused his power as the Legal Adviser to the Convening Authority in the Department of Defense Office of Military Commissions. He no longer holds this position.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Air%20Force"&gt;United States Air Force&lt;/a&gt; is conducting an ethics probe after a preliminary investigation concluded that there were sufficient grounds to move forward. The inquiry is investigating allegations that cases which were not ready for trial moved ahead because Hartmann bullied prosecutors and logistics officials.

The other investigation is being conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;United States Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; which is looking into complaints by at least two military officials that Hartmann acted in an abusive and retaliatory manner towards them while they served at the &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Military%20Commissions"&gt;Office of Military Commissions&lt;/a&gt;.

These probes will "cast doubt on all of the decisions that have been taken under his tenure," predicted Hina Shamsi, who serves as official trial observer at Guantanamo for the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;.

Hartmann was recalled to active duty in July 2007 and appointed the Legal Advisor to the civilian official — known as the Convening Authority — in charge of Office of Military Commissions. The position of Convening Authority has been filled by &lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20J.%20Crawford"&gt;Susan J. Crawford&lt;/a&gt; since February 2007. Hartmann's active duty term was to be for a two year term.

The duties of the Legal Advisor to Convening Authority included providing general oversight of the Prosecution and Defense teams, and providing advice to the convening authority when appeals are made. 

When Hartmann was appointed the Chief Prosecutor, &lt;a href="w%3AColonel"&gt;Colonel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Davis"&gt;Morris Davis&lt;/a&gt; was on medical leave. Hartmann was dissatisfied with the process of the commissions. In the nine months since the passage of the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20Commissions%20Act%20of%202006"&gt;Military Commissions Act of 2006&lt;/a&gt; only three captives had been charged. Hartmann is reported to have intervened in the operation of the Prosecution, pressuring Prosecutors to initiate charges against the captives suspected of being the more senior members of &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;.

When Davis returned from his medical leave, he and Hartmann clashed. Davis felt Hartmann had improperly over-stepped his assigned duties, usurping his own role.

Davis reported that his approach had been to charge captives whose trials could be conducted without access to secret evidence, and without access to evidence coerced through the use of torture or questionable interrogation techniques. 
In October 2007, Davis went public and suggested that both he and Hartmann resign from the Office of Military Commissions. A military inquiry at the time censured Davis, who did resign from the Office of Military Commissions, and has subsequently testified against Hartmann.

The &lt;a href="w%3APresiding%20Officer%20%28Guantanamo%20Military%20Commissions%29"&gt;Presiding Officers&lt;/a&gt; of three of the Military Commissions heard testimony from Hartmann and eventually barred him from participation in the cases before them, because they believed he had exercised "illegal command influence".

&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20R.%20Henley"&gt;Stephen R. Henley&lt;/a&gt; — the Presiding Officer of &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Jawad"&gt;Mohammed Jawad&lt;/a&gt;'s commission, who barred Hartmann from further participation — wrote on August 14, 2008:

After Colonel &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Parrish"&gt;Patrick Parrish&lt;/a&gt; barred Hartmann from participation in &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Khadr"&gt;Omar Khadr&lt;/a&gt;'s commission, Hartmann's subordinate was promoted to replace him. Hartmann was moved to a new position, where he served over the Prosecution. Pentagon officials described it as a lateral move. Air Force officials described it as a promotion.

On November 2, 2008 Carol Rosenberg, writing in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Herald"&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, reported that Hartmann had filed a request to retire from the Air Force on 17 February 2008. Hartmann's superior at the Pentagon, William J. Haynes, had announced his resignation in February.

1700 runners running in the &lt;a href="w%3AOriginal%20Mountain%20Marathon"&gt;Original Mountain Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Afell"&gt;fell&lt;/a&gt; running event, are still unaccounted for the day after they were stranded by flooding.

Approximately 2000 people entered the race, and rescue teams have resumed their search for the missing.
The disruption of the event that occurred at the top of one of the highest mountains in the &lt;a href="w%3ABorrowdale%20Valley"&gt;Borrowdale Valley&lt;/a&gt; (a region of the &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20District"&gt;Lake District&lt;/a&gt;) , and the people found have sought refuge at local buildings and businesses. Three hundred of the people found have sheltered in the nearby Honister Slate Mine.

"The weather is absolutely horrendous and it's a scene of chaos up here," stated Mark Weir, the owner of the slate mines. "I believe there were up to about two thousand people who entered this race and I advised the organizers not to go ahead with the event."

"The mountain rescue teams are still trying to account for everyone," added Weir. "We have had people coming in throughout the day in pretty bad states. They are dripping wet through and very cold. Our staff is helping to transport them off the mountain pass and down to Cocker mouth where the emergency services are taking over. But we need more help and more buses as there are still plenty of people up here."

Organizers of the run have stressed that the runners should be fully equipped with tents and food, allowing them to survive in the place where they are stranded.
