Muslim community members in &lt;a href="w%3AAhmedabad"&gt;Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated against the alleged involvement of &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in Friday's blasts in Malegaon that killed 38 people and injured hundreds, most of them Muslims. The protestors came out onto the streets, shouting anti-Pakistan slogans and condemning the blasts, which, they say, were orchestrated by the Pakistani &lt;a href="w%3AInter%20Services%20Intelligence"&gt;Inter Services Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to create a rift between Hindus and the minority community. Rauf Bengali, one of the protestors, also pointed out the fact that Hindu temples (most recently the one in &lt;a href="w%3AVaranasi"&gt;Varanasi&lt;/a&gt;) were also targeted to cause a communal divide in Indian society. "We urge the Hindus and Muslims to stand united against such terrorist activities, directed to create communal tensions between the two communities," he added. 

Indian security agencies have, in the past, found evidence that suggests the involvement of the ISI in anti-India activities such as providing shelter to militants and backing strikes in Indian cities. The situation was tense in Malegaon yesterday, but has since calmed down with no incidents of Hindu-Muslim violence being reported.

Sources have claimed that &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Huntley"&gt;Ian Huntley&lt;/a&gt;, currently serving a minimum sentence of 40 years for the murders of two schoolgirls, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, has made a videotape confessing his crimes. It is believed that the video was made before a failed suicide attempt in his cell at &lt;a href="w%3AWakefield%20%28HM%20Prison%29"&gt;Wakefield high security prison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Yorkshire"&gt;West Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;.

Huntley was found unconscious in his cell on Tuesday following a suspected overdose of anti-depressant drugs. It is believed he obtained the drugs from a fellow prisoner in exchange for the videotape. The actions of an alert guard at the prison saved Mr Huntley's life -- he could have been dead before the existence of the tape came to light.

It is understood that managers at the Wakefield prison are transcribing the tape before sending transcripts to Cambridgeshire Police, who led the original investigation into the &lt;a href="w%3ASoham%20murders"&gt;Soham murders&lt;/a&gt;.

However, due to a penalty incurred by Alonso for blocking Felipe Massa during qualifying, he had his 3 fastest times deleted and will start tenth bumping teammate Fisichella up to ninth

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; told Canada to end gay marriage and instructed Roman Catholic politicians not to vote for gay marriage, urging them not to sacrifice their personal beliefs for the sake of opinion polls and social trends. Benedict met with &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; bishops at the &lt;a href="w%3AVatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; in Rome.

"In the name of tolerance, your country has had to endure the folly of the redefinition of spouse," the Pope told the bishops. "In the name of freedom of choice, it is confronted with the daily destruction of unborn children." "When the Creator's divine plan is ignored, the truth of human nature is lost."

Neil McCarthy, director of public relations for the &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic%20Archbishops%20of%20Toronto"&gt;Archdiocese of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, said yesterday that Benedict XVI's latest foray into the gay marriage debate came directly in response to issues the visiting Ontario bishops would have raised.

He said Catholic bishops from &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Canada"&gt;Atlantic provinces&lt;/a&gt; also made a visit to the Vatican this year, asking a response from the Pope on other matters of concern in Canada, such as unemployment and declining church attendance among young people.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;, before his death last year, denounced Canada for its drive to legalize same-sex marriage.

Parliament passed legislation in June 2005 that made Canada the &lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage%20in%20Canada"&gt;fourth country&lt;/a&gt; in the world to allow gay marriage.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; said he will revisit the issue and that members of Parliament will be asked this fall whether they wish to reopen the debate.

A garbage truck in &lt;a href="w%3ADowntown%20Toronto"&gt;downtown Toronto&lt;/a&gt; crashed in a sink hole next to a construction site. The truck sank beneath a roadway Friday morning after the pavement gave way into a large sink hole.

The driver is safe, suffering only from a sudden fright. The truck went down so quickly that the driver was forced to jump out about seven feet as the rear end of his vehicle crashed through at an angle.

"He was very frightened, he was distressed, definitely," said a police officer at the scene shortly after the accident. "He said it sank quite rapidly in the beginning and it is actually continuing to sink."

Engineers had to wait more than 12-hours to give approval to tow the truck out. "From what we can tell there isn't a water main at this location," city engineer Maurizio Barbon said.

Engineers described a hole similar in size to a small backyard swimming pool.

It will take a few more days to find out what caused the sink hole.

&lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Bucky%20Phillips"&gt;Ralph Bucky Phillips&lt;/a&gt;, a long-time New York fugitive, has been caught. He was arrested on Friday in &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Warren County, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; at about 8:15 pm &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Daylight%20Time"&gt;ET&lt;/a&gt;. He was unarmed and unhurt when he surrendered. The police had cornered him in a field just over the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20-%20Pennsylvania%20Border"&gt;Pennsylvania border&lt;/a&gt;. The police had moved closer to Phillips. Just before nightfall, 25 &lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; officers and 12 dogs swept through a field where he was suspected to be hiding. He gave up at around 8:00 pm local time. Phillips surrendered, with his hands up in the air.

"A few of my guys had spotted him in an open field, the helicopter zeroed in on him," said Lenny DePaul, commanding officer of the US Marshals Service fugitive task force. "Very good news," he said.

Friday's search started just before 2:00 am.

Phillips looked dirty and exhausted in a photo of him in the back of the police car. He spoke with one-word answers, answering "yes" when asked if he was Ralph Phillips, and also if he had received a copy of the federal complaint charging him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

Phillips was taken to a jail in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;. He will appear in court today, facing a charge of attempted murder in connection with the shooting of a state trooper on June 10.

Eight Californians contracted a rare lung infection after eating live &lt;a href="w%3Asawagani%20crab"&gt;sawagani crab&lt;/a&gt;s at several southern &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; restaurants. 

The freshwater crabs, also known as river or regal crabs, were purchased in several restaurants, including Riptide Rockin' Sushi &amp; Teppan Grill in Mission Viejo and Chomp Rockin' Sushi &amp; Teppan Grill in Fullerton. The crabs were infected with a parasite called &lt;a href="w%3Aparagonimus"&gt;paragonimus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Aflatworm"&gt;flatworm&lt;/a&gt; similar to &lt;a href="w%3Alung%20fluke"&gt;lung fluke&lt;/a&gt;. 

The parasite travels to the lungs six to ten weeks after ingestion. Symptoms include coughing, diarrhea, breathing problems, chest pain, abdominal pain, fever, and hives. The worm can spread to other organs, including the brain. 

According to &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, about 5,000 Americans die of &lt;a href="w%3Afoodborne%20illness"&gt;foodborne illness&lt;/a&gt; every year.

19-year old &lt;a href="w%3AMaria%20Sharapova"&gt;Maria Sharapova&lt;/a&gt; won her first &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Open"&gt;US Open&lt;/a&gt; title, defeating &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AJustine%20Henin-Hardenne"&gt;Justine Henin-Hardenne&lt;/a&gt; 6-4, 6-4 in the Saturday final. The match lasted over 90-minuites, in which Sharapova used her powerful serve, and forehand to command the entire match. 

The day before the final, Sharapova defeated world number one &lt;a href="w%3AAmelie%20Mauresmo"&gt;Amelie Mauresmo&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-final match. Justine Henin-Hardenne defeated the Serb &lt;a href="w%3AJelena%20Jankovik"&gt;Jelena Jankovik&lt;/a&gt; 4-6, 6-4, 4-0.

Before the final Henin-Hardenne had an impressive 4-1 record against Sharapova, with 4 straight wins.

After her win, Sharapova said that she was excited to be in "...her favorite city in the world." She also commented that "This is an amazing honor."

She continued by crediting tennis great &lt;a href="w%3ABillie%20Jean%20King"&gt;Billie Jean King&lt;/a&gt; for "just being an amazing woman."

Henin-Hardenne also reached all four Grand Slam finals in 2006, yet only took the French Open title home.

In the final game of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;2006 Tri Nations Series&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; tournament, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; 24 points to 16 at &lt;a href="w%3AEllis%20Park%20Stadium"&gt;Ellis Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;. Despite winning their last two games, South Africa finished third on the table, Australia second, and the &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; as winners. 

The loss for Australia in Johannesburg extends their poor record in South Africa - their last win there was in 2000, and their last win at Ellis Park was over 40 years ago. &lt;a href="w%3AFourie%20du%20Preez"&gt;Fourie du Preez&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABreyton%20Paulse"&gt;Breyton Paulse&lt;/a&gt; both scored &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt; for South Africa with &lt;a href="w%3AAndre%20Pretorius"&gt;Andre Pretorius&lt;/a&gt; kicking one conversion, three penalties goals and one drop goal. &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Larkham"&gt;Stephen Larkham&lt;/a&gt; scored Australia's only try and &lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20Mortlock"&gt;Stirling Mortlock&lt;/a&gt; kicking the one conversion and three penalty goals. International rugby continues throughout the rest of the year, with a number of teams involved in &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; qualifying, and November Tests matches in the northern hemisphere.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Italian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AAutodromo%20Nazionale%20Monza"&gt;Autodromo Nazionale Monza&lt;/a&gt; racing track. The &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Baron"&gt;"Red Baron"&lt;/a&gt; passed the checkered flag and won the race, the 90th win in his long career. &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; driver started from pole, but was unable to keep up with Schumacher after the first pit-stop and finished second.

As expected, &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;'s winner spoke of his future in Formula One after the race. He announced that he will retire from Formula One as the man who wins the most than the other drivers - a true champion of this sport. He will surely struggle the last three races and it will be much easier because of a good standings in drivers' and constructors' championship.

His closest competitor &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href="w%3ARenault"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; pilot, held an unbelievable race, but was out due to the engine failure 9 laps to go. He was heading for the third place. This closed his gap from Schumacher to the minimum of 2 points and allowed Ferrari to take the lead from Renault. Second Renault driver &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt; finished fourth.

A fantastic race for the first &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt; driver won his first podium. In the final protocol he placed himself third though started seventh. He replaced on the podium his co-driver &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt; who started third, but finished eighth due to the penalty for speeding on the pit-lane and a failed start.

&lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;, who will replace Schumacher in Ferrari next year, had an extra pit-stop due to a tire problem thus allowed Kubica to end the race alone.

&lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; drivers managed two good results - &lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Button"&gt;Jenson Button&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARubens%20Barrichello"&gt;Rubens Barrichello&lt;/a&gt; finished 5th and 6th, accordingly..

&lt;a href="Jack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;New Democratic Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; has been reaffirmed, this morning, at the party's federal convention in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20City"&gt;Quebec City&lt;/a&gt; where 92% of delegates voted against having a new &lt;a href="w%3Aleadership%20convention"&gt;leadership convention&lt;/a&gt;. The vote was the first formal say by party members on Layton's stewardship of the NDP since his election as party leader at the 2003 &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20leadership%20conventions"&gt;NDP leadership convention&lt;/a&gt;. 

Layton, 56, has led the NDP through two &lt;a href="w%3AElections%20in%20Canada"&gt;federal elections&lt;/a&gt; and to its highest level of support since the 1980s. With 29 of 308 seats in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Canadian House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;, however, the party is still not a contender for government though it was able to hold the effective &lt;a href="w%3Abalance%20of%20power"&gt;balance of power&lt;/a&gt; from 2004 to 2006 when the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; ruled with a &lt;a href="w%3Aminority%20government"&gt;minority government&lt;/a&gt;. 

The resounding endorsement of Layton's leadership will help boost the leader's reputation after it was bruised at the opening of the convention with the news that &lt;a href="w%3ACarl%20Hetu"&gt;Carl Hetu&lt;/a&gt;, who had been the Quebec co-chair of Layton's 2003 leadership campaign and &lt;a href="w%3Astar%20candidate"&gt;star candidate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Summerville"&gt;Paul Summerville&lt;/a&gt; had bolted the party. Hetu criticised Layton for not doing enough to build the party in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; while Summerville, a former banker who had been the NDP's economic spokesperson in the last election, denounced the party as being hostile to the idea of a &lt;a href="w%3Amarket%20economy"&gt;market economy&lt;/a&gt; and joined the Liberals.

Earlier in the convention, an estimated 90% of delegates voted for a resolution supporting Layton's call for Canada to withdraw its troops from &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Following on from the April 2 snap-election, the &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20News%20Agency"&gt;Thai News Agency&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that current caretaker PM, &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; expects the new election to be held in November.

April's snap-election followed months of building criticism and protests and was apparently called by the beleaguered PM to renew his mandate. This effort was derailed by mass-protests calling for his resignation and an opposition boycott that left &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; the only credible contender in the election where over 10 million people chose to abstain.

Irregularities led to the annulment of the April 2 results, and the eventual removal of the country's election commission, Friday saw the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20of%20Thailand"&gt;Thai Senate&lt;/a&gt; appoint a new election commission. With the likely date of them assuming their duties being only a month prior to the currently scheduled October 15 election rerun, the senate anticipated a delay of a month would be requested.

New research findings from &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; on an extremely drug-resistant (XDR) strain of the &lt;a href="w%3Abacterium"&gt;bacterium&lt;/a&gt; that causes &lt;a href="w%3Atuberculosis"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; (TB) alarm experts. &lt;a href="w%3ATuberculosis%23Drug%20resistance"&gt;XDR-TB&lt;/a&gt; is defined as resistance to three or more second line &lt;a href="w%3ATuberculosis%20treatment"&gt;antibiotics for TB&lt;/a&gt;. The condition remains treatable with other types of medications, but those are less effective, costlier and toxic. If the afflicted persons can't be diagnosed timely and given proper treatment, they can die within a month. Of 53 patients who had this form of the lung infection in the study, 52 died, reports ABC News. 

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region &lt;a href="w%3AKwaZulu-Natal"&gt;KwaZulu-Natal&lt;/a&gt;. In an interview, he said the new variant was "very highly troubling and alarming because of the very high &lt;a href="w%3AFatality%20rate"&gt;fatality rate&lt;/a&gt;." Some patients might have contracted the bug in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were hospital health workers. In one year's time, an infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts. However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any particular moment in South Africa.

The typical symptoms of TB (like prolonged coughing, fever, night sweats, weight loss and chest pain), and signs on X-ray are identical for XDR-TB. To ascertain the presence of this resistant form, a laboratory test on the patient's &lt;a href="w%3Asputum"&gt;sputum&lt;/a&gt; is necessary, but these tests are often too expensive in the poor countries where TB is present. Also, these countries frequently have high &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;-rates too; 44 patient's in the study by Dr. Moll were &lt;a href="w%3ASeropositivity"&gt;seropositive&lt;/a&gt;. These patients are particularly vulnerable. Dr. Karin Weyer, director of the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20African%20Medical%20Research%20Council"&gt;South African Medical Research Council's&lt;/a&gt; Unit for TB Research, cautioned that "In a country with such high &lt;a href="w%3APrevalence"&gt;prevalence&lt;/a&gt; of HIV, the emergence of XDR-TB is a nightmare." Because TB is often a hallmark of &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;, many people afraid of the social stigma don't seek medical attention.

These distressing findings urged a two-day meeting in &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the situation. Experts like Dr. Moll believe the new strain is also present in other provinces than Kwazulu-Natal. Conference organizers report cases in &lt;a href="w%3AMozambique"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABotswana"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt; too. The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has called for renewed efforts to combat the disease. Meanwhile, officials of the Health Ministry are suspected to be enforcing a media ban on the topics of AIDS and possibly TB.

During the 1990s, &lt;a href="w%3AMultidrug%20resistance"&gt;multidrug-resistant&lt;/a&gt; tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least &lt;a href="w%3Aisoniazid"&gt;isoniazid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Arifampin"&gt;rifampin&lt;/a&gt;, emerged as a threat to TB control, both in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and worldwide.

<h1>King of Tonga dies, aged 88</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=King%20of%20Tonga%20dies%2C%20aged%2088&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to an official news release on the &lt;a href="Tonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;n Royal Palace website, His Majesty King &lt;a href="w%3ATaufa%27ahau%20Tupou%20IV"&gt;Taufa'ahau Tupou IV&lt;/a&gt; passed away peacefully at 11.34pm local time (2334 UTC), on Sunday, 10th September at Mercy Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; aged 88.

King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV was the ruler of Tonga following the death of his mother, Queen &lt;a href="w%3ASalote%20Tupou%20III"&gt;Sālote Tupou III&lt;/a&gt;, in 1965. His wife was Queen Halaevalu Mataʻaho ʻAhomeʻe, born in 1926. The couple had four children.

"The sun has set in the Kingdom of Tonga," said an official government statement from the royal palace.

His death ends 41 years of his reign.

The capital, Nukua'alofa, was draped in black and purple, the official colours of mourning.

His state funeral is expected to be held on September 19. An official month of mourning was declared.

His body will be flown home on Wednesday, September 13.

The Kingdom of Tonga was stricken into mourning earlier this year, when in July, Prince Tu'ipelehake and his wife Princess Kaimana, along with their driver Vinisia Hefa, were killed when their vehicle was stuck by a speeding car on a San Francisco, California, USA highway.

King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV was once known as being the World's heaviest monarch (his weight exceeded 200 kg then), as well as later being the victim of a &lt;a href="w%3AJesse%20Bogdonoff"&gt;number of money-making schemes&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ATaufa%27ahau%20Tupou%20V"&gt;Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou V&lt;/a&gt;, the King's eldest son, was sworn in on Monday, September 11 as the next king but his formal coronation is likely to be next year . He and his sister, Princess Pilolevu have represented the monarch during his lengthy absences due to failing health.

Seven &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;ISPs&lt;/a&gt; and individuals were raided and six confirmed computers &lt;a href="w%3ACollateral%20consequences%20of%20criminal%20charges"&gt;seized by German police&lt;/a&gt; -- but not purely for operating as &lt;a href="w%3Aanonymity"&gt;anonymity&lt;/a&gt; proxy servers using the &lt;a href="w%3ATor%20%28anonymity%20network%29"&gt;Tor&lt;/a&gt; network protocol. 

The premise of the seizures was that the servers showed up in a server log of a &lt;a href="w%3Achild%20pornography"&gt;child pornography&lt;/a&gt; site. According to German civil liberties advocates in Germany who talked to the police, there are dozens if not hundreds of computers, in addition to the Tor nodes, that were also seized.

Tor executive director, Shava Nerad, expects all the computers to be returned to the server operators, none of whom have been charged with any crime, after the servers have been cleared from any involvement in the sting. However, Nerad also cautioned, "I don't believe German police have a deep understanding of how an anonymizing system works and none of these routers have logs." According to one of the Tor operators whose server was confiscated, no criminal charge has yet been filed against him.

All efforts are being made by the Tor community to preserve the privacy and civil liberties of all involved, but according to Nerad the situation is not so dire as has been reported elsewhere in the &lt;a href="w%3Ablogosphere"&gt;blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;. Civil rights advocates and &lt;a href="w%3Acypherpunk"&gt;cypherpunks&lt;/a&gt; claim that child pornography has become a &lt;a href="w%3Acarte%20blanche"&gt;carte blanche&lt;/a&gt; rationale for police suppression of &lt;a href="w%3ADisruptive%20technology"&gt;disruptive technologies&lt;/a&gt; protecting &lt;a href="w%3Aprivacy"&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt;.

Laws circumscribing online privacy rights in the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; are more strict than in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https%3A//www.prime-project.eu/prime_products/whitepaper/PRIME-Whitepaper-V1.pdf"&gt;PRIME&lt;/a&gt;, the EU's Privacy and Identity Management for Europe project, says: "The concept of a user-controlled identity management system implements the EU Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC, whose purpose is to safeguard individuals' fundamental rights and freedom, including the right to privacy. The technology will enable PRIME platforms to comply with European legislation. The platform applies the EU Directive's data protection principles. It supports and facilitates anonymity and pseudonymity to minimize the processing of personal information, whenever possible."

<h3>Queensland: Beattie's labor government returned to power</h3>
♡❤♡September 9, 2006♡❤♡

The &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; state election has been won by the Peter Beattie led labor government. After a colourful campaign featuring disunity between the liberal-national coalition and a forecasted protest vote that failed to eventuate against labor, Beattie maintained his considerable margin in the 89 seat legislative assembly winning a predicted 60 seats with approximately 70% of votes counted. The nationals and liberals are predicted to pick up 16 and nine seats respectively.

<h3>Paes and Damm win men's doubles title</h3>

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeander%20Paes"&gt;Leander Paes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Damm"&gt;Martin Damm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; crowned their first year as a pair on Saturday as they beat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJonas%20Bjorkman"&gt;Jonas Bjorkman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMax%20Mirnyi"&gt;Max Mirnyi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 6-7, 6-4, 6-3 to win the men's doubles title at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2006%20U.S.%20Open"&gt;2006 U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tennis tournament.

Paes and Damm had lost the first set and their serve broken in the second set managed to win their first title of the year.

Paes said communication had been the key to his success with Damm. "I don't think there are enough words to express how much fun and how much learning I've actually had playing with Martin, because we're actually opposites on the court," Paes said.
"Martin is strong and plays more solid. I'm more flashy and a bit more quick. We really complement each other.
"It's been a fantastic year playing with him. I've really enjoyed it. I'd like to thank him for a wonderful year."

<h3>Aerobatics champ dies in tragedy at Aero GP season opener</h3>
♡❤♡September 10, 2006♡❤♡

A mid-air collision has taken the life of Swedish aerobatics champion &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGabor%20Varga"&gt;Gabor Varga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Shortly after the in-flight tangle, the two planes crashed into the sea as co-competitor Eddie Goggins of Ireland parachuted into the sea where &lt;a href="Malta"&gt;Maltese&lt;/a&gt; Armed Forces rescued him.

The incident comes only days after Aero GP announced a sponsorship deal with Betfair, giving the Malta Aero GP the official title, ♡❤Aero GP Betfair Grand Prix of Malta♡❤.

The competition in the Aero GP involves a variety of skill tests for the pilots, testing their racing, dogfighting and target-bombing abilities.

<h3>Strong earthquake in Gulf of Mexico causes rare tremor in Florida</h3>
♡❤♡September 10, 2006♡❤♡

An &lt;a href="earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; struck in the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; with a magnitude of 6.0, a strength very rare for that region of the world, at 10:56am EDT (14:56 UTC) on September 10. Although no damage has been reported, it has been reported that tremors were felt in &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOcala%2C%20Florida"&gt;Ocala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the state of &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geographical%20Survey"&gt;U.S. Geographical Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the quake's epicenter was 260 miles (418 km) WSW (240°) of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClearwater%2C%20Florida"&gt;Clearwater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, and 329 miles (529 km) southeast (145°) of &lt;a href="New%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, at a depth of 6.2 miles (10 km).

USGS officials stated that the quake was not strong enough to trigger a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Tremor intensities as high as Force IV on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMercalli%20intensity%20scale"&gt;Modified Mercalli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; scale were felt throughout Florida.

Loreto Convent School, a 134 year old educational institution in &lt;a href="w%3ALucknow"&gt;Lucknow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; was vandalized by around 40 activists belonging to &lt;a href="w%3ABhartiya%20Janata%20Yuva%20Morcha"&gt;Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday evening.

The activists assembled to protest a session conducted in school premises to invoke the spirit of Jesus Christ by one Nobo Kumar Mondal.

As per reports, a few students fell unconscious as Mr.Mandal from Murshidabad, West Bengal asked students to lift their hands in prayer after chanting something.

All Catholic Institutions in Lucknow will remain closed on Monday in protest of the vandalism.

Three activists have been arrested as they have broken gates, flowerpots and smashed the glass panes of the chapel and principal's office.

Due to a failure to secure appropriate sponsorship, the ♡❤Global Challenge Round the World Yacht Race♡❤ will not be being held next time it's due in 2008.

The unusual race features ordinary people competing as opposed to major yachting sportspeople. For a final twist, the race is the "wrong way", namely against the prevailing winds. This leads the UK's newspaper, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ to describe it as "the world's toughest yacht race".

Less than a year after the discovery of a record size &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aprime%20number"&gt;prime number&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the same team from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Missouri%20State%20University"&gt;Central Missouri State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; discovered yet another record holder on September 4, 2006. The primality of this number was verified on September 11, 2006. The team were participants of an online project called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Internet%20Mersenne%20Prime%20Search"&gt;Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The number is 2 − 1, extending out to an astonshing 9,808,358 decimal digits. These rare prime numbers are known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMersenne%20prime"&gt;Mersenne primes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . So far, only 44 of these are known.

Although the number is just shy of the 10 million digits required for the $100,000 prize offered by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , participants are always looking forward to new primes.

&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt; released a &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt; message to the American public today, and with it comes a threat for the American people. It calls on fellow &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; to step up their resistance to the American people. 

"Your leaders are hiding from you the true extent of the disaster," &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;, the fugitive deputy to al-Qaeda leader &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; says in a video, which appeared on Islamist Web sites late Sunday. "And the days are pregnant and giving birth to new events, with God's permission and guidance."

It appeared just moments before the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

The tape appears to be recorded recently, with many references to the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;Israel and Lebanon conflict&lt;/a&gt;, including the recent bombardment of &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. 

Al-Zawahiri says that attacks on the West should be considered fair, because "...the reality of international politics is the humiliation and repression of the Muslim at the hands of the idol-kings who dominate this world."

The video, which is an hour and 16 minutes long, and subtitled in English, presents a threat to &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, which currently controls &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; troops in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, that "Dr. Brydon won't be returning this time," which is a reference to the sole survivor of a British colonial army massacred during the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Anglo-Afghan%20War"&gt;First Anglo-Afghan War&lt;/a&gt; in 1842.

Al-Zawahiri also criticised his native country &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, saying that "Israel has been able to dominate Lebanon and &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; only because Egypt has been totally removed from the conflict with Israel."
"We tell you not to concern yourselves with the troops in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and Afghanistan, these are doomed," he said. "You should worry about your presence in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; in general, and the second place they should worry about is (their presence, red.) in Israel," Al-Zawahiri said.

&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; analyst &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Bergen"&gt;Peter Bergen&lt;/a&gt; said Sunday that the al-Qaeda group was certain to make some sort of statement on Monday's anniversary.

"It would be very, very weird, in my view, if we didn't hear from either or both of them in the next few days, because this is something they want to remind Americans and their followers about -- the dreadful attacks on 9/11," Bergen said.

At least 10 people have died due to flooding caused by torrential rains in &lt;a href="w%3ASindh"&gt;Sindh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. Floodwaters swept away a railway bridge about 80 km northwest of the port city of &lt;a href="w%3AKarachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;.

Within an 18-hour spell of rain on Friday dumped up to 20 centimeters of water on the Sindh.
Torrential rains that lashed southern parts of Pakistan's Sindh a couple of days ago have inundated cultivation territories, badly affecting the crops. The crops of banana, melon, betel leaf, chilli, onion and tomato suffered huge damage from the heavy rain. Due to &lt;a href="w%3ALBOD"&gt;LBOD&lt;/a&gt; overflowing, there is no another system in Sindh to drain out water from the damaged crops.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; went to visit his homeland in &lt;a href="w%3AMarktl-am-Inn%2C%20Germany"&gt;Marktl-am-Inn, Germany&lt;/a&gt; today. The Pope celebrated Mass in front of 70,000 people, at Kapellplatz square. Benedict had a six-day homecoming tour of his native &lt;a href="w%3ABavaria"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt;, a state in Germany. He said a prayer remembering 9/11 victims.

Benedict also planned to make visits to where he was born, and to Freising, where he was ordained a priest. He will also visit Regensburg, where he once taught theology; he still has a house in the city, and his brother Georg, a retired priest and choir director, lives there as well.

"This is the mother that generations have come to Altoetting to visit," he said. "To her we entrust our cares, our needs and our troubles."

He visited his first house, which he lived till he was two years old. The house had to be cleaned after it was spattered with blue paint early on Sunday. The police described it as vandalism. 

"This is a really big thing — I've never seen a pope before," said Juergen Tauer, a 38-year-old computer technician from the Bavarian town of Degendorf who took the day off to travel to Altoetting with his wife and three children. "It's great that the pope is coming to Altoetting."

Everyone was excited about the chance to see the pope.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Florence%20%282006%29"&gt;Hurricane Florence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was positioned at 35.8 N 63.9 W, at 11 p.m. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEDT"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; - 4 hr), with maximum winds blowing at 85 mph and gusts of up to 105 mph. The hurricane is moving in a north-easterly direction at 18 mph and is showing signs of weakening.

The government of &lt;a href="Bermuda"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt; has discontinued the &lt;a href="Tropical%20cyclone"&gt;Tropical Storm&lt;/a&gt; warning it issued only after it 
blew away window panes, glasses and roofs. No deaths have been reported though there are reports of minor injuries. The hurricane has knocked out power supply to thousands of people.

The Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) expects the restoration of supply to be complete in few days.

The special &lt;a href="w%3ATADA"&gt;TADA&lt;/a&gt; court hearing the &lt;a href="w%3A1993%20Mumbai%20bombings"&gt;1993 Mumbai blasts&lt;/a&gt; case began delivering its verdict today. Four members of the Memon family, Yakub, Essa, Rubina and Yusuf, were found guilty of conspiring and abetting acts of terrorism and also having contacts with underworld don &lt;a href="w%3ADawood%20Ibrahim"&gt;Dawood Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt;, and now face between 5 years and life in prison. The judge decided to acquit three other Memons, Suleiman, Hanifa and Raheen, giving them the benefit of the doubt. Yakub, younger brother of prime accused &lt;a href="w%3ATiger%20Memon"&gt;Ibrahim Mushtaq 'Tiger' Memon&lt;/a&gt;, was also convicted of possessing unauthorised arms. The rest of the accused, including &lt;a href="w%3ABollywood"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href="w%3ASanjay%20Dutt"&gt;Sanjay Dutt&lt;/a&gt;, will hear the judgements in their cases over a period of four weeks.

After hearing the court's ruling against him, Yakub lost his temper, hurling abuses at the judge and accusing him of "making terrorists out of innocents". After the blasts, which killed over 250 people in 13 explosions across the city, the Memon family fled to Dubai, and then Pakistan. Except Tiger and his brother Ayub, however, the rest of them returned to India in 1994, and were arrested by the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;CBI&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, Yakub has been in custody and has, according to his lawyer Subhash Kanse, been undergoing treatment for depression.

Guards in charge of security at the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ADamascus%2C%20Syria"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; have stopped a "terrorist operation" just outside the embassy's walls, according to a statement by the Syrian government. Several other areas near other embassies located in &lt;a href="w%3ARawda%2C%20Syria"&gt;Rawda, Syria&lt;/a&gt; have also been shut down in order to secure the surrounding areas.

Reports say that four gunmen exited two vehicles, parking them just outside the embassy and began shooting at guards inside the embassy and throwing grenades at them. The guards then began firing upon the gunmen killing three and wounding one taking him into custody. At least two of the terrorists were attempting to hide in buildings near the embassy, but security officers killed them after catching up to them. 

During the exchange of gunfire, one of the vehicles used by the terrorists exploded and according to the Syrian Government, was detonated by the terrorists. The second vehicles also exploded, but reports say the vehicle was in the control of the Syrian security force before it too blew up.

"Three terrorists were killed and one was wounded. [The attack was a] terrorist operation targeting the US embassy," said Gen. Bassam Abdel Majid of Syria's Interior Ministry.

None of the gunmen were able to enter the embassy and there is no claim of responsibility as of yet.

Reports also state that at least one Syrian Security officer and two &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqis&lt;/a&gt; were killed and at least seven technicians located at a nearby workshop were injured including a local police officer. One diplomat from &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; was also injured when he was hit by debris from the blast while standing on the roof of a garage located at the Chinese Embassy. No Americans were killed or injured during the battle.

An anonymous senior official of Syria's Baath party stated the attacks were planned by government intelligence from within the United States.

&lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corp."&gt;News Corp.&lt;/a&gt; has purchased a controlling interest in &lt;a href="w%3AJamba"&gt;Jamba&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Aringtone"&gt;ringtone&lt;/a&gt; company created by &lt;a href="w%3AVeriSign"&gt;VeriSign&lt;/a&gt;. The $188 million give News Corp. a 51% interest in the public-owned company.

Jamba, and its American brand Jamster, will be merged into News Corp.'s Mobizzo. Mobizzo sells short video clips of television series. It is expected MySpace will integrate the ringtone sales somehow into News Corp.'s social networking website &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;; MySpace recently announced it would sell music on its website.

News Corp President and CEO Peter Chernin commented to ♡❤Reuters♡❤ that "wireless technology gives us an enormous opportunity to reach billions of mobile phone users with our content".

The announcement was made this morning by News Corporation, which owns MySpace.

Ten people, 7 of which are children, are dead, and at least 17 injured as a bomb went off in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADiyarbakir%2C%20Turkey"&gt;Diyarbakir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. Police say that the bomb was set off by a timer on a mobile phone. The blast happened inside a park in the Baglar region of Diyarbakir.

A group called the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons or TAC has claimed to be responsible for the blasts. The group threatened Turkey last week when it posted a message on their website saying that they would turn the country "into hell."

"Our grief is great for the victims of this terror, especially as our children have been the victims," said Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister.

American model and actress &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Nicole%20Smith"&gt;Anna Nicole Smith&lt;/a&gt;'s son Daniel Smith, 20, died in the &lt;a href="w%3ABahamas"&gt;Bahamas&lt;/a&gt;, while visiting his mother, who had just given birth to a girl.

Authorities state that one other person was in the room at the time, and the person was not a hospital staffer. The person's identity has not been released.

The cause of death is currently unknown, however the results of the autopsy and toxicology reports will be released at the inquest, which has been scheduled for the week of October 23. Authorities also say that there is no sign of physical injury

"He was found in a condition of non-responsiveness. I am not certain who made the alarm, and doctors were called in, but he was pronounced dead," said Assistant Commissioner of the Royal Bahamas Police Force, Reginald Ferguson. 

If jurors decide a crime has taken place, it will be sent to the Attorney General's office.

Ms. Smith said that she was devastated over the loss of her son.

Individual letters detailing Progressive Enterprises' latest pay offer have started arriving at locked-out supermarket worker's homes in a move which bypasses their unions. 

The 500 distribution workers yesterday rejected the company's base 3 and a half percent pay increase, claiming it doesn't cover inflation. 

The company has couriered letters directly to the nearly 600 affected workers, saying it wants them to be fully informed. 

"We believe our offers of a wage increase are fair, reasonable, sustainable, and consistent with the retail industry where pay increases are in the 3 to 4 per cent range," Mr Hamnett said. 

"We wanted to make sure that after [the offer] went to the union, it went our employees."
Strikers are now into their third week without pay in three cities, stocks in many supermarkets are running low. Unions are annoyed no progress has been made to secure a national collective agreement. 

The National Distribution Union says Progressive's latest offer fails to meet the pay parity workers from different sites are seeking.

But the company's spokesperson, Marty Hamnett, says the offer is fair and reasonable, and he's waiting to hear what individual workers think of the offer, rather than the unions.

The dispute involves 500 workers in Auckland, Christchurch and Palmerston North who went on strike on August 25 in a dispute over a single collective agreement and a pay rise. They were subsequently locked out on August 28.

&lt;a href="w%3AHewlett-Packard"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt; (HP) is embroiled in a scandal over the alleged illegal investigation of its own board members over leaks from the board to the press. The company admits that it hired private investigators and that they used pretexting to get private phone records of its own directors. '&lt;a href="w%3APretexting"&gt;Pretexting&lt;/a&gt;' is where someone pretends to be the customer when calling the phone company to get their phone records. It is illegal in the state of &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. 

The aim of the HP investigation was to find out which director(s) had leaked information to journalists. Venture Capitalist investor Tom Perkins resigned from the board on May 22, 2006 over the issue and requested that HP look into the methods used in its leak inquiry. The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; is looking into phone companies who may have supplied the phone records illegally under California law.

In one study, conducted at the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Prefectural%20University%20of%20Medicine"&gt;Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, patients with chronic viral &lt;a href="w%3Ahepatitis"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; were divided into two groups. The experimental group, consisting of 30 people, drank one cup a day of a specially prepared drink containing mandarin orange juice and added &lt;a href="w%3Acarotenoid"&gt;carotenoid&lt;/a&gt;s. The control group, consisting of 45 people, did not. After one year, none of the patients in the experimental group had any signs of liver cancer. In the control group, four people, or about nine percent of the group, had developed liver cancer. The researchers plan to continue the study for five more years.

In a second study, performed by researchers from the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Institute%20of%20Fruit%20Tree%20Science"&gt;National Institute of Fruit Tree Science&lt;/a&gt; and headed by Minoru Sugiura, 1,073 people from the town of &lt;a href="w%3AMikkabi%2C%20Shizuoka"&gt;Mikkabi, Shizuoka&lt;/a&gt; were monitored. The townspeople are known for their high consumption of mandarin oranges. An analysis of certain chemical markers in the blood of these people revealed a lower risk of liver disease, arteriosclerosis, and insulin resistance. 

The studies are being presented during a four-day symposium called "Functional Foods and Health", which is part of the 232nd national meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Chemical%20Society"&gt;American Chemical Society&lt;/a&gt; from September 10 to September 13, 2006. "&lt;a href="w%3AFunctional%20food"&gt;Functional food&lt;/a&gt;s" is the name given to foods that can fight various diseases, including cancer and heart disease. In all, more than 50 papers are being presented at the symposium. 

Commenting on these studies, Cathy Ross, a cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said that the studies confirmed the beneficial effects of fruits. "The more types of fruit and vegetables you can include in your diet the better."

In light of these studies, mandarin orange is being called a "&lt;a href="w%3Asuper%20food"&gt;super food&lt;/a&gt;", according to the ♡❤Belfast Telegraph♡❤. 

Speaking for Cancer Research UK, spokesman Ed Yong stated "These studies are far too small to tell us anything conclusive about whether mandarin oranges protect against liver cancer." He also stated "Cancer Research UK recommends eating five daily portions of fruit and vegetables as part of a balanced diet to reduce the risk of cancer. But it is unclear if any specific fruits have particularly strong benefits."

A stampede in a stadium in &lt;a href="w%3AYemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, where President Ali Abdullah Saleh was holding a pre-election rally, killed at least 51 people and more than 230 were injured.

Most of the dead are children as some 150,000 people had gathered. The stampede occurred when people where trying to leave after Saleh finished his speech.

The incident happened at Ibb, about 180 kilometers south of Yemen's capital, Sanaa.

Saleh has said family members of the victims will be compensated with a monthly salary.

Saleh who reversed his earlier decision not to re-run for elections has been in power since 1978 as President of North Yemen and then head of the unified Yemen after North and South merged in 1990. First independent elections were held in 1999 in Yemen.

Nonlethal weapons being developed by the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Air%20Force"&gt;US Air Force&lt;/a&gt; may be used on citizens to help control bad crowd-control situations, as proposed by the Chief of the Air Force. This would also stop some safety considerations before being used on the battlefield. 

"If we're not willing to use it here against our fellow citizens, then we should not be willing to use it in a wartime situation," said Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Wynne"&gt;Michael Wynne&lt;/a&gt;. "(Because) if I hit somebody with a nonlethal weapon and they claim that it injured them in a way that was not intended, I think that I would be vilified in the world press."

The US Air Force has spent a large cut of its budget for nonlethal weapons research, but Wynne says that money shouldn't be largely spent until injury problems are reviewed by experts, and resolved. Some weapons can also be used to disable small electronic devices, which is because of a small electronic beam emitted from some of the weapons.

Wynne also said the Air Force, which is already chopping 40,000 active duty, civilian and reserves jobs, is now struggling to find new ways to slash about $1.8 billion (€1.4 billion) from its budget to cover costs from the latest round of base closings.

The base closings were originally planned to create savings by reducing Air Force fees by 24 percent.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20Hewlett-Packard"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the chairman of the company's board, &lt;a href="w%3APatricia%20Dunn"&gt;Patricia Dunn&lt;/a&gt; will resign in January, following revelations that private investigators hired by the board to discover the source of media leaks had used false identities to obtain telephone records from service providers.

Chief Executive &lt;a href="w%3A%20Mark%20Hurd"&gt;Mark Hurd&lt;/a&gt; will replace Dunn as chairman, though she will continue to remain a director on the board.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20Bill%20Lockyer"&gt;Bill Lockyer&lt;/a&gt;, California's Attorney General has indicated that company insiders are likely to face criminal charges.

George A. Keyworth II, a board member, accused of leaking information said he resigned only after Dunn agreed she would give up her post.

Those hired by the investigation company pretended to be others, a practice known as &lt;a href="w%3A%20pretexting"&gt;pretexting&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the phone logs of board members and journalists.

In raids that were part of &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Mokpo"&gt;Operation Mokpo&lt;/a&gt;, police seized a massive weapons haul from a suburban house.

Officers from Britain's &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police"&gt;Metropolitan Police&lt;/a&gt; arrested a 55-year-old man after two houses and a business were raided in Dartford, South East of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

The firearms include hundreds of shotguns, semiautomatic guns and automatic weapons.

&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Trident"&gt;Operation Trident&lt;/a&gt; officers and Polsa (Police Search Advisor) search teams carried out three search operations early morning though majority of weapon was found in a three bed room house.

"This is the biggest firearms haul we have ever had," Det. Chief Superintendent Kevin Davis said. "Guns are mounted on every available wall space in the property and live ammunition was found lying on the floor."

A simultaneous operation is underway in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;.

This was the biggest success for Operation Mokpo, launched 18 months ago after a series of shooting by rival gangs in North London.

Police in the town of &lt;a href="w%3AMalegaon"&gt;Malegaon&lt;/a&gt; have recovered explosives from a yellow container placed in the Mohammadiya Madrassa shopping complex on &lt;a href="w%3ARafi%20Ahmed%20Kidwai"&gt;Kidwai&lt;/a&gt; Road. A bomb disposal squad has been rushed to the site, and the surrounding area has been cordoned off. Officers from the &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Terrorist%20Squad"&gt;Anti-Terrorist Squad&lt;/a&gt;, along with IG P.K Jain and Superintendent of Police Rajyawardhan, are also at the site. Jain, however refused to confirm whether the device was a bomb, saying only that it was a "suspicious looking container with wires and a battery attached to it." He said that if it was indeed an &lt;a href="w%3AImprovised%20Explosive%20Device"&gt;IED&lt;/a&gt;, police would either attempt to defuse it, or detonate it in an isolated area.

Meanwhile, police in &lt;a href="w%3ANashik"&gt;Nashik&lt;/a&gt; have seized 11 detonators, 5 &lt;a href="w%3Agelignite"&gt;blasting gelatin(gelignite)&lt;/a&gt; sticks and a &lt;a href="w%3Arevolver"&gt;revolver&lt;/a&gt; from a building named Raj Sarthi. At least 38 people were killed and over 180 injured on 8 September, when three bombs went off near the Hamidia Mosque during the Shab-e-Barat festival. Although the communally sensitive town has so far been quiet, officials have once again declared an alert in Malegaon.

The Pope also criticized the &lt;a href="w%3AOccident"&gt;Western world&lt;/a&gt; for alienating other cultures and "excluding God".

Following the days since &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Irwin"&gt;Steve Irwin&lt;/a&gt; died of a &lt;a href="w%3Astingray"&gt;stingray&lt;/a&gt; attack, at least 10 stingrays have been found dead on two Australian beaches, with their tails cut off. While it was reported that fishermen occasionally cut the tails off stingrays they accidentally catch to avoid being stung, however, state fishery official Wayne Sumpton said that this practice was "uncommon".

It is suspected that these killings were done in revenge for Irwin. "That's the last thing Steve would want," said Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin. However, other sources point out that fans of Irwin would generally not commit such actions.

In general, stingrays are not aggressive and will not attack unless provoked.

Meanwhile, a public memorial service for Irwin is planned next week.

<h1>20 injured in Montreal college shooting spree</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=20%20injured%20in%20Montreal%20college%20shooting%20spree&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At 12:41 p.m. local time (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;-5), a man opened fire at &lt;a href="w%3ADawson%20College"&gt;Dawson College&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AWestmount"&gt;Westmount&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;; the college is located near the heart of downtown &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;. Police report at least 20 people being injured. The gunman was reportedly killed at the scene by police. Students told reporters that they heard several shots in the building at about 12:45 local time. One student told a local radio station that she saw two people who had been shot, including one who was hit at the neck. The student said a friend told her four people had been shot.

Hundreds of students fled the building, and the area has been cordoned off. Nearby Plaza Alexis Nihon and Westmount Square were evacuated and the Green line of the Montreal Metro was shut down between Lionel-Groulx and Peel. Police officers wearing bullet-proof vests are keeping people away from the college. "They're telling me, 'Go the other way, lady, you're in the line of fire,'" said CBC News reporter Nancy Wood, who reported from the scene.

Local media have reported police hotlines have been established for loved ones to gain more information: +1-(514)-280-2880, +1-(514)-280-2805, and +1-(514)-280-2806. The Montreal General Hospital has also set up a hotline at +1-(514)-843-2839.

Police have reported that the situation has been neutralized as of 20:06, September 13, 2006 (UTC). Police have been told to stand down and are no longer looking for new victims or shooters.

Dawson College is a &lt;a href="w%3ACEGEP"&gt;CEGEP&lt;/a&gt; that hosts about 10,000 students.

<h2>Gunmen</h2>
Earlier reports suggested that there were between two and six gunmen, however, reports are generally that there were two, maybe three. Police have only confirmed that there was one gunman, Kimveer Gill, who was shot dead "after police intervention,". They will not say anything about additional shooters. A close witness to Gill's last moments reported being used as a shield during the shootout with police officers, who allegedly hit Gill in the arm. The shooter would then have turned his weapon on himself.

The gunman was &lt;a href="w%3AKimveer%20Gill"&gt;Kimveer Gill&lt;/a&gt;, a 25 year old Laval man. He was carrying three guns: a &lt;a href="w%3ABeretta%20Cx4%20Storm"&gt;Beretta Cx4 Storm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acarbine"&gt;carbine&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AGlock"&gt;Glock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A9mm"&gt;9mm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ahandgun"&gt;handgun&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="w%3ANorinco%20HP9-1"&gt;Norinco HP9-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asawed-off%20shotgun"&gt;sawed-off shotgun&lt;/a&gt;. 

Up to 20 shots were fired over a period of 30 minutes.

<h2>Casualties</h2>
Police have indicated 20 people have been injured in the incident. &lt;a href="w%3ACBC"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt; reports that 16 people are injured, and 2 have been killed, including the gunman. Montreal General Hospital officials have stated that 11 people have been admitted with gunshot wounds, 8 of them in critical condition. A spokeswoman also stated that 3 others were taken to Jean Talon Hospital and two others were taken to the Jewish General Hospital. The spokeswoman went on to report that most of the injuries are to the abdomen and limbs, and one victim with an injury to the head.

After substantial gains yesterday, U.S. stocks rallied again this afternoon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 11,543.32, up 45.23 from yesterday and reached a four month high.

This despite the fact that crude oil showed a slight rebound today of 21 cents, closing at $63.97 a barrel after seven days of losses. The increase came after the U.S. Department of Energy reported that crude oil inventories fell more than expected last week.

At the reception on Monday night, she met with members of MacKay's family, his father &lt;a href="w%3AElmer%20MacKay"&gt;Elmer MacKay&lt;/a&gt;, a former federal Tory cabinet minister. "Family means a great deal to me ... Wherever you go and whatever you're doing, there's nothing like really strong and great family. They keep you grounded," she told local dignitaries gathered at the Museum of Industry. "They remind you of the things that you did when you were 5 years old, and it's not easy then to lose sight of who you are," said Rice. "And so, Peter, thank you very much also for letting me share some time with your family."

"You don't get four hours of the secretary of state's time even if you're the Queen of England," said an American official.

Rice and MacKay took a stop at the Tim Horton's in Pictou, Nova Scotia.

The mayor, Sandy Cyr, of nearby Westville said, "This is the biggest thing we've ever had here and I've been here for 70 years."

She delivered her message as a two-day visit that focused on thanking Canadians for their support during the 9/11 crisis just five years ago. They discussed a number of issues including border security, Canada's role in Afghanistan, and support for the war.

Voting is underway in a provincial &lt;a href="w%3ABy-election"&gt;byelection&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AParkdale%E2%80%94High%20Park"&gt;Parkdale-High Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; to elect a replacement former education minister &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; who left the provincial post to join the leadership race for the federal Liberal party.

The new education minister, &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Pupatello"&gt;Sandra Pupatello&lt;/a&gt;, has accused &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20New%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; candidate and United Church Minister &lt;a href="w%3ACheri%20DiNovo"&gt;Cheri DiNovo&lt;/a&gt; of comparing media coverage of &lt;a href="w%3AKarla%20Homolka"&gt;Karla Homolka's&lt;/a&gt; release from prison to the persecution of Jesus Christ. &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href="w%3ASylvia%20Watson"&gt;Sylvia Watson's&lt;/a&gt; campaign has released selected portions of DiNovo's past sermons to claim she supports the ordination of pedophiles and axe-murderers.

&lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20New%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Ontario New Democratic&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Hampton"&gt;Howard Hampton&lt;/a&gt; defended DiNovo, saying the Liberals are worried about losing the riding.

DiNovo said the remark was taken entirely out of context by the Liberals and suggested she might sue them over it.

Political parties are doing everything they can to win the riding.

Venezuelan President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; stated the U.S. government may have planned the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;. He said the attacks have been used to justify U.S. "aggression" throughout the Middle East and also that &lt;a href="w%3A9/11%20conspiracy%20theories"&gt;9/11 conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; are plausible.

Chavez said in a speech Tuesday, "The hypothesis is not absurd ... that those towers could have been dynamited." He also said "A building never collapses like that, unless it's with an implosion."

The U.S. government has maintained that Al-Qaeda orchestrated the attacks under the leadership of Osama bin Laden.

An ATM in Virginia Beach, Virginia was cracked so it would give out 4 times as much money as it was supposed to; and this was done just by entering numbers into the keypad.

A man bought a pre-paid card and used it in the ATM. The attack consisted of a magic number which was entered in the PIN keypad, which caused the machine to disburse $20 bills when it recorded giving out $5 dollar bills.

No one in authority noticed for nine days, until an honest ATM user reported the machine was giving out too much money.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; Minister of Justice, &lt;a href="w%3APiet%20Hein%20Donner"&gt;Piet Hein Donner&lt;/a&gt; is under pressure from his own party, the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Appeal"&gt;Christian Democratic Appeal&lt;/a&gt; (CDA), for claiming that Islamic &lt;a href="w%3ASharia"&gt;Sharia&lt;/a&gt; law could come into effect in the Netherlands if a majority of the people supported it. Donner's controversial assertion was made in a book released on Wednesday.

While the majority of the CDA MPs are against the creation of a Muslim political party which stands for Sharia law, Mr Donner has said that it is the essence of democracy that Muslims are able to try to reach their objectives by democratic means, even if the current majority is against those goals. Mr Donner apologised for the rift in parliament that his remarks have caused and clearly stated that he is against Sharia law. However, he reiterated his belief that, in a democracy, people with different opinions are allowed to express their opinions. CDA MPs are set to propose new laws prohibiting any party that stands for principles which conflict with the constitution of the Netherlands.

Researchers at &lt;a href="w%3APrinceton%20University"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt; have conducted research into the security of &lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20voting"&gt;electronic voting machines&lt;/a&gt;. They have created a virus that could breach voting machines and change votes. The creators of the voting machine say the research was unrealistic.

&lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20William%20Felten"&gt;Edward William Felten&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of computer sciences and public affairs at Princeton University, and two Princeton graduate students, Ariel Feldman and Alex Halderman, created a &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20virus"&gt;computer virus&lt;/a&gt; that they say could remain concealed in tests, "steal" votes, delete itself to go undetected and spread to other machines.

They used a &lt;a href="w%3ADiebold"&gt;Diebold&lt;/a&gt; AccuVote-TS which is a small computer with a touch screen. The latest version of the software used 128-bit data encryption, digitally signed memory card data, &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20Layer%20Security"&gt;secure socket layer (SSL)&lt;/a&gt; data encryption for transmitting results and dynamic passwords.

They opened the drawer with a key, picked the lock or undid screws to open the compartment that allows them to change the memory card. They suppressed the beep created by the computer when it reboots by using headphones. They say the virus can spread by using the same memory card which when inserted into a different machine will infect the machine.

The researchers say they received the machine they tested on from someone who wants to keep their name anonymous.

"You have to be a good programmer — not a genius — to do this," Halderman said. "I believe a good programmer could reproduce our virus without very much effort."

"Analysis of the machine...shows that it is vulnerable to extremely serious attacks," the report states. "An attacker who gets physical access to a machine or its removable memory card for as little as a minute could install malicious code."

&lt;a href="w%3ADiebold%20Election%20Systems"&gt;Diebold Election Systems&lt;/a&gt; president Dave Byrd said that the research was done with security software that were two generations old.

"By any standard--academic or common sense--the study is unrealistic and inaccurate," he said in a statement.

"Normal security procedures were ignored. Numbered security tape, 18 enclosure screws and numbered security tags were destroyed or missing so that the researchers could get inside the unit. A virus was introduced to a machine that is never attached to a network."

"Every voter in every local jurisdiction that uses the AccuVote-TS should feel secure knowing that their vote will count on Election Day,"

"That's what they were saying a few years ago," said Halderman. He said he would very much like to study Diebold's newer machines and software. "We expect and fear, unfortunately, that if we were to examine the newer version of the software, we could find similar problems."

The Iranian Minister for Health and Education, Kamran Baqeri Lankarani issued a statement yesterday that the new formula would be administered for at least three months and would have lasting effects for up to two years, compared to drugs that need to be continually administered.

Iran's former Health Minister, Doctor Mohammad Farhadi, said that over the past five years researchers developed "a formula with herbal and chemical materials to help treat patients who are suffering from weak immunity system."

"The theory was to determine whether or not it is possible to boost the of the body. Some 60 projects were initiated to attain the result. At last the scientists found out a formula and then experimental works were carried out on animals at the laboratory to determine the effects of the formula," added Farhadi.

Lankarani stated that the drug has been tested on several patients and that the effects of the drug are "guaranteed" to work for at least two-years, but "we cannot say that effects of the newly-discovered medicine will remain in the body along the life time."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%3A%20Arctic%20Sea%27s%20icecap%20is%20melting&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
According to images captured by NASA's QuikSCAT satellite, the Arctic icecap has lost at least 14% of its 'perennial' ice between 2004 and 2005. Data shows that at least 280,000 square miles of ice, at least the size of &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; has been lost. The eastern Arctic has lost at least 50% of its ice, but scientists say that ice was shifted by wind and other weather factors from the east to the west Arctic, causing the western areas of ice to actually grow.

Between October 2005 and April of 2006; however, the icecap lost an additional 70% of frozen water.

Between 04 and 05, the perennial ice, which is supposed to remain frozen year-round, was replaced by 'seasonal' ice, which scientists say melts faster during the Summer months. This event has never before been witnessed. Perennial ice is normally 3 meters (10 feet) thick or more and seasonal ice is only 0.3 meters (1 feet) to 2 meters (7 feet) thick.

"If the seasonal ice in the east Arctic Ocean were to be removed by summer melt, a vast ice-free area would open up. Such an ice-free area would have profound impacts on the environment, as well as on marine transportation and commerce," said Son Nghiem, the leader of research at the &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory"&gt;Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena, California&lt;/a&gt;.

For several decades, the icecap has melted about 0.7% a year during the Summer months and has increased at least "18 times" faster than past decades, but Nghiem also said that the icecap has melted with "some variability" over the past years and was at times a "much smaller" of a loss of ice.

"If we average that over the long term we find a reduction of between 6.4% and 7.8% per decade. What we have here is 14% in one year - 18 times the previous rate. In previous years there is some variability, but it is much smaller and regional. [The changes between] 2004 and 2005 is enormous," added Nghiem.

Global warming is believed to have played a role in melting the ice.

"It has never occurred before in the past. It is alarming. ... This winter ice provides the kind of evidence that it is indeed associated with the greenhouse effect," said Josefino Comiso, another NASA researcher and scientist.

The 2000 mile long border currently has 75 miles of fencing. 

The bill also orders the U.S. Homeland Security Department to take over control of the border in 18 months and grants border agents new authority to stop fleeing vehicles.

It also ordered the Secretary of Homeland Security &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chertoff"&gt;Michael Chertoff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to conduct a study of the necessity and feasibility of the construction of a "state-of-the-art barrier system" along the &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; border.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20New%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Ontario New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; has scored an upset victory in a hotly contested provincial &lt;a href="w%3Aby-election"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ariding"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AParkdale--High%20Park"&gt;Parkdale—High Park&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20New%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACheri%20DiNovo"&gt;Cheri DiNovo&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Ontario Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href="w%3ASylvia%20Watson"&gt;Sylvia Watson&lt;/a&gt; by over 2,000 votes. DiNovo received 41% of the vote compared to 33% for Watson. &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Progressive Conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADave%20Hutcheon"&gt;Dave Hutcheon&lt;/a&gt; was third with 17% of the vote while &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20De%20Jong"&gt;Frank De Jong&lt;/a&gt; was fourth with 6%. 

The by-election was an important one for the ruling Ontario Liberal Party as the province enters an election year. The Liberals held the riding until former &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Provincial%20Parliament"&gt;MPP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; resigned, earlier this year, to focus on his bid to win the leadership of the federal &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20general%20election%2C%202003"&gt;2003 provincial election&lt;/a&gt; he held the riding with a commanding 57% of the vote. 

Speaking Thursday night, NDP leader &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Hampton"&gt;Howard Hampton&lt;/a&gt; said "There are no safe seats for the McGuinty government. People see us as a viable option."

Despite having been considered one of the safest Liberal seats in the province the by-election campaign has gone badly for the Grits who have pulled out all the stops in the past week after internal polling showed them in danger of losing. On Monday, &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Ontario Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADalton%20McGuinty"&gt;Dalton McGuinty&lt;/a&gt; and eleven of members of his &lt;a href="w%3AExecutive%20Council%20of%20Ontario"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; spent much of the day campaigning in the riding. The last seven days has also seen a series of aggressive accusations aimed at DiNovo, a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Church%20of%20Canada"&gt;United Church&lt;/a&gt; minister. The allegations, which were initially made on blogs and anonymous fliers have, in the past few days, been issued in official Liberal Party press releases and statements and accuse her of not being suited for sitting in the provincial legislature. They focused on her admitted drug use when she was a street kid in the 1960s and what a ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤ column called "carefully edited excerpts from her sermons". Liberal candidate Sylvia Watson, a &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20City%20Council"&gt;Toronto City Council&lt;/a&gt;lor, issued a press release alleging that DiNovo described the media's treatment of murderer &lt;a href="w%3AKarla%20Homolka"&gt;Karla Homolka&lt;/a&gt; to the "persecution of Jesus Christ". DiNovo, who has billed herself as the "Radical Reverend" responded by saying the comments were taken entirely out of context and threatened to sue Watson's campaign.

Toronto mayor &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miller"&gt;David Miller&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement denouncing the Liberal tactics as a "smear" while the media has been generally critical of the Liberal attacks on DiNovo as has the Progressive Conservatives whose candidate, Dave Hutcheon accused the Liberals of trying to "assassinate the character" of DiNovo. Premier McGuinty responded to the negative reaction saying "Look, it's a tough by-election for us."

Some Liberals and some columnists have argued that the anti-DiNovo campaign is payback for the 2001 &lt;a href="w%3ABeaches%E2%80%94East%20York"&gt;Beaches—East York&lt;/a&gt; by-election in which the NDP suggested that a sex scene in a novel written by Liberal candidate &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Hunter%20%28journalist%29"&gt;Bob Hunter&lt;/a&gt; condoned pedophilia.

Graham White, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, told the ♡❤Globe and Mail♡❤ that the tactics might hurt the Liberals. "It just looks like really bad politics," he said. "Even if this is enough to sway voters in the riding for the by-election, it seems to me the larger risk is very substanial."

The Canadian PM &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; spoke with astronaut &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20MacLean%20%28astronaut%29"&gt;Steve MacLean&lt;/a&gt; over the phone yesterday from Ottawa. MacLean was on the &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-115"&gt;STS-115&lt;/a&gt; (space shuttle Atlantis). He is also the second Canadian to walk in space.

Harper congratulated MacLean and asked him questions, including one from Harper's son, Ben. The question was: "What time do the astronauts go to bed?" "On our mission, with where the sun is, we have 55 minutes of daylight followed by 75 minutes of darkness ... and that does affect your circadian rhythm," MacLean replied. The astronauts' sleep pattern "is driven by the rendezvous that we do with the station. That time is the key milestone and then we arrange our sleep schedules around that." "But you can tell your son that sleeping in space is wonderful. We all sleep down on the main deck, some of us right side up, some of us are on the side and some of us are upside down. There's more orientations up here, basically."

Harper told MacLean that the country is proud of his achievements. "I'm sure it's an adventure of a lifetime and ... I expect your mission will inspire millions of Canadians, young people, and even some who are talking to you today to become interested in space and science and technology," Harper said.

Harper wished MacLean well as the mission winds down. "I know you said ... you wanted to bring home a gold medal for Canada, from everything I've seen on your performance yesterday, you are well on your way," Harper said.

Canadian school children also got a chance to ask MacLean about his time aboard the shuttle.
MacLean walked in space on Wednesday. MacLean, with fellow Atlantis crew member &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Burbank"&gt;Dan Burbank&lt;/a&gt; started their six-hour spacewalk at the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;international space station&lt;/a&gt; at 5:05 am ET. They are focusing their attention and tools on a ferris-wheel-like rotary joint that will allow two solar arrays, once unfurled, to always face the sun as the space station circles Earth. The solar arrays will supply a quarter of the space lab's power when it is completed by 2010.

<h1>Thought-controlled cybernetic arms demonstrated</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Thought-controlled%20cybernetic%20arms%20demonstrated&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AJesse%20Sullivan"&gt;Jesse Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; has two &lt;a href="w%3Acybernetics"&gt;cybernetic&lt;/a&gt; arms, after electrical burns suffered while working as an electrical utility lineman resulted in &lt;a href="w%3Aamputation"&gt;amputation&lt;/a&gt; of both his arms at the shoulder. &lt;a href="w%3AClaudia%20Mitchell"&gt;Claudia Mitchell&lt;/a&gt; has a similar cybernetic left arm, after a motorcycle accident resulted in amputation. Sullivan and Mitchell shook hands with these thought-controlled prosthetic arms at an event staged Thursday in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3ADefense%20Advanced%20Research%20Projects%20Agency"&gt;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&lt;/a&gt; (DARPA) and Center for Artificial Limbs at the &lt;a href="w%3ARehabilitation%20Institute%20of%20Chicago"&gt;Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. 

Unlike traditional prosthetic limbs, these are actuated through muscle reinnervation; nerves are grafted onto specific muscles, controlling their contraction, which are then detected by electrode sensors and control the prosthetic limb. "Basically it is connecting the dots. Finding the nerves. We have to free the nerves and see how far they reach," says Dr. Todd Kuiken, developer of the prostheses and director of neuroengineering at the Rehabilitation Institute. By this chain of communication the prostheses utilize thought-controlled &lt;a href="w%3Abiomechanics"&gt;biomechanics&lt;/a&gt;. According to Sullivan, "When I use the new prosthesis I just do things. I don't have to think about it ... I do all the yard work. I take out the garbage."

DARPA, as an agency of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;United States Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, seeks to eventually provide such prostheses for soldiers losing their organic limbs in combat. "We're excited about collaborating with the military," said Kuiken. 411 U.S. troops in Iraq and 37 in Afghanistan have had wounds that cost them at least one limb according to the Army Medical Command.

A 35-year old woman, Venus Critchfield of Philipippi, &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to two to six years in prison.

Critchfield was accused of beating her stepchildren with boards, and using hooks and ropes to secure them and force them to stand for long periods of time. Critchfield also forced the children to continuously eat food and drink, and then eat their own vomit. Her stepson, now aged 17, described the abuse in court. 

Circuit Judge Alan D. Moats called this the worst case he has seen in 30 years. "You have never been a mother. You are the antithesis of everything that is a mother." Moats said in court.

The abuse involved all six of Critchfield's children, however only some were willing to testify against her. 

Critchfield pleaded guilty and was convicted of two counts of child abuse, with injury. The charges pertained to abuse committed from January 2001 until January 2002. She was sentenced to the maximum possible term.

State welfare services had removed the children, now 11-16 years old, from the Critchfields' care in previous cases. 

Jenning Brian Critchfield, the father, is currently serving a 3-15 year sentence for abuse.

&lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; has enraged the &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;ic world by quoting the 14th century &lt;a href="w%3AByzantine%20Empire"&gt;Byzantine&lt;/a&gt; Emperor &lt;a href="w%3AManuel%20II%20Palaiologos"&gt;Manuel II Palaiologos&lt;/a&gt; criticism of Prophet Muhammad's teachings on Tuesday, August 12, durring his six-day visit to Germany.

The Pope said "The emperor comes to speak about the issue of &lt;a href="w%3AJihad"&gt;jihad&lt;/a&gt;, holy war. He said, I quote, 'Show me just what &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached'."

Vatican spokesman Reverend Federico Lombardi clarified the quotation, saying "It certainly wasn't the intention of the Pope to carry out a deep examination of jihad and on Muslim thought on it, much less to offend the sensibility of Muslim believers." 

Many Muslim leaders have condemned the comments, some of them stating that the Pope had fallen into "the trap of bigots and racists".

&lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Mahdi%20Akef"&gt;Mohamed Mahdi Akef&lt;/a&gt;, who was convicted of leading the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Brotherhood"&gt;Muslim Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, asked Islamic nations to break off relations with the Vatican, until the Pope apologises for his statements. He said, "The Pope has aroused the anger of the whole Islamic world and strengthened the argument of those who say that the West is hostile to everything Islamic." He also said, "The remarks do not express correct understanding of Islam and are merely wrong and distorted beliefs being repeated in the West" and that the comments "pour oil on the fire and ignite the wrath of the whole Islamic world to prove the claims of [hatred] of politicians and religious men in the West to whatever is Islamic".

In reference to the Pope's plan to visit to Turkey in November, &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Bardako%C4%9Flu"&gt;Ali Bardakoğlu&lt;/a&gt;, head of Turkey's Religious Affairs Directorate, "I do not think any good will come from a visit to the Muslim world by a person who has such ideas about Islam's prophet. He should first of all replace the grudge in his heart with moral values and respect for others."

The &lt;a href="w%3AMajlis-e-Shoora"&gt;Pakistani parliament&lt;/a&gt; unanimously passed a resolution saying, "This House demands that the Pope should retract his remarks in the interest of harmony between religions." "The derogatory remarks of the Pope about the philosophy of jihad and Prophet Mohammed have injured sentiments across the Muslim world and pose the danger of spreading [bitterness] among the religions."

&lt;a href="w%3ADin%20Syamsuddin"&gt;Din Syamsuddin&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammadiyah"&gt;Muhammadiyah&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia's second largest Islamic organisation, said: "The Pope's statements reflect his lack of wisdom." "It is obvious from the statements that the Pope doesn't have a correct understanding of Islam." 

Hamid Ansari, chairman of the Indian National Commission for Minorities said, "The language used by the Pope sounds like that of his 12th-century counterpart who ordered the crusades."

During a brief interview of &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Rehman%20Manjee"&gt;Prince Rehman Manjee&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago, IL, he is quoted saying, "The pontif is not a God or a super being, he is clearly a human being and is allowed to make mistakes, he would however do well to remember God will judge his mistakes the same as the rest of ours. If he truly has contempt for the Muslim world and his beliefs are in conflict with the official position of the church, then a simple statement should be made to that effect."

In Qatar, prominent Muslim scholar shaikh Youssef al-Qaradawi discounted The Pope's comments and said that Islam was a religion of peace and reason.

In Islam, the word "Jihad" itself has a variety of meanings depending upon context and interpretation; ranging from any inner spiritual struggle to openly religious warfare.

Sanger was employed by &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; to work on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANupedia"&gt;Nupedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and later Wikipedia from 2000-2002. He currently works on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Universe"&gt;Digital Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; initiative with entrepreneur &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Firmage"&gt;Joe Firmage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and astrophysicist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Haisch"&gt;Bernard Haisch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but does not anticipate Citizendium being part of Digital Universe.

Brad Patrick, General Counsel and interim Executive Director of the &lt;a href="Wikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, said "A great strength of the free culture movement is in the freedom to experiment. It is good to see Mr Sanger continuing to push forward with freely licensed content in his new project."

&lt;a href="w%3A%20Dell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;'s share price has been in a sharp decline as the company has struggled to deal with declining &lt;a href="w%3A%20Personal%20Computer"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A%20server"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; revenues. Now it has been forced to delay its 2Q financial report as it deals with state and federal accounting investigations. Dell revealed last month that the &lt;a href="w%3A%20SEC"&gt;SEC&lt;/a&gt; was looking into its past financial statements. As a result, it has been forced to put its stock buyback programme on hold until the market can be confident the share price is right. To correct its course, Dell has also announced in the past week:

<h3>Plans to outsource more services as it expands around the world</h3>

Dell intends to be less US-centric, and to build new plants in regions such as central Europe, Brazil, China and India. Under the Dell 2.0 roadmap, the company will also provide fewer services in-house.

<h3>Spend $150m on improving &lt;a href="w%3A%20customer%20satisfaction"&gt;customer satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Dell said this week that customer satisfaction is something that it had not done perfectly in the past. "We made a decision six to 12 months ago, because we weren't pleased with our internal and external satisfaction indices," said a Dell general manager. Dell has also reduced its supplier base, to 'reduce variability in component quality', according to CEO &lt;a href="w%3A%20Kevin%20Rollins"&gt;Kevin Rollins&lt;/a&gt;. The company will also focus on product design, another aspect that Dell has been accused of neglecting in the past.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has warned that it may delay &lt;a href="w%3A%20Vista"&gt;Vista&lt;/a&gt;, the next release of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, in Europe unless it receives clear guidance from the &lt;a href="w%3A%20European%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; (EC) about its antitrust requirements for the operating system. Microsoft says it has received numerous requests from its partners seeking assurance about the regulatory status of Vista in Europe.

Microsoft has also claimed that the EC may require that some security features be removed from Vista, possibly referring to internal firewall changes in Vista. The EC had expressed concern that the firewall changes might lock out third party security companies &amp; decrease security by creating a more homogeneous computing environment.

The EC denies any responsibility for a potential shipment delay of Vista, stating that the onus is upon Microsoft to comply with the competition laws of Europe and not for the EC to tell Microsoft how to design Vista.

Schoolchildren at Rawmarsh &lt;a href="w%3AComprehensive%20School"&gt;Comprehensive School&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Yorkshire"&gt;South Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, are being fed fish and chips by their parents through the school gates at lunchtimes because parents do not believe their children are being given enough choice of food at lunchtime.

The parents are standing outside the school gates in a &lt;a href="w%3Acemetery"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt; to take the orders of food from the children, and then go and pick up the food for them. Parents say that this is because the children do not like the quality of food being served in the school cafeteria, and so the parents are only giving the children what they want - which is a hot and tasty lunchtime meal.

Head Teacher John Lambert has lashed back at the parents, calling the delivery of food through the gates immoral and stating that it is not "helping the children or their school" by bringing the junk food in. He also stated that "[The School] aims to provide good quality food which is within government healthy eating guidelines and helps the children's learning in the afternoon". Parents have defended the delivery of food by saying that not only are they receiving orders for burgers and chips, but also for salad rolls, jacket potatoes, and other healthy foods.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20British%20Telecom"&gt;BT&lt;/a&gt; Global Services this week laid out its vision for the next three years: its revenues to double in the USA, Japan, India and China, and £400m of annual savings, achieved through offshoring and slashing its procurement costs. £200m of this will come from a reduction in what it spends on technology from vendors on large systems integration projects.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20CEO"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; Andy Green admitted that BT had been slower than rivals such as &lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAccenture"&gt;Accenture&lt;/a&gt; to ramp up its offshore headcount. But he claimed that BT Global Services is thriving as the fastest-growing division within BT. He said that the division was outperforming its closest rivals, &lt;a href="w%3A%20T-Systems"&gt;T-Systems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Orange%20SA"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt; Enterprise and &lt;a href="w%3A%20AT%26amp%3BT"&gt;AT&amp;T&lt;/a&gt; Enterprise, which had all posted revenue declines for the most recent quarter. He said BT was fast becoming a familiar brand to businessmen in New York, Tokyo, Mumbai and Shanghai.

He disclosed a few revenue figures not revealed before. For the financial year ending March 2006, UK revenues rose just 2% to £5.5bn, while overseas revenues shot up 48% to £3.3bn. And of the £8.8bn total revenue, £1.6bn was captive work for its parent, while of the remaining £7.2bn, 18% came from the UK government sector and 17% from financial services. BT said it still harbours ambitions to conquer America, despite the failure of the '&lt;a href="w%3AConcert%20Communications%20Services"&gt;Concert&lt;/a&gt;' partnership with &lt;a href="w%3AMCI"&gt;V&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s.

In a separate story, BT announced it has chosen Chinese vendor ZTE to develop a dual-mode handset -- &lt;a href="w%3A%203G"&gt;3G&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A%20Digital%20audio%20broadcasting"&gt;DAB&lt;/a&gt;-IP -- for launch by its BT Movio subsidiary next year. DAB-IP (in other words, IP over the DAB digital radio network) will enable BT Movio to broadcast four TV channels at acceptable quality to the handset.
3G will enable video-on-demand, so that the users can specify what video clips or programmes they wish to watch. UK legislation specifies that no more than 30% of the DAB spectrum can be used for non-radio purposes, so BT is lobbying for more DAB spectrum to be released, to enable higher quality video and/or more TV channels.

The popularity of Websites that rely on user-generated content has increased dramatically in the United Kingdom, according to new statistics. &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APiczo"&gt;Piczo&lt;/a&gt; show the strongest growth in usage year-to-year, respectively up 467% to 5.2 million visitors and 393% to 4 million. &lt;a href="w%3ABebo"&gt;Bebo&lt;/a&gt; is up 328% to 3.9 million, while &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; saw a 181% increase.

These sites draw more frequent visits that other non-user-generated sites in the UK Top 50, with 4.2 usage-days per month (compared to the 3.5 average). They tend to engage visitors for longer (80 minutes per visitor, compared to the 33-minute average over all), and visitors tend to view more pages per visit (217 pages per visitor, compared to 52-page average over all).

Because users of these sites visit more frequently, stay longer, and view more content, the argument goes that this creates more opportunities for marketers to communicate messages. However, in reality, as the number of pages served becomes very large, it becomes more difficult to find sufficient advertising inventory to send with those pages.

No-one yet seems to be making big margins from social networking sites. The cost of operating these sites, it turns out, is sensitive to scale. Moreover, users generate a lot of noise in promoting themselves, but there's little evidence that many of them are listening to each other — which severely restricts the site owners' ability to generate advertising services, and secure advertising revenues.

On Thursday, September 14, the death toll had risen to 11 adults and 5 children, as a bomb went off in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADiyarbakir%2C%20Turkey"&gt;Diyarbakir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. At least 13 people have been injured in the blasts, some severely.

There are conflicting reports as to who or what group is responsible for the attacks. Yesterday the ♡❤BBC News♡❤ agency reported that the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons or TAC had claimed responsibility for the blast, but so far the ♡❤New Zealand Herald♡❤ reports that no one has yet to claim responsibility.

♡❤VOA News♡❤; however, reports that the Turkish Revenge Brigade has claimed responsibility for the blasts.

The Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK, has denied to have any connection with the blast condemning the attack.

"This attack was carried out by some forces in the Turkish special war system in order to sabotage this [treaty] process," said the Workers Party in a statement.

<h1>Virginia bill proposes castration as treatment option for sex offenders</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Virginia%20bill%20proposes%20castration%20as%20treatment%20option%20for%20sex%20offenders&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia's&lt;/a&gt; state crime commission recommended on Wednesday that more research was needed on a legislative bill that would allow convicted sex offenders to opt out of behavioral treatment centers if they agreed to voluntary &lt;a href="w%3Acastration"&gt;castration&lt;/a&gt;. The bill, proposed by Emmett W. Hanger Jr. (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="w%3A%20Augusta%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Augusta&lt;/a&gt;), was introduced as a cost cutting measure.

Hanger told the crime commission, "… when I proposed this initially, it was part of a list of cost-reduction methods." The Virginia General Assembly delayed a vote on the bill during its last legislative session until the commission could examine it.

Virginia sex offenders considered violent are sometimes released from prison sentences and placed into a mandatory state treatment center. The treatment costs per person are in the range of $7340 annually. 

The Hanger bill (seems he may not be interested in pushing it) would re-open the debate on whether castration, either performed surgically or chemically, is an effective measure for an offender to opt out of treatment. Hanger himself has suggested that he may drop the bill in favour of a much broader measure setting up programs for dangerous sex offenders, in which castration will be one of many options. 

The Minnesota House voted overwhelming to approve a measure for longer prison sentences and chemical castration for sex offenders in April of last year. Governor &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Pawlenty"&gt;Tim Pawlenty&lt;/a&gt; later signed the bill on June 2. 

&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, and both &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 passed measures allowing sex offenders to avoid judicial commitments by undergoing castration.

&lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombian&lt;/a&gt; authorities rescued a 2-month-old baby, who was kidnapped by a woman on Monday in &lt;a href="w%3ABogota"&gt;Bogotá&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AArmenia%2C%20Colombia"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday night, September 14. 

The baby girl, Maribel Muñoz, was taken by a woman who told her parents, Zenaida Muñoz and Henry López Romero that she belonged to an &lt;a href="w%3ANGO"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt; and could get medical care for the girl inside Hotel Tequendama. The parents, who are displaced people, went to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACaracol%20TV"&gt;Caracol TV&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ network in order to report the kidnapping. 

Surveillance recordings from the hotel and the city's bus terminal helped with the search. The woman, described as in her late twenties, of height 1.65 m, and having black hair and almond-shaped eyes, left the hotel with two men and went to the local bus terminal. On Thursday, a taxi driver told the media that the day before, he had driven a woman with those features to Cedritos, a neighbourhood in northeast Bogotá. 

Finally, on Thursday night, the kidnapper, Esmeralda Echeverri Castaño, was taken into custody in &lt;a href="w%3ACali"&gt;Cali&lt;/a&gt;. She confessed that she had abandoned the baby in a hotel in Armenia, where Maribel was finally found and moved to a hospital. The doctors found the baby to be in good health.

Maribel's parents, who live in a modest house in Usme, south Bogotá, recognized the baby on Friday early morning, thanks to a digital picture sent from Armenia to the police in Bogotá. The child was returned to her parents at 11:30 a.m. (16:30 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) on Friday.

Opera singer-turned-talk show host &lt;a href="w%3ACharlotte%20Church"&gt;Charlotte Church&lt;/a&gt; wanted to book hotel heiress &lt;a href="w%3AParis%20Hilton"&gt;Paris Hilton&lt;/a&gt; on her program, to insult her. Church says Hilton is too expensive though, charging USD$650,000 for an appearance, and her producers dropped the idea.

Church told a British radio show "We asked Paris to be on the program because I could take the mick out of her and not feel at all bad about it — she's such a complete airhead. But she demanded a ridiculous amount of money — like the price of a big house just to say a few stupid things. She's hardly going to announce anything world-changing, is she? It's absolutely pathetic, isn't it?"

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Charlotte%20Church%20Show"&gt;The Charlotte Church Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has aired on Britain's &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt; since September 1, 2006.

A planned shooting was intercepted by police in Green Bay, &lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. The suspects were arrested on the morning of September 14th at East High School, a day after the shooting at Dawson College. Police raided the suspects' homes and found nine rifles and shotguns, ammunition, several "crudely made" bombs, bomb-making material, camouflage clothing, two-way radios, helmets and gas masks. Nothing was found at the school upon their arrest. There was no timeline to the plan, but police say that an attack was imminent. It has been labeled as "a &lt;a href="w%3AColumbine%20school%20shooting"&gt;Columbine&lt;/a&gt; waiting to happen".

<h3>The suspects</h3>

Police Chief Craig Van Schyndle stated that "From statements that we heard, it gave us great concern that, yes, it was in the very near future something was going to take place". He also revealed that the school resource officer also "learned these two students were obsessed with pain, death, and had suicidal thoughts".

The suspects are currently in custody, and charges such as conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to commit arson are pending.

"Based on the current information, FDA advises that consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach at this time. Individuals who believe they may have experienced symptoms of illness after consuming bagged spinach are urged to contact their health care provider," said a statement on the &lt;a href="w%3AFDA"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s website.

Health officials report that the symptoms from eating any contaminated spinach are kidney failure or Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome [HUS] which can occur easily in children and elderly people, bloody diarrhea, mild fever and in some cases death. At least 14 of the infected have suffered kidney failure.

"Given the severity of this illness and the seriousness of the outbreak, FDA believes that a warning to consumers is needed. We are working closely with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; [CDC] and state and local agencies to determine the cause and scope of the problem," added the statement.

Consumers are urged to throw out any fresh spinach they may have as washing it does not help, but officials say that cooking the spinach could kill the bacteria though officials still urge consumers to throw out all spinach.

"We are telling everyone to get rid of fresh bagged spinach right now. Don't assume anything is over," said Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle. Wisconsin has seen the worst of the outbreak with one death reported and over 30 people infected.

"If you wash it, it is not going to get rid of it," said the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition director, Robert Brackett.
Health officials also say that they do not know what caused the contamination and do not know where the spinach originated from. Officials believe that the contamination was not "deliberate."

"It is too early to say where the spinach has come from. This is an active investigation and we will provide more information as it becomes available. We have no evidence that this was deliberate," said a spokeswoman for the FDA, Laura Alvey.

"We have temporarily stopped shipping spinach products, and have taken spinach out of our salads that contain them. Everyone at Earthbound Farm is terribly upset about these illnesses and death and their potential relationship to a product that is ordinarily a very healthy food choice. We are committed to producing exceptionally fresh and healthy produce. Quality and food safety continue to be our top priorities," said Natural Selections in a statement on its website. Natural Selections is operated by Earthbound Farm.

"It is possible that the recall and the information will extend beyond Natural Selection Foods and involve other brands and other companies, at other dates," said chief medical officer with the FDA's Center for Food Safety, Doctor David Acheson.

Natural Selection sells many different brand names of spinach including Dole, Trader Joe's, Green Harvest, Ready Pac, Earthbound Farm, Rave Spinach and their own brand of spinach, Natural Selections.

Officials say that more cases are expected to be reported, but many individuals will recover from the illness within a week.

♡❤E. coli♡❤, on average, affects more than 75,000 people a year and can kill as many as 60.

<h1>A fifth of American kids projected to become obese</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=A%20fifth%20of%20American%20kids%20projected%20to%20become%20obese&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A report released on September 13 called "Progress in Preventing Childhood Obesity: How Do We Measure Up?" states that if strict measures are not implemented, in just four years, over 20 percent of American children will be &lt;a href="w%3Aobese"&gt;obese&lt;/a&gt;. The report called current measures aimed at tackling childhood obesity "fragmented and small-scale". 

The report was released by the &lt;a href="w%3AInstitute%20of%20Medicine"&gt;Institute of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, but including an explicit disclaimer that 'Any opinions, findings, conclusions, are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the organization [Institute of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation] that provided support for the project.'

Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, president of &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Wood%20Johnson%20Foundation"&gt;Robert Wood Johnson Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the organization that funded the report, said "if we do not reverse the epidemic of childhood obesity, millions of kids and our society will be robbed of a healthy and hopeful future". The percentage of children who are overweight or obese has been increasing worldwide in recent years. Food Consumer reports that according to the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), childhood overweight and obesity is a "global pandemic".

According to an estimate based on the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Health%20and%20Nutrition%20Examination%20Survey"&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt; (NHANES), 34 percent of American children were overweight in 2003-2004, compared to 28 percent in 1999-2000. In 2002, 16 percent of American children and teens were obese. In 2004, the rate was 17 percent. The rate is expected to rise to 20 percent, according to the report.

Childhood obesity increases risk of several chronic diseases, including &lt;a href="w%3Adiabetes%20mellitus%20type%202"&gt;diabetes mellitus type 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Ahypertension"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, obstructive &lt;a href="w%3Asleep%20apnea"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANon-alcoholic%20fatty%20liver%20disease"&gt;non-alcoholic steatohepatitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aheart%20disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, poor self-esteem, and a lower health-related quality of life. Type 2 diabetes is at an all-time high in American children. According to WHO, obesity also increases the risk of &lt;a href="w%3Astroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and certain forms of &lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. 

While there is no single cause of childhood obesity, experts cite sedentary lifestyle, labor-saving technology, not eating enough fruits and vegetables, calorie-dense fast foods, and deceptive advertising as some of the main causes. A recent report by International Obesity Task Force has said that junk food manufacturers target children, for example, through Internet advertising, chat rooms, text messages, and "advergames" on websites.

The article also mentions the greater prevalence of obesity among two minority populations, African-Americans and Hispanic/Latino, but does not consider in its analysis of the increase in obesity the increase of these populations as a proportion of the United States population.

African-Americans and Hispanic/Latinos have a higher rates of obesity than White Americans, while Asian-Americans have a relatively low rate of obesity. Despite only representing one third of the U.S. population, African-Americans and Hispanic/Latinos represent about one half of the population growth.

Folk musician &lt;a href="w%3ATracy%20Grammer"&gt;Tracy Grammer&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of the duo &lt;a href="w%3ADave%20Carter%20and%20Tracy%20Grammer"&gt;Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer&lt;/a&gt;, has posted to Wikipedia to correct misrepresentations and misconceptions about her time with &lt;a href="w%3ADave%20Carter"&gt;Dave Carter&lt;/a&gt;, who died of a heart attack in July of 2002. Grammer addressed the persistent rumors about whether she and Carter were involved in a romantic relationship, confirming that they entered into one in 1997, a year after they met, and had lived together from 1999 to 2002, although their relationship had been "in transition" at the time of Carter's death as he began pursuing a gender change in 2002. Prior to her comments on Wikipedia, the only public comment on the matter had been the repeated assertion that Carter and Grammer were "partners in all things" due to their desire to "keep the focus on their music."

Grammer also explained why she did not own the rights to Carter's songwriting catalogue, stating that the rights passed to Carter's ex-wife due to a will dating from before Carter and Grammer began their partnership. Grammer's offer to purchase the catalogue was rejected, and after "considerable acrimony," the catalogue was purchased by Carter's sister, Elise Fischer, who made arrangements with Grammer to administer the catalogue.

An album, ♡❤Seven is the Number♡❤, containing Dave Carter's final recordings with Tracy Grammer will be released in October.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADixie%20Chicks"&gt;Dixie Chicks&lt;/a&gt; screened their new documentary, "&lt;a href="w%3ADixie%20Chicks%3A%20Shut%20Up%20and%20Sing"&gt;Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing&lt;/a&gt;", at the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Toronto International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; (TIFF).

Directed by Cecilia Peck and &lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Kopple"&gt;Barbara Kopple&lt;/a&gt;, the documentary follows the group from the London gig in 2003 in which lead singer &lt;a href="w%3ANatalie%20Maines"&gt;Natalie Maines&lt;/a&gt; said she was "ashamed" &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; came from Texas, up to the release of their latest album. Even though their latest album has gone platinum, the &lt;a href="w%3ACountry%20Music%20Association"&gt;Country Music Association&lt;/a&gt; has not nominated them for the &lt;a href="w%3ACMA%20Awards"&gt;CMA Awards&lt;/a&gt;, and many radio stations still do not play their music. But despite the controversy, the Dixie Chicks are in the media, getting good reviews.

"When Natalie made her comments particularly from the country music box, there was no community, they were out there all on their own," said Kopple. "Our hope with this film, is that people will see it and no longer will the Chicks stand alone."

"They never asked me to apologize. We never debated that," said Maines. "What I said can come off as silly or whatever and just everything that has happened since then, it's more of a disgrace, just watching the footage from Hurricane Katrina, it's unbelievable." "At this stage, I don't think that I am pissing off any new people," she commented. "Yes, thank God for Canada," said Maines, noting the band found political support from countries around the world. "It's a little surprising that the U.S. hasn't necessarily caught on yet."

The band says the experience gave them the ability to stand up for what they believe in, and strengthened their bond.

The United States of America have beaten the New Zealand &lt;a href="w%3AWheel%20Blacks"&gt;Wheel Blacks&lt;/a&gt; to win the &lt;a href="w%3AWheelchair%20rugby"&gt;2006 Wheelchair Rugby Championships&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth championship ever held.

The final score was 34-30 at Christchurch, New Zealand's Westpac Stadium. The Americans had led by one point following the first quarter, 9-8, and went into half time with the US leading 16-15, but the lead spaced further apart going into the final quarter, 25-23.

US and New Zealand, the Athens 2004 paralympic champions, had played each other previously in the tournament with US coming out winner 42-34.

Grant Sharman, New Zealand Wheel Blacks coach, said: "The Wheel Blacks did not quite have their 'A game' in the final today and the Americans played extremely well."

US played a near-faultless game of wheelchair rugby, which won them the match.

The defending champions, Canada, finished third place overall by defeating Great Britain 23-19.

In Tuesday's speech the Pope quoted a 14th Century Christian emperor who said the &lt;a href="w%3AProphet%20Muhammad"&gt;Prophet Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; had brought the world only "evil and inhuman" things. The comment created angry protests among the Muslim community. Today, &lt;a href="w%3AVatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; secretary of state &lt;a href="w%3ATarcisio%20Bertone"&gt;Tarcisio Bertone&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement that quotes "The Holy Father is very sorry that some passages of his speech may have sounded offensive to the sensibilities of Muslim believers". Bertone added that the Pope is sorry that his statements had been "badly interpreted".

Various street demonstrations have been held in Pakistan, India, Turkey and Gaza in the past days. Moreover, some leading religious leaders and politicians have criticised the remarks. Some rejected the pope's statement, claiming that it did not go far enough (Egypt's &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Brotherhood"&gt;Muslim Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;).

The president of the &lt;a href="w%3APeer-Directed%20Projects%20Center"&gt;Peer-Directed Projects Center&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Levin"&gt;Rob Levin&lt;/a&gt;, has today passed away after being hit by a car whilst riding his bike on Tuesday. He is survived by his wife Debbie and his son Benjamin.

Mr. Levin was known to many as "lilo", his favoured IRC moniker. He entered a coma after being struck by the vehicle on Tuesday. It is believed he was not wearing a cycle helmet at the time of the collision. The incident is being treated as a hit and run.

A global notice on freenode was sent:

His funeral will be held in Houston, Texas. He was 50 years old at the time of death.

A special e-mail address, condolences[at]freenode[dot]net, has been setup for people to send their messages to. All messages sent to this address will be published in the online "Book of Memories" and passed on to his wife and family.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Intelligence"&gt;Senate Select Committee on Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; has found no link between &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. The 148-page report that was 3-years in the making states that Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al-Qaeda and regarded Islamic extremism as a threat to his regime.

U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Walker%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and Vice-President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; maintained since before the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;2003 invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, that the Iraqi government had direct, operational links with al-Qaeda and was thus at least partially responsible for the terrorist attacks on the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center%20buildings"&gt;World Trade Center buildings&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;.

More recently, during an August 21 presidential press conference, President Bush responded to questions by Ken Herman of ♡❤Cox Newspapers♡❤ concerning the sagging Bush poll numbers with:&lt;blockquote&gt;President Bush - ...I don't think you've ever heard me say, gosh, I'd better change positions because the polls say this or that. I've been here long enough to understand you cannot make good decisions if you're trying to chase a poll. And so the second part of your question is, look, I'm going to do what I think is right, and if people don't like me for it, that's just the way it is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ken Herman - Quick follow-up. A lot of the consequences you mentioned for pulling out [of Iraq] seem like maybe they never would have been there if we hadn't gone in. How do you square all of that?.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;President Bush - I square it because, imagine a world in which you had Saddam Hussein who had the capacity to make a weapon of mass destruction, who was paying suiciders to kill innocent life, who would -- who had relations with Zarqawi... terrorists attacked us and killed 3,000 of our citizens before we started the freedom agenda in the Middle East. &lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ken Herman - What did Iraq have to do with that?&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;President Bush - What did Iraq have to do with what?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ken Herman - The attack on the World Trade Center?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;President Bush - Nothing, except for it's part of -- and nobody has ever suggested in this administration that Saddam Hussein ordered the attack. Iraq was a -- the lesson of September the 11th is, take threats before they fully materialize, Ken. Nobody has ever suggested that the attacks of September the 11th were ordered by Iraq. I have suggested, however, that resentment and the lack of hope create the breeding grounds for terrorists who are willing to use suiciders to kill to achieve an objective. I have made that case...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

43% of Americans believe that Saddam Hussein was personally involved on the attacks of &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011th%2C%202001"&gt;September 11th, 2001&lt;/a&gt; according to &lt;a href="w%3AOpinion%20Research%20Corporation%20for%20CNN"&gt;Opinion Research Corporation for CNN&lt;/a&gt;.

A 66-year old Italian nun was shot dead by gunmen in a hospital run by SOS Children in Islamist-controlled &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;. Sister Leonella Sgorbati was training nurses at the SOS mother and child clinic in Mogadishu. She allegedly forgave her murderers before she died.

Muslim leaders in the region have demanded that Muslims "hunt down" and kill the Pontiff. They have also told worshippers that "whosoever offends our Prophet Mohammed should be killed on the spot by the nearest Muslim". The attack comes in the wake of a speech made by the Pontiff on Tuesday in which he quoted a 14th Century Christian emperor who said the &lt;a href="w%3AProphet%20Muhammad"&gt;Prophet Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; had brought the world only "evil and inhuman" things.

The Pope after delivering &lt;a href="w%3AAngelus%20Blessing"&gt;Angelus Blessing&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday has issued a personal statement regarding his remarks last week in &lt;a href="w%3ABavaria"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; that angered the Islamic community. He quotes "I am deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address at the University of Regensburg, which were considered offensive to the sensibility of Muslims." Senior imams in India have supported the Pope's apology and calls for an end to violent protests. The Pope also clarifies the statement quoting "These in fact were a quotation from a medieval text, which do not in any way express my personal thought." 

The full apology statement can be read from the BBC's website.

The two leaders spoke for over an hour in private to sort out their issues and work out a plan to recommence peace-talks, which were stalled for some time in the aftermath of the &lt;a href="w%3A11%20July%202006%20Mumbai%20train%20bombings"&gt;11/7 bombings&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;.

"These talks are happening in the aftermath of the Mumbai blasts. The two countries have decided to condemn terrorism in all its forms," Indian Prime Minister Singh said, while the President hailed his country's relations with India saying ♡❤Mohabbat Zindabad♡❤ (long live goodwill). The Foreign Secretaries of the two nations will now meet to discuss such issues as the demilitarisation of the &lt;a href="w%3ASiachen"&gt;Siachen glacier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Creek"&gt;Sir Creek&lt;/a&gt; and also the status of confidence building measures such as the Lahore-Amritsar bus service and the &lt;a href="w%3AThar%20Express"&gt;Thar Express&lt;/a&gt;.

The two countries have decided to form an Indian-Pakistani institution to fight and identify terrorism. The possibility of the intelligence agencies from both countries sharing information with each other is also being explored.

President Musharraf stated that "all outstanding issues including the key Kashmir factor" needed to be resolved. He also invited Dr. Singh to visit &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Study%3A%20chemicals%20from%20cruciferous%20veggies%20kill%20cancer%20cells&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A new study conducted by researchers from &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Otago"&gt;University of Otago&lt;/a&gt;'s Christchurch School of Medicine has found that certain chemical compounds naturally found in &lt;a href="w%3Acruciferous%20vegetables"&gt;cruciferous vegetables&lt;/a&gt; help kill cancer cells that are particularly resistant to &lt;a href="w%3Achemotherapy"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;. The study has been published in &lt;a href="w%3ACancer%20Research%20%28journal%29"&gt;Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;.

The research team found that chemicals called &lt;a href="w%3Aisothiocyanate"&gt;isothiocyanate&lt;/a&gt;s cause cancer cells to commit suicide. This includes cells with high levels of the protein Bcl-2, which makes them resistant to chemotherapy. Isothiocyanates are naturally found in cruciferous vegetables. These include kale, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, bok choy, radish, and watercress, among others. 

Dr. Mark Hampton, the team leader, said that "a cancer cell with a lot of Bcl-2 has increased resistance to chemotherapy drugs that are used to destroy the tumor. We've found that Bcl-2 can't protect cancer cells against certain isothiocyanates".

<h1>Mujahedeen Army issues threat of attack on Vatican City</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mujahedeen%20Army%20issues%20threat%20of%20attack%20on%20Vatican%20City&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The statement is issued to "you dog of Rome" then begins to threaten Rome saying, we will "shake your thrones and break your crosses in your home. Our minds will not rest until we shake your thrones and break your crosses in your home. We swear to God to send you people who adore death as much as you adore life. Rome will be a witness when Muhammad destroys the Vatican. Rome's cross will be destroyed."

The threat comes after &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; recited verses from a conversation between Emperor Byzantine Manuel II Palaiologos and a Persian man in the 14th century. The Pope quoted Palaiologos as saying, "show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."

Because of the threat, security around Pope Benedict has been increased.

"The preoccupations make reference not only to the Vatican City, but also to diverse objectives that are somehow conducive to the Catholic world," the ♡❤Dominican Today♡❤ news agency quoted the ♡❤Italian News Agency♡❤ as saying.

Security around the Pope "will be discreet not to disturb the context of the mass however, meticulous and attentive, it will cover a more extensive area than what is habitual. [We] have reinforced safety measures in the area surrounding the Vatican."

Secretary of State of the Vatican City, Cardinal Tarcisio said that the Pope apologized for the way his remarks made during a speech at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Regensburg"&gt;University of Regensburg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; on September 12 2006 were interpreted saying, "the Holy Father is very sorry that some passages of his speech may have appeared offensive to Muslims and were interpreted in a way he hadn't intended them to be. [The speech was supposed to reflect] the relationship between religion and violence in general, and to conclude with a clear and radical rejection of the religious motivation for violence, from whatever side it may come."

The Pope apologized in public today saying, "at this time I wish also to add that I am deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address at the University of Regensburg, which were considered offensive to the sensibility of Muslims. These [comments] were in fact a quotation from a medieval text which do not in any way express my personal thought."

"I hope that this serves to appease hearts and to clarify the true meaning of my address, which in its totality was and is an invitation to frank and sincere dialogue, with great mutual respect," added the Pope.

Police were called to the set of the television crime show, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACSI%3A%20Miami"&gt;CSI: Miami&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ during filming, when a real body was seen washing up on shore.

A police officer for the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Dade%20Police%20Department"&gt;Miami Dade Police Department&lt;/a&gt; spotted the body while he was working on the show which was being filmed in Bicentennial Park in &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

The cast of the show were attempting to get shots from the air using a helicopter when the officer spotted the body floating a few yards from the set's location.

"Unfortunately, it's not unusual during certain times of the year that people who have fallen in the bay, either homeless people or people who were asleep or in some cases boaters who had a mishap, fall into the bay and turn up days later," said Delrish Moss, a detective for Miami Police.

There is no word on what caused the individual's death, but police say an autopsy will be performed on the body.

Earlier in the week, the set of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACSI%3A%20New%20York"&gt;CSI: New York&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was also turned into a real crime scene when a mummified body was discovered inside a building located in Los Angeles, California where the show was being filmed.

The ♡❤Miami Herald♡❤ reported an unnamed source as saying that the corpse "was discovered by a building engineer who checked on the tenant because he had not paid rent for the month."

♡❤CSI: New York♡❤ just finished filming an episode with a similar plot.

<h1>Street protests in Hungary over PM's taped lies</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Street%20protests%20in%20Hungary%20over%20PM%27s%20taped%20lies&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Despite rainfall and Sunday late evening local time, street demonstrations started in &lt;a href="w%3AHungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt; hours after almost all of Hungarian electronic media coordinatedly published a taped recording of &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20minister"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFerenc%20Gyurcs%C3%A1ny"&gt;Ferenc Gyurcsány&lt;/a&gt;'s confidential address made to a gathering of &lt;a href="w%3Asocialist%20party"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMSZP"&gt;MSZP&lt;/a&gt; leaders on 26th May 2006.

In the recording, Mr. Gyurcsány is heard to admit openly, often using &lt;a href="w%3Aprofanity"&gt;foul language&lt;/a&gt; that the last 1½—2 years of his government and his victory in the &lt;a href="w%3AHungarian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202006"&gt;spring legislative elections&lt;/a&gt; were based on lies, doctored fiscal data and he admits the four years under his government has created absolutely nothing remarkable.

The most commonly quoted part of his monologue, when translated literally:

The original in &lt;a href="w%3AHungarian%20language"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt;:

The widespread publication of this monologue quickly led to a spontaneous gathering of an estimated 1200 to 2000 people, mostly young adults, in front of the seat of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20of%20Hungary"&gt;Legislature of Hungary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABudapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt;. About one hundred &lt;a href="w%3Ariot%20police"&gt;riot police&lt;/a&gt; and two water-cannon trucks are securing the restricted grass area around the building, while protesters are chanting with demands for Mr. Gyurcsány to immediately step down and schedule a new &lt;a href="w%3Aelection"&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; before the year ends. 

According to midnight news, about 50 young people are leading a march in the rural town of &lt;a href="w%3AZalaegerszeg"&gt;Zalaegerszeg&lt;/a&gt; with the intention to harangue more support for the protest and lead a crowd to Budapest.

The prime minister has appeared on a liberal controlled cable TV channel "ATV" and later on nationwide commercial television "TV2". He pledged not to resign. He said the taped disclosure was fine, as the country can now finally understand why their spring censoring of state fiscal information and their election promises were justified - according to him the victory of Christian conservative &lt;a href="w%3AFidesz"&gt;Fidesz&lt;/a&gt; party would have pushed the country into even deeper economic and social turmoil.

According to a &lt;a href="w%3AH%C3%ADr%20TV"&gt;Hír TV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aeditorial"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;, the current &lt;a href="w%3Ascandal"&gt;scandal&lt;/a&gt; and the resulting public protest bears a harrowing similarity to early events of the &lt;a href="w%3A1956%20Hungarian%20Revolution"&gt;Hungarian revolution of 1956&lt;/a&gt; when a group of university students started a street protest against the communist regime after hearing leaked excerpts of the &lt;a href="w%3ASecret%20Speech"&gt;Secret Speech&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;a href="w%3ANikita%20Khruschev"&gt;Nikita Khruschev&lt;/a&gt; wherein he denounced his predecesor's (&lt;a href="w%3AJosef%20Stalin"&gt;Josef Stalin&lt;/a&gt;) regime. This comparison is disputed by other media.

Sweden's centre-right opposition has narrowly won &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20general%20election%2C%202006"&gt;Sunday's general election&lt;/a&gt;, beating a &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Social%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic&lt;/a&gt; government for only the third time since the Second World War. The provisional results give 48.1% of the vote to the four-party &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20for%20Sweden"&gt;Alliance for Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and 46.2% to the government and its two supporting parties, which translates to a seven-seat majority in the 349-seat &lt;a href="w%3ARiksdag"&gt;Riksdag&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden's parliament. A detailed summary of results can be found in the Wikipedia article on the election.

Around 22.50 CET last night &lt;a href="w%3AModerate%20Party"&gt;Moderate Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AFredrik%20Reinfeldt"&gt;Fredrik Reinfeldt&lt;/a&gt; claimed victory at his party's election night vigil in Stockholm. Referring to the Moderates' renewal under his leadership, he said: "We stood for election as the New Moderates. We have won as the New Moderates. We will also - together with our Alliance friends - govern as the New Moderates." &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Sweden"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AG%C3%B6ran%20Persson"&gt;Göran Persson&lt;/a&gt; admitted defeat shortly afterwards at the &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Social%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;'s election night vigil: "We have lost the election, but we are not a beaten party. We will fight back." He said however, that he "would not lead the comeback", and announced his resignation as Prime Minister but also that he would resign as party leader in March 2007, at the party conference convened to choose his successor. Mr Persson has announced that he will hand in his resignation at 16.00 CET today.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20Riksdag"&gt;Speaker of the Riksdag&lt;/a&gt;, who in Sweden is constitutionally responsible for proposing a new government to the Riksdag, is expected to officially ask Mr Reinfeldt to form a government tomorrow. The opposition &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20for%20Sweden"&gt;Alliance for Sweden&lt;/a&gt; (composed of the &lt;a href="w%3AModerate%20Party"&gt;Moderate Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACentre%20Party%20%28Sweden%29"&gt;Centre Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Sweden%29"&gt;Liberal People's Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democrats%20%28Sweden%29"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;) had already agreed a common programme and on Mr Reinfeldt as its prime ministerial candidate before the election.

The centre-right opposition has bounced back from a decisive defeat in the &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20general%20election%2C%202002"&gt;general election of 2002&lt;/a&gt;, when the Moderate Party's proposal of large tax cuts and disunity between the four parties led to the government increasing its majority. Commentators are agreed that the move of the Moderate Party towards the centre under its new leader &lt;a href="w%3AFredrik%20Reinfeldt"&gt;Fredrik Reinfeldt&lt;/a&gt; and the agreements reached between the four parties of the centre-right on major policy areas were important in gaining victory. The Moderate Party in particular did well, achieving its best result since 1928 and making a gain of 10.9 percentage points, the biggest gain made by any party since 1914. In contrast, the &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Social%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt; had their worst result since 1914, with 35.2% of the vote.

The key issue in the election was employment. The opposition argued that more needed to be done to get people into work to support Sweden's generous &lt;a href="w%3Awelfare%20state"&gt;welfare state&lt;/a&gt;, and proposed to cut income taxes on those with lower incomes and to cut payroll tax, especially for the private services sector and for companies hiring long-term unemployed. This was to be funded mainly by cutting unemployment benefit from 80% of previous income to 70% after 200 days and 65% after a further 300 days. The opposition also argued for more choice in the welfare system.

The government pointed to Sweden's impressive economic growth, good fiscal situation and low unemployment rate of around 6%. They also attacked the opposition for wanting to undermine the "Swedish model" and attacking those who were already most vulnerable by cutting unemployment benefit. The opposition countered by arguing that unemployment is higher than official statistics suggest because of the large numbers of people on long-term sick leave and in early retirement, as well as government employment schemes.

Sweden's new government will be presented to the &lt;a href="w%3ARiksdag"&gt;Riksdag&lt;/a&gt; on 6 October, and will present its first &lt;a href="w%3Agovernment%20budget"&gt;budget&lt;/a&gt; on 16 October.

Photographs published by the ♡❤Investigate♡❤ magazine and the newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sunday%20Star-Times"&gt;Sunday Star Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has shown the Prime Minister of New Zealand &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark's&lt;/a&gt; husband, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Davis%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;Peter Davis&lt;/a&gt;, being hugged and kissed by openly gay Auckland GP (General Practitioner) Dr. Ian Scott on election night 2005. The editor of ♡❤Investigate♡❤, Ian Wishart, stated that at no time has ♡❤Investigate♡❤ ever suggested Davis is gay.

Wishart said that he has "Been targeting Mr Davis for months and has appealed for readers to send him details of his private life. [My] article makes no homosexual inferences and is merely an attempt to background Davis ahead of reports to follow." 

♡❤Investigate♡❤ has been publishing a series of stories involving Davis about an alleged incident overseas. They were tipped off by New Zealand law enforcement. "The picture is all about trying to find out more about the alleged incident. [I am] working through overseas sources to investigate the allegations. Regardless of what his investigation uncovers, the results will be published." Wishart also says there is more 'dirt' to come.

Clark has called it a "pack of lies" and labelled it as a smear campaign. "I've been aware of a smear campaign circulating for many months. Actively circulated by National Party people. And I've had countless friends phone me about it. It's been assiduously spread through circles in business, the law, accountants – it's just come from all quarters."

Dr. Scott is a close friends of the couple and was, according to Clark, "reasonably boisterous and drunk," when the situation occurred and Davis was "a bit disgusted," when he was kissed. "We have a particularly small group of very close friends . . . and Ian is right in there. He is one of our oldest friends as a couple. There is not a shred of truth to what Wishart says," said Clark.

"People just fall about themselves laughing when they see that was the great 'gay' allegation," Clark said.

Clark has partly blamed the Exclusive Brethren for the smear campaign as they were allegedly the ones who campaigned to unseat Labour and also allegations that they hired a private detective to follow Davis, the church has denied having any involvement. Clark has said "the smear campaign against her husband had spread far too wide for it to be the work of the Brethren alone," so she also blames Brash.

"I think the National Party has stooped to new levels with his leadership. I think we're seeing the absolute desperation of, actually, the far Right in politics, which feels it has a right to rule, couldn't cope with losing three elections in a row and there's a desperation and nastiness about it and it will stoop to anything," Clark said.

Brash said that he rejects and condemns the rumour-mongering and a spokesman said: "he [Brash] nor any of his MPs were involved in spreading them [rumours]. National believes the private lives of politicians and their families should be just that – private."

A source for the National Party said that people had phoned in with the rumour and National told them to "go away."

Gerry Brownlee, Deputy leader of National, denies any National Party involvement. He said: "Despite Don Brash coming under fire for admitting his marriage was in difficulties amid speculation he had an affair, National is not in a vengeful mode and rejects any such suggestion. The private lives of the families of MPs should be left out of the public eye."

Media experts are passing off ♡❤Investigate♡❤♡s story as poor journalism. Including the head of New Zealand Broadcasting School, Paul Norris. Norris said: "The leader of a party has to expect their private life to impact on their leadership but in this case it seems Clark does not have a lot to answer to. The story has very little substance."

Clark has denied that a meeting between Brash to discuss toning down personal attacks will take place. But does say a meeting between party representatives could be arranged.

Clark has told the New Zealand Police that she believes that they have been followed by private detectives. The police are yet to confirm that they are investigating the claim as of Monday morning. Clark said that she has been "told by a number of sources that private investigators have been hired to follow both herself and her husband, Professor Peter Davis."

Anousheh Ansari, 40, an &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt;-American became the first female paying passenger astronaut today. Paying $20 million [USD] for the trip, she replaced a &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; businessman who decided not to take the trip due to medical reasons. The &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; made &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20Rocket"&gt;Soyuz Rocket&lt;/a&gt; lifted off at 04:10 GMT from &lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%2C%20Russia"&gt;Baikonur, Russia&lt;/a&gt;.

Ansari is a businesswoman in the telecom industry and put up the Ansari X Prize for the first privately funded trip to space won by Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites and his team.

The mission is expected to dock with the ISS on Wednesday.

The special &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorism%20and%20Disruptive%20Activities%20Act"&gt;TADA&lt;/a&gt; court hearing the &lt;a href="w%3A1993%20Mumbai%20bombings"&gt;1993 Mumbai blasts&lt;/a&gt; case has found two of the accused, Asghar Mukadam and his accomplice Qureshi guilty of executing the explosion near &lt;a href="w%3APlaza%20Cinema"&gt;Plaza Cinema&lt;/a&gt; that killed 10 people and injured 27. Mukadam, the manager of main-accused &lt;a href="w%3ATiger%20Memon"&gt;Tiger Memon&lt;/a&gt; (who is still absconding), parked a car laden with &lt;a href="w%3ARDX"&gt;RDX&lt;/a&gt; near the theatre. Qureshi aided Mukadam by arranging for the explosives to be brought from Raigad to &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;.

Special Judge P.D Kode convicted Mukadam of 12 of the 14 charges brought against him, including abetting and intentionally facilitating the commission of terrorist acts, collecting funds for terrorist acts and conspiracy. Qureshi was found guilty of transporting the RDX via boat to the Maharashtra coast, and then bringing it into Mumbai. He was also found to have participated in the meeting where the bombings were planned, and visiting &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; to be trained in the execution of the attacks.

The TADA court began pronouncing the verdict in the 1993 bombings which killed 257 in 13 explosions, on the 12 of this month, and has so far found seven persons guilty in the serial blasts case. Four members of the Memon family were convicted last week, and Mohammad Shoaib Kasam Ghansar (Tiger Memon's hitman) was found guilty on Thursday.

Comedian &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Vegas"&gt;Johnny Vegas&lt;/a&gt; peeved talk show host &lt;a href="w%3ACharlotte%20Church"&gt;Charlotte Church&lt;/a&gt; during his appearance. She slapped him, and shouted "Shut the fuck up", after he made numerous rude comments and stared down female audience members. 

The comedian suggested Church looked tense, and offered the former smoker "have a cigarette." Church has appeared in a national anti-smoking campaign. 

When Church commented that she and he sang karaoke together in a hotel owned by her mother, Vegas replied "Yes and I shagged your grandma too."

<h1>Ethane clouds found on Titan</h1>

"Our observations imply that surface deposits of ethane should be found specifically at the poles, rather than globally distributed across Titan's disk as previously assumed. That may partially explain the lack of liquid ethane oceans and clouds at Titan's middle and lower latitudes," University of Arizona planetary scientist Caitlin Griffith in a statement on the &lt;a href="http%3A//saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.cfm"&gt;Cassini-Huygens website&lt;/a&gt;.

"We think that ethane is raining or, if temperatures are cool enough, snowing on the north pole right now. When the seasons switch, we expect ethane to condense at the south pole during its winter," added Griffith.

Cassini recently took pictures of what scientists call "lakes and oceans" on Titan and scientists now believe that the oceans, filled with methane, may also be "rich" with ethane.

"We now know that Titan's surface is largely devoid of lakes and oceans. During the polar winters, we expect the lowlands to cradle methane lakes that are rich with ethane. Perhaps these are the lakes recently imaged by Cassini," said Griffith.

VIMS first detected the clouds during flybys in December 2004 and September and August 2005.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.

Avila won by approximately 131,000 votes, a margin of just over three per cent of the four million votes cast in the final.

"I'm just one tiny person on this planet but thanks to you guys, I'm feeling like I'm sitting on top of the world," Avila said Sunday.

Avila sang what will be the first single of her upcoming album: ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMeant%20to%20Fly%20%28Eva%20Avila%20song%29"&gt;Meant to Fly&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, co-written by &lt;a href="w%3AChantal%20Kreviazuk"&gt;Chantal Kreviazuk&lt;/a&gt; and her husband &lt;a href="w%3ARaine%20Maida"&gt;Raine Maida&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ABMG%20Music%20Canada"&gt;Sony BMG Music Canada&lt;/a&gt; is the record label that will be releasing her single on September 26. Her new recording was on the radio airwaves at 12 am. today.

"The fact that all Canada is voting and the votes were so close ... I'm happy that she won," he said. "I mean, I'm sad that I lost, but we are different and she's just amazing," Craig Sharpe said.

Wanakafest has attempted to break the world record for the longest bra chain. They fell short by 107,297 bras, but raised more than NZ$10,000 for the Breast Cancer Research Trust charity in the attempt to beat the record currently held by &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;. The record is 114,782 bras which was made on April 30 this year.

The bra chain, however, did manage to create a distance of 5 kilometers from 7,485 bras collected from all over the world over a period of six weeks. The bras included such places as United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Australia and from numerous places in New Zealand. 1,000 bras collected in North Hampton, England, courtesy of the BBC, did not count for the final tally. Three sacks full of bras, delivered complete with spiders, cob webs and cockroaches, from the world-famous &lt;a href="w%3ACardrona%20Bra%20Fence"&gt;Cardrona bra fence&lt;/a&gt; in Otago which farmer John Lee had to dismantle after council pressure earlier this year.

Wanakafest managed to collect $10,000 for charity by donations sent in with people's bras, bras previously owned by celebrities were auctioned on New Zealand auction site, &lt;a href="w%3ATradeMe"&gt;TradeMe&lt;/a&gt;, community fundraisers and an art auction.

Kerry Quin, Wanakafest manager, said that she was "thrilled with how the community got behind the fundraiser. We have had so much support – not only from Wanaka locals, but also from throughout New Zealand. It's great to be able to give money to such a worthy cause."

The Wanakafest organisers are unsure what will happen to the bras collected but Ms Quinn has said that a Napier charity asked for them and were not told what the purposes for them were.

Quinn said: "Some were so tiny you wonder why they bother, and some so big you wonder how they walk!"

Voters in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Brunswick"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; narrowly defeated the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Brunswick%20Progressive%20Conservative%20Party"&gt;Progresive Conservative&lt;/a&gt; government of &lt;a href="w%3APremier"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABernard%20Lord"&gt;Bernard Lord&lt;/a&gt; giving &lt;a href="w%3AShawn%20Graham"&gt;Shawn Graham&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Brunswick%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Liberals&lt;/a&gt; a narrow upset victory in yesterday's &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Brunswick%20general%20election%2C%202006"&gt;general election&lt;/a&gt;. 

While the Tories edged the Liberals in the popular vote by a margin of 47.65% to 47.00%, the Liberals will form a &lt;a href="w%3Amajority%20government"&gt;majority government&lt;/a&gt; having won 29 seats to the Conservatives' 26 while the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20New%20Brunswick"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; was shut out. Graham, 38, will become premier displacing Lord, 40, who held the office for two terms. Lord becomes the first New Bruwnswick premier to fail to win a third term since the 1950s.

"Welcome to a new era for our province," said Graham in his victory speech. "It is with great humility tonight that I accept this mandate from the people of New Brunswick."

"But the first thing we will do is bring back the pride of New Brunswickers," he said. "Today, New Brunswickers made a choice and that choice was change. You have chosen hope. We can not wait another day. We have worked to earn your trust and now we will work to keep your trust."

Lord accepted the result telling his supporters that "serving as Premier for the last seven years has been an honour and a privilege. I was hoping that we had the energy [to win] but in the end I accept the decision of the people of New Brunswick." 

In the election, the Liberals picked up two seats from the Tories in northern New Brunswick where the government had made several controversial hospital closings.

After only five months on the job, &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Education%20%28Ontario%29"&gt;Education minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Pupatello"&gt;Sandra Pupatello&lt;/a&gt; moved to the trade portfolio while &lt;a href="w%3Aparliamentary%20secretary"&gt;parliamentary secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKathleen%20Wynne"&gt;Kathleen Wynne&lt;/a&gt; has been promoted to the education portfolio. 

Pupatello had faced criticisms for her handling of a conflict with three school boards, including both of the Toronto District School Board and the Toronto Catholic board which have not balanced their budgets. Wynne, a former Toronto school trustee, is seen as being less pugnacious than her predecessor and as having a better relationship with the boards. Pupatello had insisted that the boards' problems were self-inflicted and some Queen's Park reporters such as the ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤♡s education reporters suggest the change in ministers may indicate a change of attitude by the government. 

Cordiano, 48, has been in politics for 21 years and says he wants to spend more time with his wife and daughters. "I'm standing here with very mixed emotions," Cordiano told reporters, "after a great deal of reflection, I've decided my time here should come to an end."

The &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; bungled the case of &lt;a href="w%3AMaher%20Arar"&gt;Maher Arar&lt;/a&gt; leading to an innocent man being tortured in &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; following his deportation from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, according to the findings of the federal inquiry into the affair. Justice Dennis O'Connor's report, released yesterday, reveals that the RCMP erroneously told the United States that Arar was linked to &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; and wrongly described him as an "Islamic extremist individual". 

"The potential consequences of labelling someone an Islamic extremist in post-9/11 are enormous" wrote O'Connor. 

Based on information received from the RCMP, Arar was detained on September 16, 2002, during a stopover at &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20Airport"&gt;JFK Airport&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. After being held in the US for two weeks he was deported to Syria under the US policy of "&lt;a href="w%3Aextraordinary%20rendition"&gt;extraordinary rendition&lt;/a&gt;" and was detained in a Damascus prison for a year without charges and tortured before being returned to Canada. 

"I am able to say categorically that there is no evidence to indicate that Mr. Arar has committed any offence or that his activities constitute a threat to the security of Canada," O'Connor wrote in his 822 page report. "This was not a case where investigators were unable to effectively pursue their investigative goals because of lack of resources or time constraints. On the contrary, Canadian investigators made extensive efforts to find any information that could implicate Mr. Arar in terrorist activities... The results speak for themselves: they found none," stated the report. 

Arar, 36, was relieved by the findings and was tearful when he first read them.

"I think the Canadian public has always believed that I was innocent. But it's very different when it comes from a respected jurist like Justice O'Connor," he said saying also that the judge had "cleared my name and restored my reputation."

Thailand's army general ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in a military coup, declaring martial law and revoking the constitution. Army spokesperson Col. Akara Chitroj said army Commander-in-Chief Gen. &lt;a href="w%3ASondhi%20Boonyaratkalin"&gt;Sondhi Boonyaratkalin&lt;/a&gt; would be acting prime minister. An announcement from the military earlier declared a provisional authority loyal to &lt;a href="w%3ABhumibol%20Adulyadej"&gt;King Bhumibol Adulyadej&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier a number of tanks had surrounded the government headquarters in the capital of &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of troops had deployed at government installations and major traffic intersections. &lt;a href="w%3ASVT"&gt;Swedish television&lt;/a&gt; has shown footage of troops with military vehicles setting up checkpoints on roads, as well as soldiers on guard (follow the video links within the article). The footage shows troops wearing yellow ribbons tied to their uniforms, the color of the King.

The Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; has declared a state of emergency from New York, where he is currently with the UN. "The prime minister with the approval of the Cabinet declares serious emergency law in Bangkok from now on," Thaksin said on a government-owned TV channel. He has also sacked the current Thai army commander.

There was a scare last week when several army tanks were seen in the streets of Bangkok, but army commanders said they were simply returning from exercises.

The last coup was 15 years ago, back in February 1991; there have been 23 coups (successful or attempted) in the last 74 years in the country.

Thailand has been in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand%20political%20crisis%202005-2006"&gt;political turmoil&lt;/a&gt; since the results of &lt;a href="Third%20of%20Thais%20vote%20%27none%20of%20the%20above%27"&gt;April's general elections&lt;/a&gt; were annulled, leaving the country without a working legislature. Thaksin had won elections in 2001 and 2005, and was widely expected to win &lt;a href="Thai%20election%20rerun%20likely%20in%20November"&gt;planned elections in November&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Sky News, 50 soldiers have been said to be inside Bangkok's Government House.

All international news stations were taken off the network of cable operator UBC. All local stations are now airing a military speech loop stating everything will be over shortly.

The army issued this statement shown on national TV:

♡❤"Whereas the political reform commission under the democratic constitutional monarchy, comprising the commanders in chief of the armed forces and the head of the national police, have secured the situation in Bangkok and nearby suburbs without any resistance.

"In the interest of maintaining law and order, a request is therefore made for public cooperation for which our apologies for any inconvenience."♡❤

&lt;a href="w%3AFlight%20controller"&gt;Flight controller&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.A&lt;/a&gt; observed an unidentified object at approximately 7:45 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; today moving at an undetermined distance from the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;Space Shuttle Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; as it orbited the Earth at an altitude of over 190 &lt;a href="w%3Anautical%20miles"&gt;nautical miles&lt;/a&gt;. As of 16:00 UTC, there was still uncertainty as to the object's size and distance from the orbiter. Video of the object showed it following an undeviating path between the shuttle and the Earth below. 

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; released the following statement on its official website: "An object was observed by flight controllers using a TV camera on the shuttle in close proximity to the spacecraft. It was observed following standard tests of Atlantis' reaction control system about 2:45 a.m. today. Flight controllers continue to analyze the situation and are concerned the item may be something that came off of Atlantis."

The shuttle had been scheduled to land at 15:45 UTC on Wednesday, but concerns raised by the object, in addition to an unfavorable weather forecast, prompted &lt;a href="w%3AMission%20Control%20Center"&gt;Mission Control Center&lt;/a&gt; to "wave off" the landing until 11:32 UTC Thursday at the earliest.

&lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that flight controllers first saw the object shortly after sensors in the shuttle's wings indicated the craft had been "hit by something", but the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reports that NASA officials believe the sensor reading was triggered by the spacecraft itself as it fired positional jets. As of 18:00 UTC the leading theory at NASA is that something escaped from the shuttle's cargo bay during that jet firing sequence. Cameras will be focused on the object throughout the night and a detailed inventory of cargo bay items will be taken in an effort to learn whether a safe landing can be made without the object, if it in fact belonged to the shuttle.

The judge in charge of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATrial%20of%20Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;genocide trial&lt;/a&gt; has been replaced, the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister's office said. 

A government spokesman said that the court agreed to replace Grand Judge Abdullah al-Amiri with a new judge.

"We asked the court to replace him because he said that Saddam wasn't a dictator, which was a violation of his neutrality." said government spokesman Ali Dabbagh.

"The court told us he has already been replaced. This was a decision by the cabinet of the prime minister."

The court is trying Hussein, his cousin &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Hassan%20al-Majeed"&gt;Ali Hassan al-Majeed&lt;/a&gt;, known as "Chemical Ali," and five others on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for their role in the &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Anfal%20Campaign"&gt;1988 Anfal campaign&lt;/a&gt; against ethnic Kurds.

Hussein and al-Majeed also face the graver charge of genocide. If found guilty, all men face death by hanging.

The court was set up by US occupying forces to try Hussein for war crimes, and genocide. It is now run by the Iraqi government, with the United States acting as an advisor body.

They say that since &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, the home of recent Idol winner &lt;a href="w%3AEva%20Avila"&gt;Eva Avila&lt;/a&gt;, is bigger and therefore Avila got more votes and that Canadian Idol was fixed because Sharpe is a &lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundlander"&gt;Newfoundlander&lt;/a&gt;. Officials at &lt;a href="w%3ACTV%20television%20network"&gt;CTV&lt;/a&gt; said such talk was nonsense.

Residents throughout the province increasingly complained of jammed residential phone lines. It happened so much that a payphone "Vote Craig" campaign was launched. In recent weeks Sharpe supporters drove at night looking for available payphones. Pay phones had a high success rate for registering calls, while home-based lines often got busy signals.

"Newfoundland knows how to represent their people," Sharpe said. "But you can't make it to the top two with just Newfoundland. You've got to have Canada behind you." 

"Canadian Idol is not a popularity contest based on region," said Scott Henderson, a spokesman for CTV. "Craig and other finalists from Newfoundland have made it as far as they have in the competition because they receive the support of the entire country."

It was the second year in a row that a Newfoundlander finished second on the show. &lt;a href="w%3ARex%20Goudie"&gt;Rex Goudie&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ABurlington%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Burlington, Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt; lost last year to &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMelissa%20O%27Neil"&gt;Melissa O'Neil&lt;/a&gt;.

Avila beat Sharpe by a three per cent margin, just over 131,000 votes, in the last show that CTV officials said was determined by fans in &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Canada"&gt;Western Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

During the opening day of the 61st annual &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; used his address to challenge the effectiveness of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"Can a council in which they [the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="UK"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;] are privileged members address their violations? Has this ever happened?" President Ahmadinejad asked the assembly. "In fact we have repeatedly seen the reverse."

"The persistence of some hegemonic powers in imposing their exclusionist policies on international decision making mechanisms, including the Security Council, has resulted in a growing mistrust in global public opinion, undermining the credibility and effectiveness of this most universal system of collective security," President Ahmadinejad said. 

The US President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; address earlier on Tuesday spoke both to the assembly and the world Islamic population.

"Freedom, by its nature, cannot be imposed &amp;mdash; it must be chosen. From Beirut to Baghdad, people are making the choice for freedom. And the nations gathered in this chamber must make a choice, as well: Will we support the moderates and reformers who are working for change across the Middle East &amp;mdash; or will we yield the future to the terrorists and extremists?" President Bush asked.

"My country desires peace. Extremists in your midst spread propaganda claiming that the West is engaged in a war against Islam. This propaganda is false and its purpose is to confuse you and justify acts of terror," said President Bush. "We must seek stability through a free and just Middle East where the extremists are marginalized by millions of citizens in control of their own destinies."

"To the people of Iran," President Bush said, "You deserve an opportunity to determine your own future, an economy that rewards your intelligence and your talents, and a society that allows you to fulfill your tremendous potential. The greatest obstacle to this future is that your rulers have chosen to deny you liberty and to use your nation's resources to fund terrorism, and fuel extremism, and pursue nuclear weapons."

President Ahmadinejad was not present for the mid-afternoon address by President Bush.
Ahmadinejad also did not attend the UN's traditional banquet for visiting presidents, princes and prime ministers, where dignitaries have a chance to mix informally, because alcohol (the consumption of which is forbidden in Islam) was served at the banquet. The banquet this year was held in honor of UN Secretary &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Anan"&gt;Kofi Anan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who will step down after two consecutive 5-year terms ending December 31.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; police have arrested and charged four men, aged between 20 and 30 for an assault on a &lt;a href="w%3Asynagogue"&gt;synagogue&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt; at 2:30 am on Sunday, September 17th. 

The four arrested are from different ethnic backgrounds and can be detained up to three days before appearing in front of a judge. Police have not ruled out further arrests over the incident.

At least 10 shots were fired at the synagogue. Nobody was injured in the incident. It is believed that the attack was carried out with an assault rifle. 

The Mosaic Religious Community, which owns the site had requested better protection following threats and an incident of vandalism last month.

More than 150 people were injured when protestors clashed with &lt;a href="w%3AHungary"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; police in the capital &lt;a href="w%3ABudapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. The protestors were demanding the resignation of the Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3A%20Ferenc%20Gyurcsany"&gt;Ferenc Gyurcsany&lt;/a&gt; after a videotape in which the PM tells MPs that the government "lied throughout the last year-and-a-half, two years..." and that there were no "significant government measure we can be proud of" came to light on Sunday. 

The tape recorded a meeting held a few weeks after the April elections and the PM, in a speech riddled with obscenities says that tough economic measures are needed but admits lying to voters during the elections. The revelations have lead to protests in the capital and several other cities and more are planned, calling on the PM to resign. The Prime Minister has announced that he has no plans to resign and has vowed to continue his budget reforms. On Monday, he was backed by a unanimous vote by Socialist MPs.

The Hungarian President, &lt;a href="w%3ALaszlo%20Solyom"&gt;Laszlo Solyom&lt;/a&gt; has said that the revelations have created a "moral crisis" and opposition parties have demanded his resignation, and the centre-right &lt;a href="w%3AFidesz"&gt;Fidesz&lt;/a&gt; party said that they plan to boycott Parliament over the affair.

Some protestors have stormed buildings and set cars alight. On Tuesday, trouble began when a group of protestors, who were trying to hand in a petition, and some broke into the state television building. Police used tear gas and water cannons to quell the protests. About 150 people were reported injured, including 102 police officers.

A population study, released by &lt;a href="w%3AStatistics%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Statistics New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; titled ♡❤A History of Survival in New Zealand♡❤, highlights that the life expectancy of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; males born in the mid 1890's would have been five years higher without the impact of the two world wars, as 10% of males died in war. Also males born in the late 1910's would have had a three year higher life expectancy, without the impact of the two world wars as well. The new study is an international study of survival and mortality.

The study also reveals that a male born in the late 1870's would have had an average life span of 51-years-old and in the 1930's the average life span was 69-years-old. And in females the life expectancy is 75-years-old, previously 55-years-old.

Kim Dunstan, Statistics NZ &lt;a href="w%3ADemography"&gt;demographer&lt;/a&gt;, said: "The dramatic lifespan changes were attributed to many factors, including improved hygiene, sanitation, medicines and infectious disease control. Changes in lifestyle had also made an important difference."

People born in the late 1870's had a 23% chance of not making it to see their 15th birthday, people born in the 1900's had a 15% chance, people born in the 1930's had a seven percent chance, people born in the 1960's had a three percent chance and those born around the 1990's had a one percent chance.

Mr Dunstan said: "The study provided the most complete picture of how long New Zealanders lived and showed for the first time the impact of war deaths on the population. Death comes to us all and it does affect us at a lot of levels. A lot of people have had family members who died in the war and can relate to their own experiences."

♡❤A History of Survival in New Zealand♡❤ also shows that New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world that has an almost complete and detailed history of births, deaths and migration information dating back to the late 1800's. This study is a historic book full of births, deaths and external migration for the population of New Zealand. It will also be used in the future relating to health, population and mortality areas. It is also unique because it follows the population from birth right through to death. "We see the study very much as the basis for further work ... across other organisations in New Zealand and, indeed, internationally," Mr. Dunstan said.

Abe is a third-generation politician related to two former Prime Ministers. The election comes on the day before his 52nd birthday. He is expected to become the nation's first Prime Minister born after &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;.

"The LDP has helped make Japan a democracy that has contributed to the world," Abe said after the vote. "I will demonstrate my leadership to preserve the flame of ideals, and put reforms forward as the first party leader from the postwar generation."

Microsoft is set to release an &lt;a href="w%3AHD-DVD"&gt;HD-DVD&lt;/a&gt; upgrade to its media centre, gaming device, the &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;. The HD-DVD add-on would be an external accessory, and is expected late November in Japan for about ¥20,000, and in the US, about $170.

Microsoft will also be releasing a Software Update to the Xbox, that will allow full &lt;a href="w%3A1080p"&gt;1080p&lt;/a&gt; output, with automatic 1080p upscaling. However, they have not announced if future games will have native support at 1080p

Tuesday morning, &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; correspondent, &lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Walters"&gt;Barbara Walters&lt;/a&gt; announced on the television program, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20View"&gt;The View&lt;/a&gt;, that she is flying to &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; to talk with &lt;a href="w%3ATerri%20Irwin"&gt;Terri Irwin&lt;/a&gt;, the widow of &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Irwin"&gt;Steve Irwin&lt;/a&gt;. 

The exclusive interview will be televised next week.

Irwin died recently when stung by a &lt;a href="w%3Astingray"&gt;stingray&lt;/a&gt;, the subject of a segment for a show he was producing with his young daughter as host.

Steve and Terri Irwin ran the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20Zoo"&gt;Australia Zoo&lt;/a&gt; together, while Steve hosted many animal related series and specials, the most famous of which was titled ♡❤Crocodile Hunter♡❤.

While she is only on ♡❤The View♡❤ full-time, Walters stated on that program that journalism for &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; is still her "bread and butter".

&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20cricket%20team"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Indies%20cricket%20team"&gt;Windies&lt;/a&gt; by 16 runs in the fifth &lt;a href="w%3AODI"&gt;ODI&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AKinrara%20Oval"&gt;Kinrara Oval&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AKuala%20Lumpur"&gt;Kuala Lumpur&lt;/a&gt;, thereby keeping alive their hopes of making it to the finals of the DLF Cup tri-series. The West Indies were chasing 163 to win, but were bowled out for 146 at the end of the 41st over. India will now face &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; in the semi-final on Friday. The West Indies have already secured themselves a place in the final.

Winning the toss, India elected to bat first but got off to a disastrous start. Skipper &lt;a href="w%3ARahul%20Dravid"&gt;Rahul Dravid&lt;/a&gt; was caught behind off Dwayne Smith's bowling for a duck, and was soon followed by &lt;a href="w%3AVirender%20Sehwag"&gt;Virender Sehwag&lt;/a&gt; who was bowled by Smith after getting just one run off six balls. Suresh Raina, &lt;a href="w%3ASachin%20Tendulkar"&gt;Sachin Tendulkar&lt;/a&gt; and Harbhajan Singh helped bring India's total up above the 150-mark, even as the rest of the batting order collapsed under the West Indian attack.

The Indian bowlers managed to put some pressure on the Windie batting order by getting some early wickets. Shivnaraine Chanderpaul, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Runako Morton were all dismissed in the 20s, following which the rest of the West Indies batsmen were all sent back to the pavilion by the 41st over.

A new report released by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Wildlife%20Federation"&gt;National Wildlife Federation&lt;/a&gt; finds that, in the United States, the animals of many different species, including species eaten by humans, are contaminated with mercury at levels higher than previously thought. &lt;a href="w%3AMercury%20poisoning"&gt;Mercury poisoning&lt;/a&gt; in humans, which can result from eating contaminated animals, leads to a wide range of conditions, including kidney and neurological damage, fatigue, vision problems, and tremors. Mercury poisoning in some animals is severe enough to result in death or reduced fecundity.

While many people are aware of mercury contamination of fish, more recent studies have found that insects, and animals that eat them, also have high levels of mercury. Felice Stadler, from the National Wildlife Federation, says that "the research shows birds that eat contaminated insects get contaminated themselves. &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey%20%28bird%29"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3Achicken"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;s, which humans eat, eat those same contaminated insects, so this is the tip of the iceberg." 

Confirming previous studies, the report also finds high mercury levels in animals that eat fish. Because of the high mercury levels, 46 of the 50 states have issued advisories for pregnant women and children against eating certain types of fish, including &lt;a href="w%3Atuna"&gt;tuna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aswordfish"&gt;swordfish&lt;/a&gt;. States have also issued other warnings because of mercury-contaminated foods. For example, Florida has issued a warning against eating &lt;a href="w%3Aalligator"&gt;alligator&lt;/a&gt; meat; Utah, against eating &lt;a href="w%3Ashoveler"&gt;shoveler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Agoldeneye%20%28duck%29"&gt;goldeneye&lt;/a&gt; ducks. 

According to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, the National Wildlife Federation is the largest American conservation organization. The report, released on Tuesday, is based on 65 different scientific studies conducted by more than 20 scientists. It highlights that, in the United States, mercury is accumulating in a diversity of species, including species of fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and in a diversity of environments, including freshwater, marine, and forest habitats. Some of the animals in which mercury is accumulating include &lt;a href="w%3Asongbird"&gt;songbird&lt;/a&gt;s, alligators, &lt;a href="w%3Aturtle"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="w%3Abat"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="w%3Aotter"&gt;otter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="w%3Apolar%20bear"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="w%3Amink"&gt;mink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aduck"&gt;duck&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="w%3Aloon"&gt;loon&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href="w%3Abald%20eagle"&gt;bald eagle&lt;/a&gt;s. 

Felice Stadler says that the report "underscored how pervasive mercury contamination has become. Nearly every aspect of our &lt;a href="w%3Afood%20chain"&gt;food web&lt;/a&gt; has been contaminated. It's difficult to find an ecosystem that's not contaminated, whether it's ocean or forest or coastal waters or wetlands."

According to Wikipedia, mercury exposure in humans can result in brain damage, birth defects, severe neurological consequences, mercurial &lt;a href="w%3Aptyalism"&gt;ptyalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMinamata%20disease"&gt;Minamata disease&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly autistic behaviors. 

In the United States alone, mercury pollution is about 100 tons per year. Primary sources of pollution include coal-burning power plants, waste water treatment plants, and waste incinerators.

A Wikinews analysis of financial reports filed with &lt;a href="w%3AElections%20Canada"&gt;Elections Canada&lt;/a&gt; shows that two of the candidates for the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada%20leadership%20convention%2C%202006"&gt;leadership&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; have not made any financial donations to the party, its &lt;a href="w%3Ariding%20association"&gt;riding associations&lt;/a&gt;, or election candidates in 2005 or 2006. Neither &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt; nor &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; are recorded as having made finanical contributions.

Ironically, Ignatieff was the recipient of a donation from one fellow leadership candidate, &lt;a href="w%3AMartha%20Hall%20Findlay"&gt;Martha Hall Findlay&lt;/a&gt;, who donated $230.58 to his successful effort to be elected to the House of Commons in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20election%2C%202006"&gt;January 23, 2006 federal elections&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt;, a former leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20New%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Ontario New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; donated a total of $845 to the Liberals since the beginning of 2005 including $300 to MP &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Godfrey"&gt;John Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;'s election campaign and $300 to &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Pettigrew"&gt;Pierre Pettigrew&lt;/a&gt;'s riding association in &lt;a href="w%3APapineau%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Papineau&lt;/a&gt;. He also donated money to NDP candidates in the January election including $300 to &lt;a href="w%3AIrene%20Mathyssen"&gt;Irene Mathyssen&lt;/a&gt;, who was a cabinet minister under Rae in the 1990s, and $250 to his former special assistant, &lt;a href="w%3ARochelle%20Carnegie"&gt;Rochelle Carnegie&lt;/a&gt;, the NDP's candidate in &lt;a href="w%3AWillowdale"&gt;Willowdale&lt;/a&gt;. Carnegie's Liberal rival was &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Peterson"&gt;Jim Peterson&lt;/a&gt;, brother of former Ontario premier &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Peterson"&gt;David Peterson&lt;/a&gt; whose government Rae defeated in &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20general%20election%2C%201990"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Brison"&gt;Scott Brison&lt;/a&gt; is the most generous Liberal having donated a total of $3175 to the party, its candidates and riding associations, followed by &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Dryden"&gt;Ken Dryden&lt;/a&gt; who donated $2145, &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Volpe"&gt;Joe Volpe&lt;/a&gt; who has donated $1695, &lt;a href="w%3AHedy%20Fry"&gt;Hedy Fry&lt;/a&gt; with $1323.49, Hall Findlay with $1290.85, Rae's $845 and &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Dion"&gt;Stephane Dion&lt;/a&gt; with $595.

Totals do not include donations made by the candidates to their own leadership campaigns. Wikinews examined financial reports for donations to political parties, riding associations and federal election candidates made in 2005 and 2006.

&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Hammond"&gt;Richard Hammond&lt;/a&gt;, a British television presenter known for presenting shows such as ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATop%20Gear"&gt;Top Gear&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABrainiac%3A%20Science%20Abuse"&gt;Brainiac&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, is in a "stable" condition in hospital following a car accident during filming for ♡❤Top Gear♡❤. He was injured when the jet-powered car he was driving crashed during filming for the former. The car, similar to the "Vampire" which holds the British land speed record, overturned whilst being driven at speeds of up to 300 miles per hour at Elvington airfield near York, in what was suggested to be an attempt at bettering the previous record. It has been suggested that he succeeded in a previous attempt. Emergency services were called to the scene at 5.45pm local time (16.45 UTC).

He was airlifted to the specialist neurological unit at Leeds General Infirmary. A former firefighter who was providing fire safety at the site and witnessed the accident said that Hammond was initially unconscious but able to speak when removed from the wreckage. At the time he indicated some pain in his lower back. Numerous eyewitnesses from the ♡❤Top Gear♡❤ crew claimed he was 'helped into' an air ambulance, suggesting he was conscious at the time. The ambulance service is reported to have said that Hammond was unconscious when they arrived at the scene, but began to regain consciousness upon arrival at the hospital.

The car was "very very badly damaged and in many pieces on the runway", according to BBC News 24, reporting comments made by his colleagues. 

A &lt;a href="http%3A//www.justgiving.com/PHRichardHammond%3Fpage%3D1%23donationtable%7C"&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;
has been set up for well-wishers enabling them to donate to the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.yorkshireairambulance.org.uk/"&gt;Yorkshire Air Ambulance&lt;/a&gt;. This site will accept donations until January 21, 2007. As of 23.09 (UTC) 21st September 2006 (day 2) £52,239.90 had been raised, surpassing the original target of £340.00 and well past their target of £51,000 (150 flights) that was set in the past few days.

On Monday four Canadian soldiers were killed in a suicide bomb attack. The soldiers were in Afghanistan since the end of July and in operations since the beginning of August. They are now returning home in Canada for a memorial service.

Pte. David Byers, 22, of &lt;a href="w%3AEspanola%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Espanola, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; was identified after a suicide bomber attacked the soldiers in Kandahar. On Tuesday, the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20National%20Defence%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Department of National Defence&lt;/a&gt; said the attack also killed Cpl. Glen Arnold, based in &lt;a href="w%3ACFB%20Petawawa"&gt;CFB Petawawa&lt;/a&gt;, northwest of Ottawa; and Cpl. Shane Keating of Saskatoon and Cpl. Keith Morley, based at &lt;a href="w%3ACFB%20Shilo"&gt;CFB Shilo&lt;/a&gt; in Manitoba were also killed.

"All three of these men were proud citizens and exceptional examples of the men and women who serve this country, both at home and abroad," said Maj. Stephen Joudrey, acting commanding officer for 2PPCLI at CFB Shilo, on Tuesday.

The Prime Minister also made a statement saying: "I wish to send my heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of Corporal Glen Arnold, Corporal Shane Keating, Corporal Keith Morley, and Private David Byers, who were killed by a suicide bomber yesterday in the Panjwayi region of Afghanistan."

Thirty six Canadian soldiers have died in Afghanistan since 2002.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has given the 'ok' for the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;Space Shuttle Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; to land on Thursday September 21. NASA also says that there was "no damage" to the shuttle when astronauts spotted a piece of debris floating next to the shuttle.

"We are cleared for entry. Nothing was found to be missing or damaged from the thermal protection system, the heat shield of the space shuttle Atlantis, or, in fact, any other part of the shuttle Atlantis," said N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle's program director.

The debris is believed to be a piece of plastic from under the shuttle's heat tiles. A similar piece was seen by cameras falling from inbetween the heat shield tiles, but when the camera took another look, there was nothing to be found. Hale says that the source of the debris is unknown and that "we [NASA] may never know" where it came from.

"This is most likely the culprit. It was there before, it's not there now. It was most likely shaken loose during the flight control system checkout. We probably will never know for sure," added Hale.

Astronauts used Atlantis's robotic arm to check the shuttle and its heat shield for any signs of damage.

&lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20Soccer%20League"&gt;Premier Soccer League&lt;/a&gt; club, &lt;a href="w%3AKaizer%20Chiefs%20Football%20Club"&gt;Kaizer Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; could be in hot water again. Less than a year after the club was fined for badly behaved fans, last night saw some of the 6000 atendees go on the rampage after the Johannesburg based club lost to &lt;a href="w%3AWits%20University%20Football%20Club"&gt;Bidvest Wits University&lt;/a&gt; by 2 goals to nil.

Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp, as well as players had to run for cover as fans ripped up chairs and hurled them onto the field to express their disappointment at a poor start to the season. So far Kaizer Chief's, one of South Africa's premier soccer clubs, have yet to win a game in this season.

Last year, the club was penalised by being made to play two games behind closed doors but after months of legal wrangling, the PSL decided to lower the punishment to just one game.

Comment is still pending from the soccer league and the club.

Two weeks after &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASurgeon"&gt;surgeons&lt;/a&gt; successfully &lt;a href="w%3ATransplantation"&gt;transplanted&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="w%3AOrgan%20donation"&gt;donated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APenis"&gt;penis&lt;/a&gt; onto an unidentified 44-year-old man, they were requested to remove it. Despite functioning perfectly and having been physically accepted by the body, the patient and his wife asked for the penis to be &lt;a href="w%3Aamputation"&gt;amputated&lt;/a&gt;, due to the severe &lt;a href="w%3APsychological%20trauma"&gt;psychological trauma&lt;/a&gt; they had both suffered.

A team of surgeons led by Dr Hu Weilie took 15 hours to attach the penis, which was donated by the family of a 22-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ABrain%20death"&gt;brain-dead&lt;/a&gt; patient. Doctors have successfully re-attached patients' own severed members in the past, but this was the first use of a second-party penis.

The psychological rejection of the penis is not unusual from a medical point of view; in 2001 surgeons removed the world's first &lt;a href="w%3AHand%20transplant"&gt;transplanted hand&lt;/a&gt; from donee &lt;a href="w%3AClint%20Hallam"&gt;Clint Hallam&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted the "hideous and withered" hand to be removed because he had become "mentally detached" from it. The team that led the transplant have since performed the world's first double arm transplant.

A &lt;a href="w%3AJet%20Airways"&gt;Jet Airways&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt; with 89 people on board was involved in a near-collision with a formation of &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Indian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASu-30"&gt;Sukhoi-30s&lt;/a&gt; in the skies over &lt;a href="w%3ARajkot"&gt;Rajkot&lt;/a&gt; airport at around 8:30 AM (&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Standard%20Time"&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt;) today. The Jet Airways plane developed a technical snag as a result of the sudden climb it had to execute to avoid the fighter jets, which were participating in the ♡❤Gagan Shakti♡❤ air-exercise. The 737 was subsequently grounded at Rajkot.

Preliminary reports suggest that the narrowly-averted mishap may have been caused due to a lack of co-ordination between the Jet Airways crew and Rajkot air-traffic controllers. A Jet spokemsan said that flight 9W-345 from &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChhatrapati%20Shivaji%20International%20Airport"&gt;CST&lt;/a&gt; to Rajkot was on a normal approach to the airport, when the &lt;a href="w%3AACAS"&gt;ACAS&lt;/a&gt; (Aircraft Collision Avoidance System or Airborne Collision Avoidance System) instructed the pilots to climb from 22,500 ft to 23,000 ft. The 737 reportedly came within 500 feet of the IAF jets. 

The Air Force statement issued in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, however, said "Prima facie reports available suggest that the fighter aircraft did not pose any threat to the civil airliner as they were under control of ground-based radar and in visual contact." An inquiry with the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation is underway to investigate the incident.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWelsh%20Assembly%20Government"&gt;Welsh Assembly Government&lt;/a&gt; has announced that smoking will be banned in enclosed public places on April 2, 2007. The ban will affect pubs, clubs, bars and restaurants and all other enclosed public spaces in &lt;a href="w%3AWales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;, although smoking in beer gardens etc will be at the discretion of the landlord. The ban will come into effect one month before the Welsh &lt;a href="w%3Ageneral%20election"&gt;general election&lt;/a&gt;, on the same day as a similar ban in &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and before a ban in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; already has a similar smoking ban in place. 

People lighting up after April 2, 2007 will face on the spot fines. New bilingual no smoking signs will need to be prominently displayed.

&lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20for%20Democratic%20Reform%20under%20Constitutional%20Monarchy"&gt;Council for Democratic Reform under Constitutional Monarchy&lt;/a&gt; (CDRM) on Thursday banned &lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20party"&gt;political party&lt;/a&gt; meetings of more than five people on national television. Moreover there is also a ban on new political parties from being formed. However political parties still have the right to exist. The military also promised that civilian rule will be restored within a year. Meanwhile the military is taking hold of all duties and responsibilities of the parliament.

On Tuesday the coup leaders suspended the 1997 constitution and imposed &lt;a href="w%3Amartial%20law"&gt;martial law&lt;/a&gt;. This prompted concern over the international level. The U.S. warned on Thursday that any ban on political parties would be a 'setback' for democracy.

The army issued the following statement shown on national television:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; To ensure the constitutional monarchy is functioning after reforms have been completed, the Council for Democratic Reform Under Constitutional Monarchy has ordered political parties to halt all meetings and political activities.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – Thai military spokesman&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Thai citizens returned to work on Thursday ever since Tuesday's coup. &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; appeared to have returned to normal even though there were tanks on the streets as well as soldiers manning major traffic checkpoints.

Canadian PM &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; made a speech at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;UN General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; today in New York. He talked about Canada's role in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Canada has 2,300 soldiers in the southern Afghan city of &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;, scene of a series of major clashes with the Taliban. Twenty Canadians have died in Afghanistan in the last three months alone, 36 soldiers and a diplomat have died since 2002.

"Let us be realistic. The challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous. There will be no quick fixes. Moreover, success cannot be assured by military means alone," Harper told the U.N. "Difficulties don't daunt us. But lack of common purpose and will in this body would. ... If we fail the Afghan people, we will be failing ourselves."

Harper spoke to the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday night, talking about recent opinion polls that show most Canadians are opposed to the mission. "I don't really accept that Canadians are opposed to the mission. I think what Canadians regret, what hurts Canadians a lot, is seeing their brave men and women in uniform lose their lives," he said.

Harper also talked about other challenges facing the UN, including conflicts affecting Haiti, Darfur and Lebanon, and suggested that the time for getting tough with Iran over its nuclear ambitions is getting close.

Afghan President &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt; is due to address the Canadian Parliament on Friday and also making a three day visit to Canada which started today.

A complaint made against Internet service provider (ISP) &lt;a href="w%3AiHug"&gt;iHug&lt;/a&gt; by M. McNatty has been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). McNatty complained that he was not told of the special conditions of banner adverts he saw on the iHug website.

McNatty said: "I signed up [to iHug] but discovered I had shot over my limit and iHUG had reduced my download speed from 100 to 64kps. I rang iHUG and they explained that I had gone over my 1 GB traffic allotment by 230%. I explained I was on the 3 GB plan and they went on to tell me that 2 of the 3GB can only be used between the hours of 2 a.m. and 10 a.m." He then went on to talk to the manager of iHug but was told there was nothing he could do so he asked to be upgraded to the more expensive option of the 15 GB plan.

iHug replied to the complaint by saying: "It appears that M. McNatty has briefly looked at the front page of our broadband section without either reading down the page to the what you get section or clicking on the info or join now links on our website. If he had, he would have found information about the peak and off-peak split of data allowances. He has then rung the iHug call centre, where our call centre personnel have been instructed to inform customers of the details of data allowances because many customers don't understand how much data they will need. If the customer service representative has failed to explain how the data allowances work then that is a mistake on our part, for which I am sincerely apologetic. iHug has taken steps to resolve this by stressing to Customer Service Managers that they must remind their teams to fully explain data allowances during the sign up call."

iHug then went on to apologize to McNatty if felt he had been misled but said: "I think it is unreasonable for M. McNatty to expect all information pertaining to a broadband application to be contained in detail on a small banner advert which is clearly design to capture interest only and lead the customer to further information."

The ASA complaint board then reviewed the advertisement and noted that the advertisement clearly identified that information related to the offer was available on other pages and that a customer would most likely know that plans varied and would ask for clarification before subscribing.

But then said, referring to the 3 GB plan advertisement; "However, nowhere in the main offer or the immediate conditions headed, "ihug broadband – what you get", did it inform the consumer that 2 of the 3 GB could only be used between the hours of 2 a.m. and 10 a.m., one third being peak user time, two thirds being off-peak user time. This, in the Complaints Board's view, significantly diminished the offer of '3 GB data', to the extent that the offer could be considered to be 'exaggerated'. As such the Complaints Board said that it would be likely to mislead the consumer."

They also noted that the wording "generous peak download allowance" was a hyperbole and overstated the product offered, which amounted to misleading the customer.

The Complaints Board said: "A website advertisement was not limited by a time constraint such as a television advertisement, or restricted by space available, and thereby there was no apparent reason why this paramount condition could not be more obvious in relation to the offer."

The complaints board then said that if special condition reduced the offer in value then those conditions need to be obvious. They noted that the ad does say conditions do apply. "However, as the condition in this instance diminished the offer in a major way, the Complaints Board was unanimously of the view, that it should have been disclosed in an obvious manner, as part of the initial offer or in close proximity to it," said the complaints board.

The board then noted that the advertisement was in violation of the second rule in the Code of Ethics which states "Truthful Presentation - Advertisements should not contain any statement or visual presentation or create an overall impression which directly or by implication, omission, ambiguity or exaggerated claim is misleading or deceptive, is likely to deceive or mislead the consumer, makes false and misleading representation, abuses the trust of the consumer or exploits his/her lack of experience or knowledge. (Obvious hyperbole, identifiable as such, is not considered to be misleading)." The board did uphold the complaint.

There will be an anti-coup gathering at 6 p.m., Bangkok time (GMT+7), (11:00 GMT) at the Siam Paragon shopping mall in downtown Bangkok. Due to the military's ban on protests and gatherings of more than 5 people, violence is expected to erupt.

Please note that the website www.19sep.org, the homepage of the group organizing the gathering, has already been shut down by the junta.

<h1>Venezuelan President Chavez criticises U.S. President Bush in U.N. address</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Venezuelan%20President%20Chavez%20criticises%20U.S.%20President%20Bush%20in%20U.N.%20address&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In an address to the UN General Assembly in New York on September 20, 2006 Hugo Chávez, President of Venezuela, sharply criticized the US government and its policies.

At the same time he announced his country's bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council, saying that it will speak for all countries which "have no power, no power to make any impact on the terrible situation in the world" for which, he indicated, the US is responsible. 

President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; said that the greatest terrorist threat for the world is the US government and its imperialistic policies. When speaking to the assembly, Chávez displayed the book "&lt;a href="w%3AHegemony%20or%20Survival"&gt;Hegemony or Survival&lt;/a&gt;", written by &lt;a href="w%3ANoam%20Chomsky"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;, and recommended "this excellent book" to the audience. He described this book as being written "clearly and in depth" an that "the American empire is doing all it can to consolidate its system of domination."

He said that "the hegemonic intentions of the imperialistic power are threatening the world", and called on all the peoples of the world, including Americans, to respond to that threat.

He warned Americans that "The devil is right at home. The devil -- the devil, himself, is right in the house. And the devil came here yesterday.", apparently referring to the United States President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;w:George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;.

Hugo Chavez criticized Bush, saying the he was "talking as if he owned the world", and called him "the spokesman of imperialism". 

Talking about the US efforts at nation-building, he said that it is "a very original democracy that's imposed by weapons and bombs and firing weapons.", adding "What a strange democracy. Aristotle might not recognize it or others who are at the root of democracy."

When pushing his agenda of democracy and free trade in Latin America, Chávez accused President Bush of being a racist, saying that President Bush would look "at your color" and he say "oh, there's an extremist. &lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt;, the worthy president of Bolivia, looks like an &lt;a href="w%3Aextremist"&gt;extremist&lt;/a&gt; to him."

Chavez indicated Bush discriminates against Morales because Morales was the country's first Indian president.
The newly elected president of Bolivia, announced plans of socializing part of the energy resources, particularly gas in Bolivia in 2005 in a move to try to be more independent from multinational coorporations.

As the president of the Bolivian Senate, Santos Ramirez, put it: "Bolivia and Latin America are no longer the servile democracies that tolerate...poverty and the surrendering of sovereignty."

Chavez is pushing his own socio-economic agenda. For example the People's Trade Treaty consisting of Bolivia, Venezuela and Cuba and &lt;a href="w%3AMercosur"&gt;Mercosur&lt;/a&gt;, an economic union designed after the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; for which in turn Bush sharply criticized him.

Chavez defended Morales in his speech by saying "The imperialists see extremists everywhere. It's not that we are extremists. It's that the world is waking up."

Chavez referred to Bush's speech the day before, when Bush directly addressed the peoples of Afghanistan, Lebanon and Iran, telling the assembly "what would those peoples of the world tell him if they were given the floor? What would they have to say? - They would say, "Yankee imperialist, go home."".

To address the current political issues he mentioned, Chavez complained that "But we, the assembly, have been turned into a merely deliberative organ. We have no power, no power to make any impact on the terrible situation in the world. And that is why Venezuela once again proposes, here, today, 20 September, that we re-establish the United Nations."

In particular. he criticized the "the anti-democratic" veto held by the Permanent Five members of the Security Council,
Citing the "immoral" veto of the United States which he said, "allowed the Israelis, with impunity, to destroy Lebanon.", referring to the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict&lt;/a&gt;

Chavez said that he wants to provide an "alternative way of thinking" and canvassed for the support of the international community for Venezuela to attain a seat on the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; to "to save our planet, to save the planet from the imperialist threat." and "for our children and our grandchildren a world of peace based on the fundamental principles of a renewed United Nations."

<h2>U.S. Response</h2>
U.N. Ambassador John Bolton said the remarks don't warrant a response.
The US is currently lobbying for Venezuela not to attain a seat on the U.N. Security Council.

Rep. Charles Rangel (Democrats) who represents a New York City neighborhood which Chavez recently visited said 
"I just want to make it abundantly clear to Hugo Chavez or any other president - don't come to the United States and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that Americans do not feel offended when you offend our Chief of State. Any demeaning public attack against him is viewed by Republicans and Democrats, and all Americans, as an attack on all of us."

&lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;'s State Security Court has sentenced seven people to be executed for their involvement in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Amman%20bombings"&gt;2005 Amman bombings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , on Thursday, September 21. A failed female suicide bomber was the only defendant in custody, all others were tried &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIn%20absentia"&gt;♡❤in-absentia♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

All seven were found guilty of conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts causing death and destruction, and illegal possession of weapons and explosives.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASajida%20al-Rishawi"&gt;Sajida al-Rishawi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , 39, was the only person in custody. She was arrested when she tried to hide with the family of her sister's husband.

Mrs. al-Rishawi confessed to the attacks on television four days after the attacks. She described her attempts to detonate an explosives on her belt.

However she pleaded not guilty and claimed the confessions were extracted through torture but had no evidence of this. 

Prosecutors say she tried to blow herself up with her husband, Ali al-Shamari, at the Radisson SAS hotel.

Her lawyer, Hussein al-Masri, argued that she only married her husband Ali Hussein al-Shimeri a day before coming to Jordan and was forced to wear the belt hours before the attack.

"She expected either the death sentence or to be sent back to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;," Mr. al-Masri said. 

"She refused to give me her family address in Iraq because she did not want them to be harmed. So neither her family nor the party that sent her helped us present any evidence that might help her case."

He said that he would appeal against the verdict. Judicial sources say that the verdict can be appealed at the Court of Cassation.

<h1>Transrapid collision in Germany kills 23</h1>

Twenty-three people died when a &lt;a href="w%3ATransrapid"&gt;Transrapid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Amaglev%20train"&gt;maglev train&lt;/a&gt; travelling on the system's test track in &lt;a href="w%3ALathen"&gt;Lathen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; border, collided with a maintenance vehicle on the track. Ten others were severely injured according to Karl-Heinz Brüggemann, a spokesman for the rescue effort.

The driverless train was estimated as operating at 170&amp;nbsp;km/h (105&amp;nbsp;mph) when the accident occurred around 09:30 local time (07:30 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). The unmanned train, with 31 passengers aboard crashed into a maintenance wagon containing 2 workers.

&lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20Germany"&gt;German Chancellor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Angela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; visited the site to pay her respect to the victims and the rescuers.

The train had traveled about 1&amp;nbsp;km (0.6&amp;nbsp;miles) from its departure station when it struck the maintenance vehicle. Debris from the accident was spread over a 300&amp;nbsp;m (984&amp;nbsp;ft) section of track. Police spokesman Hans Kley confirmed that the Transrapid train did not leave the track, which is elevated approximately 5&amp;nbsp;metres (16&amp;nbsp;ft) above the ground. Other reports indicate that the train's roof was torn off in the collision. Rescue workers used ladder trucks from local fire departments to evacuate the stopped train. On hearing of the accident, Germany's Transport Minister &lt;a href="w%3AWolfgang%20Tiefensee"&gt;Wolfgang Tiefensee&lt;/a&gt; suspended his trip in &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and made preparations to return to Germany to view the accident scene.

The 31.8&amp;nbsp;km (20&amp;nbsp;mile) test system in Germany was built by a consortium of &lt;a href="w%3ASiemens%20AG"&gt;Siemens AG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThyssenKrupp"&gt;ThyssenKrupp&lt;/a&gt;. It has been in operation since 1984 and is regularly used by tour groups for demonstration runs four days per week. Transrapid trains are capable of speeds up to 450&amp;nbsp;km/h (280&amp;nbsp;mph). This accident is the first on the system that included fatalities; analysts so far attribute the cause of the accident to a lack of communications between the train operators and the maintenance employees. The only commercial installation of Transrapid technology in service is currently the &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai%20Maglev%20Train"&gt;Shanghai Maglev Train&lt;/a&gt; linking &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai%20Metro%20Line%202"&gt;Shanghai Metro Line 2&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ALongyang%20Road"&gt;Longyang Road&lt;/a&gt; station to &lt;a href="w%3APudong%20International%20Airport"&gt;Pudong International Airport&lt;/a&gt;.

Anyone planning on attending the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2008 Summer Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing%2C%20China"&gt;Beijing, China&lt;/a&gt; can forget about renting a car when they get there.

Newspapers reported on September 18 that no private cars would be allowed near any of the venues in the host city, in an attempt to combat the gridlock that has plagued the city.

Known for its stand-still traffic, Beijing's transport authority believes it needs to curb at least 20% of traffic flow to ensure the Games run smoothly. The number of cars in the city is set to increase from 2.7 million to 3 million by the time of the Olympics. Country-wide, annual car sales are expected to reach 10 million annually by 2010.

A good infrastructure is one of the International Olympic Committee's top priorities when searching for bid cities. The IOC requires that athletes, support staff such as coaches, venue volunteers, spectators, and the press all should be able to get from venue to venue without hassle.

Existing plans in Beijing say that private cars may only drive in the city on alternate days. Plates with odd numbers would drive one day, while even numbered licenses would drive the next day.

♡❤Wired♡❤ magazine has suggested fuel-cell vehicles may be China's next cultural revolution. Vancouver-based venture capitalist Mike Brown told the ♡❤National Post♡❤: "If they get aggressive about this, and they decided to build up a fuel cell manufacturing capability to sell half a million of these things, they'll get the costs down faster than anybody else."

&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Handley"&gt;Joe Handley&lt;/a&gt;, Premier of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Territories"&gt;Northwest Territories&lt;/a&gt;, accused the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (CBC) of ignoring his province in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHockey%3A%20A%20People%27s%20History"&gt;Hockey: A People's History&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (♡❤H:APH♡❤). From the producer of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACanada%3A%20A%20People%27s%20History"&gt;Canada: A People's History&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤H:APH♡❤ is a ten-hour-long miniseries about the origins of Canada's most beloved past times.

The series debut, which aired Sunday on the CBC, centred on games in Nova Scotia and Montréal as being the most importantc dates for the modern game. A group of enthusiasts called the Society for International Hockey Research has long supported the competition on March 3, 1875 in Montréal as the game's birthplace. The game was describe in the news issue of the ♡❤Montréal Gazette♡❤.

Handley, however, supports the Northwest Territories town of Deline as the sport's true roots. British explorer John Franklin refers to his expedition team playing "the game of hockey, played on the ice", while at Grey Goose Lake outside what is now Deline. This journal entry, discovered in 2003, was written in October 1825. The Society for International Hockey Research at the time hailed this as an important finding for sport historians.

Handley, who saw the episode on tape in his Yellowknife offices, told CanWest News Service that "I was disappointed... [the filmmakers apparently] didn't do their research."

The Member of the Legislative Assembly for an area including Deline, Norman Yakeleya, called the documentary "shameful. This is our holy grail. They didn't give any credit to the North."

While the producers were aware of the expedition, and other early games, a CBC spokesperson suggests that the choice was made as the Montreal game is "generally considered to have been clearly reflective of the modern game."

The &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Gross"&gt;Paul Gross&lt;/a&gt;-narrated documentary does make acknowledgements to stick and ball sports from Ancient Egypt, as well as golf-on-ice games in 16th-century Europe.

Halifax-Dartmouth and Windsor, both of Nova Scotia, and Kingston, Ontario are three other cities who have laid claim to the honour.

&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (CBC) chairman Guy Fournier loves going to the washroom, Radio-Canada reports, and his image in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; is suffering because of it.

While trying to defend himself on &lt;a href="w%3ARadio-Canada"&gt;Radio-Canada&lt;/a&gt; program ♡❤Tout le monde en parle♡❤ for false, disparaging comments about the Lebanese, Fournier faced even greater pressure. In May 2006, Fournier gave an interview to a French-language Toronto radio station, spending more than ten minutes recounting his love of what many refer to as "pooing".

According to his account, Fournier was on a train ride in the 1960s with his friend Michel. Michel commented that he considered this particular usage of a washroom as being as great a pleasure as sexual intercourse.

The interview did not receive much attention at the time, due to a limited audience.

In the interview, Fournier comments "as you grow older, you continue to go poop once a day if you are in good health, while it is not easy to make love every day. So finally, the pleasure is longer-lasting and more frequent than the other." He spoke out about distracting oneself on the &lt;a href="w%3Atoilet"&gt;toilet&lt;/a&gt;, and called doing a &lt;a href="w%3ASudoku"&gt;Sudoku&lt;/a&gt; or a crossword a "heresy". He continued that "it is just as heretical as if you read the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Post"&gt;National Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ while making love. It is not to be recommended."

Fournier was on ♡❤Tout le monde♡❤ to apologise for unsubstantiated claims that &lt;a href="w%3Abestiality"&gt;bestiality&lt;/a&gt; is permitted in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, so long as the animal is of the opposite sex. In the 9 September issue of ♡❤7 Jours♡❤, Fournier wrote "In Lebanon, the law allows men to have sexual relations with animals as long as they are female! Doing the same thing with male beasts can result in the death penalty."

His claims were made solely on information found on the Internet.

While an apology was made on the French-language program ♡❤Tout le monde♡❤, which averages over two million listeners, Alain-Michel Ayache at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversit%C3%A9%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec%20%C3%A0%20Montr%C3%A9al"&gt;Université du Québec à Montréal&lt;/a&gt; is unsure whether he'll drop his lawsuit. Ayache, a political science instructor of Lebanese descent, has begun the steps required to file a lawsuit.

Ayache commented to the ♡❤National Post♡❤ that he is astonished Fournier wishes to remain the chairman of the CBC, after using such low journalistic standards.

Legendary Emperor &lt;a href="w%3AQin%20Shi%20Huang"&gt;Qin Shi Huang&lt;/a&gt; of China had one more &lt;a href="w%3ATerracotta%20Army"&gt;terracotta warrior&lt;/a&gt; guarding his tomb, recently. Pablo Wendel, an art student from , disguised himself as one of the clay sculptures surrounding Qinshihuang in his final resting place, now a museum.

Police protecting the northern China museum searched for an extended period of time, as Wendel stood silently, among several thousand sculptures. When police found the 26-year-old performance artist, who later told them he was fascinated by the monumental display, they carried him away "as if he were a log."

China was united by Emperor Qin Shi Huang over 2,200 years ago. The tomb in &lt;a href="w%3AXian"&gt;Xian&lt;/a&gt;, once the capital of China, is open to the public as a museum.

Amid fears of being arrested for breaking the military ban on protests and political gatherings, over 100 people have protested, without any immediate arrests in front of &lt;a href="w%3ASiam%20Center"&gt;Siam Center&lt;/a&gt; in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;.

Although media reports that no arrests have been made, a video posted on a blog shows a protester being interviewed by a foreign reporter, claiming that 7 protesters have been arrested.

Siam Center is the shopping mall directly to the west of &lt;a href="w%3ASiam%20Paragon"&gt;Siam Paragon&lt;/a&gt;. The protest was originally supposed to take place in front of Siam Paragon.

The protesters wore black to symbolize the death of democracy and held banners criticizing the &lt;a href="w%3Acoup"&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of the protesters came from a group whose website, www.19sept.org, was previously shut down by the junta for breaking martial law because it criticized the coup.

Giles Ungphakorn, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University, said: "We believe we speak for a significant number of Thais who are too worried or too afraid to speak.". When information was spreading about the gathering, earlier that day, some were cautioned not to attend.

There are contradictions found in the two first reports by thai media about the protest. The Nation claims that nearly 100 people protested, while The Bangkok Post claims that the number is only 20. The Nation claims that police had recorded the protest on video, while The Bangkok Post claims that only &lt;a href="w%3ASiam%20Center"&gt;Siam Center&lt;/a&gt; security guards were present.

Due to censorship ordered on thai television by the junta, the protest was not shown on thai television. CNN has shown video footage of the protest, however, the thai cable company that broadcasts CNN within Thailand blocks all footage from CNN that talks about the coup.

Although protests are banned by the junta, as are political gatherings of more than 5 people, a deputy commander said: "police had recorded the protest on video and would examine the tape to see if protesters had broken martial law forbidding an assembly of more than five people for political purposes." It is unknown whether the police or junta will later arrest those it has recorded breaking martial law on video.

<h1>Belgian terrorism suspects remain in custody as case details emerge</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Belgian%20terrorism%20suspects%20remain%20in%20custody%20as%20case%20details%20emerge&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A court in &lt;a href="w%3AFlanders"&gt;Flanders&lt;/a&gt; prolonged the custody of 12 suspects on Thursday. Meanwhile, more details emerge in the case against alleged &lt;a href="w%3ANeo-Nazism"&gt;neo-Nazi&lt;/a&gt; group inside the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Belgium"&gt;Belgian army&lt;/a&gt;. They are accused of &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, weapons traffic and &lt;a href="w%3ARacism"&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt;.

Most lawyers involved asked for their clients to be released, and will appeal the court's decision. One lawyer said the police was being influenced politically to make the arrests now, before the &lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20municipal%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;elections of October 8&lt;/a&gt;, and that his client was more of a "immature teenager and weapons freak". The prosecutor is calling some suspects weapons dealers, but the defence lawyers claim they are weapons collectors, and say that terrorism is out of the question.

A spokesperson for the justice department denied this formally, saying that "The weapons traffic of the suspects began to take too large proportions, so we couldn't wait any longer." She also said the army informed them that they considered it too dangerous to take the soldiers involved along on uncoming international missions (&lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; is sending troups to &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;).

The prime suspect and alleged leader of the group is Thomas B. The police thinks he has a neo-Nazistic ideology and was planning attacks to destabilise Belgium. Thomas B. founded a splinter group of &lt;a href="w%3ABlood%20and%20Honour"&gt;Blood and Honour&lt;/a&gt; called 'Bloed, Bodem, Eer en Trouw' (Eng: Blood, Soil, Honour and Fidelity), after the British headquarters of the &lt;a href="w%3ASkinhead"&gt;skinhead&lt;/a&gt; organisation didn't let him found an official branch in Belgium.

T.V. station &lt;a href="w%3AVlaamse%20Televisie%20Maatschappij"&gt;VTM&lt;/a&gt; claimed the police tapped into phone conversations where Thomas B. was talking about killing &lt;a href="w%3AFilip%20Dewinter"&gt;Filip Dewinter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADyab%20Abou%20Jahjah"&gt;Dyab Abou Jahjah&lt;/a&gt;, two political leaders and opponents in Belgium. That way, both sides would cause an uprise and they could seize the opportunity. But the prosecutor's office has formally denied the existence of specific plans to this end.

The police has discovered numerous weapons, and a video showing a paramilitary training, not only on military grounds but also under a bridge in the city &lt;a href="w%3ADendermonde"&gt;Dendermonde&lt;/a&gt;. The police say the tape shows how they fire guns and throw &lt;a href="w%3AMolotov%20cocktail"&gt;Molotov cocktails&lt;/a&gt; on that location.

In the political arena, Internal Affairs minister &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Dewael"&gt;Patrick Dewael&lt;/a&gt; has suggested a law to forbid &lt;a href="w%3AFar%20right"&gt;far right&lt;/a&gt; criminal organisations. The plan was applauded by some and contested by others. Earlier on Friday, the federal government supported the proposal to give more power to the national intelligence services to fight terrorism. Minister of Defence André Flahaut suspended 11 suspects inside the army. Prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Verhofstadt"&gt;Guy Verhofstadt&lt;/a&gt; said the entire affair was "a blame for the country and the army".

Earlier this week a &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; court ruled that &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20News"&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt; could not use material from "Belgian publishers of the French- and German-speaking daily press" without paying a &lt;a href="w%3Acopyright"&gt;copyright&lt;/a&gt; fee. The ruling followed a case brought by Copiepresse, an association of French- and German-language newspaper editors in Belgium, challenging the right of Google to run their news aggregator under the current copyright laws.

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed the newspapers &lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Soir"&gt;♡❤Le Soir♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Libre%20Belgique"&gt;♡❤La Libre Belgique♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Derni%C3%A8re%20Heure"&gt;♡❤La Dernière Heure♡❤&lt;/a&gt; from its indexes immediately, causing them to disappear from google.be as well. However, Google Inc. faced daily fines of €500,000 (USD$640,000) for not posting the 2315 word court ruling on its google.be and news.google.be pages. Google appealed that part of the verdict, but the judge now confirms it, and both sites now display the court's ruling.

Investigation of the extent of Google's compliance with the court order reveals that all links and cached copies of material from ♡❤Le Soir's♡❤ site have been rendered inaccessible. A search for pages on the site www.lesoir.be returns the message, "♡❤In response to a legal request submitted to Google, we have removed 1260 result(s) from this page. If you wish, you may read more about the request at ChillingEffects.org.♡❤"

Google News displays photographs, headlines, and opening paragraphs of articles by members of the print, broadcast, and online-only media. This content forms topical homepages for web users, who then are encouraged to read the complete article on the news source's website. During the trial, internet adviser Luc Golvers argued that Google News is not a search engine, but a news portal. 

Google News was launched as a beta edition in April 2002, and came out of beta January 2006. A similar trial is being held in &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) as the &lt;a href="w%3Aplaintiff"&gt;plaintiff&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; daily newspaper ♡❤L'Est Republicain♡❤ reported today that Al-Qaeda's &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; may have died of &lt;a href="w%3ATyphoid%20fever"&gt;Typhoid Fever&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; on August 23, citing what it said was a leaked French secret service report dated September 21. The newspaper reported that unnamed &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi&lt;/a&gt; secret services sources passed this information to the &lt;a href="w%3ADirection%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20de%20la%20s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9%20ext%C3%A9rieure"&gt;Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure&lt;/a&gt; (DGSE, the French external secret service). 

"According to a source that is usually reliable, Saudi secret services are now convinced that Osama bin Laden is dead," said the French intelligence report. The report states that Saudi Arabia first heard the information on September 4 and are searching for more details, more specifically Osama's burial place, before making an official announcement. Bin Laden is alleged to have succumbed to a serious bout of typhoid fever, which caused a partial paralysis of his lower limbs. Due to his remote hideout, the report claims, medical assistance was out of the question.

A spokesperson of the Pakistani home office said that he had no information about the possible death of Osama bin Laden. U.S. intelligence services and spokespeople at the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; also say they have no confirmation of the report.

French President &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; reacted: "I was rather surprised to see that a confidential note from the DGSE was published and I have asked the minister of defense to start an investigation immediately and to reach whatever conclusions are necessary." He too stressed the information was not confirmed.

Meanwhile, a Saudi source told &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATime"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; that bin Laden has a water-borne illness, but is still alive.

Saudi Arabia's embassy in Washington D.C. has issued a statement saying: "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has no evidence to support recent media reports that Osama bin Laden is dead. Information that has been reported otherwise is purely speculative and cannot be independently verified."

It's not the first time bin Laden's death has been announced. CNN terrorism analyst &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Bergen"&gt;Peter Bergen&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that rumours of bin Laden's death circulate every few months.

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Navy"&gt;U.S. Navy&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AF-14"&gt;F-14&lt;/a&gt; made its last ceremonial flight at the &lt;a href="w%3ANaval%20Air%20Station%20Oceana"&gt;Naval Air Station Oceana&lt;/a&gt;, Virginia Beach, Virginia. The jet that was supposed to fly for its ceremonial flight never made it due to mechanical problems. However, a back-up F-14 was in time for the flight. The aging jets have seen costly maintenance and many problems involving its wings. In total there were six F-14s in the ceremony, several of these will go on display at the &lt;a href="w%3ADavis%20Monthan%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Davis Monthan Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona. The last six of the navy's F-14s will stop flying on September 30. It will be replaced by &lt;a href="w%3AF/A-18E/F"&gt;F/A-18E/F&lt;/a&gt; which will have better capabilities and lower maintenance cost.

Saturday saw the current military rulers of &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; expressing concern over foreign media reports on the coup that ousted caretaker Prime Minister &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;.

A spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20for%20Democratic%20Reform%20under%20Constitutional%20Monarchy"&gt;Council for Democratic Reform under Constitutional Monarchy&lt;/a&gt; (CDRM), Major General Thaweep Netniyan, said: "At today's meeting top military leaders asked the foreign ministry to urgently retaliate against foreign reporters whose coverage has been deemed insulting to the monarchy,".

Thai media is being kept under strict control by the CDRM, with over 100 community radio stations in the northern and eastern provinces closed down. The area is reported to be a source of popular support for the ousted PM, whose populist policies appealed to the rural poor majorities.

Isabelle Dessoy, the Secretary of Federal Staff at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; embassy was found murdered in her Vasant Vihar home.

Initial reports indicate that the victim was stabbed 22 times, and her driver, Vijay Pal Chaudhry, is currently the prime suspect. According to police he has fled the scene. The woman was able to telephone her son after the incident, and tell him what had happened.

Police were apparently informed of the incident at 10:45pm local time, the victim was taken to Safdarjung Hospital where staff declared her dead.

The police assert that robbery was the likely motive, details of the victim's stolen car have been dispatched to surrounding areas and a search for the prime suspect is underway.

Deputy police commissioner R.S. Yadav informed AFP that the victim was 45 years old. Earlier reports had indicated that the suspect was in custody and the victim had been aged 35. A profile on a travel site, apparently belonging to the victim, gives her age as 47 as of June 2006.

Charles R. Grosvenor, Jr., webmaster of &lt;a href="w%3AAm%20I%20Right"&gt;Am I Right&lt;/a&gt;, was interviewed earlier today on the EZHelp Radio Show to discuss his web sites, in particular Am I Right. The aforementioned Am I Right is one of the world's largest web sites in the world about &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20music"&gt;pop music&lt;/a&gt;.

Grosvenor discussed his definition of a &lt;a href="w%3Aparody"&gt;parody&lt;/a&gt; (Changing the words of a song to poke fun at a subject), how he got started doing websites, misheard lyrics, alleged backwards masking ("A good example is 'Stairway to Heaven'"), BBS servers ("...Web sites were very one-dimensional..."), who can submit parodies, how Am I Right came to be, sister web sites ("The 80s site goes back to 1995.") and how he deals with &lt;a href="w%3Aspam"&gt;spam&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first ever interview that Grosvenor has given about Am I Right.

Chucky G, as site users call him, has been making web pages since 1995, including: inthe80s.com, inthe70s.com, inthe90s.com, inthe00s.com, Whatfreaks, Am I Right, and Am I Wrong.

Am I Right is a website devoted to making fun of popular music. This includes song parodies, misheard lyrics, stupid band names, band name origins, bad choices or on-hold music (e.g. "Baby Come Back" by Player for a missing children hotline), answers to songs, adding / removing / changing a letter in a song title, comedy song recordings, proposed duets, and proposed commercials.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; founder, &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, the first draft of the new version of the &lt;a href="w%3AGNU%20Free%20Documentation%20License"&gt;GNU Free Documentation License&lt;/a&gt; is expected to be released soon.

Jimmy Wales, who is visiting &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; to establish the Polish branch of &lt;a href="w%3AWikia"&gt;Wikia&lt;/a&gt;, was speaking on the occasion of the fifth "birthday" of the &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20Wikipedia"&gt;Polish language Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, on 23rd September. 

Wales, asked what he is planning to do to make usage of Wikipedia content easier, admitted that the current GFDL license (version 1.2) under which the whole content of Wikipedia is released, is very complicated and parts of it are hard to understand. However, he said that earlier in the day, he received a call from &lt;a href="w%3AEben%20Moglen"&gt;Eben Moglen&lt;/a&gt;, main lawyer of &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Software%20Foundation"&gt;Free Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which created the license, who promised that the first draft of new version of GFDL license would be released soon and it would solve the problems present in current version.

Professional wrestling promotion &lt;a href="w%3ATotal%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling"&gt;Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&lt;/a&gt; (TNA) announced last night during their No Surrender Pay-Per-View event that Olympic gold medalist &lt;a href="w%3AKurt%20Angle"&gt;Kurt Angle&lt;/a&gt; has signed an exclusive contract with the company. The deal comes just shortly after Angle, 37, was released by &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Wrestling%20Entertainment"&gt;World Wrestling Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; (WWE), with both sides citing "personal issues" as the cause of his release. TNA also used the Pay-Per-View to announce that the weekly television show &lt;a href="w%3ATNA%20Impact"&gt;TNA Impact&lt;/a&gt; will be moving from it's current timeslot of Thursdays at 11PM, to 9PM, starting November 16.

Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) is an American professional wrestling promotion, founded by &lt;a href="w%3AJeff%20Jarrett"&gt;Jeff Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; and his father &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Jarrett"&gt;Jerry Jarrett&lt;/a&gt; in May 2002 and now owned by Panda Energy International.

A &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Trains"&gt;Virgin Trains&lt;/a&gt; train travelling at high speed collided with a car near Copmanthorpe, &lt;a href="w%3AYorkshire"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, killing the car's driver.

The accident took place at approximately 20:55 GMT when the Class 220/221 train, travelling at close to 100mph, hit the car which was on the tracks. The train then partially derailed but remained upright, coming to a stop further down the tracks. The car driver is believed to have been killed instantly. No one on the train was injured. 

The car was not at a level crossing. North Yorkshire Police said that the car had left the road, driven through a fence and ended up on the track. 

The train was the 14:25 Virgin Voyager cross-country service from Plymouth to Edinburgh Waverley, capable of speeds up to 125mph, but was deccelerating on approach into York. There were 74 passengers on board. 

The line between York and Leeds was closed for several hours, delaying other services. Virgin Spokesman Arthur Leathley told reporters that Network Rail hoped to have three of the four lines in that section of the track operational by Tuesday morning.

"There's no doubt we're gaining share across all product lines," said &lt;a href="w%3A%20Oracle%20Corporation"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;'s CFO, after a quarter where net income grew 29% and revenue grew 30% to $3.6bn. 

Applications license revenue climbed 78% on a constant currency basis. CEO &lt;a href="w%3A%20Larry%20Ellison"&gt;Larry Ellison&lt;/a&gt; noted that, in comparison, &lt;a href="w%3ASAP"&gt;SAP&lt;/a&gt; saw its application license revenue grow a more modest 8%. Oracle's president claimed 88 head-to-head wins against SAP in the quarter.

Some commentators noted that, though impressive, Oracle's results may not persist. Unlike industries with huge fixed costs, competitors in the software industry can quickly gain and lose market share through new product launches and mergers.

Ovum noted that the integration of acquisitions such as &lt;a href="w%3APeopleSoft"&gt;PeopleSoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJD%20Edwards"&gt;JD Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASiebel"&gt;Siebel&lt;/a&gt; now seem to have been accomplished, and that both Oracle and SAP are benefitting from the increasing symbiosis between the middleware and application markets.

SAP replied with a statement noting that it offers "market-leading SOA applications today, while Oracle's next-generation applications exist only in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Microsoft%20PowerPoint"&gt;PowerPoint&lt;/a&gt; and won't be delivered until 2008 or beyond."

Safia Ama-jan, as she was known locally, is the first woman official to be targeted by the Taliban-led insurgency since it was deposed in 2001. 

<h3>Advocate for Woman's rights</h3>

Safia Ahmed-jan taught at a girls' school and was a high-school principal in Khandahar prior to the Taliban's 1996 rise to power in Afghanistan. When the Taliban regime banned education for girls and forbade women from working outside the home, she ran an underground school for girls at her home, said her son Naqibullah, speaking to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤. 

After the Taliban government was overthrown in 2001, Ahmed-jan became the provincial chief for women's affairs in 2002, when the ministry was established and has since then held that position, worked for women's rights and particularly, championed the cause of educating girls. Her secretary, Abdullah Khan told ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ that among her most successful projects were the vocational training schools she opened in Khandahar, where almost 1000 women were taught baking, tailoring and other skills. 

Ahmed-jan has also been fiercely critical of the repression of women during the Taliban rule, in a region that has remained conservative and emerged as a hotbed of the Taliban's insurgent activity. Her requests for personal security guards and transport went unheeded by the government, according to local media reports, though her nephew, Muhammad Asif told the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ that Ahmed-jan preferred to keep a low profile and used a taxi or public transport even though her office maintained cars and drivers.

<h3>Early morning shooting</h3>

Ahmed-jan was shot dead outside her house at about 7:30 a.m. local time (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;+4:30) on Monday, as she left for work in a taxi. The gunmen are believed to have left scene on a motorcycle, and tyre marks have been found by the police, said the provincial governor Asadullah Khaled, who visited the scene of the attack. 

Ahmed-jan was shot four times with a pistol, Muhammad Haidar, who worked in her office told the ♡❤New York Times♡❤. Mohammad Nader, the head nurse at Khandahar's main hospital where Ahmed-jan was taken to, confirmed to the ♡❤Chicago Tribune♡❤ that she was shot four times, including once in the head. 

She was about 65 years old. 

Accounts of the shooting are sketchy, several reports suggesting no one witnessed it. However, one man, identified as Allaudin told ♡❤Al Jazeera♡❤ that he saw two men on motorcycles waiting on the road, who attacked Ahmed-jan as she left her house.

A spokesman for the Khandahar governor, Daud Ahmadi confirmed the death and said that Ahmed-jan had died on the spot. An investigation into the attack has begun, and local officials have blamed the Taliban. 

Hundreds of men and women, including the Governor Asadullah Khaled were present at Ahmed-jan's funeral on Monday evening, which took place in Khandahar's main Shia mosque.

<h3>Killing condemned</h3>

The killing has been strongly condemned by the Afghan President &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt; as well as aid and human rights organisations in Afghanistan.

Aleem Siddique, a spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Assistance%20Mission%20in%20Afghanistan"&gt;United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; (UNAMA), said that UNAMA was "appalled at the senseless murder" of a woman who was working to ensure a full and equal part in the future of Afghanistan for its women. He added, "We share the sentiment of the majority of Afghan people who are appalled at this killing."

Abdul Quadar Noorzai, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) for the Khandahar region told ♡❤IRIN News♡❤ that Ahmed-jan's death will have a "serious impact on women's activities in the south where women are already suffering from ... the deteriorating security and conservative traditions,".

Fariba Ahmedi, a woman MP from Khandahar who was present at Ahmed-jan's funeral told the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, "The enemy of Afghanistan killed her, but they should know it will not derail women from the path we are on. We will continue on our way,". 

Sonja Bachmann, a U.N. political officer who knew Ahmed-jan well told the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ that Ahmed-jan "did a good job, she worked in a very low-key way and worked hard to raise awareness about women's issues."

<h3>Claim of responsibility</h3>

♡❤Reuters♡❤ and ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ received phone calls, claiming responsibility for the attacks on behalf of Mullah Sadullah, a regional Taliban commander, but no confirmation of the claim has been possible.

Another caller, who identified himself as Taliban commander Mullah Hayat Khan told ♡❤Al Jazeera♡❤ that Ahmed-jan was killed because she worked for the government.

<h3>Attacks mount</h3>

The Taliban-led insurgency has stepped up attacks in recent months, killing hundreds of people this year. 

Last week, 19 Afghans working for reconstruction projects in the region were killed after their bus was ambushed.
The Governor of Paktia province, a close associate of President Karzai, was killed in a suicide bombing on September 10. 

Attacks on schools have also been stepped up. According to the Afghan education ministry, there have been 158 attacks on schools this year, compared to 146 last year. The attacks on schools are believed to be due partly to the Taliban's opposition to educating girls, as well as a way to undermine the Afghan government and it's reconstruction efforts. 

Twelve suspected militants and two Afghan police officers were reported killed on Monday in separate incidents which also left eight others and a U.S. soldier wounded. 

"People are scared, of course," Ahmad-jan's co-worker Haidar said, "How can we feel secure when the head of our department is killed in front of her house?"

<h1>Bulgaria and Romania to enter European Union</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bulgaria%20and%20Romania%20to%20enter%20European%20Union&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; has accepted &lt;a href="w%3ABulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; as members of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; from January 1, 2007 under what analysts call the strictest terms in recent history.

The Commission emphasizes that the new members will have to do a better job fighting organized crime but also fight political corruption, which has plagued both since the fall of the &lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;. Both governments have been criticized for not being tough enough on corruption, a hot political ticket in the duo.

The president of the Commission, &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Manuel%20Barroso"&gt;Jose Manuel Barroso&lt;/a&gt;, has called for a pause in enlargement of the EU afterwards in order to carry out institutional reform within the Union and solve the question of a constitution for the EU, which became less certain last year when French and Dutch voters rejected the proposal. An EU treaty currently mandates institutional changes within the Union before the number of members go beyond the 27 maximum, which the Union will reach by the accession of the two new members.

If the two countries will not be able to comply with the terms, they may face consequences, some of which are directed specifically at the accession process but most of which are general requirements that all members face if they fail to meet certain standards. Specific to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is losing up to a quarter of farm payments unless they succeed in setting up an operational database for animals called IACS by April 2007.

Furthermore, corruption and organized crime have to be addressed. Some members of the Commission have said that allowing them to enter may actually help them tackle corruption more than it would be leaving them outside of the Union. Every six months, both countries will have to report on the progress to fight corruption.

Although both economies are growing rapidly, they will be the poorest countries within the EU with &lt;a href="w%3A%3AGDP"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt; per capita only at about one third of the EU average. As always, there are debates about whether that's good or bad in terms of accession, some arguing that it will result in mass migration of workforce to richer countries resulting in unemployment, others by that the richer countries of the Union benefit the Union by going for cheap labor within itself, as opposed to for example India or China.

Trade of pigs from the two countries will still be forbidden as farmers from both countries have had to deal with serious diseases in pigs.

All members of the EU have to ratify the entry of new members. France, Germany, Denmark and Belgium have yet to ratify the entry of the two countries, but analysts say that they're expected to do so soon, a refusal to do so being extremely unlikely.

Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Kaur confirmed today that Mohammed Afzal, a militant attached to the Pakistan-based outfit &lt;a href="w%3AJaish-e-Mohammed"&gt;Jaish-e-Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;, would be executed on 20 October for his role in the &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20Indian%20Parliament%20attack"&gt;attempted attack&lt;/a&gt; on the Indian Parliament building in 2002. 

On 13 December 2001, at 11:45 a.m. local time(&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;+5:30), just as the MPs were preparing to leave the House, militants armed with AK-47s and hand-grenades breached the security at Gate No.12 of the Parliament Building and opened indiscriminate fire, killing six policemen and one Parliament employee. The &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Army"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt;, along with police and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Security%20Guards"&gt;NSG "Black Cats"&lt;/a&gt; sealed the area and killed all five gunmen in a "lock-down mop-up" operation. 

The attack &lt;a href="w%3A2001-2002%20India-Pakistan%20standoff"&gt;increased tensions&lt;/a&gt; between India and &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, which was accused by India of providing support to the Kashmiri militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed, involved in the attack.

A special court had earlier sentenced Delhi University lecturer S. Geelani, Afzal and Shaukat Hussain Guru to death under Section 3(2) of &lt;a href="w%3APOTA"&gt;POTA&lt;/a&gt; (indulging in terrorist acts leading to deaths) and Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (murder). The court also fined Shaukat Hussain's wife, Afsan Guru Rs. 10,000 and sentenced her to five years rigorous imprisonment for concealing details of the plot. A Delhi High court ruling, however, later acquitted Afsana Guru and Geelani.

On 4 August 2005, a &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20India"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; bench including Justice P V Reddy and Justice P V Neolkar confirmed the death penalty for Mohammed Afzal and sentenced Shaukat Hussain Guru to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for concealing details of the conspiracy, thereby sparing him the gallows. Although the Supreme Court upheld Geelani's acquittal, it observed that his actions were not above suspicion and seemed to have supported the attack.

On Tuesday morning, many &lt;a href="w%3AComcast"&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; internet users were reporting problems connecting to &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; services, such as web search, personalized pages, and &lt;a href="w%3AGmail"&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt;.

Since the original reporting, other &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; ISP users also reported that they could not connect to Google.

Google released a statement saying that they are investigating the problem. Comcast support states that a ticket has been filed.

Internet users also reporting that other leading websites, such as &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; were not loading on the same ISP networks.

Outages by the leading websites are not uncommon, such as a technical glitch at &lt;a href="w%3AAOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt; back in June that delayed emails for several hours.

The Google outage brought up the topic of &lt;a href="w%3ANet%20Neutrality"&gt;Net Neutrality&lt;/a&gt; on many internet websites and forums, such as &lt;a href="w%3ADigg"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;.

It has been announced that a DNS server in Massachusetts went down, causing the problems and that it has been fixed.

Canadian MP &lt;a href="w%3ABelinda%20Stronach"&gt;Belinda Stronach&lt;/a&gt;, 40, has reportedly cheated with Canadian hockey star &lt;a href="w%3ATie%20Domi"&gt;Tie Domi&lt;/a&gt;. Domi and his wife were in court today getting divorced and both have now reached a temporary settlement in their divorce proceedings, less than an hour before the case was to be heard before Toronto's Superior Court. Stronach is refusing to comment on the divorce or say if she "wrecked" Domi's marriage.

"If it wasn't for my husband's affair with Belinda, we wouldn't be getting a divorce," Leanne told the ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤ in an interview last night. Domi's wife claimed that the former &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Maple%20Leafs"&gt;Toronto Maple Leaf&lt;/a&gt; player told her if she did not hire a lawyer he would give her $1 million in cash and a $1.5-million house if she kept quiet about his affair with Stronach. If she contacted a lawyer, however, she "would get nothing."

"I'm not going to comment at this point in time whether it's true, it's false or it's just the opinions of others," Stronach said on CTV's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Duffy%20Live"&gt;Mike Duffy Live&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. "I'm not prepared to talk about my personal life at this moment."

When Stronach was with the Conservatives she dated fellow MP &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20MacKay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt;. In an interview in the ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤ on January 8, 2005, Stronach confirmed that she and MacKay were dating. Stronach, elected as a Conservative in the 2004 election, &lt;a href="w%3ACrossing%20the%20floor"&gt;crossed the floor&lt;/a&gt; to the Liberal Party on May 17, 2005. She did not comment on what impact this would have on their relationship. On May 18, 2005, MacKay told the ♡❤CBC♡❤ that his relationship with Stronach was indeed over. Stronach crossed the floor from the Conservative party directly to Paul Martin's Liberal cabinet in May 2005. Stronach was previously married to Olympic speed-skating champion &lt;a href="w%3AJohann%20Olav%20Koss"&gt;Johann Olav Koss&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, then divorced in 2005.

Tie Domi said he would not comment on his personal life and his agent said Monday the hockey star would have nothing to say while the matter was before the courts. 

Leanne Domi's divorce application was filed on September 18, just one day before Tie Domi announced his retirement from the &lt;a href="w%3ANHL"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt;.

None of the allegations have been proved in court.

Instead of returning to practise from a fractured finger today as scheduled, flamboyant &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Cowboys"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt; receiver &lt;a href="w%3ATerrell%20Owens"&gt;Terrell Owens&lt;/a&gt; is instead recovering at &lt;a href="w%3ABaylor"&gt;Baylor&lt;/a&gt; Medical Center this morning from an apparent &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; attempt last night. A female friend who was with Owens last night observed him taking several prescription &lt;a href="w%3Apain%20killer"&gt;pain killers&lt;/a&gt; and behaving erratically. She called &lt;a href="w%3A911"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt; and Owens was rushed to the hospital.

Original reports stated that Owens was suffering from an adverse reaction to the pain medication, which he was taking for a fractured hand. But this morning, &lt;a href="w%3ADallas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt; police have reported that Owens took an unknown large amount of the pills, and when asked by police this morning if he had been attempting to hurt himself, Owens replied, "Yes." 

Paramedics have only confirmed that they called police to report that they were bringing Owens to hospital.

Owens has since said that he was not attempting suicide.

Duane Morrison, 53, took several girls hostage Wednesday at Platte Canyon High School in &lt;a href="w%3ABailey%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Bailey, Colorado&lt;/a&gt; and later killed himself after police reportedly stormed the school.

"It is a hostage situation, an adult is holding the hostages, he claims to have explosives," said Lance Clem, a spokesman for the Colorado State Police Department.

At least two schools, Platte Canyon High School and Fitzsimmons Middle School were evacuated and the main highway between Bailey and &lt;a href="w%3AShawnee%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Shawnee, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, Highway 285, was closed to all traffic until further notice.

A SWAT team and the bomb squad were also deployed in the area. Six hostages were initially taken, but four were released. The remaining hostages were two girls who were being held hostage in a classroom located on an upper floor and reports say that the girls may have suffered some injuries during the raid.

According to the secretary of the school district's superintendent, Jan Howard, students in both schools are in a "safe location", but police say that parents are not able to pick up their kids due to the closure of the main highway.

Several shots were fired according to the sheriff's department, which are believed to be the "loud noise" that prompted the evacuation of the rest of the two schools.

The police had "limited contact" with Morrison and the hostages. Contact with them had been "a little bit sporadic," said spokeswoman with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, Jacki Kelley.

"It's very sketchy at this stage but we can confirm that a man carrying a weapon is inside the building and two girls are being held hostage. The man entered a classroom at about noon and had an exchange with a teacher and fired more than one shot. We have no reports of any injuries. We know he is armed with a weapon because shots were fired but we do not know what kind of a weapon it is," added Kelley.

Morrison was found to have used a revolver and a semi-automatic pistol when police removed his body after the raid. Upon further investigation, Morrison was also found to have been a homeless man who lived out of his car.

Park County Sheriff Fred Wegener said authorities decided to storm the classroom after Morrison cut off negotiations and set a 4 p.m. deadline. Wegener wouldn't say what Morrison threatened to do. He said authorities used explosives as they entered the classroom, only to have the suspect fire at officers, shoot one of the girls and then himself.

"We have almost no information on this suspect. We don't know who he is. We don't know what he wants," said Kelley.

According to Sheriff Wegener, Morrison also sexually assaulted at least one of the hostages while holding them captive.

During the raid on the school, Morrison shot one of the hostages, identified by acquaintances and a co-worker as 16-year-old Emily Keyes. She was reported to have been bleeding heavily and was taken to a Denver hospital in critical condition, but was declared dead, a hospital spokeswoman said.

The reason for his release is unknown, as no details have yet been released by WWE or Cash himself.

The Republican National Committee Site Selection Committee will recommend Minneapolis-St. Paul to host the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Republican%20National%20Convention"&gt;2008 Republican National Convention&lt;/a&gt; (GOP), on September 1-4, 2008. RNC confirmation will be done in January, 2007. Cleveland, New York City, and Tampa-St. Petersburg had also submitted bids.

"We are thrilled to accept the bid from Minneapolis-St. Paul to host our 2008 convention . The host committee put together a tremendous bid and we are confident that we will partner for a successful event. Minneapolis-St. Paul has outstanding assets including state-of-the-art facilities, exciting and vibrant downtowns, and a clear enthusiasm from the community to host our convention," said RNC Chairman Ken Mehlman.

Details have not been announced, but the &lt;a href="w%3AXcel%20Energy%20Center"&gt;Xcel Energy Center&lt;/a&gt; is likely to be the main venue. The convention is expected to fill most hotel rooms in the area, and rank among the largest events ever held in the area. The last major national convention in the area was when &lt;a href="w%3A1892%20Republican%20National%20Convention"&gt;1892 Republican National Convention&lt;/a&gt; was held in Minneapolis.

The Twin Cities area was also under consideration for the &lt;a href="w%3A2008%20Democratic%20National%20Convention"&gt;2008 Democratic National Convention&lt;/a&gt; four days earlier. The first day of the Republican convention will be &lt;a href="w%3ALabor%20Day"&gt;Labor Day&lt;/a&gt;, the last day of the &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20State%20Fair"&gt;Minnesota State Fair&lt;/a&gt;.

A secretly filmed footage aired by Polish TV prompted accusations of "political corruption" on the part of the ruling party and calls for the government to step down and the parliament to be dissolved.

The scandal burst out when Polish TV channel, &lt;a href="w%3ATVN%20%28Poland%29"&gt;TVN&lt;/a&gt;, aired footage secretly filmed by opposition MP &lt;a href="w%3ARenata%20Beger"&gt;Renata Beger&lt;/a&gt;. The footage presents &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Lipi%C5%84ski"&gt;Adam Lipiński&lt;/a&gt;, a government minister and top aide of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Jarosław Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt; offering Beger a government post, legal and financial aid in return for defecting from her party and joining the ruling coalition.
The conversation between the two politicians comes amidst a larger-scale effort on the part of the ruling &lt;a href="w%3APrawo%20i%20Sprawiedliwo%C5%9B%C4%87"&gt;Prawo i Sprawiedliwość&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤"Law and Justice"♡❤) party to woo members of former coalition partner &lt;a href="w%3ASamoobrona"&gt;Samoobrona&lt;/a&gt; to leave their party and support the governing coalition. The efforts follow the deposing of Samoobrona's leader &lt;a href="w%3AAndrzej%20Lepper"&gt;Andrzej Lepper&lt;/a&gt; from his position as deputy prime minister, after he refused to support the budget proposal accepted by the Council of Ministers.

The broadcast of the footage has led to calls for the immediate dismissal of the government and for new elections to be held. Prawo i Sprawiedliwość has called the revealed conversation "normal practice", and ruled out the possibility of the government stepping down. The scandal, however, severely complicates the party's attempt to rebuild parliamentary majority and undermines their public support, as its popularity was built on declarations of fighting corruption in politics.

The day after the footage was aired, protesters started gathering before the buildings of the parliament, and some pitching tents to spend the night there.

<h1>New York City considers stricter regulations on trans fat</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20York%20City%20considers%20stricter%20regulations%20on%20trans%20fat&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Board%20of%20Health"&gt;Health Board&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday presented a plan to ban &lt;a href="w%3ATrans%20fat"&gt;trans fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; (or trans fat) from the eateries in the city. The ban would not involve grocery stores, or natural trans fat that is present in dairy products or meat from &lt;a href="w%3ARuminant"&gt;ruminants&lt;/a&gt;.

The proposal follows a campaign last year to encourage restaurants to cut down on using trans fat themselves, but recent surveys show that the campaign was unsuccessful. In 2003, the city already instituted a &lt;a href="w%3ASmoke-free%20restaurant"&gt;smoking ban in restaurants&lt;/a&gt;, which was met with protest, but the measure has been copied in many other states since.

In Western countries, most trans fat in food today is the result of industrial processing, and has been linked to &lt;a href="w%3ACoronary%20heart%20disease"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;. Frying oils, &lt;a href="w%3AShortening"&gt;shortening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMargarine"&gt;margarines&lt;/a&gt; with trans fats have easier storing requirements. Artificial trans fat is considered by some experts to be even more dangerous than natural trans fat.

The new limit would be at 0.5 grams of trans fatty acids per menu item, whereas a typical serving of French fries contains about 8 grams. It would be instituted in several phases, allowing time for eateries to adapt.

The plan would also have serious implications for both fast food chains and restaurants. A spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York State&lt;/a&gt; Restaurant Association reacted with disbelief, stating that "Labeling is one thing, but when they totally ban a product, it goes well beyond what we think is prudent and acceptable," referring to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration's&lt;/a&gt; requirement for food labels to list trans fat, a measure taken last January.

The Boards Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Frieden on the other hand said the ban would be a challenge for cooks, but substitute oils can easily be found. Comparing it to lead paint, he said "It is a dangerous and unnecessary ingredient", adding that "No one will miss it when it's gone."

A similar ban is being considered in &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, but would only target companies with annual revenues over $20 million, thereby targeting exclusively major &lt;a href="w%3AFast%20food%23Overview"&gt;fast-food restaurants&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. brands &lt;a href="w%3AWendy%27s"&gt;Wendy's&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACrisco"&gt;Crisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrito-Lay"&gt;Frito-Lay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStarbucks"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASubway%20%28restaurant%29"&gt;Subway&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AKraft%20Foods"&gt;Kraft's&lt;/a&gt; have already taken action to remove trans fat from some of their products.

&lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; became the first country in the world imposing strict regulations on trans fatty acids in March 2003. &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonald%27s"&gt;McDonalds&lt;/a&gt; consequently started using trans fat-free oils in Denmark, but has not yet switched over in the United States.

A public hearing is scheduled on October 30, and a final vote on the proposal is scheduled for December.

Diamond Brownridge, a 5-year old girl from &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Chicago, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, has died after a visit to the dentist. Children's Memorial Hospital officials say that the girl was rushed to the hospital when she never woke up after being sedated for a dental procedure. She had been in a coma, on life support, since being admitted to the hospital early in the weekend.

"She passed very peacefully and beautifully," said the hospital in a statement that the family issued.

Ommettress Travis, the mother of the girl, was asked not to remain inside the room while dentists were operating on the girl to repair two cavities and to have at least two caps replaced. Travis says after thirty minutes she was asked to come back in and found Brownridge not breathing, in the dentist chair.

Hicham Riba, a specialist and professional in anesthesia, who was also licensed, was the dentist in charge of the procedure.

"My family and I are so sad. May God bless Diamond and her family. Every time you have a tragedy like this, you pray more. I don't think I will ever go back to a normal life after an experience like this," Riba said in a statement on Wednesday, September 28.

According to the family, the girl had been given at least a triple dose of medicine that sedated her. Those drugs include: nitrous oxide gas, a single dose of an "oral agent" and an IV.

A judge has ordered that all equipment and materials used during the operation be protected and examined. The girl's medical records have also been ordered to be examined.

There is no word on whether or not any charges will be filed against Riba or any of the dentist's staff.

A standoff is forming in &lt;a href="w%3AAarhus"&gt;Aarhus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;'s second largest city, located mainly in the &lt;a href="w%3ARegion%20Midtjylland"&gt;Region Central Jutland&lt;/a&gt;, with politicians seeking to make budgetary cuts for 2007 on one side, and parents, &lt;a href="w%3APedagogy"&gt;paedagogs&lt;/a&gt; and elderly-care professionals on the other. 

The dispute broke out on Friday, September 22, when day-care centres across the city were blockaded by parents, teachers and other city council employees. At one point, the city council asked the police to intervene to break the blockades of the day-centres, although a last-minute change of heart by the council averted direct confrontation.

The parents feel that the quality of day-care centers has declined, which they attribute to budget cuts. Further ire was seen when &lt;a href="w%3AMayor"&gt;Mayor&lt;/a&gt; Henning G. Jensen "magically" found an additional 60 million &lt;a href="w%3ADanish%20krone"&gt;DKK&lt;/a&gt; for his budget. The protesters saw this as evidence that he had tried to hide money.

Denmark's &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20the%20Interior%20and%20Health%20%28Denmark%29"&gt;Interior Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALars%20L%C3%B8kke%20Rasmussen"&gt;Lars Løkke Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; has also voiced concern that the mayor knew that the money was there all the while.

The strike is ongoing and has now spread widely in Denmark and even some localities near &lt;a href="w%3ACopenhagen"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;, the Danish capital, have been experiencing strikes by public sector employees.

<h1>Sony plans global replacement of laptop batteries</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sony%20plans%20global%20replacement%20of%20laptop%20batteries&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After several &lt;a href="w%3ALaptop"&gt;laptop&lt;/a&gt; producers recalled a total of about 7 million products containing &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; batteries, the Sony Corporation said it will "initiate a global replacement program... in order to address concern related to recent over-heating incidents."

Sony previously admitted the recalls announced by &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt; would cost up to 30 billion &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20yen"&gt;yen&lt;/a&gt;, which is a quarter of Sony's profits in 2005. Several news sources expect this to reflect badly on the company, as it adds to problems with the &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%203"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABlu-ray%20Disc"&gt;Blu-Ray DVD&lt;/a&gt;. Since Dell announced recalls in August, Sony's stock has lost almost 9% of its value.

Keeping up with competitors like Apple and Dell, &lt;a href="w%3AToshiba"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALenovo%20Group"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; have started recalling laptops with the &lt;a href="w%3ALithium%20ion%20battery"&gt;lithium ion batteries&lt;/a&gt;. Dell expanded its program to include about 4.2 million portables. Following Sony's statement, &lt;a href="w%3AFujitsu"&gt;Fujitsu&lt;/a&gt; too declared it would replace the batteries involved. A spokesperson for Toshiba added that the company doesn't expect there to be any problems with &lt;a href="w%3APersonal%20computer"&gt;personal computers&lt;/a&gt;, but it will replace their Sony batteries anyway, over customer concerns. However, the company doesn't expect to pick up the tab for it.

A Lenovo laptop with the problem battery caught fire in &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20International%20Airport"&gt;Los Angeles Airport&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. Consequently, &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Atlantic%20Airways"&gt;Virgin Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; added them to a blacklist of prohibited laptops on their flights. According to Sony, microscopic metal particles are to blame for overheating and potentially catching fire "under certain rare conditions".

The &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Products%20Safety%20Commission"&gt;U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt; advised &lt;a href="w%3AThinkPad"&gt;ThinkPad&lt;/a&gt; users who want to continue using their portable to switch it off, remove the battery and continue with the AC adapter and power cord.

The top-brass of the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Indian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; (IAF) has sent a three-page letter to Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee, warning him that the IAF is in danger of losing its long-standing air-superiority over &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. In the letter the following statement is given, 

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; Pakistan Air Force (PAF) is being beefed up with 44 F16s from America. They have a clearly defined goal of attaining parity with the IAF. With China supplying J 10 and JF 17 aircraft (fitted with Russian engines), PAF force levels of combat squadron will increase. 
Unless steps are taken to move ahead with procurement, the IAF's combat strength will deplete to a level, which would entirely neutralise the conventional superiority held by IAF since our Independence. PAF will have 19 to 26 squadrons by 2011-12, while the IAF could reduce to 26.5 by 2015.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – Air Chief Marshal Tyagi&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Additional Director of Air Power Studies, Kapil Kak said, "This aircraft induction will take at least 10 years from today and in those 10 years, the MiG 21's will progress if they get wound down. Their total technical life and design life will end and we will have the Air Force combat force strength winding down, worryingly fast."

Several inductions planned by the IAF, such as the &lt;a href="w%3AHAL%20Tejas"&gt;HAL Tejas&lt;/a&gt; and the proposed &lt;a href="w%3AMedium%20Combat%20Aircraft"&gt;Multirole Medium Range Combat Aircraft&lt;/a&gt;, have been delayed. In his letter, the Air Chief Marshal has asked the Government to acquire 40 Su-30 MKIs from Russia as soon as possible, induct the 126 Multirole Medium Range Combat Aircraft at the earliest and also urge Russia to honour their commitment of not allowing China to sell planes with Russian engines to Pakistan.

A &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; soldier was killed today in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; by a bomb while on patrol in Panjwaii district, west of &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt; on foot. He died around 1 p.m. local time (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;+4:30).

Military officials have not yet released the name of the soldier. The soldier is from &lt;a href="w%3ACFB%20Petawawa"&gt;CFB Petawawa&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;.

His remains were taken by a helicopter to the &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar%20Airfield"&gt;Kandahar Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. One soldier from &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; was reported to have suffered minor hearing loss as a result of the blast.

Earlier today at 12 p.m., there was a rally called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Friday%23Red%20Friday%20Canada"&gt;Red Friday&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ for the Canadian troops in Afghanistan held in the Younge-Dundas Square in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. Many in Toronto wore red in support for the troops. It was announced at the rally that the Canadian soldier was killed by a bomb.

Ten Canadian soldiers have died in September. Thirty-seven Canadians have died in Afghanistan since 2002.

The field of candidates running to lead the &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20Toronto"&gt;City of Toronto&lt;/a&gt; became larger today as former &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20LeDrew"&gt;Stephen LeDrew&lt;/a&gt; threw his hat in the contest for &lt;a href="w%3AMayor"&gt;mayor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s largest city. LeDrew is running against incumbent &lt;a href="w%3AMayor%20of%20Toronto"&gt;Mayor of Toronto&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miller"&gt;David Miller&lt;/a&gt;, who is seeking a second term and city councillor &lt;a href="w%3AJane%20Pitfield"&gt;Jane Pitfield&lt;/a&gt;, who was considered Miller's main challenger until today. With LeDrew entering the race there are a total of 38 candidates running for the position. The election takes place on November 13, 2006.

Miller is a centre-left politician with links to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; though he also has support from some Liberals and Conservatives. His opponents have been looking for a candidate to challenge him in light of what has been perceived as Jane Pitfield's faltering candidacy. LeDrew considered supporting Pitfield but, calling her "Calamity Jane" because of the mistakes she's made in her campaign, concluded she could not unseat the mayor. After other high-profile figures such as former &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;Members of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Mills"&gt;Dennis Mills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASergio%20Marchi"&gt;Sergio Marchi&lt;/a&gt; and former police chief &lt;a href="w%3AJulian%20Fantino"&gt;Julian Fantino&lt;/a&gt; declined to enter the contest as a centre or centre-right candidate, LeDrew decided to enter the race. Today was the last day to register as a candidate. 

LeDrew has never run for public office though he has many years of experience as a "back room" operative in the Liberal Party and in municipal politics. In 2005, he declared bankruptcy and was ordered to pay 74% of the $364,000 he owed in back taxes. 

"The evidence is that LeDrew consciously and continually neglected to pay income tax installments when due and appeared to regard his obligation to pay income tax as subordinate to all other personal obligations," wrote Justice John Ground of the Superior Court of Justice.

LeDrew says he was trying to pay off his tax debt but also had to pay personal expenses such as school fees for his children. 

"I'd gone through a divorce. I was in a law firm ... that broke up and I lost money in that. I had four children to put into schools."

"I was also working 2,000 hours a year (as a) volunteer as Liberal Party president. I said , 'I owe taxes. The taxpayer can wait. My children can not.'"

"I was proud of my choices, my priorities," he told the ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤. "I'd do it again. Any father knows his children are the most important thing."

A &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian passenger jet operated by budget airline &lt;a href="w%3AGol%20Transportes%20A%C3%A9reos"&gt;Gol Transportes Aéreos&lt;/a&gt; that was reported missing whilst on route to &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilia"&gt;Brasilia&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AManaus"&gt;Manaus&lt;/a&gt; has been located by the &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Brazilian Air Force&lt;/a&gt;. The wreckage of the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt;, Flight 1907, which was carrying 149 passengers and 6 crew was spotted in the rural state of &lt;a href="w%3AMato%20Grosso"&gt;Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon%20rainforest"&gt;Amazon rainforest&lt;/a&gt;. There are no survivors.

At least 20 of the passengers of the flight were employees of Yamaha Corp.

José Carlos Pereira, president of the Brazilian airport authority (&lt;a href="w%3AInfraero"&gt;Infraero&lt;/a&gt;) told journalists, "It would be very difficult for anyone to survive such a crash. Our experience shows that when one cannot find the fuselage relatively intact and when the wreckage is concentrated in a relatively small area, the chances of finding any survivors are practically non-existent"

Gol released a statement saying "The wreckage of the plane was found 30 kilometres north of the Peixoto Azevedo municipality" 

Troops are currently attempting to make their way through the dense jungle to the wreckage on foot.

Many relatives and friends desperate for information gathered at airports in Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and Manaus during the night.

Aviation officials now say that initial reports that the airliner collided with a smaller private plane cannot be confirmed.

Gol, which was founded in 2001, say that the plane was new and had only come into service this month.

A passenger list and further information can be found on the Gol website. Further information for family members can be found by calling 0800 2800749.

&lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; Police Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3AAnami%20Narayan%20Roy"&gt;A N Roy&lt;/a&gt; confirmed today that investigations had revealed the involvement of the militant group &lt;a href="w%3ALashkar-e-Toiba"&gt;Lashkar-e-Toiba&lt;/a&gt; and the (banned) &lt;a href="w%3AStudents%20Islamic%20Movement%20of%20India"&gt;Students Islamic Movement of India&lt;/a&gt; (SIMI) in the &lt;a href="w%3A11%20July%202006%20Mumbai%20train%20bombings"&gt;11 July 2006 bombing&lt;/a&gt; of the city's commuter rail network. He also stated that the attacks had been masterminded by &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AInter-Services%20Intelligence"&gt;Inter-Services Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (ISI) and carried out by Pakistani and Indian nationals.

Fifteen people, twelve of whom were directly involved in the execution of the bombings are in custody, eleven of them are Pakistani citizens. 

The conspiracy to carry out the attacks, which killed 190 people, was hatched in the vicinity of Mumbai, by militants who were trained in Bahwalpur, Pakistan. The Pakistani bombers entered India in batches, some through the porous Indo-Nepal border, others via Bangladesh and some through Gujarat. They then reached Mumbai around May 25, and were sheltered in Malad and Bandra by Faizal Sheikh. Kamaluddin Ansari and Ehtasham Siddiqui, (General Secretary of SIMI, Maharashtra) were also involved in the conspiracy.

The RDX explosive used in the blasts was brought from Pakistan by a man called Ehsanullah, while the ammonium nitrate was procured locally. The explosives were assembled in Chembur by Mumbai resident Mohammad Ali, between 8 and 10 July. On the day of the attacks, the bombs (each containing 2 - 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg of RDX and 3.5 – 4&amp;nbsp;kg of ammonium nitrate) were concealed in eight pressure cookers and transported to the railway stations in taxis.

From there two member teams of bombers placed the explosives on the trains and detonated them using quartz timers. One of the militants, Saleem, a native of Lahore, could not (as was the plan) get off the train before the explosives went off, as a result of which he perished in the blast between Khar and Bandra. Of the seven Indian suspects, four (Faizal Sheikh, Kamaluddin Ansari, Ehtashan Siddiqui and Naved) have been apprehended, while a search is on for the other three. 

Mr. Roy described the bombings as a "professional, precise and well-planned". The first clue his department got was a phone call made from Navi Mumbai to a place on the Indo-Nepal border. Based on this information Kamaluddin Ansari was arrested in from Madhubani, Bihar. Narco-analysis of the other suspects revealed that they were trained in Pakistan and also helped tie up other loose ends in the case. Faizal Sheikh also revealed that he had received Rs. 60,00,000 from Pakistan in the last few years. Police also recovered 26,000 Riyals, given to him by Rizwan Devra, an ISI operative living in Dubai, from Faizal's house. 

Pakistan's Minister of State for Information, Tariq Azim, denied the role of the ISI in the bombings, saying that his country "rejected" the accusation, and that India should provide Pakistan with "any information if they have it". "Such allegations only give benefit to the real culprits, who escape arrest," he said.

Forecasters are predicting that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Isaac%20%282006%29"&gt;Hurricane Isaac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could hit &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Canada"&gt;Atlantic Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as early as next week. The provinces &lt;a href="Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt; have been advised to monitor the progress of Isaac.

Forecasters said Isaac should stay to the east of &lt;a href="Bermuda"&gt;Bermuda&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaritimes"&gt;Canadian Maritimes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Newfoundland could feel the outer edges of the storm.

"Some areas of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Canada"&gt;Eastern Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could feel the outer reaches of Isaac by sometime Monday or Tuesday. It was expected to strengthen slightly before then," said hurricane specialist Eric Blake.

Three years ago the Maritimers suffered through &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Juan"&gt;Hurricane Juan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . On September 29, 2003, in Nova Scotia, Juan killed two people, smashed buildings and left about 300,000 homes and businesses without power.

The Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1 and ends November 30. Isaac had top sustained winds near 75 kilometres per hour by 11 p.m. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;ET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;minus;5), the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said. Isaac is the fifth hurricane and the ninth named storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season.

An overpass has collapsed in &lt;a href="w%3ALaval%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Laval&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb of the &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; area of &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Three lanes of the Concorde Boulevard overpass collapsed into Highway 19. At least 5 people are dead, 6 others injured, 2 critically and least 3 cars are reported to be trapped underneath the overpass. Authorities have stated that 3 cars and a motorcycle were on the overpass when it collapsed. 

Rescue workers and construction engineers have brought in heavy equipment, cranes and drills to break up the overpass into roughly a dozen smaller segments for removal. At the time of the collapse, authorities reported that 2 vehicles were trapped under the debris. Around midnight, the two vehicles were removed from the debris, and the five occupants of both vehicles were pronounced dead on the site. 

&lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20Quebec"&gt;Transport Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%BBret%C3%A9%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec"&gt;Sûreté du Québec&lt;/a&gt; have reported that around 9:30 a.m. local time, people called &lt;a href="w%3A911"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt;, reporting that small chunks of concrete had fallen from the Boulevard de la Concorde (Concorde Boulevard) overpass over &lt;a href="w%3AAutoroute%2019"&gt;Autoroute 19&lt;/a&gt;, and Transport Quebec sent a crew to inspect. At around 11:55 a.m., Transport's Québec patrol arrived at the overpass confirming the facts. The patroller moved the chunks off the highway and produced a report, sent to the Transports Quebec branch responsible for Laval. 

The incident happened at approximately 12:30 p.m. local time, local residents described what sounded like "an earthquake". It is not known at this time how the collapse occurred, or when it might be repaired. It is currently assumed that the cement bondings to the steel rods which held the overpass to its approaches gave way, and with nothing to hold the overpass' central span up, it collapsed.

This isn't the first overpass collapse in Laval. In 2000, a section of the Highway 15 overpass collapsed, killing one and injuring two others. It was later determined that the collapse in 2000 was caused by a manufacturing defect.

<h1>Ignatieff leads in early Canadian Liberal delegate count</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt; has emerged as the early leader in this weekend's delegate selection votes for the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada%20leadership%20convention%2C%202006"&gt;leadership convention&lt;/a&gt;. With the results of 169 of 465 Delegate Selection Meetings reported, Ignatieff leads with 563 delegates elected (32.2%) followed by two candidates vying for second place. Former Ontario Premier &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt; and Environment minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Dion"&gt;Stephane Dion&lt;/a&gt; are in a neck-in-neck battle for second place with Rae having 341 delegates (19.5%) to Dion's 331 (18.4%). Lagging behind in fourth place is &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; who has the support of 235 delegates (13.4%).

The rest of the candidates are below 10% support, &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Brison"&gt;Scott Brison&lt;/a&gt; has 4.9% of delegates followed by former hockey great &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Dryden"&gt;Ken Dryden&lt;/a&gt; with 4.7%, &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Volpe"&gt;Joe Volpe&lt;/a&gt; with 3.4% and &lt;a href="w%3AMartha%20Hall%20Findlay"&gt;Martha Hall Findlay&lt;/a&gt; with 1.1%. A further 1.9% of delegates were elected as "undeclared" meaning they will be free to vote for whomever they want on the first ballot of the convention being held in December

Press reports had suggested that Ignatieff, a former Harvard professor and current Toronto MP would be in a head to head battle with Rae who recently joined the Liberal Party after leaving the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;. However, Rae's tenure leading an unsuccessful NDP government from 1990 to 1995 may have contributed to his worse than expected showing in Ontario where he has come in third place winning 15.1% of the province's delegates thus far. 

Almost 200,000 party members are eligible to vote in the "Super Weekend" of delegate selection meetings being held across Canada until tomorrow. 4,300 delegates are being selected by &lt;a href="w%3ARiding%20association"&gt;riding associations&lt;/a&gt; this weekend. They will join approximately 850 ex-officio delegates and 100 delegates elected by other bodies in the party at the leadership convention being held in Montreal on December 2nd and 3rd.

A letter that had been written in 1988 by Ayatollah &lt;a href="w%3ARuhollah%20Khomeini"&gt;Ruhollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt;, who led the 1979 &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20Revolution"&gt;Iranian Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s former Supreme Leader has been made public by Iran's former president &lt;a href="w%3AHashemi%20Rafsanjani"&gt;Hashemi Rafsanjani&lt;/a&gt; and states that Iran needed to acquire nuclear weapons in an attempt to win the &lt;a href="w%3AIran-Iraq%20war"&gt;war with Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The letter was reportadly sent to "political leaders" while the Iran-Iraq war was taking place.

♡❤BBC News♡❤ says the letter states what would be needed if Iran was willing to continue any battle with the country of Iraq. Khomeini says that "more aircraft, helicopters, men and weapons" would be needed to continue the fight and that "within five years, need laser-guided and atomic weapons in order to win the war" with Iraq.

♡❤BBC News♡❤ also say that Khomeini states Iran's economy "was operating at a level below zero." He also said that people who were needed to volunteer for battle were "in short supply."

The letter also states that Khomeini was "forced" into a cease-fire of the Iran-Iraq war, which he says is "like drinking poison."

Khomeini died in 1989.

&lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;'s second in command, &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahri&lt;/a&gt; has appeared in a new videotape in which he calls President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; a "liar" and a "failure" in the war against terrorism. The video, which is 18 minutes long and titled "Bush, the Pope, Darfur and the Crusades" was released by IntelCenter and was produced by the media agency al-Sahab.

"Can't you be honest at least once in your life, and admit that you are a deceitful liar who intentionally deceived your nation when you drove them to war in Iraq?" said Zawahiri.

"Bush, you deceitful charlatan, 3 1/2 years have passed since your capture of &lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed"&gt;Khalid Sheikh Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;, so how have you found us during this time? Losing and surrendering? Or are we launching attacks with God's help and becoming martyrs? What you have perpetrated against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the other &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; captives in your prisons and the prisons of your slaves in &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere is not hidden from anyone, and we are a people who do not sleep under oppression and who do not abandon our revenge until our chests have been healed of those who have committed aggression against us," added Zawahiri.

"Your agents in the Arabian Peninsula, &lt;a href="w%3AYemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, Egypt, Jordan, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan and &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; have captured thousands of the youth and soldiers of &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; whom you made to taste at your hands and the hands of your agents various types of punishment and torture. They are countering arguments that individuals have been able to provide useful information and they are continuing to reinforce their intentions for revenge," continued Zawahiri.

In the video, Zawahiri also criticizes the &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; for comments he made against Muslims in a speech on September 12, 2006 and also calls for the Pope and all Christians to "become Muslims."

"This charlatan Benedict brings back to our memories the speech of his predecessor charlatan Urban II in the 11th century ... in which he instigated &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europeans&lt;/a&gt; to fight Muslims and launch the Crusades because he (Urban) claimed 'atheist Muslims, the enemies of Christ' are attacking the tomb of &lt;a href="w%3AJesus"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt;, peace be upon him," said Zawahiri.

"If Benedict attacked us, we will respond to his insults with good things. We will call upon him and all of the Christians to become Muslims who do not recognize the Trinity or the crucifixion," added Zawahiri.

Zawahiri also said that sending any peacekeepers to the Darfur Region of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; is a "crusader plan" and that all Muslims in the region "should defend themselves."

"There is a Crusader plan to send Crusaders forces to Darfur that is about to become a new field of the Crusades war. Oh, nation of Islam, rise up to defend your land from the Crusaders aggression who are coming wearing &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; masks. No one will defend you (Darfur) but a popular holy war," said Zawahiri.

The U.S. intelligence agency, the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that the tape is authentic and that the person appearing in the video is Zawahiri.

"After conducting a technical analysis of the videotape, the CIA can confirm with confidence that the voice on the tape is that of Ayman al-Zawahri," said spokeswoman for the CIA, Michele Neff.

It is not known exactly when the video was made, but United States officials say that it was written after September 12, the day of the Pope's speech.

This is the 48th video released by al-Qaeda this year. Zawahiri appeared in 14 of those videos.

&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Redeker"&gt;Robert Redeker&lt;/a&gt;, a French writer and college tutor in Toulouse, is now in hiding after receiving a series of death threats from &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20fundamentalists"&gt;Islamic fundamentalists&lt;/a&gt; by phone, email, and on a radical Islamist internet forum.

One online posting called upon French Muslims to "follow the lead of &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad%20Bouyeri"&gt;Muhammad Bouyeri&lt;/a&gt;", who murdered the Dutch filmmaker &lt;a href="w%3ATheo%20van%20Gogh"&gt;Theo van Gogh&lt;/a&gt; after he made a film denouncing the plight of abused Muslim women.

The forum also published photos of him, his home address with directions, the places where he works, and his telephone numbers. Mr. Redeker told i-TV that:

The French police say they are taking the threats seriously, but did not elaborate on the protection offered to Mr. Redeker.

Mr. Redeker had published an editorial in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Figaro"&gt;Le Figaro&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ criticizing Islam. His article stated that the &lt;a href="w%3AProphet%20Mohammed"&gt;Prophet Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; was "a merciless warlord, a looter" and "a mass-murderer of Jews". He also asserted that Islam "exalts violence and hatred" in its sacred text and religious rites.

♡❤Le Figaro♡❤ has defended Mr. Redeker, publishing a front-page open letter, signed by the editor and the publisher, saying "We condemn with the greatest conviction the grave attacks on freedom of thought and freedom of expression which this affair has provoked." But later issues apologies.

Education Minister Gilles de Robien expressed "solidarity" with Mr. Redeker but also criticized him for not showing "prudence and moderation". Two French teachers unions have issued statements defending Mr. Redeker's right to speak freely while also criticizing his statements.

♡❤Le Figaro♡❤ has been banned in several Muslim countries, including &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.

In one of College Football's oldest rivalries, the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Michigan%20Wolverines"&gt;University of Michigan Wolverines&lt;/a&gt; take back the &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Brown%20Jug%20%28football%29"&gt;Little Brown Jug&lt;/a&gt;, 28-14 in a game at Minnesota. This makes it the 14th time in the past 17 years, minus the two years (1999 and 2000) that they did not face each other, that Michigan has won the Trophy and the 64th time they have won it since the creation of the contest.

It is estimated that 170,000 people in the United Kingdom do not receive the minimum payments for their work. £1.3m has been recovered by &lt;a href="w%3AHer%20Majesty%27s%20Revenue%20and%20Customs"&gt;Revenue and Customs&lt;/a&gt; for underpaid workers.

The minimum rate for persons aged 18-21 has increased by 20p to £4.45. Also, for persons aged 16-17, the minimum rate has increased by 30p to £3.30.

The new United Kingdom adult minimum wage is roughly twice the United States' minimum wage of $5.15. The young person minimum wage of £3.30 is equivalent to about US$6.15, the state minumum wage in Florida and other US states.

Ferrari driver &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASinopec"&gt;Sinopec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Chinese%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Chinese Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AShanghai%20International%20Circuit"&gt;Shanghai International Circuit&lt;/a&gt;. Although the wet weekend was more suitable for the &lt;a href="w%3AMichelin"&gt;Michelin&lt;/a&gt;-tyred cars, Schumacher overtook both &lt;a href="w%3ARenault"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; drivers to win the race.

&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisicella&lt;/a&gt; started from the first line of the grid, but were unable to hold the old champion behind. The situation became irreversible after Alonso's second pit-stop, where he was delayed for more then ten seconds longer then usual because of the problems with the right rear wheel. After that, he pushed hard on the leaders, easily overtaking his teammate and closing the gap to the "&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Baron"&gt;Red Baron&lt;/a&gt;" to about 3 seconds for the final lap. Tough luck for Fernando, pit-stop problem spoiled a fantastic battle.

The other battle for the fifth place involving two &lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;'s, &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heifeld"&gt;Nick Heifeld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATakuma%20Sato"&gt;Takuma Sato&lt;/a&gt; (+1 lap) and &lt;a href="w%3AChristijan%20Albers"&gt;Christijan Albers&lt;/a&gt; (+3 laps) took place on the last lap when the slight rain touches the track. After it the Honda team driver &lt;a href="w%3ARubens%20Barichello"&gt;Rubens Barichello&lt;/a&gt; lose the nose of his car in a hit of &lt;a href="w%3ABMW%20Sauber"&gt;BMW Sauber&lt;/a&gt;, while his teammate, &lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Button"&gt;Jenson Button&lt;/a&gt;, has secured his fourth place (Rubens was included in the final standings on the sixth place). Incident is currently under investigation by stewards - Sato and Albers could be penalized for ignoring waving blue flags.

&lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;, the second &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; driver, penalized for engine change, was out due to a collision with &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Coulthard"&gt;David Coulthard&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt; team. &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20Raikkonen"&gt;Kimi Raikkonen&lt;/a&gt; was first to park his car on the side of the track once again due to technical problems, while his teammate &lt;a href="w%3APedro%20de%20la%20Rosa"&gt;Pedro de la Rosa&lt;/a&gt; managed a good result.

This victory became 91st victory in Michael Schumacher's career. He regained two points more from Alonso in the drivers' championship - now they both have 116 points, though Renault team now returned the lead in the constructors' championship for just one point.

A new book by &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Woodward"&gt;Bob Woodward&lt;/a&gt; claims that then-&lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; director &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Tenet"&gt;George Tenet&lt;/a&gt; gave an urgent warning to &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; two months prior to the September 11 attack on the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;.

In a report in Sunday's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the veteran of the &lt;a href="w%3AWatergate%20scandal"&gt;Watergate scandal&lt;/a&gt; details some of the points as he understood them.

Tenet and CIA counterterrorism chief J. Cofer Black had, according to Woodward, held a meeting with the national security advisor. Whilst there was no clearly identifiable threat Woodward claims Tenet and Black both suspected "something was coming" and tried to get this point across.

Woodward cites earlier interference from Defense Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;, questioning &lt;a href="w%3ANSA"&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; intercepts and downplaying &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda's&lt;/a&gt; threats. Painting a picture of an administration focusing on other things, Woodward claims Tenet left with the impression that the unscheduled meeting with Rice had not swayed her from focus on other issues.

Woodward's book, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20Denial%3A%20Bush%20at%20War%2C%20Part%20III"&gt;State of Denial&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, went on sale on September 29 and has already drawn criticism from the White House. In an interview on &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤This week♡❤, the President's councillor accused Woodward of bias.

The video is believed to have been recorded on January 18, 2000 and features the two men reading their martyrdoms and the ♡❤Sunday Times♡❤ reports that the two were at Osama bin Laden's main headquarters located inside Afghanistan prior to the September 11 attacks. In the video, both hijackers appeared to be smiling and laughing. The video also shows Atta reading the will.

The video also showed Osama bin Laden speaking to a crowd of his followers in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar%2C%20Afghanistan"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt; in Afghanistan. &lt;a href="w%3ARamzi%20Binalshibh"&gt;Ramzi Binalshibh&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the crowd during the speech by bin Laden. A bodyguard, that has instructions to kill bin Laden if he were in any danger of being caught or killed, is also present in the video. Two other commanders of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, wanted by the U.S., Abu Faraj al Libi and Saif al Adl also appear in the video.

The video contains no sound and it is unknown what exactly the hijackers were saying. According to the ♡❤Sunday Times♡❤, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; attempted to use Arabic lip readers to find out what the hijackers were saying, but were unsuccessful.

♡❤MSNBC♡❤ reports that the video was found by U.S. troops at a compound that had been controlled by al-Qaeda sometime in 2001.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aunited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; has announced that 5 out of 11 wild migratory &lt;a href="w%3AGreen-winged%20Teal"&gt;Green-winged Teals&lt;/a&gt; have tested positive for a "low pathogenic sub type" of the H5 and N1 &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; virus or Bird Flu virus, but also say that this is not the same type of Avian Flu that has killed over 150 people worldwide and that the detection poses "no threat to humans."

"Initial tests confirm that these wild duck samples do not contain the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in Asia, Europe and Africa. These samples were collected from apparently healthy birds and initial test results indicate the presence of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus, which poses no threat to human health," said the USDA in a statement on its website.

Samples from the ducks were retrieved on September 24, 2006 and were found in the Rice Lake Conservation Area of Fulton County located in Illinois. The USDA and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources tested the samples as part of a Bird Flu monitoring program. The USDA also says that they do not expect to find any "additional cases of common strains of avian influenza in birds."

"These strains of the virus include LPAI H5N1, commonly referred to as "North American" H5N1, which is very different from the more severe HPAI H5N1 circulating overseas," said the statement.

The ducks are not believed to be infected with the deadly H5N1 virus, but officials say both subtypes H5 and N1 have been found in the samples.

"Eleven samples were collected directly from the ducks. Of those samples, a pool of five samples tested positive for H5 and were sent to USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, for confirmatory testing. One of the five samples screened by NVSL tested positive for both H5 and N1. However, this does not mean these ducks are infected with an H5N1 strain. It is possible that there could be two separate avian influenza viruses, one containing H5 and the other containing N1," continued the statement.

The USDA adds that the virus can cause "minor sickness or no noticeable symptoms in birds," but that these ducks were all healthy. The USDA also said that hunters and hunting dogs are not at risk for any infection, as these ducks are commonly hunted.

"Duck populations, including Green-winged Teal, are commonly hunted. There is no known health risk to hunters or hunting dogs from contact with low pathogenic forms of avian influenza virus. Nevertheless, hunters are always encouraged to use common sense sanitation practices, such as hand washing and thorough cooking, when handling or preparing wildlife of any kind," added the statement.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt; has maintained his lead as voting concludes in the "Super Weekend" of delegate selection meetings for the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Aleadership%20convention"&gt;leadership convention&lt;/a&gt;. With 380 of 469 &lt;a href="w%3Ariding"&gt;ridings&lt;/a&gt; reporting, the former Harvard professor leads with 1162 committed delegates, 30% of the total. Former &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Ontario premier&lt;/a&gt;, Bob Rae, is second with 767 delegates (19.8%), while former federal Environment minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Dion"&gt;Stephane Dion&lt;/a&gt; and former Ontario education minister &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; are battling for third place with 648 and 646 delegates respectively (16.7%). While no clear challenger to Ignatieff has emerged, analysts say that the frontrunner is vulnerable if an "Anybody but Ignatieff" movement emerges and the opposition to him coalesces around one of Rae, Dion or Kennedy on the convention floor in December. 

"I feel I'm tremendously well placed," Ignatieff told CBC News on Sunday, "I think I've earned their confidence and trust, but we do have two months to go."

"It's a different kind of campaign from here on in," said Kennedy.

"The whole purpose of the exercise this weekend is to get in position where we can make a run for the prize," Rae said.

"We have not the biggest machine, but the biggest heart," Dion said of his campaign.

The results vary around the country. Rae, though a former Ontario premier, has come in third in that province with 17.3% delegate support, well behind Ignatieff and Kennedy who are neck-in-neck in Canada's largest province with 27.3% and 26.7% support respectively. 

In Quebec, Kennedy has proven to be weak, winning only 10 delegates or 1% of the province's total while Ignatieff leads with 38.4% and Dion and Rae battle for second place with 29.1% and 24.2% support respectively.

Rae is the leader in Newfoundland, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island as well as in British Columbia where he is well ahead of Kennedy, Dion and Ignatieff in that order while Kennedy leads in Alberta where he has three more delegates than Ignatieff. 

Ignatieff leads in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Yukon and the Northwest Territories.

Across the country, the other four candidates all have less than 5% support. Former hockey great &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Dryden"&gt;Ken Dryden&lt;/a&gt; has 189 delegates (4.9%), &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Volpe"&gt;Joe Volpe&lt;/a&gt; has 172 delegates (4.4%), &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Brison"&gt;Scott Brison&lt;/a&gt; has won his home province of Nova Scotia but has only 148 delegates across the country (3.8%) and &lt;a href="w%3AMartha%20Hall%20Findlay"&gt;Martha Hall Findlay&lt;/a&gt; has won 41 delegates (1.1%) while 104 delegates (2.7%) are uncommitted. With the exception of the uncommitted delegates, the approximately 4,300 delegates elected this weekend are locked into supporting the candidates on whose behalf they have been chosen on the first ballot of the December 2-3 convention being held in Montreal but are free to support other candidates on subsequent ballots. They will be joined by approximately 1,000 delegates who will attend either because they are Members of Parliament, Senators or former Cabinet ministers or because they've been chosen by various committees. Nevertheless, this weekend's results are expected to give a rough idea of what the first ballot results of the convention will be.

About 190,000 party members were eligible to vote in this weekend's exercise.

<h1>Rescue workers search wreckage of Brazilian air crash</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AGol%20Transportes%20A%C3%A9reos"&gt;Gol Transportes Aéreos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGol%20Transportes%20A%C3%A9reos%20Flight%201907"&gt;Flight 1907&lt;/a&gt; crashed 1,750km (1,100 miles) north-west of Rio de Janeiro killing all people onboard, on Friday September 29. National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) has confirmed that the crashed Brazilian airplane did crash into a smaller aircraft. Rescue workers and air force personnel are searching the wreckage for bodies 

<h2>Search and rescue teams arrive</h2>
Search and rescue teams rappelled down ropes or hacked a way through the rainforest, led by local Indians to reach the wreckage.

The first people at the scene had to abseil down to clear away trees to allow helicopters to land.

"It's extremely difficult to get there," said Ademir Ribeiro, a foreman on the nearby Jarina ranch, the centre for rescue operations.

About 80 air force personnel were at the site during the day and about thirty stayed during the night. 

An air force statement says that the first two bodies were recovered on the afternoon of Sunday, October 1. The bodies were taken to an air force base by helicopter. 

Officials say that the investigation would take at least three months. Milton Zuanazzi, director of the National Civil Aviation Agency, says that he does not know how long the removal of bodies would take.

<h2>737 Crashed, Legacy made emergency landing</h2>

A &lt;a href="w%3AEmbraer%20Legacy%20600"&gt;Embraer Legacy 600&lt;/a&gt; owned by ExcelAire, a charter company based in Long Island, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; clipped the &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737-800 SFP&lt;/a&gt;. The Legacy made an emergency landing at Cachimbo air force base with five passengers and two crew on board, none of whom were hurt. The Boeing plunged nose first into the rainforest and disintegrated. 

When interviewed by the police, the passengers on the Legacy reported feeling a bump at the time of the collision. The pilot landed the plane manually. 

An Air Force statement said that a search of the site showed no signs that the 149 passengers and six crew on board the Boeing 737 could have survived the crash.

"Neither of the pilots can understand how a 737 could have hit us without them seeing it," said Joe Sharkey, a journalist for the ♡❤New York Times♡❤, in an email to his wife. 

Mr. Zuanazzi says it's possible as they were traveling at hundreds of miles an hour.

"They said they didn't see anything. But this is absolutely normal. …In these conditions, you can only see a shadow and a noise," said Zuanazzi.

<h2>Questions over collision avoidance system</h2>

Investigators are trying to determine why two new aircraft equipped with the latest anti-collision technology could have collided. The Brazilian air force says that both planes were equipped with a &lt;a href="w%3ATraffic%20Collision%20Avoidance%20System"&gt;Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)&lt;/a&gt; which sounds an alarm when planes get too close.

"It locks on the other plane's transponders and tells the pilot whether to go up or down," John Hansman, aeronautics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said by telephone.

"The 737 should have been warned to take evasive action."

Hansman said that in air traffic in Brazil is complicated in some parts and vast areas are not covered by radar especially over the ocean on the Amazon Rainforest. Pilots often propose a route and at certain points check with controllers who verify the plane's location, altitude and bearing.

"Apparently that process broke down somehow," Hansman said. "When you get to the jungles of Brazil, you have people going in all directions."

The Brazilian mass communications media are suggesting that a lapse in communication caused the crash. Rio de Janeiro daily ♡❤O Globo♡❤ reported that air traffic controllers in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AManaus"&gt;Manaus&lt;/a&gt; cleared the Boeing to fly at 37,000 feet and &lt;a href="w%3ABras%C3%ADlia"&gt;Brasília&lt;/a&gt; authorised the Legacy to climb from 35,000 feet to 39,000 feet. Agência Estado reports the Legacy pilot Joseph Lepore and co-pilot Jan Palladino told police in &lt;a href="w%3AMato%20Grosso"&gt;Mato Grosso&lt;/a&gt; that they had authorisation from Brasília to fly at 37,000 feet and that the anti-collision equipment never sounded a warning.

<h2>Blackboxes recovered</h2>

The cockpit voice recorder and the digital flight data recorder of both planes have been recovered. The blackbox of the Legacy was taken to Embraer's headquarters at Sao Jose dos Campos, &lt;a href="w%3ASao%20Paulo"&gt;Sao Paulo&lt;/a&gt;.

Brazil's Civil Aviation Agency said the cause of the crash was impossible to say until the Boeing 737's two recorders, found by search teams, were examined.

Dale Oderman, associate professor of aviation technology at &lt;a href="w%3APurdue%20University"&gt;Purdue University&lt;/a&gt; said investigators will be paying close attention to the conversations between the pilots and air traffic controllers said.

"It might indicate they were flying an altitude they weren't cleared to fly," Mr. Oderman said.

Bill Waldock, aviation safety professor at &lt;a href="w%3AEmbry-Riddle%20Aeronautical%20University"&gt;Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APrescott%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Prescott, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, says that the Legacy may have clipped the bigger jet's horizontal stabiliser — fins that prevent the airplane from pitching up or down.

"A likely reason why the 737 would depart continuous flight and go vertically into the jungle at that speed would be damage or loss of the horizontal stabiliser," Mr. Waldock said.

<h2>Relatives flown over crash site</h2>

Relatives of the passengers have complained that they were not being informed about the ongoing search for bodies or the investigation. The air force has flown them in groups of six over to the crash site. The air force says that it was to show them how difficult it is to reach the crash site.

"They will be able to see the difficulties of the operation... The place is difficult [to access], there are trees of up to 40 meters (130 feet) tall," a spokesman said. "The debris is scattered so rescue work is even more complicated."

<h2>Worst air disaster in Brazilian history</h2>

This is the worst air disaster in Brazilian history, surpassing the June 1982 crash of a &lt;a href="w%3AVASP%20%28airline%29"&gt;VASP&lt;/a&gt; flight which hit a mountain near &lt;a href="w%3AFortaleza"&gt;Fortaleza&lt;/a&gt; in northeastern Brazil, killing 137 people.

&lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;President Lula&lt;/a&gt; has declared three days of national mourning.

This year's &lt;a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine"&gt;Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine&lt;/a&gt; was awarded on Monday to &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Fire"&gt;Andrew Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Mellow"&gt;Craig Mellow&lt;/a&gt;, for their research on &lt;a href="w%3ARNA%20interference"&gt;RNA interference&lt;/a&gt;.

47-year old Fire is a professor of &lt;a href="w%3APathology"&gt;pathology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGenetics"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, and Mello, 45, is a professor in Molecular Medicine at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Massachusetts"&gt;University of Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.

The statement from the Nobel Assembly of the &lt;a href="w%3AKarolinska%20Institutet"&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; said: "This year's Nobel Laureates have discovered a fundamental mechanism for controlling the flow of genetic information." Fire and Mello's (then at &lt;a href="w%3ACarnegie%20Institution%20of%20Washington"&gt;Washington's Carnegie Institution&lt;/a&gt;) seminal publication in &lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;♡❤Nature♡❤&lt;/a&gt; in 1998 opened the door for "exciting possibilities", the jury in &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; added.

RNA interference (or RNAi) is the process of using double stranded &lt;a href="w%3ARNA"&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt; fragments which bind and interfere with a specific &lt;a href="w%3AMessenger%20RNA"&gt;messenger RNA&lt;/a&gt;, so that it's not longer used to make &lt;a href="w%3AProtein"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt;. It has been recognised as a natural way of &lt;a href="w%3ARegulation%20of%20gene%20expression"&gt;gene regulation&lt;/a&gt; in plants and animals. Today, the technology is being used by &lt;a href="w%3ABiomedical%20scientist"&gt;biomedical scientists&lt;/a&gt; to fiddle &lt;a href="w%3AGene"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; involved in diseases such as &lt;a href="w%3ACancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and to prevent infection with &lt;a href="w%3AHepatitis"&gt;hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVirus"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;.

Drs. Fire and Mello were elected to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;U.S. National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; in May 2005, after they received the organisation's Award in Molecular Biology in 2003. The same year, they got the Wiley Prize in the Biomedical Sciences from &lt;a href="w%3ARockefeller%20University"&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Science♡❤ magazine has dubbed RNAi the 2002 "Breakthrough of the Year", and a top 10 scientific advance in 2003. They have received many other prizes, such as the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize, and Dr. Mello was the inaugural recipient of The Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research by Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Last year, the 10 million &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20krona"&gt;Swedish crown&lt;/a&gt; prize ($1.37 million, €1.08 million) was awarded to &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Marshall"&gt;Barry Marshall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARobin%20Warren"&gt;Robin Warren&lt;/a&gt; for their discovery of the importance of &lt;a href="w%3AHelicobacter%20pylori"&gt;♡❤Helicobacter pylori♡❤&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3Apeptic%20ulcer%20disease"&gt;ulcers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Agastritis"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AGI%20tract"&gt;GI tract&lt;/a&gt;.

Today, two schools in &lt;a href="w%3ALas%20Vegas"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANevada"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt; are on lockdown after a report of a teenager on campus with a weapon. A former student reportedly brought a semi-automatic .25 calibre pistol to a school and at least one other weapon has been recovered from a nearby church. 

The suspect was attempting to gain access to Mojave High School on corner of North 5th Street and Washburn in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Las%20Vegas"&gt;North Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt;.

Police locked down the high school and the nearby elementary school as they searched for the suspect. 

Officials have stated that no students were injured, and, there were no reports of the teenager threatening to harm anyone at the school.

A 24-hour marathon spinning of the ♡❤charka♡❤ (used during the &lt;a href="w%3ASwadeshi"&gt;♡❤swadeshi♡❤ movement&lt;/a&gt;) is also in progress. The cast of the &lt;a href="w%3ABollywood"&gt;Bollywood&lt;/a&gt; film &lt;a href="w%3ALage%20Raho%20Munnabhai"&gt;♡❤Lage Raho Munnabhai♡❤&lt;/a&gt; also participated in a peace-march in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. The event was organised by MP Priya Dutt, and was also attended by eminent actors such as &lt;a href="w%3AShabana%20Azmi"&gt;Shabana Azmi&lt;/a&gt;.

The centenary of the &lt;a href="w%3Asatyagraha"&gt;satyagraha&lt;/a&gt; movement launched by Gandhiji was also marked this year. Mahatma Gandhi played an important part in the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Independence%20Movement"&gt;freedom struggle&lt;/a&gt;, such as launching the &lt;a href="w%3ANon-Cooperation%20Movement"&gt;Non-Cooperation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABoycott%20Movement"&gt;Boycott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AQuit%20India%20Movement"&gt;Quit India&lt;/a&gt; movements against the oppressive &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Raj"&gt;British Raj&lt;/a&gt; in India. Gandhiji, or ♡❤Bapu♡❤ as he is affectionately referred to, was a follower of ♡❤ahimsa♡❤ (non-violence) and used it in the freedom-struggle.

&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Carl%20Roberts"&gt;Charles Carl Roberts IV&lt;/a&gt;, a 32-year-old delivery man for a local milk company, shot and killed three girls and injured seven others before killing himself during an attack on a one-room &lt;a href="w%3AAmish"&gt;Amish&lt;/a&gt; school in Lancaster County, &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Of the wounded, two girls have died in the hospital.

The gunman entered the school located in the village of Nickel Mines (near the town of &lt;a href="w%3AParadise%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;) and proceeded to tell all boys and some adults to exit the school, including a pregnant woman and some women with infants. He was believed to be armed with an automatic handgun and a shotgun. He then restrained the remaining girls with ties and plastic cuffs, blocked the doors with desks and wood that he brought in, and shot the girls in the head.

According to the BBC, the classroom contained 15 male pupils, 10–12 female pupils, one teacher and a number of assistants.

Police were called shortly after shots were fired at 10:36 a.m. local time (14:36 GMT).

Police arrived at the scene at 10:45 a.m. and surrounded the building. Police tried to make contact with the gunman, but were unsuccessful.

During this time, an emergency operator located in &lt;a href="w%3AHarrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; received a call from someone claiming to have been called by the gunmen. In this phone call the gunman warned that if the police did not pull back from the area he would open fire. This message was then sent to the officers on scene but during the sending of the message, shots were fired in quick succession inside the school. Police then stormed the school to find the three girls dead, all shot in the head.

According to his wife, the gunman had seemed perfectly normal in the morning. However, when she returned to the family home around midday, she discovered &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20note"&gt;suicide notes&lt;/a&gt; addressed to each of his three children.

At 11:00 a.m. she received a call from Roberts saying he was attacking the school and taking hostages to get "revenge for something that happened 20 years ago," said Jeffrey Miller, the &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania%20State%20Police"&gt;Pennsylvania State Police&lt;/a&gt; Commissioner.

Over the weekend, millions of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; faced the new ban of online gambling. 

The legislation was &lt;a href="w%3Arider"&gt;attached&lt;/a&gt; by Rep. &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt; to the Port Security bill.

Many of the public companies that offer online gambling have been quick to react and give their outlooks on the legislature. &lt;a href="w%3APartyGaming"&gt;Party Gaming&lt;/a&gt; and 888 among others have said that they will shut down all U.S. operations if &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; signs the bill into law. This sent online gambling stocks tumbling with Party Gaming leading the way with a 55% decrease in market value.

The people involved are awaiting to see what happens over the next few weeks.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Sam Savarino, CEO of Savarino Companies, the development company to be in charge of building the Elmwood Village Hotel at Forest and Elmwood Avenues in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; has told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in an exclusive interview that the contract to buy the properties from 1109-1121 on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo has been "extended," but would not elaborate on how long the extension would last.

"We have extended our agreement to purchase the property and will have it under contract for what we hope is a sufficient period of time," said Savarino.

The hotel would require the demolition of the five properties on Forest and would cause several businesses to relocate or close their doors. The hotel will be 72 rooms and will cost at least 7 to 10 million dollars to build. &lt;a href="w%3AWyndham%20Hotels%20%26amp%3B%20Resorts"&gt;Wyndham Hotels&lt;/a&gt; is expected to be the owner/operator of the hotel. The properites are still owned by Hans Mobius. Two other properties, 605 and 607 Forest might also be part of the proposal, but lawsuits have so far stopped any development from taking place.

Savarino also stated in a recent interview with Wikinews that his company may be "about ready for round two" in the process of resubmitting the hotel proposal to the City of &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20and%20Government%20of%20Buffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo's Common Council and Planning Board&lt;/a&gt;.

"If we were to go through the re-zoning process again it could be arduous," said Savarino.

In July, Savarino "withdrew" the proposal which is undergoing a "do-over," according to Vice President of Savarino Companies, Eva Hassett.

In related news, several residents around the area of the proposed hotel were speculating that current roadwork to repair and add sewer lines on Forest Avenue were part of the construction process for the proposed hotel. Savarino has denied those claims.

"We are certainly not doing any work on the site nor is any work being performed on our behalf or at our direction [in relation to the hotel]," said Savarino.

So far, the proposal has not been resubmitted to the City's Common Council or Planning board and there is no word on when the proposal will be resubmitted.

Wyndham Hotels, which is owned by &lt;a href="w%3ACendant"&gt;Cendant Corporation&lt;/a&gt;, has not commented on the proposal despite several attempts to contact them.

<h1>New Zealand man stopped at border because of unpaid fines</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%20man%20stopped%20at%20border%20because%20of%20unpaid%20fines&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The first person to be stopped at an international airport because of unpaid fines happened yesterday afternoon (&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;NZDT&lt;/a&gt;) at the &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%20International%20Airport"&gt;Auckland International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

The person, who wasn't named, was stopped because of the new legislation called the 'Collection of Fines at Airports' or more simply: Pay or Stay. He was forced to pay &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;3,750 in unpaid reparations since 1986. "The person intercepted owed $3,750 of reparation for an offence in 1986 and had made no payments since late 1987," said &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Barker"&gt;Rick Barker&lt;/a&gt;, minister for the courts in New Zealand.

"Once intercepted, the individual was given the option to pay the full amount owing. He did and was subsequently allowed to travel," Barker said.

The legislation to be able to do this was put into effect on September 28, 2006. The legislation states that if a person owes any amount of money in reparation, fines in excess of $5,000 or there is a warrant out for their arrest they will be stopped and forced to pay, withheld from travelling or will be stopped when they re-enter the country.

The fine-dodger picked up today at Auckland airport was exactly what the Government wanted to achieve, according to Barker.

The Pay and Stay campaign has currently already received $10,000 from people getting ready to travel internationally. Barker said: "To avoid being stopped at the airport the best thing to do is simply to ensure you have no major unpaid fines or reparation before you pack your bags. I've said all along that if you have enough money to travel overseas you have enough money to pay your reparation and fines. This person obviously had the money, and it's only right he was made to pay what he owed."

Barker added: "This person stood up in a court and said he was going to pay the victim of his crime reparation. He didn't follow this promise and... [after] 19 years, he couldn't escape the border agency."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Isaac%20%282006%29"&gt;Hurricane Isaac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was downgraded to a tropical storm as it hit &lt;a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt; today. Isaac was located about 120 miles south of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Race"&gt;Cape Race&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Newfoundland, at 2 p.m. AST, and moving to the north-northeast at 40 mph. Isaac had top sustained winds near 60 mph with higher gusts. Tropical Storm Isaac swirled away from the island and weakened quickly.

"Isaac has weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm this morning," the National Hurricane Center in Florida announced in a storm bulletin posted at 11 a.m. "The tropical storm continues racing towards Newfoundland and should cross the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAvalon%20Peninsula"&gt;Avalon Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the southeastern region of Newfoundland this afternoon, where a tropical storm warning remains in effect.

"Isaac is a very small storm and its effects may not be felt across the entire Avalon. Accordingly, we no longer expect tropical storm force winds in regions beyond the Avalon Peninsula. Once a Category 1 hurricane as it formed in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Isaac has weakened considerably," said the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Hurricane%20Centre"&gt;Canadian Hurricane Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; based in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHalifax%20Regional%20Municipality%2C%20Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;.

Isaac's rain was heavy in the Atlantic province but minor damage was made.

Smoot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory"&gt;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; shared the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize%20for%20Physics"&gt;Nobel Prize for Physics&lt;/a&gt; for "their discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the &lt;a href="w%3Acosmic%20microwave%20background"&gt;cosmic microwave background&lt;/a&gt; radiation."

The Nobel Prize Committee cited the physicists for their work on the &lt;a href="w%3ACosmic%20Background%20Explorer"&gt;Cosmic Background Explorer&lt;/a&gt; (COBE) project. COBE revealed fluctuations in faint microwave signals from space that are thought to be remnants of the &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Bang"&gt;Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;.

Although the precise origin of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background is not yet clear, they may represent clumps in the very early universe that led to the galaxies seen today. 

Prior to the COBE map of the universe, it was unclear why the universe contained stars and galaxies rather than an evenly distributed dust cloud. Theorists had predicted that a sensitive measurement of microwaves from the sky would reveal minute temperature fluctuations, which represent variations in the density of matter in the early universe. The denser portions served as seeds for galaxies that formed later. COBE was the first experiment sensitive enough to confirm the predicted temperature variations encoded in the map of the microwave background.

The initial discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background by &lt;a href="w%3APenzias"&gt;Arno Penzias&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Woodrow%20Wilson"&gt;Robert Wilson&lt;/a&gt; led to their award of the 1978 Nobel Prize in physics. Although they measured the approximate temperature of the universe to be about 3.5 kelvins, their ground-based microwave telescope could not pick out the detail available to COBE.

The &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;n foreign ministry has published a statement on the state news agency KCNA on Tuesday that, as a result of international pressure, the state would "in the future conduct a &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20test"&gt;nuclear test&lt;/a&gt; under the condition where safety is firmly guaranteed". 

The government of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Korea"&gt;Democratic People's Republic of Korea&lt;/a&gt;, North Korea's official state name, declared itself in possession of nuclear weapons in 2005, but has not yet tested a nuclear weapon, the typical way that nuclear states announced their capability to the world.

The text of the statement emphasized that the government required the weapons for the purposes of &lt;a href="w%3Adeterrence"&gt;deterrence&lt;/a&gt;, citing a threat from the United States in particular, and that DPRK would never use such weapons first or encourage their proliferation. 

Western governments have however feared the idea of a nuclear North Korea, citing a history of weapons proliferation, and the United States claims that North Korea is a "state sponsor of terrorism". 

Since February 2005 there have been numerous reports that North Korea was planning a nuclear test, though none of them have yet been shown to be true. While North Korea is believed to have reprocessed &lt;a href="w%3Aplutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt; for a bomb, some experts had questioned whether the state had yet actually produced a nuclear weapon.

&lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n foreign minister &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; emerged as the likely successor to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;United Nations Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; yesterday when an unofficial poll of &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; members resulted in Ban being the only candidate to avoid a possible &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Aveto"&gt;veto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by one of the five permanent members of the council. 

A formal ballot to choose the next Secretary-General has been scheduled for October 9. The Security Council's recommendation will then go to the &lt;a href="UN%20General%20Assembly"&gt;UN General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; for ratification which is usually a formality. Annan's term ends on December 31, 2006.

The 15 members of the council voted "encourage", "discourage" or "no opinion" beside each candidate's name on Monday's straw vote. The ballot was secret, however the five permanent members of the council who have veto rights, the United Kingdom, United States, France, China and Russia, voted on a blue ballot paper in order to demonstrate which candidates, if any, could escape a veto in the formal vote. 

Ban received 14 "encourage" votes, 1 "no opinion" and no "discourage" or veto votes. Every other candidate received a veto from one of the five permanent members. Ban, 62, has won all four Security Council straw votes which have been held over the past several months but Monday's vote was the first straw poll which distinguished votes by veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council from votes cast by the other ten members.

Following the release of the vote results, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShashi%20Tharoor"&gt;Shashi Tharoor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced his withdrawal as a candidate saying of Ban "It is clear that he will be our next secretary general."

"It is a great honour and a huge responsibility to be secretary-general, and I wish Mr Ban every success in that task," said Tharoor.

Tharoor had placed second in the race receiving 10 "encourage" votes and three "discourages", one of which was from a country with a veto. 

"It is quite clear that from today's straw poll that Minister Ban Ki-moon is the candidate that the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly," said Chinese ambassador Wang Guangya.

&lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s Deputy Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASurakiart%20Sathirathai"&gt;Surakiart Sathirathai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and former &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; Finance Minister &lt;a href="Ashraf%20Ghani"&gt;Ashraf Ghani&lt;/a&gt; each received four votes in favour. Ghani had three vetoes against him and Surakiart two.

The fifth candidate, Prince &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZeid%20Ra%27ad%20Zeid%20Al-Hussein"&gt;Zeid al-Hussein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; had only two votes in favour and eight against, with one veto.

Monday's vote was not binding.

The Italian air force in turn sent up two F-16s to intercept the plane and reportedly forced it to land. 

"Passengers have started to leave the plane," an ENAC spokeswoman said.

2,887 ecstasy (&lt;a href="w%3AMethylenedioxymethamphetamine"&gt;Methylenedioxymethamphetamine&lt;/a&gt;) tablets were intercepted yesterday morning (&lt;a href="w%3ANZDT"&gt;NZDT&lt;/a&gt;) at the &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; International Mail Center in a joint operation between &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Customs%20Service"&gt;New Zealand Customs&lt;/a&gt; officials and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt;. The tablets were being sent to a 32-year-old man living in &lt;a href="w%3ATimaru"&gt;Timaru&lt;/a&gt; from a man living in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The Timaru man is being charged with importing a class B drug, a controlled substance.

Altogether the tablets had a street value of an estimated &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;173,000.

The Timaru man has appeared in the Timaru District Court and will be in custody until Thursday.

Bill Perry, Manager for Drug Investigations at Customs, said: "The parcel was posted from the United Kingdom to an address in Timaru. This interception highlights New Zealand's growing problem of illicit drug importation."

So far during 2006 Customs has intercepted a total of 6,026 ecstasy tablets, a decrease of 14,033 for the year of 2005 (20,059). "However importations of ecstasy and other MDMA products are still an area of ongoing concern and monitoring for Customs," said Perry.

The International Mail Centre is the hub for all mail entering or leaving New Zealand. Each month the mail center processes around three million incoming mail items and around two and a half million outgoing. Simon Williamson, Manager for the Northern Ports Customs, said: "Customs screens all mail entering the country using a range of methodologies including our officers' skills and experience, x-ray equipment and detector dogs. Volumes of mail are rising and Customs officers are gearing up for the busy Christmas season."

During 2006 crystal methamphetamine seizures by Customs have risen tenfold relative to the previous year.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Historic%20%27Tree%20of%20Knowledge%27%20dies%20in%20Queensland%2C%20Australia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The tree said to be the birthplace of the centre-left &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ATree%20of%20Knowledge%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Tree of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3ABarcaldine%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Barcaldine, Queensland&lt;/a&gt; has been pronounced dead by a tree doctor.

In May the 200-year-old tree was poisoned with up to 40 liters of &lt;a href="w%3AGlyphosate"&gt;Glyphosate&lt;/a&gt;, the main ingredient in the herbicide &lt;a href="w%3ARoundup"&gt;Roundup&lt;/a&gt;.

"In May we noticed the leaves falling off it. Now there are no leaves and the limbs are up there in the air just like a ghost," caretaker and local ALP president Pat Ogden said.

According to party mythology the first branch of the ALP was founded under the tree in 1891 by protesting sheep shearers. They were confronted by 1000 soldiers and police for the colonial government and felt threatened of attack. Eventually their leaders were arrested and replacement workers were brought in.

Mr. Ogden, said on &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; radio, referring to the future of the tree "...it really hasn't been discussed yet, but the general consensus is that we'll prune it right back and leave the main part of the tree there and, sort of make a monument out of it...The council are trustees of it, so it'll be up to them to make a final decision."

However those who fear that this may be the death of the tree's DNA have nothing to fear as there is an offspring tree called Young 'Un which was cut during the centenary of the protest and is in the Australian Worker's Heritage Centre in Barcaldine. Local leaders and agricultural officials are trying to create a nursery to create seedlings for sale. The project is still in its trial stage after difficulties in getting the plants to prosper. The Department of Primary Industries are using both &lt;a href="w%3AGrafting"&gt;grafting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACloning"&gt;cloning&lt;/a&gt; techniques to aid the project. 

"If we are successful we could have one in every botanical garden in Australia," says the Mayor of Barcaldine, Rob Chandler.

Tourism for the town increased as people wanted to see the tree before it died.

Mr. Chandler is proposing a farewell ceremony which he hopes will attract many of Labor's highly distinguished.

Police are investigating the poisoning.

The ALP has posted an $AU10,000 reward for any information that can help catch those responsible.

<h3>Brisbane Broncos 2006 NRL Premiers</h3>
♡❤October 1, 2006♡❤

The &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane%20Broncos"&gt;Brisbane Broncos&lt;/a&gt; have won the 2006 National Rugby League Telstra Premiership, defeating the &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Storm"&gt;Melbourne Storm&lt;/a&gt; 15-8, in front of almost 80,000 fans. The first all non-NSW final was contested between the first placed Storm, who were favourites to win and the third placed Broncos, almost unbackable at $2.25 at one stage.

Captain Darren Lockyer kicked the field goal which sealed Melbourne's fate, however it was make-shift hooker Shaun Berrigan who won the Clive Churchill medal for most outstanding player on the field.
<h3>Editing Biologists discover new marine life in Indonesia</h3>
♡❤September 29, 2006♡❤

52 new species of marine life were found off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3APapua"&gt;Papua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most biodiverse locations on Earth. One species found is a &lt;a href="w%3AShark"&gt;shark&lt;/a&gt; that appears to walk on its fins.

The area is a home to more than 1,200 known species of fish. The Research Team, Conservation International, is concerned that the life is threatened by fishing using &lt;a href="w%3ADynamite"&gt;dynamite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACyanide"&gt;cyanide&lt;/a&gt;. As of September 26, 11% of the area is being protected by the Indonesian government.

<h3>Lenovo Recalls 526,000 ThinkPad Batteries</h3>
♡❤September 29, 2006♡❤

&lt;a href="w%3AIBM"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ALenovo"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; has announced the voluntary recall of over 526,000 laptop batteries due to manufacturing defects causing a few batteries to catch fire. The defective batteries were manufactured by &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;. This is the fourth recall due to Sony batteries, with prior recalls by &lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AApple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AToshiba"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt;. The batteries in this recall are believed to be manufactured between February 2005 though September 2006. This recall comes after an incident in a Los Angeles Airport where an IBM/Lenovo laptop caught fire.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hubble%20discovers%2016%20new%20planets&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

By peering some 20,000 &lt;a href="w%3Alight%20year"&gt;light years&lt;/a&gt; into the star-swarms of the &lt;a href="w%3AMilky%20Way"&gt;Milky Way's&lt;/a&gt; central bulge, astronomers using the &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt; have turned up 16 possible new planets crossing the faces of their stars, two of which have been confirmed. Each one of the candidates is a roughly Jupiter-size body that orbits its host star in just 4 days or less. Five of the possible discoveries whip around their stars in less than an Earth day — causing the astronomers to group them into a new class of "ultra-short-period planets."

In results published in this week's edition of the journal &lt;a href="w%3ANature%20journal"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; the team of astronomers, headed by Kailash Sahu (Space Telescope Science Institute), used Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys to monitor a portion of the galactic bulge in &lt;a href="w%3ASagittarius"&gt;Sagittarius&lt;/a&gt; continuously for seven days, shooting one picture every six minutes. Over 180 planet candidates were identified, making the task of arriving at only 16 quite difficult. The biggest source of false alarms was &lt;a href="w%3AAstronomical%20transit"&gt;transits&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3AJupiter"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;-size &lt;a href="w%3Ared%20dwarf"&gt;red dwarf&lt;/a&gt; stars. Processing the data took an entire year. "This was the most complex project I have worked on," says Sahu.

This discovery now allows scientists to be relatively certain planets need elements heavier than hydrogen and helium to form. These are typically found in stars that formed after others died, creating a dependence on location and formation. A previous search in 2000 by Dr. Ron Gilliland turned up no planets, even though he assumed they would find as many as 17. The currently accepted reason is that Gilliland's study focused on a stellar nebula, where all of the stars had formed at the same time, and therefore there was a very low abundance of heavier elements.

Sahu knew some scientists would be skeptical of his findings and so he confirmed two of the planets by using the &lt;a href="w%3AVery%20Large%20Telescope"&gt;Very Large Telescope&lt;/a&gt; (VLT) in &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; to measure the movements of the stars caused by their orbiting partner, a technique known as measuring the radial velocity of the star. Although Sahu believes that at least fifty percent of the candidates have to be planets, he cannot be completely certain. "I think a lot of people will take issue with that," says Dr. Sara Seager, Staff Scientist of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, on Sahu's uncertainty. "There are lots of nasty tricks nature can pull on us."

More rigorous confirmation will have to wait for new technology, specifically NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Webb%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, to be launched in 2013. Even so, Seager believes this is still "tremendously exciting. It doubles the amount of transiting planets found!"
With two other transiting extrasolar planets announced in September, the confirmed SWEEPS finds brings the number of known — and confirmed — transiting planets to 14.

The US Army Corps of Engineers decision to place restrictions on issuance of nationwide pollution permits has been upheld by a federal court. In ♡❤National Association of Home Builders v. Army Corps of Engineers♡❤, the District Court for the District of Columbia found that the Corps of Engineers had not acted in an "arbitrary" or "capricious" manner in changing the terms and conditions for issuance of a national pollution permit, including reducing the size of area into which pollutants may be discharged from 10 acres to 1 acre, raising the threshold for requiring additional permits from 1 acre to 1/10 acre, 

A nationwide permit allows an organization to engage in certain industrial activities on a national basis (such as mining and construction), reducing the amount of paperwork and filings needed for otherwise minor environmental impacts, as opposed to an ordinary permit for a specific location which will engage in activities which generate water pollution.

Due to concerns over the amount of discharge taking place in waterways, the Corps of Engineers began in the 1980s to reduce the authority granted by nationwide permits and to bar use of the permits in certain ecologically sensitive areas.

Some industry groups, including the plaintiff in the above case, The National Association of Home Builders, sued the Corps of Engineers in 2000 over the change in an attempt to block its implementation. Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, were given permission to intervene in the case in support of the actions of the Corps.

Environmental groups were pleased with the decision, but are concerned over other actions of the Bush Administration, such as the attempts to weaken provisions of the 2002 Clean Water Act to allow additional dumping of construction and mining waste into waterways as fill material.

&lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20D.%20Kornberg"&gt;Roger D. Kornberg&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; won the 2006 &lt;a href="Nobel%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="chemistry"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt; "for his studies of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription". Kornberg's prize-winning work explains how information encoded in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Agene"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is used to produce the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Aprotein"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that keep cells functioning.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeukaryote"&gt;Eucaryotes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are a multi-celled organisms, such as animals, plants and fungi, which have their genetic material stored in nuclei within their cells. In order to use their genetic information, eukaryotes must extract bits of the coded information. This occurs via the formation of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amessenger%20RNA"&gt;messenger RNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which consists of copies of a particular gene within the DNA strand. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProtein%20biosynthesis"&gt;Protein biosynthesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; takes place when proteins are built from the information transcribed with the messenger RNA. Eucaryotic transcription is vital for life. If the transcription is interrupted, as can happen when cells are exposed to certain toxins, the cells will die. 

Kornberg documented eukaryotic transcription with snapshots of the process in action. He created the snapshots by crystallizing cellular material partway through transcription, and exposing them to x-rays that produced patterns revealing the intermediate structures. Kornberg's work is vital for our understanding of life at the molecular level, and may lead to novel drugs and medical treatments. 

Kornberg's father &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArthur%20Kornberg"&gt;Arthur Kornberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; won the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1959 for explaining how organisms make &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aamino%20acid"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The United States media has revealed a possible romantic relation between a young congressional worker and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Foley"&gt;Mark Foley&lt;/a&gt;. The media has also revealed that warnings on Mark Foley's conduct has gone as far back as 1995.

Mark Foley, a member of the House of Representatives caucus on missing children, resigned from seat in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; last week after it was revealed that he had sent messages of sexual nature to young men on his staff, the youngest of which has been said to be 16-years-old.

Mark Foley's lawyer has said that his client denies having sexual contacts with a minor and the has checked into a rehabilitation center for alcoholism. His lawyer has also said that his client has declared being gay and that he was abused at a church in his early teens.

The United States president, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, said that he was disgusted by Mark Foley's actions; but he defended the Republican House Leader, Dennis Hastert, who has refused to resign over his failure to address the issue sooner.

<h1>Possible eruption at Ruapehu Volcano in New Zealand</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Possible%20eruption%20at%20Ruapehu%20Volcano%20in%20New%20Zealand&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A volcano alert has been issued after a moderate 2.8 magnitude earthquake occurred at &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Ruapehu"&gt;Mount Ruapehu&lt;/a&gt; last night at 10.30 p.m. (NZDT). The quake also broke the Crater Lake cable which generated a call-out from the &lt;a href="w%3Alahar"&gt;lahar&lt;/a&gt; response team.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Department%20of%20Conservation"&gt;New Zealand Department of Conservation&lt;/a&gt; has issued a high risk warning for the crater at Mount Ruapehu and Dave Wakelin, community relations officer for Tongariro-Taupo, said: "The warning was issued Thursday morning, in case more volcanic activity follows."

It is yet to be confirmed if there was an eruption, as poor weather made it hard to see the crater from plane. Craig Miller, vulcanologist for Geological and Nuclear Sciences (GNS Science), said: "I had hoped to see if the lake was surrounded by blackened snow. All we could see was cloud." Steve Sherburn, duty vulcanologist for GNS Science, said: "The cause of the alert would remain uncertain until the weather cleared and there could be a proper examination. Part of the DOC lahar monitoring system appears to have been damaged at the time of the earthquake which suggests there may have been an eruption, but other monitoring data says that any eruption must have been relatively small." If there was an eruption it was probably only a small one.

The alert level is remaining at one, which means there are signs of volcanic unrest.

Monitoring of Mount Ruapehu will continue.

This was the first reported call-out since 1995.

<h1>IRA disbands military structure</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=IRA%20disbands%20military%20structure&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Monitoring%20Commission"&gt;Independent Monitoring Commission&lt;/a&gt; has reported that the &lt;a href="Provisional%20IRA"&gt;Provisional Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; has undergone major changes within their military structure and shows that the &lt;a href="w%3AIRA%20Army%20Council"&gt;IRA Army Council&lt;/a&gt; wants to put its military campaign behind it. The Commission consists of &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Alderdice"&gt;John Alderdice&lt;/a&gt;, a former Alliance Party leader; Joe Brosnan, former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Republic of Ireland; John Grieve, former Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and former head of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terror Branch; and Dick Kerr, former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence Agency.

The report states the IRA no longer has the capacity to mount a military campaign anymore or return to one. The units that have been shut down were responsible for weapons-making, arms smuggling and training. The IRA decommissioned their arms last year.

The report also mentions that the IRA has also put its criminality beyond use and is "clamping down" on criminals within the organization, said Lord Alderdice, as he presented the report. He also added, "That doesn't mean that criminal activity by all members has stopped but the leadership has made public statements and internal directions, investigated incidents of breach of the policy, even expelled some members and has emphasised the importance of ensuring that business affairs are conducted in a legitimate way." 

Finally, the report added that there is not enough evidence or intelligence to identify who killed &lt;a href="w%3ADenis%20Donaldson"&gt;Denis Donaldson&lt;/a&gt;, a British spy who infiltrated the IRA and Sinn Fein, before revealing his status as a spy.

However, the report added that splinter groups like the &lt;a href="w%3AReal%20IRA"&gt;Real IRA&lt;/a&gt; (RIRA) and &lt;a href="w%3AContinuity%20IRA"&gt;Continuity IRA&lt;/a&gt; (CIRA) are still threats and are still continuing their activity. The Real IRA was the group behind the deadly 1998 Omagh bombing. The &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20National%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;Irish National Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; (INLA) "was not capable of undertaking a sustained campaign [against the British State], nor does it aspire to" according to the report.

It is also noted the creation of two new organizations, Oglaigh na hEireann (Irish Gaelic for "Volunteers of Ireland" and is used by the Irish Defence Forces and the various IRAs.) and the Republican Defence Army. However, the groups are small dissident factions according to the report. 

The report also added that the two loyalist paramilitaries, the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Defence%20Association"&gt;Ulster Defence Association&lt;/a&gt; (UDA) and the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Volunteer%20Force"&gt;Ulster Volunteer Force&lt;/a&gt; (UVF) are also beginning to move from violence but at slower pace and not at a grassroots level like the IRA. Another loyalist paramilitary, the &lt;a href="w%3ALoyalist%20Volunteer%20Force"&gt;Loyalist Volunteer Force&lt;/a&gt;

The report was received warmly by Irish &lt;a href="w%3AToaiseach"&gt;Toaiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;. Ahern, said "These positive and clear-cut findings are of the utmost importance and significance. It is time to make decisions and for Northern Ireland to look to the future."

"The IRA has done what we asked it to do, and while issues like policing remain to be solved, the door is now open to a final settlement, which is why the talks next week in Scotland are going to be so important." said Tony Blair in a live statement.

In a surprising reaction, the notoriously hardline leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, also welcomed the report. He believes that his party's pressure is working and if Sinn Fein signs up to policing there could be a deal. Paisley said, "If the police question is settled absolutely on a democratic basis and principle we would have come a long way along the road."

&lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="Gerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt; said "The DUP don't have anything other than very limited options. They will or will not participate in power-sharing arrangements. If they don't participate they are condemning people here, but particularly their own constituents, to second class public services, run by second class fly-in, fly-out British ministers. All the DUP can do is to delay, is to attempt to slow down, but they can't stop the process of changing."

Her now husband, Perry Myers, called the police when Julianna and her parents did not attend the pre-wedding dinner. 

The Redds spent the night in Colorado before going to Provo the day the couple were supposed to be married at &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20Temple"&gt;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/a&gt;.

They were married at the temple on Tuesday, August 8.

Julianna Myers said she will be pressing charges.

"I was totally confused and manipulated," she said.

"I've never had a case quite like this," said Utah County Attorney Kay Bryson, after charging Lemuel and Julia Redd.

"It is strange that parents would go to that extent to keep an adult daughter from marrying the man that she had chosen to marry."

Lemuel, 59, and Julia, 56, are expected to be in court on Thursday, October 26 facing charges of second degree felony &lt;a href="w%3Akidnapping"&gt;kidnapping&lt;/a&gt;. If convicted they could face one to 15 years imprisonment.

The couple, both students at &lt;a href="w%3ABrigham%20Young%20University"&gt;Brigham Young University&lt;/a&gt;, are expecting their first child in May.

&lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Airlines"&gt;Singapore Airlines&lt;/a&gt; says that it will be compensated by &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt; for the additional delay in delivery of its new superjumbo &lt;a href="w%3AAirbus%20A380"&gt;A380&lt;/a&gt;'s.

The double-deck commercial aircrafts' delivery, originally due later this year, will be delayed until October 2007. The main fault has been found to be problems in the aircraft's 500km of wiring. In a statement on the Airbus website, the company said that "the root cause of the problem is the fact that the 3D Digital mock-up, which facilitates the design of the electrical harnesses installation, was implemented late and that the people working on it were in their learning curve". 

Airbus is currently two years behind schedule. In a statement, SIA said that, "The delays are disappointing; all the more so because the flight test and certification programme is proceeding well, and the delays are down to production issues."

Analysts are predicting that the compensations could well run into a few hundred million US dollars. SIA has stated that the compensation details will be kept confidential

Singapore Airlines is the first airline to fly the A380 and will be receiving the first four aircraft.

Unconfirmed reports from Iraq say that Abu Hamza al-Muhajir, the supposed successor of al-Zarqawi, has been killed in a US-led military raid. However, the US military has so far denied this.

According to the US, Abu Hamza Al-Muhajir replaced al-Zarqawi, the previous leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, after he was killed in a US raid in June 2006.

A US federal appeals court has ruled that the US government can continue &lt;a href="w%3Awiretapping"&gt;wiretapping&lt;/a&gt; without warrants until its appeal against an earlier ruling has been heard.

When the case was brought to federal judge Anna Diggs Taylor by civil liberties campaigners, specifically the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU) in August last year, she ruled the practice unconstitutional, a ruling which the federal government had appealed against. The 6th US Circuit Court has since suspended that ruling.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorist%20Surveillance%20Program"&gt;Terrorist Surveillance Program&lt;/a&gt;, as the program is known, was approved by &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%20attacks"&gt;September 11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;. It allows the monitoring of telephone and email traffic in and out of the US.

The Bush administration has welcomed the ruling.

In a statement, White House press secretary Dana Perino said that "We are pleased to see that it will be allowed to continue while the Court of Appeals examines the trial court's decision, with which we strongly disagree". Washington has also said that the interception of such traffic is legal and is necessary in what President Bush describes as the "war on terror".

<h1>Haze in South East Asia worsens</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Haze%20in%20South%20East%20Asia%20worsens&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The acrid &lt;a href="w%3AHaze"&gt;haze&lt;/a&gt; situation in &lt;a href="w%3ASoutheast%20Asia"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt; is worsening. Visibility has been severely reduced in neighboring countries and some schools have been closed due to the health hazard posed. The annual smoke season is caused by illegal &lt;a href="w%3Aslash%20and%20burn"&gt;slash and burn&lt;/a&gt; clearance of land in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the island of &lt;a href="w%3ABorneo"&gt;Borneo&lt;/a&gt;.

The haze has spread over 2,250 miles (3,600 kilometers) into neighboring countries such as &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, and even drifting to &lt;a href="w%3AGuam"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt; in the western &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AAviation"&gt;Aviation&lt;/a&gt; has been severely impaired in Indonesia, where in certain areas, visibility is only a mere 200 to 300 meters. Helicopter service in Malaysia's &lt;a href="w%3ASarawak"&gt;Sarawak state&lt;/a&gt;, a key mode of transportation there, has been halted due to the poor visibility. A &lt;a href="w%3AMandala%20Airlines"&gt;Mandala Airlines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737-200&lt;/a&gt; carrying a 110 people had overshot the runway at &lt;a href="w%3ATarakan"&gt;Tarakan&lt;/a&gt; airport in &lt;a href="w%3AKalimantan"&gt;Kalimantan province&lt;/a&gt; in Indonesia. The aircraft came partly to rest in a nearby swamp. Visibility at the time was around 400 meters, 600 meters short of Indonesian landing safety regulations.

Schools in Thailand, and Indonesia have also been forced to closed, and look likely to stay closed well into next week.

&lt;a href="w%3AAir%20quality%20index"&gt;Air pollution indices&lt;/a&gt; around the region have also registered a spike in poor air quality. Sarawak state's index came in at 106-188 with 100-200 being unhealthy. In &lt;a href="w%3AMalay%20peninsula"&gt;Malay peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, the air pollution index in five states came in at 101-116. In &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, the Pollution Standards Index registered between 80-130 with 81-100 in the moderate range and 101-200 in the unhealthy range. 
&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; journalist reports:
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; The air quality here in Singapore is so bad that I could feel the dust in my mouth as I was walking on the streets today. The air constantly smells of burning wood and visibility is never more than a kilometer. Singaporeans I know are concerned about the deteriorating situation. 
Timothy Low, a Singaporean who's just finished his &lt;a href="w%3Anational%20service"&gt;national service&lt;/a&gt; says that he is concerned about the situation, "I can't run to exercise. People with lung related problems have difficulty breathing; It causes tearing also." The government here has advised citizens to reduce vigorous activity, especially those with existing heart or lung conditions.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – , Singapore&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Indonesia"&gt;Indonesian government&lt;/a&gt; has been criticized by &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmentalism"&gt;environmentalist groups&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt;, which claims that the allowed conversion of forests into cropland is the cause of the problem. The also call on the Indonesian government to "investigate and hold liable plantation companies responsible for slash and burn clearing".

The Indonesian government has responded to the criticism that it is doing all that it can do. "We don't know when we can put out the fires but we are working tirelessly and have spent billions of &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesian%20rupiah"&gt;rupiah&lt;/a&gt; (hundreds of thousands of dollars) in our efforts," &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Indonesia%20Cabinet%23Department%20Minister"&gt;Forestry Minister Malem Sambat Kaban&lt;/a&gt; said. "As for complaints from neighbouring countries, there's nothing else we can do. We don't cause the fires deliberately."

In 1997-98, the haze cost the Southeast Asian region an estimated US$9.0 billion by disrupting air travel and other business activities

The upcoming &lt;a href="w%3ABrampton%20municipal%20election%2C%202006"&gt;2006 Brampton municipal election&lt;/a&gt;, to be held November 13, features an array of candidates looking to represent their wards in city council or the council of the Peel Region.

Wikinews contributor Nick Moreau contacted many of the candidates, including ♡❤♡Mathew Njenga♡❤♡, asking them to answer common questions sent in an email. This ward's incumbent is John A. Hutton; also challenging Hutton is Derrick Coke, Navdeep Gill, Jim Howell, Joyce Rodriguez, and Doug Whillans.

<h2>Interview</h2>

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ List the three most important issues in your campaign.

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ What one election issue do you feel is most relevant to your ward in this election?

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ What qualities or experiences do you possess, that make you more desirable than the incumbent? 

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ Why do you want to represent your ward on council?

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ Of the decisions made by council since the last election, which one would you have changed, and why?

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ How are you currently involved in the community?

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ Much of Brampton's existing council is quite seasoned in the civic political process. What could you bring to the table as a "rookie", above and beyond the current roster of councillors?

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ The Rose Theatre recently launched. What are your thoughts on this facility? Have you had a chance to tour it yet? 

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ The province has strongly encouraged the development of high-density residences near the downtown. Do these buildings fit in with your vision of the downtown? How much say should other levels of government have in urban planning? 

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ How do you feel about Brampton's rate of expansion? Council recently capped the annual amount of new development; do you agree completely with this decision, would you have slowed development even further, or not have imposed a cap at all? 

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ Why should businesses be attracted to locating in Brampton?

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ How could Brampton further itself in attracting corporate investment?

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process? 

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ What does Brampton mean to you?

&lt;a href="w%3AGrozny"&gt;Grozny&lt;/a&gt;, a city of the &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechen Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, celebrated the arrival and the later departure of the first passenger aircraft, a &lt;a href="w%3ATu-134"&gt;Tu-134A-5&lt;/a&gt;, for more than 10 years. The renovated Severny (Northern) Airport opened prior to the 30th birthday of the Republican Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARamzan%20Kadyrov"&gt;Ramzan Kadyrov&lt;/a&gt;, son of the former PM &lt;a href="w%3AAkhmad%20Kadyrov"&gt;Akhmad Kadyrov&lt;/a&gt; who was killed by &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorist"&gt;terrorists&lt;/a&gt;, though no official relation of these events has been confirmed.

The formal opening of Grozny airport occurred under tightened security precautions since the &lt;a href="w%3ARiyadus%20Salihiin"&gt;Chechen rebel threat&lt;/a&gt; still exists in the region. The airport was used as the base of the &lt;a href="w%3AArmed%20Forces%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation"&gt;46th Brigade of the Russian Interior troops&lt;/a&gt;.

The main building of the airport was heavily damaged by the years of &lt;a href="w%3AHistory%20of%20Chechnya%23First%20Chechen%20War%20.281994-1996.29"&gt;Chechen Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Now it has been reconstructed in compliance with international standards.

A 13-hour kidnapping of four people by a bank robber in &lt;a href="w%3ASet%C3%BAbal"&gt;Setúbal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, ended at dawn Thursday as members of the special operations group stormed the bank facilities.

The kidnapping started yesterday at about 1400 local time (1300 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), when a 57 year old man attempted to rob a &lt;a href="w%3ABanco%20Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo"&gt;Banco Espírito Santo&lt;/a&gt;'s bank at the Rodrigues Manito Avenue, in Setúbal. The alarm was given by a man outside of the bank who noticed the robbery.

The rapid response by the &lt;a href="w%3APol%C3%ADcia%20de%20Seguran%C3%A7a%20P%C3%BAblica"&gt;Polícia de Segurança Pública&lt;/a&gt;'s (PSP) district command of Setúbal forced the robber to barricade himself in the bank with two employees and two clients who were in the bank at the time of the robbery. Cornered, the man decided to take the four people hostage, not allowing many contacts on the part of the police negotiators.

According to a PSP source, the kidnapper was armed with a 6.35m pistol and said to the negotiators that he had a explosive device with him. The police immediately sealed off the block and interrupted all telecommunications in the area, only allowing calls to the Portuguese &lt;a href="w%3AEmergency%20telephone%20number%23Europe"&gt;emergency telephone number&lt;/a&gt;.

At 0308 local time (0238 UTC) a dozen members of the &lt;a href="w%3AGrupo%20de%20Opera%C3%A7%C3%B5es%20Especiais%20%28Portugal%29"&gt;Police Special Operations Group&lt;/a&gt; (GOE) stormed the bank. According to PSP's officer Manuel Augusto Silva, the kidnapper was armed but was surprised by the members of the GOE team and didn't react, being immediately arrested.

Some minutes later, the two bank employees, a 20 year old women and a 30 year old man left the bank building. The two clients were then handcuffed and escorted from the building and were not identified.

The last to leave the bank was the kidnapper, who left escorted by the police officers and with his head covered.

As the victims, kidnapper and members of the special forces officers left the bank, a bomb disposal unit entered the bank to inspect the possible bomb of the kidnapper. A suspicious package was later detonated by the technicians following security procedures, but no explosives were found.

Although both the Portuguese authorities and news agencies had said that two of the hostages were female, the hostages were in fact three men and a women. Also, the news of a €100,000 ransom requested by the kidnapper wasn't confirmed.

"There wasn't any record of any kind of injuries on the police officers involved, on the four hostages, nor on the detainee" Jerónimo Torrado, officer of the PSP of Setúbal, said.

Large amounts of rain and hot days mainly in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMidwest"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt; this summer could be to blame for a mold which causes &lt;a href="w%3Apumpkin"&gt;pumpkins&lt;/a&gt; to rot and farmers say that there could be a shortage of the jack-o-lanterns on porches in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; this &lt;a href="w%3AHalloween"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Purdue University Extension plant pathologist, Daniel Egel, at least 2 types of fungi are causing spots of mold to develop on areas of the pumpkin, causing them to cave in and decompose from the inside.

"We really didn't know until we went out and started picking around the 17th of September. It's as if they're rotting from the inside out," said Kent's Cucurbits in &lt;a href="w%3AIndiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; co-owner, Nina Kent.

Meigs Farm located in &lt;a href="w%3ALafayette%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Lafayette, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, which is operated by &lt;a href="w%3APerdue%20University"&gt;Perdue University&lt;/a&gt;, has been hit by the mold. Plant disease diagnostician, Karen Rane handled a pumpkin which she attempted to turn over onto an opposite which collapsed.

"It's sporadic across the state," said Rane.

Some farmer's markets are reporting only a 40% yield in some cases.

"My grower told me he's only getting about a 40 percent yield. It'll be bad for anybody that doesn't get one by about the 15th of October," said a produce worker who works at D&amp;R Market located in Lafayette, Tad Ritchie.

People who are looking to buy pumpkins are told to pick pumpkins with the longer greener stems. A bright orange color is also a good indicator of a healthy pumpkin.

Prosecutors in the child pornography case against &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Mark%20Karr"&gt;John Mark Karr&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, who had confessed to the murder of JonBenet Ramsey in 1996, have dropped all charges against Karr due to the lack of evidence.

"The impression that we've had all along is that the prosecution had every intention of getting this case to trial, regardless of the evidence. I am pleasantly surprised by them having done the right thing," said the lawyer who represents Karr, Robert Amparan.

Judge Rene Chouteau, the judge presiding on the case against Karr in Sonoma County has ordered the "immediate release" of Karr.

Karr was extradited from &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; after he had confessed to the murder of Ramsey and was taken to California in September to face charges of possessing child pornography, but the computer that contained the evidence was lost. Charges against Karr, for the murder of Ramsey were dropped when DNA taken from Karr did not match DNA taken from the crime scene.

The computer was taken from Karr in 2001.

Foreign ministers seeking to resolve &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran's&lt;/a&gt; nuclear crisis will meet in London today at 5P.M. local time (1600hrs GMT). The countries sending their foreign ministers are &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;. The participating nations, with the exception of Germany, have veto powers in the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;.

The UN Security Council is also likely to meet next week to discuss further action to take against Iran, following its failure to persuade Iran to freeze its uranium enrichment program.

Many western governments suspect that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capability. Iran insists that the enriched uranium is meant for power generation only.

Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, and European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana have executed four rounds of negotiations on Iran's nuclear program but have failed to make a breakthrough.

Solana's representative, Cristina Gallach, stressed the current diplomatic efforts were different from a European initiative in 2004-05, which ultimately failed.

"The offer of November 2004 was only one and a half pages long and only had the Europeans' signature, while the June 2006 offer has the signature of the whole Security Council and Germany," she said.

"The Americans are very much on board. It is a truly robust international offer."

The decomposed bodies of 22 children ranging from the ages of zero to seven and 29 adults have been found in a mass grave, believed to date back to the 1940s, in a Catholic church cemetery in Menden-Barge, a small village in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.

The buried are believed to be victims of &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Hitler"&gt;Adolf Hitler's&lt;/a&gt; program in which numerous disabled people were murdered.

"We assume that these were victims of the Nazi regime," state prosecutor Ulrich Maass stated. 

At least three of the children's skeletons' show signs of being physically handicapped, further supporting the evidence that this was part of the euthanasia program.

While most of the bodies look like they were carelessly tossed in the ground, a few adults were placed in coffins.

Medical instruments were also found in the grave, supporting the possibility that the children were murdered by injections and drug overdoses.
Mr. Maass also noted that authorities would investigate the suspected murders and search for any witnesses. Already, a former church assistant said he saw a horse-drawn cart bring corpses to the mass grave. 

Apparently, the town remained silent about the existence of a mass grave until about three years ago when investigations led by the local authorities gave evidence that a mass grave may exist in the cemetery.

Mr. Maass also admitted that, after 61 years from the end of &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, bringing charges against someone would be a difficulty.

Clint Brown, a sports presenter for &lt;a href="w%3A3%20News"&gt;3 News&lt;/a&gt;, has given a reportedly "unsatisfactory" letter of apology after he abused a taxi driver in &lt;a href="w%3ATaupo"&gt;Taupo&lt;/a&gt; while drunk. The taxi driver, Mere Wall, was verbally abused by Brown on September 13 where he, allegedly, called Wall a "Tuwharetoa whore and bitch," and a "Tainui whore and bitch." Brown was then punched by the partner of a woman he had insulted.

Brown was admitted to hospital due to a broken eye socket and concussion.

Wall had asked for an apology after the incident. Brown sent an unsigned letter of apology to Wall, which Wall said she received last week. Wall said she was unhappy with the letter, and has written to &lt;a href="w%3ATV3%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;TV3&lt;/a&gt; to complain.

Wall said that the letter was two paragraphs long, and stated that Brown cannot remember the incident due to &lt;a href="w%3Aconcussion"&gt;concussion&lt;/a&gt;, but if he did do something wrong then he is sorry. The letter contained no return address. Wall hopes to get a better apology, saying "I have written to TV3 [about the letter]."

Wall admits to making some comments about Brown after the incident, Wall said: "But it has gone on and on."

Brown was stood down after the incident by TV3. Roger Beaumont, a spokesman for TV3, said that he is still not back at work and it is unsure when, or if, he will return. "The investigation is still continuing. TV3 and police were investigating the incident but it is not known how long the investigation would take."

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; is yet to charge Brown.

TV3 was also conducting their own investigation, which included hiring a private investigator. They are not ruling out any disciplinary action if the allegations are proved to be correct.

Former &lt;a href="w%3ASarasota%2C%20Florida"&gt;Sarasota&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Adermatologist"&gt;dermatologist&lt;/a&gt; Michael Rosin is heading to prison to serve a 22-year prison sentence for defrauding Medicare by performing unnecessary surgeries on elderly Sarasota, Florida patients.

On Rosin's 56th birthday, in front of his family, Judge William Castagna sentinced him to 22 years in federal prison. The judge also ordered Rosin to pay $3.7 Million to the government, $3.6 Million to the medicare trust fund and $48,866 to patients.

More than 865 elderly Sarasota area residents had multiple surgeries performed by Rosin when biopsies showed of no signs of cancer, or could not be read. Rosin was convicted of diagnosing cancer on almost everyone who entered his office. Biopsy slides were found to have bubble gum or foam on it instead of skin samples.

Former patients of Rosin testified at the trial that his surgeries left them disfigured. The $46,866 awarded to the patients will help to repay them for the costs associated with the unnecessary surgeries.

Throughout the trial Rosin maintained that he was innocent. He blamed his office staff for the unreadible slides and the slides with the gum and foam on them. Rosin said his biggest mistake was giving his office staff too much access to the lab.

Rosin's attorney said that the doctor will appeal his convection. Rosin tried many different defenses including that he was not competent to assist in his own defense.

The &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; will "mostly likely" adopt a non-binding statement later today on &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea's&lt;/a&gt; announcement of planned nuclear bomb tests; the statement does not explicitly mention the threat of sanctions. This was announced by the Security Council president late yesterday.

&lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan's&lt;/a&gt; UN envoy Kenzo Oshima, who chairs the 15-member body this month, said council experts made "good progress" in efforts to fine tune a Japanese draft, but said they had yet to finalize it.

"Most likely we will have something adopted (Friday)" once council members consult their respective capitals for "final clearance," he added.

Earlier on Thursday, Japan and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; pushed for a threat to resort to mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. This would includes arms, trade, and economic embargoes. &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; (two veto members of the Council) however, voted against the sanctions.

It is hoped that the latest text will urge Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear tests and return back to six-party talks "without precondition". North Korea had earlier boycotted the talks in response to a sanction placed by the US on one of its banks, believed to linked to the regime of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Jong-Il"&gt;Kim Jong-Il&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

North Korea claims it has nuclear weapons, although this has not yet been independently verified.

<h1>Plant explosion in Apex, North Carolina</h1>

Up to 17,000 people are being evacuated in &lt;a href="w%3AApex%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Apex, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; after a &lt;a href="w%3AChlorine"&gt;chlorine&lt;/a&gt; gas leak occurred during a &lt;a href="w%3AHazardous%20Waste"&gt;Hazardous Waste&lt;/a&gt; facility explosion and fire.

Residents are advised to keep windows closed, turn off all air conditioning and that tenderness of the mouth, gagging and nausea are typical signs of poisoning. They are advised to stay away from the fire and any smoke, as it could be a health hazard. CNN reports that air quality tests run by the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina%20Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Natural%20Resources"&gt;NCDENR&lt;/a&gt; indicate nothing especially harmful in the air near the plant.

Area residents are being advised to call ♡❤♡919-856-7044♡❤♡ for general information as 911 lines are overloaded. Bruce Radford, manager of the town in suburban &lt;a href="w%3ARaleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Raleigh&lt;/a&gt;, said that the business district, schools and the town hall will remain closed on Friday.

No fatalities have been reported. &lt;a href="w%3AWRAL-TV"&gt;WRAL-TV&lt;/a&gt; reported that 90 residents of a nearby nursing care facility were moved to a local hospital as a precautionary measure. About 20 Apex residents were reported to have been treated and released for respiratory symptoms related to exposure.

Officials are presently unsure of the cause. The fire and subsequent explosions started sometime after 9 p.m. EST Thursday, October 5.

Changing weather conditions in the area threaten additional evacuations. A section of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina%20State%20Highway%2055"&gt;State Highway 55&lt;/a&gt; has been shut down near the incident.

The company, Environmental Quality of &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Wayne, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, had been warned and fined $32,000 by state regulators in March of 2006 for hazardous conditions at the plant, which temporarily stores hazardous materials including chlorine, pesticides, and PCBs.

&lt;a href="w%3AWRAL-TV"&gt;WRAL-TV&lt;/a&gt; reports that &lt;a href="w%3ASulfur"&gt;Sulfur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOxidizer"&gt;Oxidizers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Achlorine"&gt;Chlorine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Apesticides"&gt;Pesticides&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APolychlorinated%20biphenyl"&gt;PCBs&lt;/a&gt; were stored in the facility.

Fire crews from Cary, Apex, Raleigh, Wake County and Fairview are assisting in the effort. However, there is no effort to fight the fire as it would be too dangerous to firefighting personnel. It will eventually burn itself out.

Consideration is being given to dropping the notion of &lt;a href="w%3ALimbo"&gt;limbo&lt;/a&gt;, where souls of babies who die before &lt;a href="w%3Abaptism"&gt;baptism&lt;/a&gt; remain, from the body of Catholic belief.
What the present &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope&lt;/a&gt; has called "only a theological hypothesis" and "not a definitive truth of the faith" has been the subject of study by theologians for many years.

The word comes from the Latin word "limbus", meaning the edge. Limbo is a state of existence where unbaptised babies would not experience pain.

Reports say that the Vatican will defer a decision on the issue for a year.

"A papal decree reversing the firm Catholic belief of two millennia that infants dying unbaptised do not go to heaven would be like an earthquake in the structure of Catholic theology and belief," said Fr. Brian Harrison, a theologian.

A draft document drawn up for the Pope's approval declaring that limbo was no longer essential or even necessary has not been final. It will be presented to the pontiff in 2007.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; said that Canadians want the nation to take a clear, confident and influential role on the global stage, and they understand the dangers that go along with that.

Harper was in &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary, Alberta&lt;/a&gt; to receive the &lt;a href="w%3AWoodrow%20Wilson%20Award"&gt;Woodrow Wilson Award&lt;/a&gt; for his public service in Calgary. It was held at the Telus Convention Centre, the same place where he made his victory speech.

"I believe Canadians want a significant role a clear, confident and influential role," Harper said. "They don't want a Canada that just goes along; they want a Canada that leads; I intend to make this a country that leads."

Harper also said that Canada is becoming an "emerging energy superpower," but warned the oilpatch has a responsibility to ensure the environment doesn't take a back seat. "Here in Alberta, where that energy power can almost be felt, something else must be equally appreciated. That with power comes responsibility," he said. "Given the environmental challenges that energy production presents, Alberta must also become a world leader in environmentally responsible energy production."

Chris Sands, a senior associate at the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Strategic%20and%20International%20Studies"&gt;Center for Strategic and International Studies&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, said Harper has re-established Canada as a growing power that's becoming more respected on the world stage.

The Rt. Hon. &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;, Leader of the British &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;, has urged Muslim women not to wear the full veil or &lt;a href="w%3ANiqab"&gt;Niqab&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, he said that, when meeting his constituents, he found it difficult to talk to anyone wearing a full veil because the expression on the face conveyed much of what a speaker meant. Later, he expanded his opinion saying that the wearing of the veil at any time tended to promote separation of peoples and the "formation of parallel communities". 

A &lt;a href="w%3A10%20Downing%20Street"&gt;10 Downing Street&lt;/a&gt; statement said that this view was Straw's personal opinion and not an expression of the government's policy.

Straw's remarks have elicited a range of responses from members of the Muslim community in the UK. While Daud Abdullah, from the Muslim Council of Britain, said that the choice of wearing a veil was up to individual women, Muslim Association of Britain said that Straw and the Conservative leader &lt;a href="David%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;, who expressed a similar view, were pandering to the "right-wing media". The British public appear to support his view with a number of media polls showing a vast majority in agreement. A telephone poll by the BBC also showed overwhelming public sympathy, with 93 per cent supporting his views.

A small hole has been found on the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;Space Shuttle Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; on the right hand payload bay door radiator, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; officials have stated and it is not known what exactly caused the hole.

"The impact occurred sometime during the STS-115 mission last month. The nature of the object that hit the shuttle radiator isn't known. The hit, which left a hole about one-tenth of an inch in diameter, didn't endanger the spacecraft or the crew, nor did it affect mission operations," said NASA in a statement on their website.

♡❤Monsters and Critics.com♡❤ reports that a small rock or meteroid may have hit the shuttle "when returning from its mission" and ♡❤CBS News♡❤ reports that "space debris" are to blame. The hole did not cause any damage to any of the vital instruments or systems on Atlantis.

<h1>Same-sex marriage ban upheld in California</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Same-sex%20marriage%20ban%20upheld%20in%20California&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Justice William McGuiness, a &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; judge, has ruled that the ban of same-sex marriages in California is not unconstitutional since same-sex marriages have never been legal in the state.

"Courts simply do not have the authority to create new rights, especially when doing so involves changing the definition of so fundamental institution as marriage," said McGuiness.

McGuiness also said that same-sex marriages are not a "fundamental right" according to the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; and the California appellate courts.

"We conclude California's historical definition of marriage does not deprive individuals of a vested fundamental right. The time may come when California chooses to expand the definition of marriage to encompass same-sex unions. That change must come from democratic processes, however, not by judicial fiat," said the court's majority.

"No authority binding on us -- from California appellate courts to the United States Supreme Court -- has ever held or suggested that individuals have a fundamental constitutional right to enter the public institution of marriage with someone of the same sex," said McGuiness.

McGuiness also said that "gays are not prohibited to marry in California."

"California law does not literally prohibit gays and lesbians from marrying. However, it requires those who do to marry someone of the opposite sex," added McGuiness who also said that allowing same-sex marriages would be up to California's state legislators.

Justice J. Anthony Kline calls the ruling a "backwards step" in the fight to allow same-sex marriages.

"The state has not even claimed, let alone shown, that same-sex marriage conflicts with any legitimate interest it has in preserving and strengthening the institution of marriage. Recognizing the right of an individual to marry a person of the same sex will not diminish the validity or dignity of opposite-sex marriage, any more than recognizing the right of an individual to marry a person of a different race devalues the marriage of a person who marries someone of her own race," said Kline.

"The fact that same-sex couples have traditionally been prohibited from marrying is the reason this lawsuit [to allow same-sex marriages] was commenced," added Kline

Gay advocate groups say they will appeal the court's decision.

"The court understood that marriage has a meaning, and that unless you redefine marriage all the arguments the other side have made are meaningless," said attorney for the Alliance Defense Fund, Glen Lavy.

"While we are disappointed that the Court of Appeal ruled against our families, we are confident that we will prevail and that the California dream will be available to all," said the executive director of Equality California, Geoff Kors.

Despite the ruling, California does allow civil unions along with &lt;a href="w%3AConnecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; is currently the only state in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; which has made same-sex marriages legal.

During the official visit of &lt;a href="Sergey%20Lavrov"&gt;Sergey Lavrov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Minister%20of%20Russia"&gt;Foreign Minister of Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, which was to revive the strained diplomatic relationship between the two countries, an embarrassing mistake was committed by the hosts. When Lavrov was greeted by the entrance to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland"&gt;Polish Foreign Ministry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; building, the courtyard was decorated with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , rather than &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Russia"&gt;Russian flags&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Ministry's employees quickly discovered the mistake and replaced the flags with the right ones, and the Russian part did not express any concern about the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afaux%20pas"&gt;faux pas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

It became, however, one of the top stories in the Polish media that day, prompting extensive ridicule. On the Russian part, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARossiyskaya%20Gazeta"&gt;Rossiyskaya Gazeta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Russia's government newspaper, commented ironically that the discontinuity in contacts between &lt;a href="Warsaw"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Moscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; was so prolonged that the Polish Foreign Ministry apparently forgot what the Russian flag looks like. The gazette also went on to joke about the possible troubles Minister Lavrov might have had distinguishing between Poland's current &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who are identical twins.

While the Russian paper also recalled a similar incident that occurred more than a year ago in &lt;a href="Athens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, where the Russian flag was hung upside down, in Poland an event that was related to was the hanging of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Poland"&gt;Polish flag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on the Polish President's limousine upside down, which made it almost identical to flags of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Monaco"&gt;Monaco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In today's Guardian newspaper, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Blunkett"&gt;David Blunkett&lt;/a&gt;, former British Home Secretary and a leading light in the Labour party, is reported as saying that "The main task for all of us is to make sure that in years to come Iraq is not seen as Blair's legacy". The Daily Mail, of the same date, reports an interview with Blunkett to the same effect.

It is significant that one so close to the Prime Minister should regard Iraq as an episode that would detract from &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;'s reputation in history.

The city of &lt;a href="w%3ABratsk"&gt;Bratsk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIrkutsk%20Oblast"&gt;Irkutsk Oblast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, received a new turbine for its famous 4,500 &lt;a href="w%3AWatt"&gt;megawatt&lt;/a&gt; hydroelectric plant founded in the mid-1950s on the &lt;a href="w%3AAngara"&gt;Angara&lt;/a&gt; river. In future this new unit will cause an efficiency rise up to 255MW for each turbine.

Currently, the Bratsk Power Station operates 18 &lt;a href="w%3Ahydro-turbine"&gt;hydro-turbines&lt;/a&gt;, each with capacity of 250MW, produced by the &lt;a href="w%3ALeningrad%20Metal%20Works"&gt;Leningrad Metal Works&lt;/a&gt; ("LMZ") in the 1960s. The plant is the second level of the Angara Hydroelectric Stations cascade. Since its full commissioning in 1967, the station was the world's single biggest power producer until Canada's &lt;a href="w%3AChurchill%20Falls"&gt;Churchill Falls&lt;/a&gt; in 1971. Annually the station produces 22.6 billion kWh.

The precious 80 tonne cargo was transported to Pulkovo International airport of &lt;a href="w%3ASaint-Petersburg"&gt;Saint-Petersburg&lt;/a&gt; where it was loaded on &lt;a href="w%3AAntonov%20An-124"&gt;Antonov An-124-100&lt;/a&gt; Ruslan to made all the way to Bratsk by air. On October 4, 2006 it landed in the Bratsk airport. In two days the unit 16 replacement arrived to the assemble place on the Angara river.

Sergey Emdin, CEO of IrkutskEnergo &lt;a href="w%3AJoint-stock%20company"&gt;JSC&lt;/a&gt;, noted the press that the Bratsk plant reconstruction project includes not only the economical, but the ecological aspect by reducing &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; emission for 6 million tonnes for the period of 2008-2012.

In 2006 and 2007 the old plant is scheduled to receive two more working wheels - by one for each year respectively, and in 2008 and 2009 another four - by two for each year.

One month ago, the &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20national%20football%20team"&gt;French soccer team&lt;/a&gt; took its revenge over &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; (World cup title holders) but the gap to stay number one remains slim.

Most of this margin is only due to the victory over Brazil in ♡❤Mondial♡❤ quarter finals but any further loss (not expected against Faroë Islands next Wednesday) is enough not to stay in the leading chair.

Both teams are likely to be hoping for a draw as the worst result, which would leave the situation as:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Scotland top of the round-robin group;
BULLET::::- France World #1.

<h1>Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya shot dead</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Russian%20journalist%20Anna%20Politkovskaya%20shot%20dead&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A Russian journalist, &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Politkovskaya"&gt;Anna Politkovskaya&lt;/a&gt;, who received wide acclaim and prominence for her critical coverage of the &lt;a href="w%3AChechen%20war"&gt;Chechen war&lt;/a&gt; and opposition to the Putin administration, was found shot dead at her apartment building in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; today. Coincidentally, October 7 is the birthday of Russian President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;.

Anna Politkovskaya worked for the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANovaya%20Gazeta"&gt;Novaya Gazeta&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper. She rose to fame for her coverage of the human costs of the Chechen conflict and her harsh criticism of the &lt;a href="w%3AKremlin"&gt;Kremlin's&lt;/a&gt; policies on Chechnya. She was also one of the people who went into the Moscow theatre during the &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow%20theater%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;2002 hostage taking&lt;/a&gt; to attempt negotiations, at the behest of the Chechen militants. 

Politkovskaya was found shot dead in an elevator in her apartment block in central Moscow, the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ reports, citing police sources. The ♡❤Interfax♡❤ news agency reports that her body was found by a neighbour and that four cartridges and a handgun were also found in the elevator. Her death has been confirmed by Dmitry Muratov, editor of the ♡❤Novaya Gazeta♡❤ and Moscow prosecutors. 

She was 48 years old and was writing her fourth non-fiction work, ♡❤Putin's Russia♡❤. Her earlier books include ♡❤Under Putin and A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya♡❤ and ♡❤A Small Corner of Hell: Dispatches from Chechnya♡❤. She won several awards for her work on the Chechen conflict. 

Politkovskaya had received threats before. She moved to Vienna for a short time in 2001 after receiving e-mail warnings that a Russian police officer, Sergei Lapin, who she had accused of atrocities, was seeking revenge. In 2005, Lapin was found guilty of crimes against Chechen civilians and sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. 

During the 2004 &lt;a href="w%3ABeslan%20school%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;Beslan school siege&lt;/a&gt;, Politkovskaya was taken ill with suspected food-poisoning. The incident was suspected by some of her colleagues to be a deliberate attempt at poisoning.

President Putin, breaking the two days' silence, vowed Monday 9 October to track down Politkovskaya's killers.

The funeral will be held on Tuesday, 10 October, at 2 p.m., at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

Best-known for directing &lt;a href="w%3ABraveheart"&gt;Braveheart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMel%20Gibson"&gt;Mel Gibson&lt;/a&gt; had trouble with police early in the morning on July 28. While he was stopped for speeding and driving drunk, he is said to have shouted a tirade against Jews.

No transcripts of this interview launched in ABC's &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Morning%20America"&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt; are officially available but, before its broadcast scheduled on October 12 and 13th, some communities wanted to know more about it.

Earlier in the week &lt;a href="w%3ARobin%20Williams"&gt;Robin Williams&lt;/a&gt; emphatized about the positive effect of this story saying he will follow the same alcohol dexintoxication process as Mel.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20State%20Cheetahs"&gt;Free State Cheetahs&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Bulls"&gt;Blue Bulls&lt;/a&gt; will meet next week in the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Currie%20Cup"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACurrie%20Cup"&gt;Currie Cup&lt;/a&gt; final, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s domestic club &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; competition. The Bulls were the first to go through, winning the first semi final against rivals &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Province%20%28rugby%29"&gt;Western Province&lt;/a&gt;, and the Cheetahs won their semi against the &lt;a href="w%3ANatal%20Sharks"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt;.

The Blue Bulls hosted WP at home, at &lt;a href="w%3ALoftus%20Versfeld%20Stadium"&gt;Loftus Versfeld&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APretoria"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt;. The Blue Bulls led WP 20 to nine at half time. The gap was closed to 23-16 in the second half, but the home team eventually ran away with the game, in the end, winning 45 points to 23.

At the second semi-final at &lt;a href="w%3ABloemfontein"&gt;Bloemfontein&lt;/a&gt;, the Cheetahs hosted the Sharks at the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20State%20Stadium"&gt;Free State Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. The Free State were up 17 to nil during the first half. The score was furthered to 24 points, but the Sharks' &lt;a href="w%3AJP%20Pietersen"&gt;JP Pietersen&lt;/a&gt; scored minutes before the half finished to give the Sharks their first points, and the game went onto halftime, Cheetahs leading 24-7. The Cheetahs held onto the game, winning 30-14.

The Cheetahs will host the final next week, being the highest place finalist (first, the Blue Bulls were second). The final will be the third Blue Bulls/Cheetahs affair in a row, and the fifth Blue Bulls appearance in a row.

The trial of three &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;ns began on Monday, October 2 in &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh's&lt;/a&gt; High Court. The three men, Imran Shahid, 29, Mohammed Mushtaq, 27, and Zeeshan Shahid, 29 are charged with "racially aggravated murder" over the killing of a 15-year old schoolboy in 2004.

This follows from the conviction of Zahid Mohammed in 2004 of assault in the same incident. Zahid was jailed for 5 years, and was released from jail on license on Wednesday, subsequently giving evidence in this trial. The accused are said to have been involved in the horrific killing of a 15-year old schoolboy in 2004. Kriss Donald was abducted on 16 March, and then stabbed in the lungs, liver and kidney. He was then covered in gasoline and set on fire. The accused, Imran "Baldy" Shahid, Mohammed "Beck" Mushtaq and Zeeshan "Crazy" Shahid had fled to Pakistan after Kriss' murder, and were arrested there in July last year. They were extradited to &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; on exceptional grounds in October 2005. This despite the lack of an extradition treaty between the two countries.

Mohammed said that he had never seen Kriss before, and confirmed that if he had been Chinese, black or "Asian" he would have been left alone. He said that Kriss and his friend had been chosen because they were white.

When asked by advocate-depute Mark Stewart QC if Kriss had said anything, Mohammed said: "Yes - he said 'I'm only 15. What did I do?' or something like that."

USA went through as 'Americas 4' to Pool A, where they join &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; champions &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3A1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;1995&lt;/a&gt; champions, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The other nation in the pool is &lt;a href="w%3ASamoa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Samoa&lt;/a&gt;, and one other nation that has yet to qualify, which will be either an Oceania or Asian nation. The USA have been to four World Cups in the past, with their best results being in &lt;a href="w%3A1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; and 2003 where they won one fixture in the pool rounds.

Next year's World Cup kicks off on September 7, and the USA will play their first game on September 8, against reigning World Champions England in &lt;a href="w%3ALens%2C%20Pas-de-Calais"&gt;Lens&lt;/a&gt;. Uruguay, although having lost the series against the USA, have one more chance at qualification : the series against the winner of (Africa 2 v Europe 4) to qualify as Repechage 1.

An opposition rally was held, yesterday, in &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, in support of the opposition candidate &lt;a href="w%3AManuel%20Rosales"&gt;Manuel Rosales&lt;/a&gt;. The BBC reports that tens of thousands of opposition supporters gathered in ♡❤Avenida Libertador♡❤. However the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ reports only around 10,000 people at the rally. 

The rally was called "un mojella de avalanche!" (a grand avalanche) by Rosales. The use of Avenida Bolivar and permission to take aerial photos of such rallies was denied by the government, citing "security reasons." There is a planned rally for &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; October 8th in Caracas as well. 

Rosales, the Social Democratic governor of &lt;a href="w%3AZulia"&gt;Zulia&lt;/a&gt; has been singled out by the opposition to be their only candidate. He has been campaigning non-stop around the country to get support for his election in the &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuelan%20presidential%20election%2C%202006"&gt;December 3rd presidential election&lt;/a&gt; against incumbent Chavez who has a significant lead in public opinion polls. Rosales' support is greatest amongst the middle class while Chavez's base is with the working class and poor.

Last Wednesday, October 7, 2006, a Muslim school girl at Jean-Mermoz College in &lt;a href="w%3ALyon"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; was injured by gravel thrown at her by four male classmates who are Muslim, as reported in the regional newspaper ♡❤Le Progrès♡❤. The reason given was for eating during the &lt;a href="w%3ARamadan"&gt;fast of Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;, and thus not observing what is believed by Muslims to be one of the five pillars of Muslim faith. 

According to a leading Jean-Mermoz School official, "it was a simple incident, not premeditated," and commented that the story did not warrant French television coverage. In a ♡❤Le Progrès♡❤ update report dated October 11, 2006, "the sequence of the facts are better known." Allegedly, three students were taken aside by several schoolboys, who exclaimed, "You are eating!" to one of the students in the group, a girl who was eating a sandwich, and who then threw stones (possibly gravel) which "lightly injured the girl in the head." The prosecutor of the Republic of Lyons noted that the word 'Ramadan' had not been uttered during the incident. "It is very necessary to know that the political awareness of these boys is limited," he added. Two of the four alleged perpetrators who did acknowledge these acts were suspended for four days, and the school's 250 students were assembled by the principal shortly after the event "for a solemn reminder of the law." The girl's parents lodged a formal complaint. 

According to the sources, this is not the first time such an act has occurred at the school. The incident has been cause for strong emotions among the French educational community, which is sensitive to issues surrounding France's Muslim community, especially those regarding the treatment of women.

Azzedine Gacci, president of the Regional Council of Muslim Worship (CRCM), stated: "[S]i les faits sont avérés, ils sont inacceptables...")—“...if the facts are proven (to be true), they are unacceptable”. The young girl in question was in her menstruating cycle at the time of the incident. He expressed regret that some Muslim youths do not know that "femmes indisposées" (women in an exceptional state) are exempted by the Koran from observing certain aspects of Ramadan injunctions.

No fewer than three major political demonstrations took place in &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, October 7. In total, more than 20,000 people flooded the streets and squares of the city to express either their dissatisfaction with or support for &lt;a href="w%3AJaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Jarosław Kaczyński's&lt;/a&gt; government, marred by a &lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20corruption"&gt;political corruption scandal&lt;/a&gt; and inability to form stable parliamentary majority.

The leading opposition party, &lt;a href="w%3APlatforma%20Obywatelska"&gt;Platforma Obywatelska&lt;/a&gt;, organized the ♡❤"Blue March"♡❤. According to the police, the march through Warsaw's historic part gathered the most people, about 11,000, who demanded new elections and expressed their discontent with the current government. Polls show over 60% of Poles want early elections, and Platforma is currently in the lead by a sizeable majority.

In response to that, Kaczyński's &lt;a href="w%3APrawo%20i%20Sprawiedliwo%C5%9B%C4%87"&gt;Prawo i Sprawiedliwość&lt;/a&gt; held a gathering of 8,000 government supporters in front of the &lt;a href="w%3Asocrealism"&gt;socrealist&lt;/a&gt; landmark &lt;a href="w%3APalace%20of%20Culture%20and%20Science"&gt;Palace of Culture and Science&lt;/a&gt; in the very centre of Warsaw. 

The third demonstration, much smaller in size, was held by junior government coalition partner, the far-right Christian conservative &lt;a href="w%3ALiga%20Polskich%20Rodzin"&gt;Liga Polskich Rodzin&lt;/a&gt;. According to the police about 2,000 people marched through the streets of Warsaw.

&lt;a href="w%3ARenault"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFuji%20Television"&gt;Fuji Television&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Japanese Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ASuzuka%20Circuit"&gt;Suzuka International Racing Course&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; drivers &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; started the race from the first row, Alonso managed to overtake both &lt;a href="w%3AToyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;s on the first part of the race and Massa after the &lt;a href="w%3Apit%20stop"&gt;pit stop&lt;/a&gt;s. Then Alonso started to push on Michael Schumacher and closed the gap to about 5 seconds. An engine failure forced Schumacher to park his car after the tunnel on lap 36 and the Spaniard rushed to his seventh victory in this season. 
&lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt;, Fernando's teammate, had a bad start, but burst through Toyota and finished on the back of the second-placed Filipe Massa. Toyota drivers &lt;a href="w%3AJarno%20Trulli"&gt;Jarno Trulli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARalf%20Schumacher"&gt;Ralf Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; lost even more positions, when &lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20F1"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Button"&gt;Jenson Button&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt; slipped in front of them and finished on 4-th and 5-th place respectively. 
The situation in the drivers' championship became almost critical for Schumacher, who lost 10 points this week-end. Only one chance remains for Schumacher to win his eighth champion's title - if he wins the final &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;2006 Brazilian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; and Alonso doesn't score any points. "I have to say clearly I don't really believe in the championship anymore," was Schumacher's reaction. 
There remains a battle for the third place in drivers' championship, where Massa has a one point lead ahead of Fisichella. In the constructor's championship Renault is 9 points ahead of Ferrari.

Controversy is being expressed over &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper's&lt;/a&gt; decision to skip the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; vote for the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol%23Position%20of%20Canada"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt; Protocol on climate change on Wednesday for a hockey game at the &lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Canada%20Centre"&gt;Air Canada Centre&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto. Liberal MPs say that this reveals Mr. Harper's true attitude toward the environment. "It shows the importance he gives to Kyoto and climate change," said Liberal MP &lt;a href="w%3APablo%20Rodriguez"&gt;Pablo Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt;. "What kind of example does that send to Canadians?"

Harper was with his ten-year-old son Ben cheering on for the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Maple%20Leafs"&gt;Toronto Maple Leafs&lt;/a&gt; and sat in seats in the platinum level of the Air Canada Centre, next to Larry Tanenbaum, head of &lt;a href="w%3AMaple%20Leaf%20Sports%20%26amp%3B%20Entertainment%20Ltd"&gt;Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, the company that owns the Leafs. Also seated with Mr. Tanenbaum was Ontario Premier &lt;a href="w%3ADalton%20McGuinty"&gt;Dalton McGuinty&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, Terri.

"You know I'm dead meat if I make those kind of predictions in hockey," said Harper, who must juggle support from voters in six Canadian &lt;a href="w%3ANHL"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt; cities. "I think Ben will be cheering for the Toronto Maple Leafs," Harper told The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Press"&gt;Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt;. "That's his team."

Harper and his son met with the members of the Toronto team after the game was finished.

Opposition MPs say that "the decision to put pucks over Parliament shows that environmental issues rate as a low priority for Mr. Harper, who had no other reason to be in Toronto the day he attended the NHL season opener between the Maple Leafs and the &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa%20Senators"&gt;Ottawa Senators&lt;/a&gt;."

Members of Parliament and the prime minister are not required to attend votes in the House of Commons and routinely miss them when dealing with other business. If Mr. Harper was there, his vote would not have changed the outcome. 
The PM will be writing a whole book on the history of the game. But demands of his day job have slowed down the project.

&lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Lee%20Curtis"&gt;Jamie Lee Curtis&lt;/a&gt;, 47, has stated that she will end her acting career, but said that she will continue writing.

"I'm not an actor anymore," she told &lt;a href="w%3AAccess%20Hollywood"&gt;Access Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; host &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20O%27Dell"&gt;Nancy O'Dell&lt;/a&gt;. "I really don't imagine I'll do that again." She later said in the conversation, "I'm just focused on my family and just can't imagine anything that's going to pull me away from them right now."

Curtis appeared on the Access Hollywood show to promote her newest children's book, ♡❤Is There a Human Race?♡❤. The interview she participated in with O'Dell will appear on the show's weekend episode.

The picture book writer had this to say about ending her acting career, "No. I don't want to be somebody else anymore."

The last film Curtis starred in was the 2005 film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Kid%20%26amp%3B%20I"&gt;The Kid &amp; I&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

<h1>France to ban smoking in public places</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=France%20to%20ban%20smoking%20in%20public%20places&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; is to ban smoking in all public places in February 2007, the French prime minister, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has announced. However cafés, nightclubs and restaurants will not be required to comply until January 2008. 

An offence would result in a fine of 75 euros for the person(s) responsible and 150 euros for the premises where the offence occurred.

When announcing the new law in a television interview, he stated his reason as being the "public health":

♡❤"We started on the basis of a simple observation - two figures: 60,000 deaths a year in our country linked directly to tobacco consumption and 5,000 deaths linked to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asecondhand%20smoke"&gt;passive smoking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It is an unacceptable reality in our country in terms of public health"♡❤

♡❤Public places♡❤ will include stations, museums, government offices and shops, but not streets or private places such as houses or hotel rooms. He also stated that the country would pay for one-third of the costs of anti-smoking treatments:

♡❤"That would represent the first month of treatment,"♡❤ he said.
♡❤"There are also other solutions, for example the creation of closed, ventilated spaces, where (food and drink) service is not authorised in order to protect employees," he added.♡❤
A BBC survey made in France, a country notorious for its use of tobacco suggests that 70% of the people support the ban. 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's most enthusiastic smokers are found in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , according to findings published in May this year. When the law activates, France will join &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which have passed similar measures. Italy, for example, has very strict measures, such as a minimum fine of 150 euros for smoking in public places with additional charges leveled if the offender was near a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apregnancy"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; woman or a child under 13. Repeat offenders could be fined more than 275 euros, and imprisoned if they continued. In &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the canton of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATicino"&gt;Ticino&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the only canton in the nation to have banned smoking in restaurants. In the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, smoking is banned in NS railway stations.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; has recommended the &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n foreign minister &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; for appointment as the next &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the United Nations. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20General%20Assembly"&gt;UN General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; now has to decide on the appointment. Ban Ki-moon placed ahead of India's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShashi%20Tharoor"&gt;Shashi Tharoor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , currently UN &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnder-Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;Under-Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in informal voting by the Security Council members.

Ban Ki-moon's recommendation will be presented to the UN General Assembly. 

The current Secretary-General, &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, said, in a statement, that he has the "highest respect for Mr. Ban, having had the pleasure of working with him both in his present capacity and when he was Chef de Cabinet to the President of the General Assembly".

Kenzo Oshima, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese Ambassador to the United Nations expressed a hope that the Assembly presidency will act rapidly to elect him.

In the &lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20municipal%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;2006 municipal elections in Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, the political party &lt;a href="w%3AVlaams%20Belang"&gt;Vlaams Belang&lt;/a&gt; ("Flemish Cause") advanced in almost all municipalities, just like the last elections. But its rise was brought to a halt in the cities &lt;a href="w%3AMechelen"&gt;Mechelen&lt;/a&gt; and also in its stronghold &lt;a href="w%3AAntwerp"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt;.

Vlaams Belang is considered by observers and opponents as a &lt;a href="w%3Afar%20right"&gt;far right&lt;/a&gt; party, supporting &lt;a href="w%3AFlanders"&gt;Flemish&lt;/a&gt; independence from &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and restricted &lt;a href="w%3Aimmigration"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt;. 

Just one week before the elections, Antwerp was the scene of the &lt;a href="w%3A0110%20concerts"&gt;0110 concerts&lt;/a&gt;, organised against &lt;a href="w%3Aracism"&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aextremism"&gt;extremism&lt;/a&gt; and gratuitous &lt;a href="w%3Aviolence"&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;. The event was spurred by a series of acts of "&lt;a href="w%3APointless%20Violence"&gt;pointless violence&lt;/a&gt;" during the last year (the murder of &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Van%20Holsbeeck"&gt;Joe Van Holsbeeck&lt;/a&gt;, the case &lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Van%20Themsche"&gt;Hans Van Themsche&lt;/a&gt; and the events surrounding &lt;a href="w%3AGuido%20Demoor"&gt;Guido Demoor&lt;/a&gt;. However, Vlaams Belang asked many musicians to boycott the event, because it "only targets Vlaams Belang". The party considered the concerts as a direct attack by the political establishment. Since 1989, the other parties have instituted a &lt;a href="w%3Acordon%20sanitaire"&gt;cordon sanitaire&lt;/a&gt; against Vlaams Belang, forcing them into the &lt;a href="w%3AOpposition%20%28politics%29"&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt;, notwithstanding their increasing electorial success. 
In 2004, three organisations that were at the heart of the Vlaams Blok party were condemned for incitement to hate and discrimination, and the party reformed consequently and changed their name to Vlaams Belang, although the party top remained unchanged.

During the last poll in 2000, Vlaams Belang became the largest political fraction in Antwerp, with 33% of votes. However, the other parties, calling themselves the "democratic parties", adhering to the cordon sanitaire, joined together to prevent Vlaams Belang from entering into power. 

On Sunday, the political &lt;a href="w%3ACartel"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASP.A-Spirit"&gt;SP.A-Spirit&lt;/a&gt; obtained 35,5% of votes in Antwerp, which was 15,5% more than in the 2000 elections, while the cartel Vlaams Belang - &lt;a href="w%3AVLOTT"&gt;VLOTT&lt;/a&gt; got 33,5% of votes. Before the elections, Vlaams Belang had set the target for Antwerp at 35% of the votes.

The electorial success of SP.A-Spirit was accompanied by a loss of votes for the coalition partners in Antwerp. &lt;a href="w%3AFilip%20Dewinter"&gt;Filip Dewinter&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Vlaams Belang, called SP.A leader and mayor of Antwerp &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Janssens"&gt;Patrick Janssens&lt;/a&gt; a cannibal, because his party seemed to have consumed the other members of the majority. Patrick Janssens received 71 289 personal votes (71% of the party's total), while Dewinter, last year's champion of personal votes in Antwerp, got 62 642 votes on his name.

In many countryside towns, Vlaams Belang participated in the elections for the first time, and immediately scored around 10%. In &lt;a href="w%3ASchoten"&gt;Schoten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALier"&gt;Lier&lt;/a&gt; (both not far from Antwerp) and other places, Vlaams Belang became the largest fraction, and the question remains if the cordon sanitaire will be upheld in these communes.

On Monday, October 9, 2006, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google Inc.&lt;/a&gt; announced its decision to purchase &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, the popular video-sharing site, for $1.65 billion in stock. Following the closure of the deal, YouTube will operate independently, "to preserve" its user community and its brand, the announcement said.

&lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Schmidt"&gt;Eric Schmidt&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Google stated "The YouTube team has built an exciting and powerful media platform that complements Google's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our companies share similar values; we both always put our users first and are committed to innovating to improve their experience. Together, we are natural partners to offer a compelling media entertainment service to users, content owners and advertisers."

"We are excited to have the resources to move faster than ever before," co-founder &lt;a href="w%3AChad%20Hurley"&gt;Chad Hurley&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube's 29-year-old CEO, told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; during a Monday interview.

100 million videos are watched on the YouTube's flash based site every day, including professional movie and TV clips and music videos, as well as amateur content.

The &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;n women's soccer team has pulled out of the inaugural 2006 Peace Queen Cup Korea women's soccer Cup to be held later this month.

Seven teams — the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; — and not eight will compete in the first edition of the tournament to be held in six South Korean cities.

According to an organising committee official, the organising committee was informed by a representative of the North Korean team - a South Korean businessman on Monday that the "complex situation" would make it difficult for North Korea to participate.

Huh Kyung-rak, organising committee official, suggested that North Korea's nuclear test had led to the decision, adding "We decided to find a substitute team. The decision reflects our concerns that the safety of North Korean players will not be guaranteed under these circumstances."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Pablo%20Montoya"&gt;Juan Pablo Montoya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who retired from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFormula%20One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; before the 2006 French Grand Prix, drove his first laps in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANASCAR"&gt;NASCAR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stockcar yesterday owned by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChip%20Ganassi"&gt;Chip Ganassi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; whom he is to race for in the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup season.

The test occurred at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATalladega%20Superspeedway"&gt;Talladega Super Speedway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where on Saturday he competed in an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAutomobile%20Racing%20Club%20of%20America"&gt;ARCA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; race in which he finished third.

The Monday test also allowed NASCAR to test the COT ("Car of Tomorrow") which will be raced next year in select events.

Montoya was the 1999 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChamp%20Car"&gt;CART&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; FedEx Championship Series champion. In 2000 he won the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndianapolis%20500"&gt;Indianapolis 500&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arookie"&gt;rookie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; driving for the same Chip Ganassi Team.

Gordon Brown, &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt;, announced today that an &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20in%20Council"&gt;Order in Council&lt;/a&gt; will be made tomorrow empowering the British &lt;a href="w%3ATreasury"&gt;Treasury&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the funding of those suspected of planning terror. Use will be made of &lt;a href="w%3Aforensic%20accounting"&gt;forensic accounting&lt;/a&gt; and of methods similar to those employed by the code breakers at &lt;a href="w%3ABletchley%20Park"&gt;Bletchley Park&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of computing power to discover relations between bits of information, they cracked the German &lt;a href="w%3AEnigma%20code"&gt;Enigma code&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="w%3AWWII"&gt;WWII&lt;/a&gt;. Gordon Brown ranks the impact of forensic accounting at the present time with the use of &lt;a href="w%3Afingerprinting"&gt;fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century and of &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; in the late 20th Century.

Speaking to &lt;a href="w%3AChatham%20House"&gt;Chatham House&lt;/a&gt;, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, Brown defined the most dangerous sources of finance for terrorists as being &lt;a href="w%3Acharities"&gt;charities&lt;/a&gt;, money service businesses and financial transactions such as &lt;a href="w%3Abureaux%20de%20change"&gt;bureaux de change&lt;/a&gt;, cheque cashers and money remitters. There will be a new licensing system requiring firms to keep more detailed records of transactions. Tougher action against non-compliance is promised. New proposals about &lt;a href="w%3Amoney%20laundering"&gt;money laundering&lt;/a&gt; are being prepared. 

The new Order will empower the Treasury, for the first time, to use ♡❤closed source evidence♡❤ from &lt;a href="w%3Aclassified%20intelligence"&gt;classified intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to freeze the assets of suspects. A ♡❤special advocate procedure♡❤ will be put in place to ensure "fair and consistent hearing of cases". If evidence shows it to be necessary, it is Brown's opinion that suspects should be held, without a charge being brought, for more than the present 28 days. 

The Government has been defeated once already in &lt;a href="w%3AParliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt, in the &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorism%20Act%202006"&gt;Terrorism Act 2006&lt;/a&gt;, to increase the present 28 days of detention without charge to 90 days. Public opinion was very divided on that proposal and feelings in Parliament ran high with talk of a &lt;a href="w%3Apolice%20state"&gt;police state&lt;/a&gt; and of the Government pandering to public opinion.

&lt;a href="w%3ABarbra%20Streisand"&gt;Barbra Streisand&lt;/a&gt; was heckled during a concert on Monday night in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href="w%3AMadison%20Square%20Garden"&gt;Madison Square Garden&lt;/a&gt; after doing a comedy sketch, impersonating the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; portraying him as a "bumbling idiot."

Some of the audience members did not like her sketch and began to heckle the singer, causing Streisand to ask "Come on, be polite!" during her sketch.

One audience member refused to stop and Streisand told him off.

"Shut the fuck up! Shut up if you can't take a joke!" said Streisand.

The heckler was then asked to leave the concert. There is no word on who the heckler was.

Streisand is currently making her first 16 city tour after nearly 12 years.

An &lt;a href="w%3AAmber%20alert"&gt;amber alert&lt;/a&gt; has been cancelled after an eight-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AInwood%2C%20Manhattan"&gt;Inwood&lt;/a&gt; boy was found unharmed after a car theft-turned-kidnapping ended on &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island"&gt;Long Island&lt;/a&gt;.

According to various local sources, Belkis Gonzales left her sleeping child, Jay Polanco, in her &lt;a href="w%3A%20Sport%20utility%20vehicle"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; while she entered a store at Sherman Avenue near 204 Street. The vehicle was then stolen with the boy still inside.

Residents in the area kept their eyes open and &lt;a href="w%3ANYPD"&gt;NYPD&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the scene quickly.

According to news reports, the vehicle was traveling along the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20State%20Parkway"&gt;Northern State Parkway&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AWestbury%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Westbury&lt;/a&gt; when one of its tires went flat. A good Samaritan, Thomas Knabbe, pulled over to assist and became suspicious when he discovered that the driver, a white female, spoke only English, while the child spoke only Spanish.

When the Knabbe pulled up to Nassau County's 6 Precinct, the driver fled. Polanco was handed over to the police, and was reunited with a much relieved Gonzales in Manhattan.

The thief-turned-kidnapper, still not identified, was apprehended approximately an hour after fleeing the scene. According to reports, she appeared to be intoxicated when she was arrested by &lt;a href="w%3ANassau%20County%20Police%20Department"&gt;NCPD&lt;/a&gt;.

The skeletal remains of a giant &lt;a href="w%3Acamel"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt; were discovered in a &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; desert. The fossils are estimated to have come from a camel that died about 100,000 years ago.

The bones were unearthed at &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Hemel"&gt;al-Hemel&lt;/a&gt;, Syria, about 155 miles northeast of &lt;a href="w%3ADamascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;, by an archaeological team made up of both Swiss and Syrian people.

Apparently the &lt;a href="w%3APalmyra"&gt;Palmyra&lt;/a&gt; region of the Syrian desert "is the first origin of the camel," said Bassam Jammous, director general of the Antiquities and Museum Department.

A scientific name has not yet been agreed upon, but the joint Swiss-Syrian team has dubbed it the "&lt;a href="w%3ASyrian%20Camel"&gt;Syrian Camel&lt;/a&gt;".
Jammous stated that the animal is thought to have been around 13 feet tall, twice that of an average-size modern day camel.

Some &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; bones were discovered nearby in 2005, while stone tools were found along with the camel bones recently.

Evidence from the fossils make it appear that they were not bred by humans, but this cannot be certain.
