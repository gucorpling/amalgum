At around 10:30 am on September 30 Chinese soldiers opened fire on people crossing from Tibet to Nepal killing at least two. Mountaineers and &lt;a href="w%3ASherpa%20people"&gt;Sherpas&lt;/a&gt; in Nepal witnessed the event. 

There has been no official Chinese comment on the event.

About 70 refugees were crossing the Nangpa Pass seeking a religious education in Nepal. 

Kelsan Namtso, a 17 year old nun leading the children, and a 13 year old boy were killed. British climber Steve Lawes said that he saw a body being left there 28 hours before it was collected.

The Blunkett diaries, being serialised in the Guardian, claim that Gordon Brown opposed the war against Iraq. Only at the last minute did he give in, according to the diaries, when he realised that Blair would sack him otherwise. 

Gordon Brown, interviewed by the Guardian, said he did not think Blunkett had ever said such a thing and that, if he was reported as having done so, he was being misquoted. 

The diary entries are contemporary with the events and were recorded shortly after the Cabinet meeting on Iraq.

Two trains have collided head-on in eastern &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AZoufftgen"&gt;Zoufftgen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AMoselle"&gt;Moselle&lt;/a&gt; region of France, close to the &lt;a href="Luxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; border, at around 11:45 local time (09:45 UTC) earlier today. Based on inital reports, BBC News has suggested 10 passenger deaths as well as the those of two train drivers involved in the incident and a track side worker. French officials later confirmed at least 5 dead.

The trains were a french freight train and a ♡❤Luxembourgeois♡❤ passenger train. The passenger train was travelling from &lt;a href="w%3ALuxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ANancy"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; and the freight train was travelling from &lt;a href="w%3AThionville"&gt;Thionville&lt;/a&gt; to Luxembourg. 

There are also at present 20 additional casualties although this number could rise. BBC News has reported, some of the injured may still be trapped in wreckage. Rescuers from France and Luxembourg are at the scene, with BBC reporting that a mobile hospital as well as specialist equipment was on the way.

The cause of the crash is undetermined at present, but due to engineering works, single line working was in operation on the route affected. The trains collided head-on. An &lt;a href="w%3ASNCF"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt; spokesman was quoted as saying "Due of the engineering works, only one way was available and train traffic was alternating" He continued, "For reasons still to be established, the trains found themselves facing each other".

French Prime Minister &lt;a href="Dominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; and Transport Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADominique%20Perben"&gt;Dominique Perben&lt;/a&gt; are understood to be on their way to the scene of the incident.

Eric Soupa, a local official was quoted (BBC News) on French radio: "We are faced with an important and dramatic situation."
According to first reports, the spokesman of SNCF has indicated that the driver of the freight train did not "pass a signal at red" and had actually passed the signal at green.

North Korea said today that; "If the U.S. keeps pestering us and increases pressure, we will regard it as a declaration of war and will take a series of physical corresponding measures."

Scientists now think they know how fast &lt;a href="w%3Adark%20matter"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt; would fall if it were dropped on other dark matter. Like the dark matter version of &lt;a href="w%3AGalileo%20Galilei"&gt;Galileo&lt;/a&gt;'s experiment of dropping items to the ground from the &lt;a href="w%3ALeaning%20Tower%20of%20Pisa"&gt;tower of Pisa&lt;/a&gt;, theorists from the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;California Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Institute%20for%20Theoretical%20Astrophysics"&gt;Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; found that there is no more attractive force associated with dark matter than with normal matter. This finding helps to eliminate other theoretical models created to explain phenomena that required an extra force within dark matter. The results of the work are presented in the September 28th 2006 issue of &lt;a href="w%3APhysical%20Review%20Letters"&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/a&gt;.

Dark matter has long fascinated scientists ever since its effects were detected in the 1970s. It is matter that does not emit or reflect light and so cannot be detected directly, but it is understood to exist from its &lt;a href="w%3AGravitation"&gt;gravitational&lt;/a&gt; effects on visible matter, namely its effect on the speed of stars around galaxies. Scientists still don't know what makes up dark matter. 

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the &lt;a href="w%3ASagittarius%20galaxy"&gt;Sagittarius galaxy&lt;/a&gt;. The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the &lt;a href="w%3AMilky%20Way"&gt;Milky Way&lt;/a&gt;'s dark matter. Just like the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing &lt;a href="w%3Atides"&gt;tides&lt;/a&gt;, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy. The scientists were able to conclude that the dark matter affect other dark matter in the same way regular matter does. Kesden and Kamionkowski, the co-author from the California Institute of Technology, tried more than one distribution of the dark matter but found the current theory fits best with the data. This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of lots of small particles.

The prediction that there may be an extra force associated with dark matter appeared in part to explain strange phenomena in the universe. One such phenomenon is the universal structure of galaxies. Galaxies tend to clump themselves together, with voids in between. Computer simulations showed that these voids contained dark matter. It had been theorized that this occurred because there was an extra force in dark matter clumping it together. Kesden mentions that these structures may be caused by other forces that affect only regular matter, like &lt;a href="w%3Aelectricity"&gt;electricity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Amagnetism"&gt;magnetism&lt;/a&gt;, but not dark matter. These forces would clump normal matter together and not affect the dark matter. They now conclude that the force is not gravitational.

Scientists, such as Glennys Farrar, a theoretical physicist at &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20University"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt;, who examined the paper's arguments, said that the researchers made too many assumptions about their simulated dark matter. Kamionskowski responded with, "We know pretty well where the dark matter is in the Milky Way." Therefore they could extrapolate that for other galaxies. However, he continued to mention that other scientists might want a more detailed comparison of the simulation with the data. Kesden states that there will always be doubters. He says a researcher then has to think, "What kind of tricks can you play to hide such an [extra force]? So it's a game. You have to be sneaky to rule everything out." As far as his game goes, "Ours was just for a typical scenario, assuming there wasn't a conspiracy to hide the force."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%2C%20Switzerland"&gt;Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Yesterday (October 10, 2006) a bomb scare occurred in Geneva. More than 30,000 people were evacuated from the main station Cornavin and the Globus Department store. By 20:00 Swiss Time (18:00 UTC) the alert was called off. Over 40 trains were cancelled and the scare caused mass havoc in the centre of Geneva.

♡❤"Ce message s'addresse aux forces de Police: deux bombes ont été posées à deux endroits stratégiques. Une, à Cornavin et une au centre commerciale Globus. Nos demandes sont...♡❤ 

♡❤"This message is addressed to the Police Forces: two bombs have been placed at two strategic positions. One at Cornavin [Geneva's main station] and one at the Globus shopping centre. Our demands are as follows...' ♡❤ The line then cut off. 

That was the message received by the alert centre of the Police at 17:12 Swiss time (15:12 UTC), causing a massive evacuation. An anonymous caller called 117, (the Police number in Switzerland). At 18:00 Swiss time (16:00 UTC) in the middle of rush hour, railway police began asking people to leave the main station building [Cornavin]. In a matter of minutes the entire station was empty. All trains were stopped at Lausanne, or had they already by-passed the station, they were to halt at the nearest station ahead of them. 

These halts caused the stranding of more than 30,000 passengers. All trams were stopped causing major traffic jams. There were similar happenings in the Globus department store where staff and shoppers were evacuated without hassle. As no bomb was found in the store, the ♡❤Police Line♡❤ bands were removed at 19:23 Swiss Time (17:23 UTC). However, the search continued in the bigger Cornavin station, but shortly after 20:00 Swis Time (18.00 UTC) the danger in the station was decided to be non-existent. 

Christophe Zawadaski, spokesperson for the police, explained that the search took a long time because the bomb-sniffing dogs found a suspicious bag in a train. But "luckily there was no bomb inside" he said.
The first train left again at 20:45 Swiss Time (18:45 UTC).

The &lt;a href="w%3ASBB-CFF-FFS"&gt;SBB-CFF-FFS&lt;/a&gt; (The Swiss Federal Railway company) say around 40 trains were cancelled. Police say there are no links between this event and the alert of a possible attack on the UN building last week, which was leaked to the press, and was meant to be a top-secret document. Geneva police have not yet made an arrest following this false alert. But, if whoever caused this panic is caught, Swiss penal code decrees anyone accused of a fallacious tip-off is liable to three years in prison.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=India%27s%20Kiran%20Desai%20wins%20Booker%20Prize%20for%20%26quot%3BThe%20Inheritance%20of%20Loss%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AMan%20Booker%20Prize"&gt;Man Booker Prize&lt;/a&gt; was awarded to &lt;a href="w%3AKiran%20Desai"&gt;Kiran Desai&lt;/a&gt;, for her fictional work ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Inheritance%20of%20Loss"&gt;The Inheritance of Loss&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The 35-year-old is the youngest woman, and the third Indian, to win the £ 50,000 award. After two hours of deliberation, Hermione Lee, (chairwoman of the judges) announced that the panel had chosen Desai's second novel over the other shortlisted entries- ♡❤In the Country of Men♡❤ by &lt;a href="w%3AHisham%20Matar"&gt;Hisham Matar&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤The Secret River♡❤ by &lt;a href="w%3AKate%20Grenville"&gt;Kate Grenville&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤Carry Me Dow♡❤ by &lt;a href="w%3AM.%20J.%20Hyland"&gt;M. J. Hyland&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤Mother's Milk♡❤ by &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20St%20Aubyn"&gt;Edward St Aubyn&lt;/a&gt; and ♡❤The Night Watch♡❤ by &lt;a href="w%3ASarah%20Waters"&gt;Sarah Waters&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This is a magnificent novel of humane breadth and wisdom, comic tenderness and powerful political acuteness.", Lee said, adding that the judges had "felt strongly about" and "admired" all the entries, and that ♡❤The Inheritance of Loss♡❤ was not a "compromise" choice. While accepting the award, Desai said, "I didn't expect to win. I don't have a speech. My mother told me I must wear a sari... a family heirloom, but it's completely transparent!" After expressing her gratitude to her publisher, editor and agent, she added, "I'm Indian and so I'm going to thank my parents."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Kiran Desai's mother &lt;a href="w%3AAnita%20Desai"&gt;Anita Desai&lt;/a&gt; is also an author, and three of her works have been shortlisted for the prize. 

♡❤The Inheritance of Loss♡❤ deals with issues such as globalisation, and life in rural India. The book, set in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AHimalayas"&gt;Himalayas&lt;/a&gt;, deals with an embittered judge and his desire to enjoy a peaceful retired life.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was very conscious of the emotional territory that I wanted to capture, in terms of the story, I didn't know at all what it was going to be, I think I wrote in every direction - the story of immigrants in New York, my parents, my grandparents, my journey. But yes, I was aware of the certain sort of emotional landscape, darkness, worry and fear that this journey between East and West causes.", said Kiran Desai of her work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Booker Prize was founded in 1969 and is considered one of the most prestigious honour given to authors whose works have been published in &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20of%20Nations"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt;. The honour was renamed the Man-Booker Prize after the Man Group began sponsoring it.

Amateur footage of members of the &lt;a href="w%3ADanish%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Danish People's Party&lt;/a&gt; drawing cartoons of &lt;a href="w%3AProphet%20Mohammed"&gt;Prophet Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; were aired on &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; Television last week, prompting protests by Muslim groups. 

The footage shows party youth members in a competition to draw cartoons, during a summer camp in August. 

There have been protests in &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, also by Muslim groups in many parts of the world.

Iran lodged a protest over the issue, saying it was "deplorable that the extremist elements in Danish society have attempted to sabotage Denmark's relations with the Islamic countries once again".

Danish Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAnders%20Fogh%20Rasmussen"&gt;Anders Fogh Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt; called the drawings "tasteless" and "unacceptable", but insisted that he cannot control content shown in the media. 

Two youths featured in the film have gone into hiding.

In 2005 there was also trouble over Danish cartoons of Mohammed.

A small aircraft struck an apartment building in New York this afternoon, killing the pilot and a flight instructor. &lt;a href="w%3ACory%20Lidle"&gt;Cory Lidle&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Apitcher"&gt;pitcher&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Yankees"&gt;New York Yankees&lt;/a&gt; baseball team, was the registered owner of the aircraft and is believed to have been piloting it; his passport was found on the scene. The flight instructor was Tyler Stanger.

The plane, a &lt;a href="w%3ACirrus%20SR20"&gt;Cirrus SR20&lt;/a&gt; with registration number N929CD, hit the 26th floor of the &lt;a href="w%3ABelaire%20Apartments"&gt;Belaire Condominium&lt;/a&gt;, a 50 story brick luxury residential building on the &lt;a href="w%3AUpper%20East%20Side"&gt;Upper East Side&lt;/a&gt; at 524 East 72nd Street at York Avenue near the East River in &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, of which the first 20 floors are a hospital. An eyewitness, present half a block from the building, reported that the plane hit the building, creating an enormous fireball, broke in two and crashed down onto on the street below. Authorities received a 911 call reporting a crash at 2:42 p.m. Eastern time.

New York City mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; gave a press conference at approximately 5:20 p.m. Eastern time to report that the plane was occupied by a flight instructor and a student pilot, but as next-of-kin had not been able to be notified, the identities of the two people on the plane would not be released at this time. 

Apartments were seen to be engulfed in flames. The FBI has stated that it was not an intentional attack. The New York area was grey and overcast during the time at crash; however, visibility was not hampered.

After an hour and a half, the fire was extinguished by the FDNY. According to CNN Television ten people have been injured, six of them firefighters. The New York Times, however, reports that eleven firefighters have been injured.

Initial reports suggested that a &lt;a href="w%3Ahelicopter"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; was involved, but the &lt;a href="w%3AFAA"&gt;FAA&lt;/a&gt; has stated that it was a fixed-wing aircraft. CNN Television reported that it was a single-engine fixed-wing plane which left &lt;a href="w%3ATeterboro%20Airport"&gt;Teterboro Airport&lt;/a&gt;, a busy General Aviation airport in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, circled the &lt;a href="w%3AStatue%20of%20Liberty"&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; was tracked on radar until it was lost near the &lt;a href="w%3A59th%20Street%20Bridge"&gt;59th Street Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, that the plane may have been having fuel problems or fuel pump problems, and that it was "a pilot in distress." 

Wallace Sines, a source for CNN stated he believes the plane was a Cirrus SR-20 with an &lt;a href="w%3ACirrus%20Aircraft%20Parachute%20System"&gt;installed parachute&lt;/a&gt;, which did not deploy. The whole-plane parachute system may have saved the lives of the aircraft occupants had it been safely deployed clear of buildings, but the system is not designed to prevent the trauma associated with a plane impacting a builing. The Cirrus SR-20 was introduced in 2001 and the Cirrus line of 4-seater aircraft has since become one of the most purchased single engine aircraft in the world. The SR-20 does not normally carry an airline-style flight-data recorder, but some are equipped with GPS equipment which logs flight direction, speed and altitude.

The aircraft was owned by baseball player &lt;a href="w%3ACory%20Lidle"&gt;Cory Lidle&lt;/a&gt;. He was on board reported by AP. Lidle was killed, according to reports. CNN Television reported that the FBI stated he was at the controls as the only occupant of the plane, and that his passport was found on the ground below the accident.

<h3>Response</h3>

A little over an hour and a half after the crash, the fire was extinguished after 39 fire units and over 100 fire fighters responded.

The White House has said that there has been no change in the &lt;a href="w%3ATerror%20alert%20system"&gt;terror threat alert level&lt;/a&gt; and that President Bush is being updated constantly.

La Guardia airport was temporarily restricted to no take offs from other airports, however by 4:10 Eastern Time, CNN Television reported that all New York-area airports were open.

CNN Television announced at 3:50 p.m. Eastern Time that as of a few minutes earlier, &lt;a href="w%3ANORAD"&gt;NORAD&lt;/a&gt; is putting fighter aircraft on patrol over certain major American cities as a precautionary measure similar to the actions taken after the 9/11 attacks as a "just in case" measure. It also reported that tomorrow is the 6th anniversary of the attack on the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Cole"&gt;USS Cole&lt;/a&gt; in Aden, Yemen.

Moments after the crash, there was a drop in the New York Stock Exchange, however it quickly returned to normal after it was reported that the crash was an accident.

The New York Yankees organization confirmed the plane is registered to Cory Lidle of the New York Yankees, who was planning to fly from New York to Florida, and that some unnamed member of the Yankees organization was on the plane.

<h3>Eyewitness accounts</h3>

One eye-witness interviewed by the BBC stated: "I was wondering why the plane was doing acrobatics and then the next thing I knew was that it had crashed into the building."
She also added that the plane was a small, white, 4-seater winged aircraft and not a helicopter as many news agencies were reporting it to be.

CNN Television broadcast reports from eyewitnesses who reported:
<ul>
BULLET::::- A pilot who saw the impact stated, "It looked like a pilot who was desperately trying to get to an airport."
BULLET::::- Another eyewitness who saw the event from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, also referred to the incident as appearing as if the plane was "desperately trying to get to LaGuardia" and that as to whether he "clipped" the building, or struck it directly, that "he hit it dead on."
BULLET::::- "I heard a buzzing noise and then an explosion which looked like a mushroom cloud."

New Orleans-based band Imagination Movers have announced that they will be shooting a pilot for the &lt;a href="w%3ADisney%20Channel"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/a&gt; this December.

The band reached a deal with Disney this April to distribute their music through Disney Records, after a year of negotiations. The series is set to debut on &lt;a href="w%3APlayhouse%20Disney"&gt;Playhouse Disney&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. Since September, their music videos have been on rotation on &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Disney%20Channel"&gt;The Disney Channel&lt;/a&gt;.

Nancy Kanter, the senior vice president of programming for Playhouse Disney, first discovered the movers at the Kids Tent of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. "We sat in the hot Kids Tent and were just blown away to see the response to them. We'd heard their CDs, but when you actually sit there with a couple hundred preschoolers and, in some cases, older kids, and see the way they react to the music, we thought, 'This is for us.'"

The Movers launched Playhouse Disney's concert series, playing at &lt;a href="w%3AMGM%20Studios"&gt;MGM Studios&lt;/a&gt;' ABC Theater from 18-24 September. The band is playing a &lt;a href="w%3AHalloween"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt; concert on 21 August 2006, in New Orleans.

Imagination Movers are a kids band formed in 2003. Indie Kids Rock reviewed the group in May, saying they were "the U2 of kids music with a big anthemic pop/rock sound, catchy lyrics, &amp; of course, imagination." The group includes Rich Collins, Scott Durbin, Dave Poche and Scott "Smitty" Smith. While all four members had at least "dabbled" in music, Durbin was a computer instructor, Collins worked in online journalism, Poche as an architect, Smith as a firefighter.

Adam Gadahn, formerly Adam Pearlman, is the first US citizen to be charged with &lt;a href="w%3Atreason"&gt;treason&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href="w%3AWWII"&gt;WWII&lt;/a&gt;. The State Department has offered a reward of $1 million for his capture.

Gadahn, 28, has allegedly appeared in multiple videos supporting &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaida"&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;. He is not in US custody and is assumed to be living in &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Treason is the only crime specifically defined in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;United States Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. The penalities, if convicted, range from death to 5 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

Canadian Liberal Leadership frontrunner &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt; refused to attend a debate with all three frontrunners in Toronto, on Tuesday. Instead, &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt;, second place to Ignatieff in Leadership race, &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; attended.

Ignatieff was invited to attend but refused to participate in the event. His spokeswoman described it as "arbitrarily restricted to perceived 'front-runners. She said Mr. Ignatieff wanted all eight candidates to be present.

"We were approached several months ago by the Canadian Club-Empire Club to participate in a debate that was only to include Stéphane Dion, Bob Rae and Michael," said the Ignatieff statement. "We advised the organizers that we are not prepared to participate in a debate that was arbitrarily restricted to the perceived 'frontrunners'."

The leadership campaigns were notified several months ago the event was being planned, with advice sought on scheduling for after the "Super Weekend."

Ignatieff also offered to speak alone, but it did not happen.

"His camp would say participating in a debate where invitations are not extended to all the candidates would be doing a disservice and would be rude to the other (four) candidates," said Liberal strategist Scott Reid. "That's smart because he wants to flatter people whose support he would require for a later ballot." However, Reid said other camps would suggest that Ignatieff is avoiding a mix-up with the three contenders with the best chances of supplanting him at the November 28 to December 3rd convention in Montreal.

Ignatieff's name was only mentioned once in the whole debate. Mr. Rae, who spoke of Canada's perennial national unity difficulties as requiring practical, constructive solutions rather than "abstract, theoretical discussions to resolve the constitutional riddle," an allusion to Mr. Ignatieff's proposal to reopen the Constitution debate and have the province of &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; recognised as a nation within Canada.

"Trying to build support, build momentum on later ballots that's really where this campaign is being fought now," said ♡❤CTV's♡❤ Roger Smith.

The party's final formal debate in Toronto on October 15 is the big chance for Ignatieff to get more supporters.

<h3>Kenyan couple caught having sex in mosque</h3>

A couple was caught copulating in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amosque"&gt;mosque&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARamadan"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Gilgil, &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;. They were discovered when a worshipper learned of "strange noises" coming out of a dark corner of the mosques. John King'ori, a senior magistrate said, "Having sex in a mosque is a most abominable thing to religion."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; users on the Chinese-forums.com website report that the longtime block of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has been at least temporarily lifted. Absent an announcement from the Chinese government, it's unclear what the conditions were that caused the site to be accessible from within China.

A blog by Wikipedia contributor Andrew Lih says that someone in "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; emailed me saying he could suddenly start using Wikipedia again. Some folks in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHubei"&gt;Hubei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said it was still blocked. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShanghai"&gt;Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuangdong"&gt;Guangdong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; users said parts were accessible."

He continued that "from a Beijing China Netcom's residential &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADSL"&gt;DSL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; connection, the English language and other foreign language versions are now accessible, but the Chinese version is still blocked", noting that the Chinese-language version is the most important one to most Wikipedians in the country.

The blog entry goes on to explain the finer points of China's blocking system, which is more complex than most media outlets suggest.

Wikimedia head &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoneycontrol.com"&gt;Moneycontrol.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; yesterday that, "We don't know what they took offense to. We really don't intend to compromise the way Google did. We also feel that the block is an error. I am trying to set up high-level meetings in China to state our case and explain why we should be unblocked. We have no idea what the result of that would be. But we are somewhat hopeful. Wikipedia is not a haven for dissidents but an encyclopedia. About 99.9 percent of Wikipedia has topics that are not of interest to the Chinese Government. There is no political component. We are hopeful that they can see the point."

He also told the outlet, he stressed how such bans were blocking Chinese perspectives in the global media. "[The] Chinese people would like to contribute to Wikipedia to give the Chinese point of view for the entire world to see. And China needs to be better understood by the rest of the world."

The third block of Wikipedia, which was implemented 19 October 2005, was issued without explanation or an expected length. Wikipedia has been blocked twice before, the first from 2-21 June 2004, due to the 15th anniversary of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATiananmen%20Square%20protests%20of%201989"&gt;Tian'anmen Square Incident&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

A website called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abaidu.com"&gt;baidu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; runs a self-censored wiki-based encyclopedia website, called baidubaike.com, launched in April of this year.

Wikipedia is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anon-profit"&gt;non-profit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; organisation based out of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida"&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Its 2007 annual convention, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikimania"&gt;Wikimania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is set to take place in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The accused murderer of &lt;a href="w%3ATokoroa"&gt;Tokoroa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; teacher Lois Dear, Whetu Te Hiko, has appeared at the High Court in Rotorua but was remanded further into custody.

Only written evidence was given while in court.

Dear, 66-years-old, was found murdered in her class at Strathmore School a day before term 3 started, July 16.

Hiko, 23-years-old, was remanded in custody until November 9 when he will be indicted, but it is unsure when the trial date will be set.

While in the dock Hiko, who has pleaded not guilty, hung his head and only showed his back to the crowded public gallery. He occasionally looked up to look at Justice Paul Heath, the residing judge. Heath said that they would not &lt;a href="w%3Aarraign"&gt;arraign&lt;/a&gt; Hiko yet because it is too soon after the depositions hearing.

Kevin McNeil, son of Dear, was also present at the high court. "I am here today for Mum. She would have been here for us. Nearly three months on, the evidence in the murder case was still being withheld, and a lot of it probably will be for some time." He was however confient that justice would be served. While wiping his eyes he added: "It's bloody hard. You have your bad days when the tears come. You never know when it is going to happen."

Hiko was in the Tokoroa District Court just under a month ago for the depositions hearing.

Brother of Hiko, Piri Te Hiko, said to McNeil: "She sounded like a real good lady. She taught a lot of my nieces and nephews."

The two men then shook hands and McNeil said that his family does not hold any animosity at Hiko's family.

Heath has rule that the media cannot publish the written depositions but may read them. The media cannot also view photographs or exhibitions that are evidence. Heath was concerned that it would become an unfair trial.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%26quot%3BCorrupt%26quot%3B%20New%20Zealand%20government%20to%20repay%20%24768%2C000&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party"&gt;New Zealand Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; today joined &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Green%20Party"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AACT%20New%20Zealand"&gt;ACT&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMaori%20Party"&gt;Maori Party&lt;/a&gt; in saying they would pay back the money received from Parliamentary Services that the Auditor-General says was wrongly used for electioneering. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Auditor-General"&gt;Auditor-General&lt;/a&gt; report, tabled today, found $1.17 million of taxpayer-funded parliamentary funding was misspent over all political parties. Labour was found to have overspent $768,000. 

The Prime Minister is adamant the Labour Party did not break any rules, but she is still going to pay back money spent unlawfully in the lead up to the election.

Labour "strongly maintains" that its spending was within the rules as they were understood but given the new ruling it would refund the money.

"Labour has strongly stated its case as was its right...The party welcomes the Auditor-General's findings that inadequate guidance has been available to MPs and parliamentary parties on what constitutes appropriate advertising, particular in the pre-election period." Clark said.

The Government will now follow through with plans to pass retrospective legislation on election spending. Deputy Prime Minister and finance minister, Dr &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Cullen"&gt;Michael Cullen&lt;/a&gt; says legislation will be introduced into Parliament next week to validate spending by parties dating back some years.

He argues the only legal remedy for the breaches identified by the Auditor General is for them to be validated by an act of Parliament.

Meanwhile National Leader Dr &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Brash"&gt;Don Brash&lt;/a&gt; is viewing the Auditor General's report on election overspending as a victory for National.

Dr Brash says it is only public, political and media pressure that is making the Prime Minister repay the money that Labour spent.

He claims she led a dirty campaign punctuated by threats, bullying and diversionary tactics, and he says she is clearly paying the money back with great reluctance.

Dr Brash says the Prime Minister should also apologise to the Auditor General, as she bullied him publicly to try to get him to change his report.

Dr Brash said it had taken a year to persuade Labour to "admit its guilt". 

"I am delighted they have finally done it... after trying every trick known."

Dove soaps continues their North American "Campaign for Real Beauty" advertising with a television commercial that explores the alterations that can be done on models.

Labeled "a Dove film", the commercial is entitled "evolution". Beginning with a woman walking into a photo shoot. From there, she is primped and plucked by hair and makeup artists, then tweaked on a &lt;a href="w%3APhotoshop"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt;-like program. 

The photo-manipulation is then posted on a billboard for the fictional "Easel Foundation Makeup" brand. Two young, teenage girls walk past, glancing at the board.

"No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted" ends the ad in text, "Every girl deserves to feel beautiful just the way she is."

Dove runs the Dove Self-Esteem Fund as a part of their Campaign for Real Beauty. In the marketing campaign, Dove uses "real" women, instead of professional models, in an attempt to instill self-esteem in their customers.

This continuing promotion, launched in 2004, was on the forefront of a current trend in Western culture to abandon the overly idealised images the media portrays of women. Recently some fashion capitals have mandated minimum body mass indexes for runway models. The top rated comedy in the United States and Canada is ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUgly%20Betty"&gt;Ugly Betty&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a series that stars an average girl coping at a fashion magazine. The series is based on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABetty%20la%20Fea"&gt;Betty la Fea&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, an extremely popular Colombian telenovela, which has been reproduced internationally.

Only two percent of women surveyed worldwide consider themselves beautiful, according to ABC ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Morning%20America"&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ co-anchor Robin Roberts, whose program debuted the commercial this morning at 8:07 am EST.

The ad is currently playing on the Campaign for Real Beauty's homepage.

While being interrogated by the &lt;a href="w%3ADelhi%20Police"&gt;Delhi Police&lt;/a&gt; today, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACricket"&gt;cricketer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHerschelle%20Gibbs"&gt;Herschelle Gibbs&lt;/a&gt; admitted that his former captain &lt;a href="w%3AHansie%20Cronje"&gt;Hansie Cronje&lt;/a&gt; asked him to underperform at the Pepsi Cup in 2000. Gibbs also named Derek Crookes among three others who, he said, were involved in the affair. 

"Gibbs had come and the interrogation took place in a manner in which we wanted. The investigation can now move forward," Joint Commissioner of Crime Branch Ranjit Narayan said at a press conference following the two hour long session. 

Gibbs maintained that he did not know whether or not any Indian players were involved in the scandal, although he did reveal that the entire South African team had received an offer in 1996, which they refused. Gibbs also refrained from revealing whether or not he actually accepted any money to underperform, saying only that he was following his late skipper's wishes. Narayan, on his part, indicated that the investigation could now "move forward", following the filling-in of "loopholes and gaps" as a result of today's interrogation. The Delhi Police have also taken samples of Gibbs' voice to compare it with the telephone recordings that they have recovered. The cops also stated that Gibbs had been cooperative, and that he "might be needed again". 

♡❤Transcript of a telephone conversation between (late) South African Captain Hansie Cronje and bookie Sanjay Chawla:♡❤

Hansie Cronje: Ok. I have spoken. Yes, everything is fine. I've spoken to Gibbs, and to Williams and Strydom.

Sanjay Chawla: Already ok. And how many runs for Gibbs?

Hansie Cronje: Less than 20.

Sanjay Chawla: Less than 20?

Hansie Cronje: Ya.

Sanjay Chawla: Ok. So, everything is according to plan. You have to score at least 250.

Hansie Cronje: Ya.

Sanjay Chawla: And if you score 270, then it is off.

Hansie Cronje: Ok. And financially the guys want 25. They want 25 each.

Sanjay Chawla: All guys. Ok.

Hansie Cronje: So, that's 75 for these three. And what can you pay me? I do not know how much you pay me?

Sanjay Chawla: You say.

Hansie Cronje: If you give me... 140 for everybody.

Sanjay Chawla: Ok. 140 all together?

Hansie Cronje: Ya.

Sanjay Chawla: Ok. That's fine. And we will sort something out for the previous ones as well.

Hansie Cronje: All right, we are on.

The office of &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Ford"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; said Thursday that the former United States President was admitted to &lt;a href="w%3AEisenhower%20Medical%20Center"&gt;Eisenhower Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; for tests in &lt;a href="w%3ARancho%20Mirage%2C%20California"&gt;Rancho Mirage, California&lt;/a&gt;.

"President Gerald Ford has been admitted to Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California for medical tests. He is doing well," Ford's spokeswoman Penny Circle said. The statement didn't release any information about the tests.

Ford has been hospitalized twice this year. In January, he was hospitalized to treat pneumonia. In July, he was hospitalized at Colorado's Vail Valley Medical Center due to shortness of breath.

Ford was also hospitalized in August at the &lt;a href="w%3AMayo%20Clinic"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota for heart procedures. Ford received a pacemaker to regulate his heartbeat. Ford also underwent angioplasty to increase blood flow in his arteries. Ford also suffered a small stroke five years ago.

Gerald Ford became the 38th United States President on August 9, 1974 after &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Nixon"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; resigned due to the &lt;a href="w%3AWatergate%20scandal"&gt;Watergate scandal&lt;/a&gt;. At the age of 93, Ford is the oldest living U.S. President and could next month become the longest living U.S. President ever.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Former%20head%20of%20Radio%20Liberty%20Russian%20Broadcasts%20criticizes%20Kremlin%27s%20reaction%20to%20Russian%20journalist%27s%20murder&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Mario Corti, former head of Radio Liberty Russian Service, criticized pro-Kremlin media reporting on the murder of independent Russian journalist &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Politkovskaya"&gt;Anna Politkovskaya&lt;/a&gt; as an insult to the victim. In a commentary in Russian and English posted on FreeMediaOnline.org, Corti took issue with Russian media reports referring to President Putin's assertion that Politkovskaya's murder would benefit Russia's enemies. 

In speaking with journalists in Dresden, Germany, on Tuesday, President Putin downplayed Politkovskaya's importance by saying that "she had minimal influence on political life in Russia" and that her murder caused "much more harm than her publications did." FreeMediaOnline.org reported that pro-government media in Russia interpreted this comment as a signal to journalists that the value of Politkovskaya's reporting and, by implication, the work of other journalists should be measured by how much damage they cause to Russia's reputation.

Corti wrote that Politkovskaya's death was not a blow to Russia's reputation but a blow to those who brought shame to Russia by their "evil deeds." Politkovskaya's reporting exposed numerous murders, cases of torture and other human rights abuses in Chechnya and in other parts of the former Soviet Union. Her reports angered the Russian establishment and she was frequently harassed and detained by Russia's security services.

Corti also wrote that the pro-Kremlin media reaction to Politovskaya's murder has caused many pro-democracy Russians to doubt whether they can still live in Russia. He countered, however, that her death has a greater meaning in showing that the struggle for human rights and for the dignity of all men has always required sacrifices. According to Corti, Politkovskaya loved Russia and wanted it to become a fully democratic country in which people respect each other, a country without torture, and a country in which the dignity of every person takes priority over everything else.

Corti was in charge of Radio Liberty's Russian broadcasts from 1998 to 2003. He now works as an indepenent journalist and is a member of the FreeMediaOnline.org Board of Directors, a California-based nonprofit organization supporting media freedom worldwide.

The Head of the British Armed forces, the &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff"&gt;Chief of the General Staff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARichard%20Dannatt"&gt;General Sir Richard Dannatt&lt;/a&gt;, has told the ♡❤&lt;a href="Daily%20Mail"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that troops are unwelcome in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and that if they are not withdrawn soon, the situation could become catastrophic.

These remarks seem to be in sharp contrast with those of the Prime Minister earlier this year when he said ♡❤"But don't be in any doubt. No-one, but no-one I spoke to [in &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;], from whatever quarter, wanted us to leave precipitately. An arbitrary timetable ie without conditions being right, would be seen for what it would be: weakness."♡❤

General Dannatt told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; Radio 4 Today programme♡❤ this morning that he had to ♡❤"speak up for what is right for the Army"♡❤ but that his remarks to the ♡❤Daily Mail♡❤ ♡❤"were neither substantially new or substantially newsworthy"♡❤. He said that the presence of UK troops ♡❤"exacerbates"♡❤ the problems ♡❤"not right across the country, but only in parts of it"♡❤.

The ♡❤BBC♡❤ reported that ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADowning%20Street"&gt;Downing Street&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ had issued a short statement in response to the general's comments. It said: ♡❤"It's important that people remember that we are in Iraq at the express wish of the democratically elected Iraqi government, to support them under the mandate of a UN resolution."♡❤

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AScotsman"&gt;Scotsman&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ in a ♡❤Key Quote♡❤ highlights the General saying - ♡❤"I think history will show that the planning for what happened after the initial successful war fighting phase was poor, probably based more on optimism than sound planning."♡❤ 

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATimes"&gt;Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ draws attention to Blair's speech at the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20Conference"&gt;Labour Party Conference&lt;/a&gt; just two weeks ago saying why the troops will have to stay in Iraq - ♡❤"If we retreat now, hand Iraq over to &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; and sectarian death squads and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; back to al-Qaeda and the &lt;a href="w%3ATaleban"&gt;Taleban&lt;/a&gt;, we won't be safer; we will be committing a craven act of surrender that will put our future security in the deepest peril."♡❤

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ leads with the story, under a picture of a military &lt;a href="w%3Aambulance"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt; being loaded, with the headline ♡❤UK army chief pleads for Iraq pull out♡❤, and quotes extracts from the General's interview with the ♡❤Daily Mail♡❤ including: ♡❤"We are in a &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; country and Muslims' views of foreigners in their country are quite clear. As a foreigner, you can be welcomed by being invited in a country, but we weren't invited certainly by those in Iraq at the time. ... The military campaign we fought in 2003 effectively kicked the door in. Whatever consent we may have had in the first place, may have turned to tolerance and has largely turned to intolerance. That is a fact. I don't say that the difficulties we are experiencing round the world are caused by our presence in Iraq, but undoubtedly our presence in Iraq exacerbates them."♡❤ The report concludes with a ♡❤snapshot♡❤ of the chaos in Baghdad by reporting an attack by gunmen on a TV station, when 11 staff were killed in the ♡❤biggest attack yet on the media.♡❤

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ carries a report from ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ headed ♡❤‘British Army Chief Who Called for Iraq Withdrawal 'Soon' Denies Rift With Government♡❤♡ in which the General is reported as saying that by 'soon' he meant a phased withdrawal over two or three years. He is reported as saying to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤"We'll probably reduce our soldiers over the course of the next year or two or three -- let's wait and see. That's what I mean by sometime soon,"♡❤. He denied that he was attacking government policy saying to BBC radio ♡❤"We don't do surrender. We don't pull down white flags. We're going to see this through."♡❤

Alongside a photograph of British soldiers rushing to the scene of a &lt;a href="w%3Ahelicopter"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; crash in &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt; May 6 2006, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, commenting on the story, says ♡❤"Dannatt's comments are certain to infuriate Blair, who is &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20Bush"&gt;President Bush's&lt;/a&gt; key ally in the Iraq war. It is highly unusual for a sitting British military commander to publicly criticize the government's foreign policy. ... Britain's involvement in Iraq has proved highly controversial from the outset. Millions protested on the streets in the lead up to the war in 2003, while high profile &lt;a href="w%3Acabinet%20ministers"&gt;cabinet ministers&lt;/a&gt; have quit the government as a result of &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair's&lt;/a&gt; support for the U.S.-led action."♡❤

♡❤BBC News♡❤ quotes Prime Minister Blair as saying that he agrees with ♡❤"every word"♡❤ the General said and that transcripts of later radio interviews showed Sir Richard was saying "the same as we all are". Subsequently, BBC New 24 at 9pm, reported that when Blair said he agreed with ♡❤"every word"♡❤, he was referring to what the General had been saying in radio and TV interviews this morning and not to the original interview reported in the ♡❤Daily Mail♡❤. This cleared up a misunderstanding evidenced in discussions among commentators and in ♡❤Any Questions♡❤ this evening. 

The British Army Rumour Service, ARRSE, which describes itself as ♡❤" THE unofficial British Army community website"♡❤. asks viewers to complete the sentence ♡❤"Sir Richard Dannatt is..."♡❤. As at 18,50 13 October, of the 181 responses, 144 agreed that ♡❤he was absolutely right♡❤ and 26 that he was ♡❤right only from military point of view♡❤. The same site has blogs from troops in theatre.

&lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Malcolm%20Rifkind"&gt;Sir Malcolm Rifkind&lt;/a&gt; M.P., interviewed by &lt;a href="w%3AChannel4%20News"&gt;Channel4 News&lt;/a&gt;, said that he agreed with every word the general said, but deplored the fact that he had said it while still a serving officer. Like &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Servants"&gt;Civil Servants&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href="w%3AArmed%20Forces"&gt;Armed Forces&lt;/a&gt; owed allegiance to the democratically elected government of the day and should not express their personal opinions while still in uniform.

The U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Tony Snow responded to Friday press briefing questions from reporters by saying that General Danatt's comments were taken out of context, referring to back-pedalling clarifications that came later from Danatt. Snow said, [referring to later interviews conducted this morning], that "he says that's not what he said. ... he said that he was misquoted and that "♡❤that particular comment [in the original interview] was actually rather largely taken out of context.♡❤♡'

Two major U.S. media outlets, &lt;a href="w%3AABC"&gt;ABC's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20News%20with%20Charles%20Gibson"&gt;World News with Charles Gibson&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="USA%20Today"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, remained wary and made no news mention of the controversy ignited by the general's remarks until an official British political response emerged.

The story continues in the British press today, October 14, for example, in the ♡❤Scotsman♡❤ which reveals the it was Des Browne, the &lt;a href="w%3ADefence%20Secretary"&gt;Defence Secretary&lt;/a&gt; who ♡❤put pressure♡❤ on the General to clarify his remarks in the series of media events that took place yesterday morning, the content of which the Prime Minister agreed wholeheartedly. However, many retired military personnel and some still on active service, have expressed their support for the General, in the media, including the now widely quoted ♡❤British Army Rumour Service♡❤. Some correspondents are disturbed to think that the military are becoming too involved in politics and that the authority of Parliament might become undermined.

Today, the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20National%20Assembly"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; passed a bill that would penalise what the bill calls &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHistorical%20revisionism%20%28negationism%29"&gt;negationism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArmenian%20Genocide"&gt;Armenian Genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The French government however opposes the bill; Catherine Colonna, Minister charged with European Affairs, reacted that "It's the task, first and foremost, of historians and not of lawmakers to clarify history."

The label "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " is disputed by the &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; government, who has called the vote a "serious blow" to diplomatic relations. Turkey has been known to prosecute Turkish intellectuals who discuss the Armenian genocide, including recent Nobel Prize winner &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrhan%20Pamuk"&gt;Orhan Pamuk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Under the Turkish Penal Code, "prosecution for anti-national plots" faces those who call "for the recognition of the Armenian genocide".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Turkey"&gt;Turkey's Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Recep%20Tayyip%20Erdo%C4%9Fan"&gt;Erdoğan&lt;/a&gt; had warned France to look into its own colonial past in &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; instead of demanding Turkish recognition of the events. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Babacan"&gt;Ali Babacan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Turkish Minister of Economy, in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for talks on Turkey's &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;E.U.&lt;/a&gt;-membership, said he could not exclude that people would start boycotting French products in Turkey. In a recent visit to &lt;a href="Armenia"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20French%20Republic"&gt;French President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; launched the idea that recognition as a "genocide" would be necessary for Turkey to enter the E.U., causing the media to label it as the "Chirac criterion". The European Commission, which has confirmed that such a criterion would not be instituted, deplored the initiative of the French parliament, because it could damage contacts with the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;.

Most historians view the events comprising the Armenian genocide as a state-sponsored plan of mass extermination. Their reasons include various eye witness reports, Turkey's recruitment of violent criminals to posts within the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Organization%20%28Ottoman%20Empire%29"&gt;"Special Organization"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the sheer number of dead, estimates of which remain as high as 1.5 million. Some politically influential countries like the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, and France have driven efforts to interpret these events as an attempt to eradicate an ethnic group. The Turkish government, as well as a few historians, estimate the number of casualties much lower, and attribute them to inter-ethnic strife, disease and famine during &lt;a href="World%20War%20I"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.

Armenia has congratulated France over its "natural response" to an "aggressive" policy of "denial" by the Turkish government. Armenians often argue that Turkey's recognition will help prevent similar events in the future. These assertions include claims that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALudwig%20Maximilian%20Erwin%20von%20Scheubner-Richter"&gt;Scheubner-Richter's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; observations of the Armenian genocide had a formative influence upon &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHitler"&gt;Hitler's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; plans for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJews"&gt;Jews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The French bill provides for a 1-year prison sentence and a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 45,000 fine, the same as for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust%20denial"&gt;Holocaust denial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It must still be approved by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the President, and due to the parliamentary calendar, news sources think it is unlikely that it will be discussed before the end of the legislation period in February 2007.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
&lt;a href="w%3ALake%20effect%20snow"&gt;Lake effect snow&lt;/a&gt; has come early to parts of Western New York prompting a State of Emergency and a flood watch to be issued, especially in Buffalo, New York and its suburbs where nearly 2 feet of snow fell during the afternoon and last night. Snow started to fall at around 12:00 pm &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, October 12, heavy at times, and accompanied by thunder and lightning. Forecasters called the weather event "unprecedented." A driving ban has been issued for &lt;a href="w%3ATonawanda%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Tonawanda, New York&lt;/a&gt;, Buffalo and &lt;a href="w%3AAmherst%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Amherst&lt;/a&gt; where at least "80% of roads in Amherst are impassible." The &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Niagara%20International%20Airport"&gt;Buffalo Niagara International Airport&lt;/a&gt; opened at almost 3:30 p.m. [EST]. The New York State Throughway, or interstate 90 is closed from nearly &lt;a href="w%3ARochester%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Rochester, New York&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ADunkirk%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Dunkirk, New York&lt;/a&gt; which is nearly 110 miles long. Motorists at the &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamsville%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Williamsville, New York&lt;/a&gt; toll barrier are being turned around. A driving ban remains in effect while a state of emergency exists.

Water will be shut off in 24 hours due to the lack of electricity to water pumps in the area and in a press conference, Mayor of Buffalo, Byron Brown issued a "boil water advisory." Brown also said that "70,000 of the 75,000 residents and businesses in Amherst are still without power." Residents are asked to bottle water and prepare for the outage. It is not known when water will be turned back on. At least 30 water intake pumps in Erie County, out of the 50 the county has, have no power. Officials say that businesses and residents could be out of water by 5:00 p.m. [EST].

At least 3 people have been killed due to the storm. Two of those people were killed in a two-car accident in &lt;a href="w%3ALancaster%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Lancaster, New York&lt;/a&gt;, and the other person was in Niagara County and died after being hit by a vehicle. One person was crushed and killed by a falling tree in Amherst, while in the process of removing snow from his property.

Hundreds of trees have snapped in half as the snow began to fall around the city. Many trees, which still have their leaves, have broken into pieces as the heavy, wet snow began to pile up, as much as an inch an hour. Early on Thursday, the airport had received nearly 9 inches (23cm) of snow and climbing. The storm has caused many delays and cancellations in flights leaving from or going to Buffalo.

Nearly 400,000 people in Buffalo and surrounding suburbs are still without power and forecasters at the NOAA are warning people "not to go outside in an area where heavy snow has fallen unless absolutely necessary." Power may not be restored to the affected areas until Sunday and possibly next week in some areas. Damage to trees is extensive with nearly every tree destroyed on Granger Place in Buffalo. 

"This was extremely heavy snow and most of the trees still have most of their leaves ... we can't do a complete damage assessment until the snow stops falling," said spokesman for Niagara Mohawk, Western New York's area power company, Steve Brady.

"At 8 pm [on Thursday], utility companies were reporting over 50,000 customers without power. The reason for the widespread power outages has been the combination of very heavy water laden snow accumulating on the trees that still have most of their leaves. Tree's limbs break under the weight of the snow and bring down power lines as they fall," said a statement on NOAA's website. 

"[This is the] snowiest day in 137 years [of weather records]. Six inches of snow occurred on October 13, 1909 and again on October 31, 1917," added the NOAA weather statement.

Many business and nearly every school in Western New York are still closed due to the weather and the snow is forecasted to move south again over the Buffalo Metropolitan area, but snow amounts are not expected to be significant. Wind is expected to be strong and gusty which could bring down tree limbs which are broken but still attached to the tree. Some areas could se an additional 6 inches of snow by Saturday morning.

The flood watch takes effect at 2:00 p.m. [EST] and continues through Saturday.

The recent &lt;a href="w%3AEscherichia%20coli"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt; outbreak that killed three people and sickened nearly 200 in the United States and Canada has been linked to cattle. The outbreak affected people who ate contaminated bagged spinach. Shortly after the outbreak began, the contaminated spinach had been traced to the &lt;a href="w%3ASalinas%20Valley"&gt;Salinas Valley&lt;/a&gt; region of California. Now, health officials say the contamination came from &lt;a href="w%3Acow%20dung"&gt;cattle manure&lt;/a&gt;.

The infected cattle manure was found on a ranch in Salinas Valley that is adjacent to the field that produced contaminated spinach. How precisely the infection was transported from the ranch to the spinach field is still unknown. Dr. Kevin Reilly of the California Department of Health Services said that "we don't know if wild swine are playing a role or not, but we do know that on this particular ranch, there is a very large population of wild boar, and we have witnessed on this site that they have torn through fencing and under fencing and have the ability to access the field". The bacteria could have been carried by wild animals from the cattle ranch to the spinach field. 

Joan Rose, a microbiologist and food safety expert at &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan%20State%20University"&gt;Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt;, commented that it is not surprising that cattle manure was the source of the infection. "If you start to look at the pathogen levels even in untreated sewage, it's minor compared to animal waste", she said.

Mark Andrew Scott, 39-years-old, and his partner, Vanessa Ada Scott, 27-years-old, both pleaded guilty near the end of the hearing to a charge of aggravated robbery and two charges of kidnapping after June 20 when they tried to rob the bank Mark Scott had been managing for a year.

Mark Scott, former US marine and veteran of the Gulf War, was the manager of the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;BNZ&lt;/a&gt; (Bank of New Zealand) Wellsford bank in Auckland.

During the pre-trial hearing, or more correctly depositions hearing, at North Shore, Auckland's district court, Mark Scott asked about the NYC plane crash, and then criticizing the in-efficiency of the court system and then alleged that police stole from him. The police had in fact taken a silver pin from his jacket which was used as evidence.
The couple could face a maximum of fourteen years in jail.

When Mark Scott went to work early he left the side door open so his partner and two other men, Richard Simon Cowell and Lewis Blackwood-Manukau, could gain entrance into the bank. During the robbery all female employees were tied up. Mark Scott, however, was not bound until he gave &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;136,000 in cash to the robbers.
Deborah Poa, employee for BNZ, tried to escape but was attacked in the face but she did manage to gain attention of a passerby who contacted the police. She told the court that she did not trust Mark Scott. "[There was] just something about him. One minute he would be all calm ... the next, all aggressive."
The two men who helped with the robbery were found outside the bank and the couple were formally charged that day by police.
To date $2,860 is yet to be recovered and $370 had already been used on groceries. The couple had some of the money found at their home by police.

After being calm all morning the couple returned to the court upset and then started shouting and swearing at the justices of the peace when they learned that the hearing would adjourn part heard and postponed until December. "Two months here, two months there ... all that bull ... you know?" Mark Scott said.
On Tuesday the robbers and the Scotts will appear in court.

The &lt;a href="w%3A%20American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU) have written in support of the right of advocates against a referendum for a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage in &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; to carry out political canvassing.

Anti-solicitation ordinances were used as the basis to block three persons who canvassed a neighborhood to oppose the legislation, and they were subsequently ordered to leave the area. The gay marriage ban they opposed is on the up-coming ballot for the mid-term election.

"The right of canvassers to enter onto private property to express their views is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution," said Kent Willis of the ACLU. The First Amendment deals with the right to &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;free speech&lt;/a&gt;.
Homeowners can ask persons to leave their property, "but homeowners should not expect the police to remove canvassers from neighborhoods just because they find their presence irritating, or they don't like the content of their message."

Police Chief Connie Novak appears to concur with this view and in an interview stated "If it's a matter of clarifying to my officers, I will certainly do that."

The microcredit &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrameen%20Bank"&gt;Grameen Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and its creator, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad%20Yunus"&gt;Muhammad Yunus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , are jointly awarded the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "for their efforts to create economic and social development from below."

Most people were expecting the founder to be nominated for the Economics Nobel prize but the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorwegian%20Nobel%20Institute"&gt;Norwegian Nobel Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; decided to award him the Peace Prize for his attempt to destroy poverty, emphasizing women who have to "struggle against repressive social and economic conditions". 

Yunus, from &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, said "We want the same kind of unity in politics like the unity that has been created by the Nobel prize award," at a press conference at the bank's office in the suburbs of the Bangladeshee capital, Dhaka.

In 2005, the Nobel Peace Prize was also awarded jointly to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IAEA) and &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt; (محمد البرادعي) (&lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;).

A private security guard attached to &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Pitt"&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAngelina%20Jolie"&gt;Angelina Jolie&lt;/a&gt; pulled out his &lt;a href="w%3Arevolver"&gt;revolver&lt;/a&gt; to threaten a lensman in &lt;a href="w%3APune"&gt;Pune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; photographer was also roughed up by the guard, Sunil Singh, who works for &lt;a href="w%3ATops%20Securities"&gt;Tops Securities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ADefamer.com"&gt;Defamer.com&lt;/a&gt;, a tabloid in Los Angeles, however, says that two guards were involved in the attack. The incident occurred at the Sindh Society area in the suburb of &lt;a href="w%3AAundh"&gt;Aundh&lt;/a&gt;. 

A spokesperson for Tops confirmed the incident, although he claimed the weapon had been pulled out in "self-defence". The accosted person himself chose to remain anonymous and refused to comment on the issue. Freelance photographer Rishikesh Puranik, who witnessed the scene, said that the AP lensman had approached Angelina Jolie with a request for a photo-shoot while she was on the sets. Jolie and her partner Brad Pitt are in India to shoot for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Mighty%20Heart%20%28film%29"&gt;A Mighty Heart&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a film based on &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Pearl"&gt;Daniel Pearl&lt;/a&gt;, a journalist who was killed in 2002 while in &lt;a href="w%3AKarachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Florida Highway Patrol says that the bodies of four people, two adults and two young children, were found on the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%27s%20Turnpike"&gt;Florida's Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; a few miles south of the I-95 interchange in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Pierce%2C%20Florida"&gt;Fort Pierce, Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

Highway Patrol Troopers received a call around 8 a.m. from someone who spotted the bodies of a male and female adult, who were both in their 20's to 30's, and a male and female child, between the ages of 4 and 6, on the southbound side shoulder of the Turnpike.

&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Lucie%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;St. Lucie County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff Ken Mascara said that the victims had been shot multiple times. Mascara also said that no vehicle was found, but there were tire tracks nearby.

The Sheriff's office says that they think the bodies were shot on the scene because of the posture of the family. The mother's body was found holding on to the children on either side of her.

The area where the bodies were found is near the St. James Golf Club as well as several home developments. A resident of a nearby housing development reportedly heard shots or fireworks around 3 a.m.

The turnpike has several traffic cameras in the area, however Sheriff Mascara says they were not recording at the time.

South Korean &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt;, 68, has been endorsed unanimously by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20General%20Assembly"&gt;general assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to succeed &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;secretary-general&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, on October 13. 

He will take the position of Secretary General on January 1.

When asked by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly"&gt;assembly president&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHaya%20Rashed%20Al-Khalifa"&gt;Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to adopt the resolution by an oral vote, the room filled with hundreds of diplomats and UN staff clapping loudly. A formal vote was not conducted as the decision was unanimous.

She banged her gavel after the vote and said, "It is so decided. I have the honor to announce that His Excellency Ban Ki-moon has been appointed by acclamation secretary-general of the United Nations. This is a historic day for the organization as it continues to evolve and live up to the values and principles of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Charter"&gt;&amp;#91;UN&amp;#93; Charter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ." 

At the time of the decision itself, the South Korean was the only candidate for the job - when informal polls were carried out within the UN, the other five individuals fared so badly that they all dropped out of the leadership race.

"I will work diligently to materialise our responsibility to protect the most vulnerable members of humanity and for the peaceful resolution of threats to international security and regional stability," Mr. Ban told the Assembly.

"The true measure of success for the UN is not how much we promise, but how much we deliver for those who need us most."

"The UN is needed now more than ever before."

Mr. Ban, the first Asian Secretary General since &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU%20Thant"&gt;U Thant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;a href="Burma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;, said he was committed to meeting &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Millennium%20Project"&gt;U.N. Millennium Development Goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , expanding peace operations and dealing with threats posed by terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, HIV/AIDS and other pandemics, environmental degradation and protecting human rights.

He also mentioned &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReform%20of%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;reform of the UN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , something the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; — which contributes the largest part of the budget of the UN, with 22&amp;nbsp;%&amp;nbsp;, but also has arrears of 1.3 billion dollars — has long called for. However, the new Secretary General made clear that any changes would occur at his own pace.

"We reform not to please others, but because we value what this organisation stands for," he said. 

"We cannot change everything at once. But if we choose wisely, and work together transparently, flexibly and honestly, progress in a few areas will lead to progress in a few more." 

Kofi Annan, 68, described Ban as "a future secretary-general who is exceptionally attuned to the sensitivities of countries and constituencies in every continent. A man with a truly global mind at the helm of the world's only universal organisation."

He added that he wished Ban strength and courage as he prepared to take over the job and to "have fun along the way."

"We believe he is the right person to lead the United Nations at this decisive moment in its history, particularly as the UN struggles to fulfill the terms of the reform agenda that world leaders agreed to last fall," U.S. Ambassador &lt;a href="John%20R.%20Bolton"&gt;John R. Bolton&lt;/a&gt; told the assembly.

Israeli Ambassador Danny Gillerman said that it was good for Israel's standing in the organization.

"If the secretary general is serious and fair and appoints underlings who are serious and fair, and the UN will be serious, clean and organized, this will be good for the Jews," said Mr. Gillerman.

Mr Ban will hold the position for five years until the next election in 2011.

The discussion mostly centers around the inclusion of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; search facilities, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdobe%20Systems"&gt;Adobe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APortable%20Document%20Format"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; creation tools, and Microsoft's own security software in the operating system. As Microsoft Windows is used by 90% of the consumer computer market both committees expressed concerns that the bundling of these services and software would push companies offering similar products out of the market. 

In September Microsoft raised the possibility of the Vista launch being delayed in the EU and Korea however the companies &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChief%20executive%20officer"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Balmer"&gt;Steve Balmer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last night confirmed this would not be the case. At the time Microsoft said it was unsure what changes the commission required to its new OS. Warnings were apparently first received by the company in March when EU Competition Commissioner &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANeelie%20Kroes"&gt;Neelie Kroes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said there could be issues with the new software.

This is not the first time the software giant has clashed with EU legislators. In 2004 it was ruled to have abused it's position as market leader to push Media player using Windows. A record €497 million fine was imposed at the time and a further €280.5 million in July this year (after courts ruled Microsoft had not complied with the ruling). In the 2004 action Microsoft was required to share information stored on its servers with competing companies, something it has so far failed to do. The company now faces a €300 million a day fine for each day it does not comply.

<h1>Canadian PM: Liberal leadership hopefuls 'anti-Israeli'</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Canadian%20PM%3A%20Liberal%20leadership%20hopefuls%20%27anti-Israeli%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt;, the frontrunner in the Liberal leadership race, said that &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; committed a war crime when it bombarded the &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; village of &lt;a href="w%3AQana"&gt;Qana&lt;/a&gt; in July.

"This is consistent with the anti-Israeli position that has been taken with virtually all of the candidates of the Liberal leadership, and I don't think it's helpful or useful," said Harper, who has refused to back down from his comment. "I think we all remember last summer when the Liberals were making all these anti-Israeli comments."

Harper told reporters that the only two of the eight Liberal leadership candidates who had distanced themselves from such remarks at the time were &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Volpe"&gt;Joe Volpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Brison"&gt;Scott Brison&lt;/a&gt;.

Ignatieff said yesterday that "it would be up to international bodies to determine whether Israel had committed war crimes at Qana." He also said he thought both sides in the conflict were guilty of crimes against civilians and that it was "disgraceful for Harper to suggest the Liberals were anti-Israeli".

"Canadians deserve a Prime Minister that helps Canadians from all communities to find a common language in which we can speak about difficult issues together," Ignatieff said. "All communities in Canada have a right to contribute to the public debate about where Canada's national interest lies but no community has the right to determine what can and cannot be said." "And no Prime Minister has the right to say that anyone who voices criticism of Israel is an enemy of Israel."

Liberal MP Ariela Cotler, whose husband &lt;a href="w%3AIrwin%20Cotler"&gt;Irwin Cotler&lt;/a&gt; is supporting &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae's&lt;/a&gt; campaign, announced that she has quit the party over Ignatieff's assertion that Israel committed war crimes. Ignatieff lacks "moral integrity" and accused him of "sacrificing the truth for personal political gains in the upcoming leadership election." 
She said she "and many of her friends" are no longer planning to attend the Liberals' December leadership convention in Montreal, Ariela Cotler said on Friday, in a letter to the editor in the ♡❤National Post♡❤.

Ignatieff's comment last week has also cost him the co-chair of his Toronto campaign, MP &lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Kadis"&gt;Susan Kadis&lt;/a&gt;, who withdrew her support from his leadership bid on Wednesday.

Canadian &lt;a href="w%3AJew"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; groups criticized the candidate for his comments. Israel's ambassador to Canada, Alan Baker, said Thursday that Ignatieff's statement was "upsetting and disappointing."

Bob Rae, commenting on the PM's remarks, said it is dangerous "to suggest there is a pro-Israel party in Canada and an anti-Israel party in Canada." 

"It's untrue. It's a big lie. It's a big smear. And it isn't going to work on me. And if he thinks he can get away with it, he's sadly mistaken," Mr. Rae said. "It's just a basically thoughtless, deeply divisive thing to say, and I think it's something we have to put a stop to right now. That's it. We cannot carry on politics in this country like this. It will not work. It divides Canadians. It's something for which he should be thoroughly embarrassed."

&lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leadership candidates, said the Prime Minister insulted everyone who wanted to see a ceasefire in the fighting between Israel and Lebanon.

"He is insulting all the people that legitimately thought that the solution was a ceasefire. And these people are not anti-Israel. The vast majority of them, they thought that the best way to help a friend was to request a ceasefire," Mr. Dion said. "I will not allow the Prime Minister to distort what was said in so shameful a way."

&lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, another leadership candidate, described Mr. Harper's "brand of politics as creating divisions within the country and diminishing Canada's reputation" abroad. He said it was unfair and unacceptable to brand the Liberal Party as anti-Israel, and damaging to the quality of public life in the country.

Mr. Ignatieff said his initial comments on Qana were "ripped flagrantly out of context."

Mr. Ignatieff said he's accepted a Jewish group's invitation to visit the Middle East next month to discuss longterm peace solutions, and will meet with the Israeli prime minister as well as Palestinian leaders.

Irish &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; have unveiled a new roadmap for the Northern Ireland devolution process. The roadmap sets a target date for a new &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Executive"&gt;Northern Ireland Executive&lt;/a&gt; to be set up.

The roadmap, known as the &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Andrews%20Agreement"&gt;Saint Andrews Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, came after three days of intense talks in St. Andrews, Scotland. The agreement gives dates for the steps to devolution culminating on March 26, 2007 when the Executive is to be fully up and running.

The first deadline is on November 10, 2006 during which time both parties must accept the agreement and for the first time in the history of the party, the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; will cast a vote for their rivals, &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt;.

The second deadline is on November 27, 2006 in which the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, would gather to elect the first minister and deputy first minister of the Executive. The first minister is speculated by many to be &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. The deputy first minister is speculated to be &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20McGuinness"&gt;Martin McGuinness&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein.

One of the key issues is Sinn Fein's recognition of the &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20Service%20of%20Northern%20Island"&gt;Police Service of Northern Island&lt;/a&gt;, which replaced the controverisal &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Ulster%20Constabulary"&gt;Royal Ulster Constabulary&lt;/a&gt;. In a reassurance to unionists, the governments said they will not transfer duties over to the executive till 2008. Sinn Fein demanded an immediate transfer of power, possibly to a Sinn Fein minister. "You can't have a democratic society unless the police are given full support," Blair said.

After the election of ministers, three steps will take place. The Democratic Unionists will be given time to observe Sinn Fein and see if they are accepting policing. Also, in January, the &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Monitoring%20Commission"&gt;Independent Monitoring Commission&lt;/a&gt; will give another report on the status of the &lt;a href="Provisional%20IRA"&gt;Provisional Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; revocation of violence. 

Finally in March, an electoral endorsement of the Saint Andrews Agreement will take place be it either through election or referendum. Most of the participants at the summit favored a referendum, except for Ian Paisley, according to an anoynoums source who wished not be identified as he no authorization to release details publicly.

The last two final steps take place in March 2007. On March 14, the nomination of the Executive will take place.

Finally, if all goes well, the Northern Ireland Executive power-sharing government and full devolved Northern Ireland Assembly would be revived and take power on March 26, 2007. However, if the parties fail to set up the Executive or fail to agree "at any stage", the Assembly will be dissolved and direct rule from London will continue with input from the Republic of Ireland. 

Tony Blair said the essential parts of the agreement are that all parties accept policing and the courts and have a clear agreement on power-sharing. "So those are the two essential parts of it," Mr Blair said. 

Ian Paisley, the notorious hardliner evangelist who has made his political career out of saying no to comprehensive reforms, eschewed his trademark fire-brand rhetoric offered a welcome and said that the province is "at a crossroads." Paisley said of Ulster, "a place where there is a road to democracy and where there is a road to anarchy." Further adding, "I trust that we will see in the coming days the vast majority of people taking the road to democracy." 

Blair also added, "We've been through different parts of this process many times over the past few years but I think this is a sound basis to proceed." He also said on the possible election of Paisley and McGuinness to their minister positions, "I do not think anybody will find it easy to sit in an executive with people who they are deeply opposed to, or indeed hostile to."

Referring to Sinn Fein, Paisley stated "We will meet the requirements. But the IRA-Sinn Fein has got to meet those requirements. And when they do, we will really be on the way to peace in Northern Ireland." Paisley left St. Andrews quickly after attending the press conference in order to be with his family for his fiftieth wedding anniversary.

Sinn Fein leader, &lt;a href="Gerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt; offered a guarded welcome of the plans and stated "requires thoughtful consideration and consultation." He made no mention of policing. However, he stated the restoration of power-sharing was an "an enormous prize. Common sense, political realism and the interests of all sections of our people demand that we achieve this."

&lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Reg%20Empey"&gt;Sir Reg Empey&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Ulster Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; said that the agreement was "Belfast for slower learners." He added "Sinn Fein will sign up to the PSNI being the only force of law and order and Ian Paisley, or a colleague, will share the joint office of first and deputy first minister with Martin McGuinness in a mandatory coalition."

Leader of the more moderate nationalist &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic and Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Durkan"&gt;Mark Durkan&lt;/a&gt; stated that welcome progress had been made in devolution and that his party would continue working towards this.

The leader of the cross-community non-sectarian &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20Party%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Alliance Party of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Ford"&gt;David Ford&lt;/a&gt; said of the summit that the outcome of the summit was a mix of "of challenges and opportunities". He added, "Despite all that remains to be done, there is now at least a sense of hope for a shared future."

Direct rule from London has been in place since the Assembly and Executive dissolved in 2002 over allegations of IRA spying ring.

The very long lasting previous pope, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20II"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;, had met eight times with the &lt;a href="w%3ADalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt; but the &lt;a href="Benedict%20XVI"&gt;recently elected pope&lt;/a&gt; did not talk to him before yesterday.

The visit was "private" and focused exclusively on "religious" matters, a Vatican spokesman said.

The Vatican has kept a low profile on past visits by the Dalai Lama, including his last in 2003 with John Paul II, to avoid a further chill with China.

China's government bars Catholics from having contact with the Vatican and allows worship only in government-monitored churches. Millions remain loyal to the pope and worship in secret, but priests and other members of congregations are frequently detained and harassed.

The pope also met with Italian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the day, as well as Polish Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJaroslaw%20Kaczynski"&gt;Jaroslaw Kaczynski&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, both of them were documented on the Vatican's Web site.

The pope's meeting with the &lt;a href="w%3ATibet"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt; leader was not listed among his official audiences. Journalists were kept well away and no pictures of the encounter have been released. The Vatican has not released any details of the visit.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; scientists prospectively analysed the health and eating pattern of 2,258 study participants and found a link between a &lt;a href="w%3AMediterranean%20diet"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and a decreased risk of &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, the most common cause of &lt;a href="w%3Adementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.

Participants were scored on their use of &lt;a href="w%3Afruit"&gt;fruits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Avegetables"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALegume"&gt;legumes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACereal"&gt;cereals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFish%20%28food%29"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; (which were considered beneficial in this study), and &lt;a href="w%3ADairy%20product"&gt;dairy products&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMeat"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;, which were regarded as being detrimental to the subjects health. A moderate fat and &lt;a href="w%3Aalcohol"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; intake was also considered part of a typical Mediterranean diet. Potential &lt;a href="w%3AStatistics"&gt;statistical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALurking%20variable"&gt;confounders&lt;/a&gt; such as age, sex, ethnicity, education, &lt;a href="w%3AApolipoprotein%20E"&gt;Apo E&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGenotype"&gt;genotype&lt;/a&gt;, caloric intake and &lt;a href="w%3ABody%20mass%20index"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt; were taken into account.

"This large study in a leading journal adds to the growing weight of evidence that diet and lifestyle are very important risk factors for Alzheimer's disease." was the reaction of Professor Clive Ballard of the &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20Society"&gt;Alzheimer's Society&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%26quot%3BOne-litre%20car%26quot%3B%20may%20help%20traffic%20pollution&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Professors at the Energy Science Centre, attached to the Federal Institute of Technology (&lt;a href="w%3AETHZ"&gt;ETHZ&lt;/a&gt;) in Zurich, have presented their contribution of a car quite similar to &lt;a href="w%3ALoremo"&gt;Loremo&lt;/a&gt; able to travel 100 kilometres (around 62 miles) on a tank with just 1 litre (around 1 quart), equalling to about 235 miles per gallon. They presented their contribution during Swiss Energy Week. 

The automobile, which has and will be manufactured by the Swiss company Horlacher, is 75% lighter than an average family car and guzzles a tenth of the fuel thanks to vastly improved aerodynamics.

One drawback to this car is that it has none of the modern safety features found in many cars to-day. But the FIT team is designing technology that lets cars communicate with each other to avoid collisions, using similar computer systems to those in aircraft.

"This car does compromise on style, speed and comfort, but you can't have a free lunch," says Lino Guzzella, one of the centre's members

"♡❤Business as usual♡❤ is no longer an option. If we are to survive in the future, we will have to drastically reduce carbon emissions." Guzzella continued. 

There are approximately 800 million cars on this planet and in Switzerland there are 500 cars per 1,000 people, compared with 800 in the United States and less than 50 per 1,000 in India and China.

Swiss drivers also favour more powerful, polluting vehicles than the rest of western Europe. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, the main lobbying group of the automobile industry in the European Union, the average car in Switzerland has a 2 litre engine compared with 1.6 litres in neighbouring countries.

"The Swiss think they are better at cutting harmful emissions than anyone else, but they are not," says researcher Peter de Haan van der Weg.

He believes Switzerland should introduce incentives to make people buy cleaner cars. Some countries already have such schemes: the US awards tax breaks worth up to $3,000 and the Netherlands offers €6,000 to green car owners. 

The Swiss authorities are currently thinking about two similar options presented by the city of Bern and the centre-left Social Democratic Party.

"Individuals are not capable of understanding the big picture because it is difficult for people to look 50 years into the future," Mr. De Haan van der Weg said.

"Therefore it is necessary to have government regulations to force changes that will benefit the environment."

An informal poll by a Wikinews reporter found that very few of those &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Koreans&lt;/a&gt; polled changed their mind about reunification with &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; and the perceived threat posed by the North, following the nuclear weapons test by North Korea on October 9. The poll was ♡❤not♡❤ a true statistical survey and its results should not be viewed as representative of the population at large.

The poll found that a majority of respondents perceived a threat from North Korea and wanted the South to "demand/expect" more in its negotiations with the North, a majority also supported eventual reunification and a role for &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; in talks, but fewer believed that reunification will take place. 

The poll was conducted at a terminal hall in Incheon Airport and on board an airplane en Route from &lt;a href="w%3AIncheon"&gt;Incheon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; on October 12.

While the question of whether South Korea was threatened by the North was viewed differently by different people, the number of those that answered "yes" or "possibly" was double that of those answering "no" or "not really".

While a majority of those questioned supported eventual reunification, fewer believed that reunification will take place in the near future.

Respondents also wanted South Korea to "demand/expect more" in its negotiations with the North. 

Those interviewed also showed more support for the involvement of Japan, the United States and China in the talks, with support in that order. 

Those polled reported their ages, which ranged from 20 to 67, and included several businessmen, musicians, students and a housewife. Not all those asked agreed to fill in the multiple choice questionnaire, which was in Korean. All of those that gave the additional information on nationality, age and occupation stated "Korean" or "South Korean" as their nationality.

The respondents were told that the poll was being conducted by a German national and was intended to be used as the basis for an online article.

&lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; have qualified for the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AItaly%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; began their qualification process in &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20-%20European%20qualification%23Round%205%20-%20October%202006"&gt;Round 5 of the European tournaments&lt;/a&gt;. The Italians went through relatively easily, finishing with a 150-7 aggregate score over their only two games.

Italy in Pool A of Round 5, won their first match against &lt;a href="w%3APortugal%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; 83 points to nil in &lt;a href="w%3AL%27Aquila"&gt;L'Aquila&lt;/a&gt; on October 7. The following week they defeated &lt;a href="w%3ARussia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; 67 to 7 in &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, sealing top position in the pool and sending them into next year's World Cup as Europe 1.

Italy enters Pool C of the World Cup, alongside the &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; of New Zealand and &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two other nations that have yet to qualify (Europe 2 and Repechage 1). Italy have appeared at every World Cup since the first tournament in &lt;a href="w%3A1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;, their best result being in &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; with two wins. Portugal and Russia both can still qualify for the World Cup, with the nations meeting next week in &lt;a href="w%3ALisbon"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;. The second placed team in the pool will advance to Round 6 to play the runner-up of Pool B.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnunoctium"&gt;Element 118&lt;/a&gt; has been created in experiments conducted in &lt;a href="w%3ADubna"&gt;Dubna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; by a collaboration of researchers from Russia's &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research"&gt;Joint Institute for Nuclear Research&lt;/a&gt; and from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory"&gt;Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.

The reaction, producing three atoms of element 118, the heaviest element yet found, through collisions that fused together Californium and Calcium atoms, was observed at Dubna. Although element 118 is too unstable to detect directly, the presence of daughter elements resulting from the decay of element 118 gave clues to its fleeting existence. The discovery was reported in the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Physical%20Society"&gt;American Physical Society&lt;/a&gt; journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APhysical%20Review"&gt;Physical Review C&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on October 9, 2006.

Researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory"&gt;Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; previously reported the synthesis of element 118 in 1999, and later retracted their results when subsequent experiments failed to confirm their discovery. It was alleged that a lead researcher, &lt;a href="w%3AVictor%20Ninov"&gt;Victor Ninov&lt;/a&gt;, fabricated the experimental data that indicated the formation of three element 118 atoms.

A family of four found shot to death Friday alongside &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%27s%20Turnpike"&gt;Florida's Turnpike&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Pierce%2C%20Florida"&gt;Fort Pierce, Florida&lt;/a&gt; was identified Saturday.

The bodies of Jose Luis Escobedo Jr., 28, Yessica Escobedo, 25, and their two sons, Luis Damian, 3, and Luis Julian, 4, were identified by &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Lucie%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;St. Lucie County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriff Ken Mascara.

Sheriff's deputies are also looking for the family's car, a black 1998 Jeep Cherokee with temporary Florida &lt;a href="w%3Alicence%20plate"&gt;licence plate&lt;/a&gt; M952180 in the rear window. Authorities believe that this was a suspect's car, as it was not at the victim's home, but neighbors of the family said that it was their car.

Sheriff Ken Mascara has said that the victims pulled their vehicle off the Turnpike between 1:30 and 3 a.m. when someone in the vehicle shot them and drove away.

A woman who lives across the turnpike reported hearing a series of six loud pops around 2:24 a.m. The woman and her husband looked outside, but could not see anything in the dark.

The St. Lucie County Sheriff's office has set up a tip line. Those with information are encouraged to call 1-(772)-462-3230 or 1-(800)-273-TIPS.

Sheriff Mascara said that more than 200 phone calls have come in to the tip line since they opened it up Friday afternoon.

The &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Currie%20Cup"&gt;2006 Currie Cup&lt;/a&gt; domestic &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; final ended in a draw, with the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20State%20Cheetahs"&gt;Free State Cheetahs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Bulls"&gt;Blue Bulls&lt;/a&gt; drawing 28-all after 20 minutes of extra-time at &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20State%20Stadium"&gt;Vodacom Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABloemfontein"&gt;Bloemfontein&lt;/a&gt;. The last time a Currie Cup final ended in a draw was in the 1989 season. The game was played in front of a packed Vodacom Park, with all tickets being sold out on the first day.

The final was the first in Bloemfontein since the 1994 season at &lt;a href="w%3ASpringbok%20Park"&gt;Springbok Park&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="w%3AGolden%20Lions"&gt;Transvaal&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Free State team. The 2006 final is the third in succession which features both the Blue Bulls and Cheetahs, with the teams being the finalists since the 2004 season. The Blue Bulls won the 2004 final at &lt;a href="w%3ALoftus%20Versfeld"&gt;Loftus Versfeld&lt;/a&gt;, and then in 2005 the Cheetahs defeated them at Loftus in the final. The 2006 season kicked off in June, with the regular season finishing after 14 rounds in late September. The Cheetahs finished in first place on the season table, with the Blue Bulls behind them in second place. The Blue Bulls defeated &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Province%20%28rugby%29"&gt;Western Province&lt;/a&gt; in the semi finals, with the Cheetahs defeating the &lt;a href="w%3ANatal%20Sharks"&gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt; to win theirs to set up the final.

The scoring opened up in the third minute with a penalty kick to the Cheetahs through &lt;a href="w%3AWillem%20de%20Waal"&gt;Willem de Waal&lt;/a&gt;. Successful with the kick, the Cheetahs opened up a three point lead over the Bulls. &lt;a href="w%3APhillip%20Burger"&gt;Phillip Burger&lt;/a&gt; scored for the Cheetahs, and &lt;a href="w%3AJP%20Nel"&gt;JP Nel&lt;/a&gt; scored his side's first try of the match, three minutes before halftime. However the conversion attempt was wide. The Cheetahs entered the halftime break leading the Bulls 14 points to eight.

Four minutes into the second half the Blue Bulls scored their second try, with &lt;a href="w%3AMarius%20Delport"&gt;Marius Delport&lt;/a&gt; gathering up a kick to score. &lt;a href="w%3AMorn%C3%A9%20Steyn"&gt;Morné Steyn&lt;/a&gt; kicked the conversion, taking the score to 15 to 14, making it the first time in the match that the Blue Bulls were leading. The Cheetahs took back the lead in the 49th minute, with another penalty kick to take them to 17-15. A long range kick from the Blue Bulls put them back in front in the 55th minute, to lead by one point, 18-17. The Cheetahs hit back through &lt;a href="w%3AKabamba%20Floors"&gt;Kabamba Floors&lt;/a&gt;, scoring a try minutes later. The Cheetahs extended their lead in the 60th minute with another penalty kick. With three minutes remaining, Nel scored his second try and Steyn kicked the conversion to draw the Blue Bulls level 25-all with around two minutes left in the match.

After 80 minutes the game was taken into extra time after a short break in play. The Blue Bulls were awarded a penalty after three minutes of extra time and Steyn kicked it successfully to take the Blue Bulls to 28-25. The Cheetahs came close to equalising in the seveth minute of extra time with a penalty kick, but the ball hit the upright and bounced away. &lt;a href="w%3AMeyer%20Bosman"&gt;Meyer Bosman&lt;/a&gt; kicked a penalty for the Cheetahs in the 14th minute of extra play, drawing the scores equal at 28-all. The game ended soon after, ending in a draw.

<h1>New policy at Madani High School requires non-Muslim girls to wear hijabs</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20policy%20at%20Madani%20High%20School%20requires%20non-Muslim%20girls%20to%20wear%20hijabs&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AHijab"&gt;hijab&lt;/a&gt;, or "Muslim headscarf", is an item of clothing which is regarded by some &lt;a href="w%3AMuslims"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; as "compulsory" for women to wear. But for the first time in &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, a Muslim school has declared that all girl students, including non-Muslims, will be required to wear the hijab.

Ten-percent of places at the Madani High School, a new school, will be allocated to students who are not of the &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic faith&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that there will be 60 places for non-Muslim girls, who will all be expected to wear the headscarf.

The school asserts that it may require the headscarf as part of the &lt;a href="w%3ASchool%20uniform"&gt;uniform&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ACommission%20for%20Racial%20Equality"&gt;Commission for Racial Equality&lt;/a&gt; responded that the school should consider all pupils when putting together a uniform policy.

&lt;a href="w%3AOfficial%20Opposition%20Shadow%20Cabinet%20%28UK%29"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Education%20and%20Skills"&gt;education secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Willetts"&gt;David Willetts&lt;/a&gt; said the move would "harm hopes of integrating communities and drive non-Muslims away".

Earlier this month &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt; called upon Muslim women not to wear the veil (know as a &lt;a href="w%3ABurqa"&gt;Burqa&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ANiqab"&gt;Niqab&lt;/a&gt;) when meeting with MPs, saying its makes relations between different communities more difficult.

&lt;a href="w%3APatani"&gt;Patani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; separatists in Thailand have brutally killed &amp; beheaded another man in southern &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.

Thai police colonel Thawan Nakarawong said the insurgents entered the shrimp farm where the 45-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ABurma"&gt;Burmese&lt;/a&gt; man worked and shot him after blindfolding his daughter. Following his murder his head was severed from his body and deposited some 20km away. 

Colonel Thawan commented to the Bangkok Post that the severed head was booby-trapped.

The separatists are believed to be affiliated with the &lt;a href="w%3APatani%20United%20Liberation%20Organization"&gt;Pattani United Liberation Organization&lt;/a&gt; (PULO).

This is the 20th known instance of suspected PULO insurgents beheading a victim, the last was a 41-year-old rubber worker. However, the recent incident has been described as the most gruesome murder since the military coup.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
According to National Grid and NYSEG during an afternoon press conference, at least 300,000 people and businesses are still without power as the City of Buffalo, New York begins to clean up after the worst October &lt;a href="w%3Alake%20effect%20snow"&gt;lake effect snow&lt;/a&gt; storm in "137 years of records" being kept, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ANOAA"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; calls the weather event "unprecedented." Power in many areas may not be fixed until early next week. Electric crews from &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; have been called in to assist in the clean-up efforts, but power to many areas may not be fully restored until next weekend.

<h3>Federal aid immediately available</h3>

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; or FEMA has cleared the way for at least US$5 million to be given to Erie County and Western New York to be used for the efforts of cleaning up the city. Shelters will also be reimbursed for their services. Residents will also have a chance to be reimbursed for goods, food and water that they needed to purchase during the storm. Items such as bottled water, radios and flashlights could be among those items eligible for reimbursement, according to a press conference with city officials and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Grid%20%28US%29"&gt;National Grid&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon.

Hundreds of trees in Buffalo and the surrounding suburbs such as &lt;a href="w%3AAmherst%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Amherst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATonawanda"&gt;Tonawanda&lt;/a&gt; are severely damaged and in many cases have to be cut down completely.

Erie County has been declared a natural disaster area and the Mayor of Buffalo, Byron Brown said in a press conference yesterday that the city and county will file several applications for federal aid and assistance with &lt;a href="w%3AFEMA"&gt;FEMA&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Flooding possible</h3>

A flood watch still remains in effect for much of the region, as melting snow pack is causing storm drains to over flow, and debris from trees is causing some drains to clog completely making many inaccessible to city workers.

Delaware Park, located near the Albright Knox Art Gallery, is nearly flooded as the banks of Hoyt Lake are beginning to over flow.

City workers are working to clear debris from a main storm drain near the overpass next to the intersection of Delaware and Forest Avenues.

<h3>Spoiled food</h3>

A local business, the Lexington Co-op on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo had to throw out nearly every perishable good in the store after being without power for almost 2 days. During the late afternoon on October 14, the Co-op acquired a generator which is currently supplying the entire store with electricity, but power itself has not yet been restored.

These pictures are just some of the very widespread damage caused by the storm.
Many were taken within less than 1 mile from Forest and Elmwood in Buffalo.

A man was sentenced to three years probation after he and his mother argued about "&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idol"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt;," a popular TV show in the U.S.

Cory Favreau hit his mother with a novelty bike chain in May after she expressed praise for last year's runner-up &lt;a href="w%3AKatherine%20McPhee"&gt;Katherine McPhee&lt;/a&gt;. She was treated for a cut on her head and was released, police say.

Favreau, a twenty-five-year-old native of &lt;a href="w%3APlattsburgh%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Plattsburgh, New York&lt;/a&gt;, pleaded guilty to third-degree assault. He also pleaded guilty to a contempt charge for violating a court order to stay away from his mother.

An American has &lt;a href="w%3Apatented"&gt;patented&lt;/a&gt; a pair of new &lt;a href="w%3Atime"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; formats with a &lt;a href="w%3Afootprint"&gt;footprint&lt;/a&gt; less than 50% of that of conventional four-digit time. The more unusual of the two new formats, called "TWELV", dispenses with &lt;a href="w%3Anumerals"&gt;numerals&lt;/a&gt; altogether. In place of &lt;a href="w%3Aclock"&gt;clock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ahands"&gt;hands&lt;/a&gt; or digits, the new clock uses color to convey the hour and a &lt;a href="w%3Amoon"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; image to convey the minute, which moon slowly grows throughout the course of an hour from a narrow crescent to a full-fledged circle.

The second and more approachable of the new formats retains numerical digits to indicate the minute but uses colors to convey the hour.

Early critics question whether the aesthetic benefits of the moon-clock will be sufficient to encourage users to learn the color-based time-telling system. However, the size advantages of the new system may make it particularly suitable for mobile applications, particularly &lt;a href="w%3Acell%20phones"&gt;cell phones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Awearable%20computers"&gt;wearable computers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Ahead-mounted%20displays"&gt;head-mounted displays&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; have qualified for the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, finishing at the top of their pool during the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20-%20European%20qualification%23Pool%20B%203"&gt;Round 5 of the European qualifying tournaments&lt;/a&gt;. Romania won their first qualifying match on October 7, defeating &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; 20-8. Their 43-20 win over &lt;a href="w%3ASpain%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; on October 14 ensured that they qualified directly for the World Cup next year.

&lt;a href="w%3ARomania%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; qualified as Europe 2, joining Pool C where they will face the &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AItaly%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, as well as one other nation yet to qualify (Repechage 1). Romania have thus far competed at every &lt;a href="w%3ARugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, since the first one was held in &lt;a href="w%3A1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt;. Romania's best result is one win during the pool stages, which it has achieved at every World Cup thus far.

One of the other two nations in Round 5 can still qualify for France next year, and Georgia and Spain will meet each other in &lt;a href="w%3ATblisi"&gt;Tblisi&lt;/a&gt; on October 28 which will determine who finishes second in the pool and advances to Round 6. There they will face the winner from the other pool from Round 5 for the Europe 3 qualification path. The loser of Round 6 can then still qualify through repechage. Both nations have been to the World Cup previously, Spain in 1999 and Georgia in 2003.

At 22:00 GMT a &lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20Navy"&gt;German navy&lt;/a&gt; group is to relieve &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in its command of the maritime task force of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Interim%20Force%20in%20Lebanon"&gt;United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; (UNIFIL) patrolling the coast of . &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and Italian ships currently surveillance an area twice the size of Lebanon itself. 

The German group consists of 2 &lt;a href="w%3AFrigate"&gt;frigates&lt;/a&gt; including carried helicopters, 2 supply ships as well as 4 fast attack craft and will be commanded by Admiral Andreas Krause. The frigate F218 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern under Commander Ulrich Reinecke has left Germany in mid-September and is the flagship of the naval group. 
Germany has contributed 2.400 personnel for this mission. The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Germany%29"&gt;German Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; reports that 1.500 naval personnel, 100 airlift soldiers, 400 mission control staff, 100 soldiers for training and advice to the Lebanese security forces and 300 personnel as tactical reserve have been sent to the Lebanese coast.

Despite official statements by , there appears to be a large faction in the government who believe that Germany taking command of the force will lead to a biased execution of the UN mandate in favor of &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;.

Muslim groups from across the world are criticising the organisers of the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%202012"&gt;2012 Olympics in London&lt;/a&gt; after it was revealed that the games will take place over &lt;a href="w%3ARamadan"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;. The most holy month in the Muslim calendar, which will take place from the 21 July to 20 August in 2012, involves fasting during daylight hours and will affect an estimated 3,000 athletes. 

Joanna Manning Cooper, spokesman for the games said: "We did know about it when we submitted our bid and we have always believed that we could find ways to accommodate it."
Nevertheless, this will come as a huge embarrassment for the organisers who have tried to ensure the event involve all of Britain's ethnic communities.

A quarter of the athletes who took part in the were from predominantly Muslim countries and the fast will put any athletes involved at a clear disadvantage.

The chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, Massoud Shadjared said: "This is going to disadvantage the athletes and alienate the Asian communities by saying they don't matter. It's not only going to affect the participants, it's going to affect all the people who want to watch the games."

The president of the National Olympic Committee of Turkey, Togay Bayalti, said: "This will be difficult for Muslim athletes. They don't have to observe Ramadan if they are doing sport and travelling but they will have to decide whether it is important to them. "It would be nice for the friendship of the Games if they had chosen a different date."

The games will run from the 27 July to 12 August to coincide with the British Summer holidays. The summer holidays are a six week period running from mid July to early September. During this time, public transportation is generally less crowded and it will be easier to find the 70,000 volunteers needed to keep the games running. The International Olympics Committee has specified that the games must take place between July 15 to August 31. Giselle Davies, IOC spokesperson said, "We give a window to the five bid cities. The host city selects the dates within that window."

The organisers are working with the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain"&gt;Muslim Council of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; to find ways around the problem.

In the second canonization ceremony of his papacy, &lt;a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; today named four new &lt;a href="w%3ASaint"&gt;saints&lt;/a&gt;.

The new saints were &lt;a href="w%3ARosa%20Venerini"&gt;Rosa Venerini&lt;/a&gt; (1656-1728), &lt;a href="w%3AMother%20Theodore%20Guerin"&gt;Mother Theodore Guerin&lt;/a&gt; (1798-1856), &lt;a href="w%3AFilippo%20Smaldone"&gt;Filippo Smaldone&lt;/a&gt; (1848-1923), and &lt;a href="w%3ABishop%20Rafael%20Guizar%20Valencia"&gt;Bishop Rafael Guizar Valencia&lt;/a&gt; (1878-1938).

Rosa Venerini helped to establish Italy's first public schools for girls.

Mother Theodore Guerin pioneered schools and religious institutions in Indiana after emigrating from France in 1840. One of the schools she founded, a girls academy, is still in existence a few miles west of Terre Haute. Now named Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, it is the oldest Catholic liberal arts college for women in the United States of America.

Italian priest Filippo Smaldone founded an order of nuns and schools for the deaf.

Bishop Rafael Guizar Valencia disguised himself to care for the wounded during the anti-clerical Mexican revolution.

A &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; 6.7 earthquake shook the &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt; islands at 17:07:49 UTC (07:07:49 local time) October 15, 2006. The quake, centered approximately 6 miles southwest of &lt;a href="w%3APuako"&gt;Puakō&lt;/a&gt; on the west side of Hawai`i Island (the Big Island), was felt throughout the entire state, causing a statewide power outage.

No &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; warning was issued as a result of the quake; however, a tsunami measuring around 0.1 meters (four inches) was recorded. There were 50 aftershocks reported after the quake, the strongest being a 5.8 tremor reported at about 17:14 UTC (7:14 a.m. local time).

There were no fatalities reported and only scattered reports of minor injuries.

Electric power was lost statewide shortly after the quake. As of about 8:00 p.m. HST, power was restored to all the neighbor islands, but Hawaiian Electric personnel still had work to go on Oahu, the island with the highest population. Power was eventually restored to most areas of Oahu by midnight. 

Structural damage occurred at Kona Hospital, where ceiling tiles fell and electricity was lost, forcing an evacuation of patients to Hilo Medical Center on the other side of the island. Damage was also reported at the Honokaa Long-term Care Facility and the Royal Kona Resort. 

Hawaii Governor &lt;a href="w%3ALinda%20Lingle"&gt;Linda Lingle&lt;/a&gt;, who was in Kona at the time of the earthquake, issued an emergency declaration for the entire state of Hawaii at about 11:00 a.m. local time (2300 UTC Sunday).

Air service in Hawaii was temporarily suspended shortly after the quake as airports were forced to operate on emergency power. The power outage caused delays to incoming and outgoing flights, as TSA agents had to conduct manual searches of all bags. Airlines have canceled numerous flights scheduled to depart &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu%20International%20Airport"&gt;Honolulu International Airport&lt;/a&gt; Sunday evening. 

Communication links are problematic. Most radio stations lost power and stopped broadcasting immediately after the quake. (Metroblogging Hawaii) Honolulu radio station KSSK, operating on emergency generators, became a central information source for Oahu residents. A landslide has blocked at least one major highway from a section of a cliff at Kealakekua Bay.

&lt;a href="w%3AUSGS"&gt;USGS&lt;/a&gt; Volcano Observatory equipment has not been significantly damaged. Monitoring stations report "no significant changes in the past 24 hours" of the eruption of the Kīlauea volcano. 

According to USGS records, this earthquake is the fourth largest Hawaiian earthquake in the last 100 years. Previous earthquakes include a magnitude 7.2 quake in 1975, a magnitude 6.9 quake in 1951, and a magnitude 6.8 quake in 1938. The last magnitude 6.7 quake was in 1983.

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Managing Toronto's density explosion:♡❤♡ The population of Toronto is increasing at about 15,000 people per year. New residents require additional infrastructure – increased sewer capacity, more TTC buses, increased solid waste capacity, extension of our subway service to York University and beyond, increased policing capability. Just about every municipal service has to be ramped up to meet the increased demands - and ramping up generates significant complexity and increases costs. The best estimate of the amount new capital infrastructure required by each new person is $20,000. Unfortunately, we receive only about $4,000 per person in development charges. As a result, we've had about a $240,000,000 capital shortfall every year – which we've "solved" by increasing debt and seeking handouts from other orders of government. This is unsustainable and unacceptable. Increasing development charges is the first step towards solving the infrastructure shortfall.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Protection and preservation of neighbourhoods:♡❤♡ The density explosion puts great pressure on our stable residential neighbourhoods. The City's Official Plan directs growth to specific places in the City – particularly those serviced by rapid transit. But the development industry continues to seek growth in those areas of the City which are NOT targeted for intensification, as well as over-intensification in those areas identified for growth. This has immediate negative impacts on neighbouring single-family homes. While we have made gains in improving policies of the Official Plan to protect these neighbourhoods, it will be the job of the next Council to ensure that Planning Staff interpret and enforce these policies to really protect them.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Election Finance Reform:♡❤♡ While Council has indicated its intent to reform how candidates raise money for election campaigns, it does remain a serious problem that must be fixed. VoteToronto, an independent organization, has documented the problems at www.votetoronto.ca of the influence that can result from election contributions of special interest groups. The new City Council must finish the job of election finance reform.

Last month made accusations against the , stating that it may cause delays in the final release of their latest operating system, (formerly known as Longhorn).

Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, stated:

"♡❤We recognize that the European Commission does not give 'green lights' for new products, and we have not asked for one. We appreciate the constructive dialogue we have had with the Commission and the guidance the Commission has provided," Smith added. Based on this guidance, we have made changes to ensure that we're in compliance with our competition law obligations.♡❤". 

The news should be welcomed by all those anticipating Windows Vista within the European community, with Microsoft showing compliance to follow the regulations set out by the European Commission.

The entire debate started when Microsoft were responding to a letter received by the European Competition Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, that showed concerns over "♡❤The possible bundling into Vista of certain products, such as internet search and certain security features that are currently available on a standalone basis from Microsoft and other vendors♡❤". In July, Smith had made a statement that Microsoft had offered to create changes to its system to comply with the commission, and that it had asked the commission to state which changes would make Vista apply to its standards and regulations.

"♡❤We told the Commission that we would be prepared to do any one of four things and they could simply tell us which of those things they wanted us to do♡❤" said Smith.

Since &lt;a href="Bill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; announced the removal of from its new operating system in October 2003, the company has been plagued by many setbacks and legal issues. Only time will tell whether Brad Smith's announcement from Microsoft is entirely truthful instead of a way of covering Microsoft's back.

&lt;a href="w%3AMakati%20City"&gt;Makati City&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;) Mayor Jejomar Binay, Vice Mayor Ernesto Mercado and sixteen members of the city council were served a sixty day suspension order from performing their official tasks. The suspension order was issued by Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita and was served to Binay and the Makati officials by Labor and Employment Undersecretary Wencelito Andar on the morning of Tuesday.

Andanar was escorted by almost 700 members of the Philippine National Police who secured the perimeter access into the Makati City Hall.

Binay and his symphatizers started to hold their fort around the city hall on Monday night to prevent representatives from the Office of the President to serve the suspension order.

The local executives of Makati City were being suspended as preventive measures against possible tampering of evidence as the Philippines Ombudsman conducts an investigation on the alleged payment of wages to ghost employees.

Former Makati Vice Mayor Roberto Brillantes filed before the Ombudsman in late July 2006, a complaint stating that Binay was paying for wages of employees who were not existing.

Binay countered his former Vice Mayor's allegations in saying that he was not aware of any ghost employees since he was not the one signing the payroll of the city.

Binay also filed a Temporary Restraining Order before the Coourt of Appeals to prevent the Ombudsman to pursue its case against him, but the matter is still pending before the court.

Former President Corazon C. Aquino, a close ally of Binay called the suspension lacking in basis.

Aquino also denounced the Malacañan order as it failed to consider Binay's pending petition before the Court of Appeals for a temporary restraining order. Mrs. Aquino also challenged Malacañan to name all the ghost employees.
The Philippines House of Representatives Minority Leader Francis Escudero of Sorsogon province also denounced the order issued by Malacañan and called it an act targeting local elected leaders who are in the opposition.

Escudero cited the case of Pasay City mayor Wenceslao "Peewee" Trinidad who was also suspended for alleged illegal and over priced garbage collection for the city in August of 2006. 

Escudero said that Trinidad, who is a vocal critic of the administration of President &lt;a href="Gloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; is being punished like Binay.

The Minority Floor Leader also called the appointment of a non-elective official to run the city of Makati as a disrespectful to the people of Makati by being given a non-elected official to manage the city.

Rodolfo Feraren, the Director for the National Capital Region of the Department of Interior and Local Government was designated as care taker of the City of Makati during the 60-day period.

Press Secretary Ignacio Bunye called the Binay suspension order as part of due process and denied allegations that the move was a political vendetta against the opposition.

Six people were killed and thirty others were injured during separate bomb attacks in the provinces of &lt;a href="w%3ASultan%20Kudarat%20%28province%29"&gt;Sultan Kudarat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACotabato"&gt;North Cotabato&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;.

Government security forces have blamed the terror group &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Sayyaf"&gt;Abu Sayyaf&lt;/a&gt; for conducting the bombing. The Abu Sayyaf has alleged links to &lt;a href="w%3AJemaah%20Islamiyah"&gt;Jemaah Islamiyah&lt;/a&gt;, the Southeast Asian terror cell of &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;.

Mrs. Arroyo called on local village securities to be more vigilant so they can become force multipliers in the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terrorism"&gt;war against terror&lt;/a&gt;.

On Monday, the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; accused &lt;a href="Eritrea"&gt;Eritrea&lt;/a&gt; of moving some 1,500 soldiers and 14 tanks into a U.N. buffer zone, instituted six-years ago over a &lt;a href="w%3AEritrean-Ethiopian%20War"&gt;border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;. Eritrea claimed it has the right to move troops into its sovereign area. An Eritrean presidential advisor said the troops were working on development projects in the Temporary Security Zone. &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; sees the action as a provocation.

A U.N. chief spokesman said that &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary-General"&gt;Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; "urges the government of Eritrea to withdraw its troops from the zone immediately, and to cooperate with the United Nations in restoring the cease-fire arrangements." The U.N. had reduced its troops and military observers from 3,300 to 2,300 in May, and threatened late September to further reduce this number if the two countries do not move forward in their border conflict.

In 1962 the Emperor &lt;a href="w%3AHaile%20Sellassie"&gt;Haile Sellassie&lt;/a&gt; of Ethiopia annexed Eritrea, which lead to the &lt;a href="w%3AEritrean%20War%20of%20Independence"&gt;Eritrean War of Independence&lt;/a&gt;, until Eritrea regained control in 1991. The current border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia started in 1998, and ended in 2000 with a peace deal that stated the countries were bound to the decision of an independent commission ruling on the border issue. Ethiopia rejected the decision and insisted on further talks. Eritrea responded by hindering the peacekeepers' movements.

Last Sunday the &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; government signed a peace treaty with the united rebel groups at the &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Front%20%28Sudan%29"&gt;Sudanese Eastern Front&lt;/a&gt;, at the border with Eritrea. The Eritrean government changed their position from previously being the main supporter of the rebels, to striving for a cease-fire.

Toronto City council must be a place where everyone has a voice, and who's ideas may be shared in resolving the challenges that face this nation in the twenty second century, and not simply a voice for the realty firms and lawyers that charge outrageous service charges. Toronto is this, but can be much more.

Rob Broudie, one of &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool"&gt;Liverpool's&lt;/a&gt; best known lawyers and brother of Lightning Seeds singer &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Broudie"&gt;Ian Broudie&lt;/a&gt; was found dead early on the morning of the 17th October after apparently jumping from the Tower of &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20Cathedral"&gt;Liverpool Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. An inquest is expect later in the week.

Mr. Broudie was a staunch critic of the Police and a slightly controversial figure, having once been charged with affray after fighting with another of Liverpool's lawyers whilst in the cells.

His company, R.M Broudie &amp; Co, is now based on Dale Street in city centre Liverpool.

On Friday October 13, Colonel &lt;a href="w%3ACarol%20Joyce"&gt;Carol Joyce&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corp"&gt;Marines'&lt;/a&gt; chief defense counsel, imposed a gag order on Lieutenant Colonel &lt;a href="w%3AColby%20Vokey"&gt;Colby Vokey&lt;/a&gt;, the lead military counsel for &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo detainee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Khadr"&gt;Omar Khadr&lt;/a&gt; and Sgt. &lt;a href="w%3AHeather%20Cerveny"&gt;Heather Cerveny&lt;/a&gt;, the team's &lt;a href="w%3Aparalegal"&gt;paralegal&lt;/a&gt;.

On her first visit to Guantanamo, Cerveny was approached by off-duty guards who bragged to her of how they abused detainees. They told of arbitrarily seizing detainee's toiletries and other belongings, in order to provoke their emotions so they would have a justification for using force against them. They told of arbitrary beatings. One guard bragged about banging a detainee's face against the door of his cell without any justification.

On October 6 2006 Cerveny swore an affidavit describing the hour-long conversation she had with the off-duty guards in the Guantanamo military club, prompting calls for an inquiry.
In an interview on October 12, Cerveny said, "It was a general consensus that I (detected) that as a group this is something they did. That this was OK at Guantanamo, that this is how the detainees get treated," 

In a statement Colonel Joyce explained she had imposed the gag order pending a review of the facts, "This is necessary to ensure all actions of counsel are in compliance with regulations establishing professional standards for military attorneys,"

According to &lt;a href="w%3AMuneer%20Ahmad"&gt;Muneer Ahmad&lt;/a&gt;, Khadr's civilian lawyer, the gag order imposes a dilemma for the military members of Khadr's defense team.
He said Vokey wasn't only barred from talking about Cerveny's affidavit, he was barred from talking about any aspect of the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20military%20commission"&gt;military commissions&lt;/a&gt;. Ahmad said Vokey previously had permission to speak with the media.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Union%20Tribune"&gt;San Diego Union Tribune&lt;/a&gt; Ahmad said the gag order had put Vokey in a dilemma: ♡❤"It's in Omar's interests for the truth about abuses of detainees at Guantanamo, including him, to get out in the open. But Colby (Vokey) is being prevented from doing that part of his job ... and thereby representing Omar's interests, I think he is very concerned about his ability to perform his job as a lawyer,"

The dialogue between &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; will resume on 13 November, when the Foreign Secretaries of both nations meet in New Delhi. The officials will discuss a wide range of issues, including the joint anti-terror mechanism, as a part of which India will offer its neighbour evidence of the involvement of Pakistani nationals and the &lt;a href="w%3AInter%20Services%20Intelligence"&gt;ISI&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3A11%20July%202006%20Mumbai%20train%20bombings"&gt;11/7 blasts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3AShiv%20Shankar%20Menon"&gt;Shiv Shankar Menon&lt;/a&gt;, who served as India's High Commissioner to &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt; before taking over as Foreign Secretary will meet his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Mohammad Khan on the 13 and 14 of November to discuss and review the ongoing peace-process between the two countries. The talks were earlier put off following the July bombings and the subsequent indications of Pakistan's role in those attacks. &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; "hopes" that the discussions between these high-ranking officials will lead to the early implementation of the joint anti-terror mechanism, which was agreed upon by Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; and President &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="w%3ANAM"&gt;NAM&lt;/a&gt; summit in &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.

India is expected to hand over evidence, including telephone recording, of the Pakistani involvement in the bombings, and seek the extradition of suspects from Pakistan. Pakistan has said that India's claims of the ISI's hand in the attacks were "unsubstantiated" and "baseless" even though ivestigations revealed that 11 Pakistani nationals were directly involved in the blasts. "We have to give them evidence. We will give them credible evidence. We feel that there is involvement of elements (based) in Pakistan," Prime Minister Singh said. "We will test them once we have given them evidence."

A 36-year-old woman stuck herself to a &lt;a href="w%3ASlot%20machine"&gt;slot machine&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="w%3AGame%20hall"&gt;game hall&lt;/a&gt; in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ALomas%20del%20Mirador"&gt;Lomas del Mirador&lt;/a&gt; when she hit the jackpot of 35 million &lt;a href="w%3APeso"&gt;pesos&lt;/a&gt;, because the halls chief refused to pay up.

The woman placed a bet of 5 &lt;a href="w%3ACentavo"&gt;centavos&lt;/a&gt;. When the slot machine displayed that she had won 35 million pesos(1.72580651 million UK£ or 3.2279485 million US$), the game hall chief didn't pay her that prize, because they claimed the slot machine was malfunctioning.

She then held on tightly to the slot machine for as long as it took for TV journalists and a lawyer to arrive at the scene. In the &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentine&lt;/a&gt; news broadcasts the machine is seen with the amount of money won on the display. The game hall offered a settlement of 125000 pesos, but she has refused to accept that offer.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
In an afternoon press conference, Erie County Executive Joel Giambra announced that at least 300 United States National Guard troops will assist in the cleanup of the "Friday the 13 snow storm" in Buffalo the past weekend and "that possibly more troops" will be called in to help. It is estimated that at least 30 million tons of trees and other debris from the storm will have to be moved from the streets of cities all over the Western New York region. At least 150 troops came to WNY on Monday with lifts and dumptrucks.

"[The debris is] massive, absolutely massive. The idea is to get it off the streets as soon as possible. That`s our priority right now," said Giambra in a press conference this afternoon. Giambra was at the Eastern Hills Mall which the National Grid Power Company is using as a staging area for all the storm repairs needed in WNY. 

The mall is still without power as is an estimated 215,000 people and businesses throughout the region. Power may not be back on in many areas until Sunday or Monday of next week. Originally, nearly 400,000 people lost power during the storm.

At least 6 people have died due to storm related injuries or incidents. Three died from being poisoned by carbon monoxide when they left power generators running in their homes. One pedestrian was killed by a falling tree limb and two persons were killed in car accidents related to the heavy snowfall.

Apple Computer, Inc. has recently discovered a Windows computer virus on more of their fifth generation iPod 'Video' products.

"We recently discovered that a small number - less than 1% - of the Video iPods available for purchase after September 12, 2006, left our contract manufacturer carrying the Windows RavMonE.exe virus... So far we have seen less than 25 reports concerning this problem. The iPod nano, iPod shuffle and Mac OS X are not affected, and all Video iPods now shipping are virus free."

The RavMonE.exe virus, more commonly known as Win32.RJump.a, is a known Trojan virus which works by opening a "backdoor" that allows others access to the infected computer. After installation, RavMonE.exe sends a message to several different servers in order to let them know about the computer's new vulnerabilities.

Up-to-date anti-virus software installed on Windows OS machines should detect and remove the virus. Apple's web support page is supplying &lt;a href="http%3A//www.apple.com/support/windowsvirus/"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; to trial programs that will remove it free of charge. Affected iPods will need to be restored to factory settings by re-installing the iTunes 7 software.

City officials in seven &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; cities were warned today about a possible attack on &lt;a href="w%3ANFL"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; stadiums using "dirty bombs." The &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;, which issued the warnings, has also added that the threat is "not credible."

The bomb threat, originally discovered on &lt;a href="w%3A4chan"&gt;4chan&lt;/a&gt;, stated that truck bombs containing radiological materials would be detonated during the football games this Sunday. While the Department of Homeland Security did not disclose which cities were mentioned, an unnamed department official has said the cities named were Atlanta, Miami, New York, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, California, and Cleveland, Ohio.

In response to the threat, several teams are scheduled to sweep some stadiums with radiation detection devices on Sunday for the presence of radioactive materials. In addition, the parking areas and entrances will be monitored closely for suspicious activity. The NFL has released a statement saying that the stadiums are well protected through security measures already in place.

The FBI has questioned a Milwaukee resident said to be responsible for the threats, which were posted on the web site last week. The FBI has declined to release the details of the investigation.

A tiny pneumatic hand, with the ability to grasp objects smaller than a millimeter across has been developed by Yen-Wen Lu and Chang-Jin Kim of UCLA's Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.

The researchers developed the microhand, which has four fingers built of minuscule &lt;a href="w%3Asilicon"&gt;silicon&lt;/a&gt; segments and &lt;a href="w%3Apolymer"&gt;polymer&lt;/a&gt;-balloon joints, to have a firm but gentle grip to facilitate manipulating tiny, delicate objects. 

The hand opens and closes when the balloons in the joints are inflated and deflated. Because it is constructed of inert materials and is operated &lt;a href="w%3Apneumatics"&gt;pneumatically&lt;/a&gt; rather than electronically, the micro-hand can operate in air or water, giving it the ability to grasp small biological samples which tend to be moist or submersed in a liquid environment.

Lu and Kim presented their robotic hand in the article "Microhand for biological applications", published October 16 in the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Institute%20of%20Physics"&gt;American Institute of Physics&lt;/a&gt; journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AApplied%20Physics%20Letters"&gt;Applied Physics Letters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The US has announced officially that it is using space for surveillance and monitoring activities, including observing natural disasters on Earth, and it intends to develop the commercial potential of space.

The new policy was agreed upon in August but the document was not released until October. In September, the BBC reported that the US Missile Defense Agency had announced the successful test firing of an interceptor missile from &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; which hit a target missile launched from &lt;a href="w%3AAlaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;. This followed the test firing of ballistic missiles by &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; in July.

The success of this US interceptor missile launch is the fifth out of eight attempts and the first to use the facilities at the Vandenberg base. In the last two attempts, in December 2004 and February 2005, the interceptor missiles failed to take off. This whole program is reported to have cost $100 billion since 1983. The system employs &lt;a href="w%3Aradar"&gt;radar&lt;/a&gt; and satellites to locate the target missile and to direct the interceptor towards it. The programme is not without its critics.

<h2>Reactions to the policy</h2>

The BBC reports Tony Snow, &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokesman as saying, in response to questions about the militarisation of space, "The notion that you would do defense from space is different from that of weaponisation of space. We're comfortable with the policy". 

Theresa Hitchens, director of the Centre for Defense Information, has a different opinion from Mr. Snow. She said; "While this policy does not explicitly say we are not going to shoot satellites or we are going to put weapons in space, it does, it seems to me, open the door towards that. This is a much more unilateralist vision of space. The United States in this policy seeks to establish its rights but fails to acknowledge the rights of other countries in space, where the Clinton policy was very careful to acknowledge the rights of all nations in space." Hitchens said

&lt;a href="w%3AMarine%20Corps"&gt;Marine Corps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20E.%20Cartwright"&gt;General Cartwright&lt;/a&gt;, interviewed by ♡❤Inside Pentagon♡❤, 18 October, was asked about allegations that &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; had tested the means of destroying American &lt;a href="w%3Asatellites"&gt;satellites&lt;/a&gt;, said ♡❤"...we really haven't seen that"♡❤. He likened the US role as that of enforcing the &lt;a href="w%3Arule%20of%20the%20road"&gt;rule of the road&lt;/a&gt; in space. He pointed out that 16 or more countries can operate 10 or more satellites and that seven of these countries, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, are not members of &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;. He said that, ♡❤"unfortunately, we anticipate some will challenge the free use of space."♡❤

&lt;a href="w%3AMikhail%20Margelov"&gt;Mikhail Margelov&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Federation"&gt;Russian Federation&lt;/a&gt; Council's foreign affairs committee, is reported by RBC News as saying that the new policy ♡❤"... may instigate Russian and joint Russian-US &lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20exploration"&gt;space exploration&lt;/a&gt; projects♡❤". Russia and America had been cooperating in space for years and it was not in the interest of the USA to sever those relations"♡❤. 

Having reported the new policy, the &lt;a href="w%3ATaipei"&gt;Taipei&lt;/a&gt; Times recollects that ♡❤"Before becoming Bush's secretary of defense, &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; had warned against a "Space &lt;a href="w%3APearl%20Harbor"&gt;Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt;" and insisted US interests needed to be better protected"♡❤.

Under the headline ♡❤"America wants it all - life, the Universe and everything"♡❤, Bronwen Maddox in ♡❤The Times♡❤ describes the new space policy as ♡❤"comically proprietory in tone"♡❤ and reports that America has rejected talks proposals by 160 other states for a ban on an arms race in space - (the vote in the UN was 160-1). The project is described as having a ♡❤"breathtaking cost"♡❤. The policy does, however, highlight the vulnerability of military, commercial and personal data links that use satellites in space.

The difference between this policy and that of the President Clinton is highlighted in ♡❤"DefenseTech.org"♡❤ by the headline ♡❤"Bush: Space is for Soldiers"♡❤. It is pointed out that in the previous space policy the emphasis was on international security and cooperation, the new policy includes the following: ♡❤"Proposed arms control agreements or restrictions must not impair the rights of the United States to conduce research, development, testing and operations or other activities in space for U.S. national interests"♡❤.

Just days following the suicide attack of unarmed Sri Lankan naval officers in Habarana, another was launched in the early hours of the morning in the southern port city of &lt;a href="w%3AGalle"&gt;Galle&lt;/a&gt;. Official reports stipulate that terrorists, under the guise of fishermen in 5 boats entered the harbor and detonated after ramming into gunboats anchored at the naval base. Initial reports confirm that at least 16 people were killed and scores of others were injured in the blast.

The government has accused the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberation%20Tigers%20of%20Tamil%20Eelam"&gt;Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam&lt;/a&gt;, LTTE, a militant separatist group, banned as a terrorist organisation in countries such as &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; of conducting both attacks. Though the organization has not claimed responsibility for either, they are also yet to claim responsibility in a string of such attacks, including the assassination of the Indian Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ARajiv%20Gandhi"&gt;Rajiv Gandhi&lt;/a&gt;, allegedly as retribution for "war-crimes" committed by the &lt;a href="w%3AIPKF"&gt;Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;.

Analysts believe that the attack on the port city of Galle, a &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Heritage%20Site"&gt;UNESCO heritage site&lt;/a&gt; and the heart of Sri Lanka's tourist industry was aimed at sparking a government response in the lead up to talks between the government and the LTTE, as well serving an economic blow in the lead up to peak tourist season on the island.

The presence of envoys from the U.S., Japan and Norway are expected for this week's scheduled government talks with the LTTE.

An &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Indian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMikoyan"&gt;MiG&lt;/a&gt; crashed today in Jarohi village in the &lt;a href="w%3ACooch%20Behar"&gt;Cooch Behar&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bengal"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;. Police officials in Jailpaiguri said that the pilots of the plane managed to eject safely and that one of them has been taken to &lt;a href="w%3AHasimara"&gt;Hasimara airbase&lt;/a&gt; hospital to be treated for injuries to his legs. Although the jet went up in flames after hitting the ground, no property damage has been reported. 

The only civilian casualty was a local girl who, officials say, fell unconscious after hearing the sound of the crash. She has been taken to Alipurdaur hospital for treatment. An IAF spokesman denied these reports, saying there had been no casualties or property damage on the ground. 

This is the sixth jet, and the fourth MiG, the IAF has lost this year. On September 28, a MiG-29 went down in &lt;a href="w%3AHaryana"&gt;Haryana&lt;/a&gt; following a double engine failure. Another crash occurred in &lt;a href="w%3AGujarat"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt; this June. The Russian-made MiG series is said to have a history of engine problems. 

Source pictures show what appears to be the wreckage of a &lt;a href="w%3AMiG-27"&gt;MiG-27&lt;/a&gt;, however reports of a MiG-29 lost persist.

Scientists from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; have announced that they have invented a way to make things invisible in &lt;a href="w%3Amicrowave"&gt;microwaves&lt;/a&gt;. The new mechanism is currently operated by what scientists call "metamaterial" which is a new material that has been created in a laboratory and can decrease the scattering as well as the shadow cast by a specially designed copper cylinder. This means that the cylinder is partially &lt;a href="w%3ACloaking%20device"&gt;cloaked&lt;/a&gt;.

"It's not exactly perfect &amp;mdash; we can do better &amp;mdash; but it demonstrates the mechanism, the way the waves swirl around the centre region where you want to conceal things," said &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20University"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt; scientist, David Smith. The findings have been published in the October 19 edition of the journal &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20%28journal%29"&gt;♡❤Science♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

More than five years after the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;11 September 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;, human remains from the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;'s fallen towers have been uncovered at the cross of 29th Street and 11th Avenue in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.

Works from Manhattan's Consolidation Edison found the remains and took them to a natural gas vehicle refueling station, where they called medical examiners to the scene. It is unclear when the remains were found or what condition they are in.

An estimated 2,749 people died as a consequence of the September 11 attacks, and family members of about 1,150 victims still do not know whether the remains of victims have been, or ever will be, found.

Most of the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; is sweltering in summerlike heat and humidity ahead of a &lt;a href="w%3Acold%20front"&gt;cold front&lt;/a&gt;, which promises to bring down polar air from &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; to cool down the state next week.

A wide swath of Florida has reported temperatures above 90º &lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit"&gt;Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt; (32º &lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;Celsius&lt;/a&gt;) over the last three days, with heat indices either approaching or topping 100ºF (38º C), with similar conditions persisting into the weekend. 

At the &lt;a href="w%3AVandenberg%20Airport"&gt;Tampa Vandenberg Airport&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, few clouds and south-southwest winds pushed the temperature to 93º (34º C), toppling the previous record set for that date (89º in 1993). At the &lt;a href="w%3ATampa%20International%20Airport"&gt;Tampa International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, the recorded high was 88º (31º C), just one degree shy of the record set on that date, also in 1993. Record-breaking highs were also witnessed yesterday at the &lt;a href="w%3AOrlando%20International%20Airport"&gt;Orlando International Airport&lt;/a&gt;: the recorded high was 93º, breaking the record of 91º set back in 1980. 

In downtown &lt;a href="w%3AJacksonville%2C%20Florida"&gt;Jacksonville&lt;/a&gt;, the recorded high yesterday was 88º, three degrees shy of the record set in 1980, but still ten degrees higher than the average high for October 19.

Even normally warm &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; flirted with record highs. On October 18, Miami recorded a high of 89º in downtown, one degree shy of the record high set back in 1993. The only part of the state receiving a respite from the high temperatures is the &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20Panhandle"&gt;Panhandle&lt;/a&gt;, which is already feeling the effects of the nearly stationary cold front.

A woman in &lt;a href="w%3ASacramento"&gt;Sacramento&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; claims to have spotted the holy figure of &lt;a href="w%3AJesus%20Christ"&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/a&gt; in her burrito.

Valencia Phillips said that, while she was very hungry and actually not very religious, she didn't dare bite into the &lt;a href="w%3AChimichanga"&gt;chimichanga&lt;/a&gt; bearing the holy mark. "I've had an amazing, amazing experience. It's been something else," Phillips said.

It is not currently known what will become of the burrito.

A 4.5 magnitude &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; centered in the northern &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; city of Cobb struck around 10 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time"&gt;Pacific Time&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;-8) on Friday. 

According to CalTech's professor Carlos Sicilia, the earthquake reportedly shook items off store shelves, causing many of them to crash against the floor. There was no immediate report of structural damage or injury.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Evangelist%20Kent%20Hovind%27s%20tax%20trial%20begins&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Evangelist &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Hovind"&gt;Kent Hovind&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, Jo, are trying to convince a federal jury that their money from video and amusement park admission sales belong to God and cannot be taxed. The trial began at &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Florida"&gt;United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday October 18, 2006 after twelve jury members and two alternates were selected to decide on the 58 federal courts against Hovind and his wife. The trial was expected to take at least two weeks to complete with the prosecution hoping to rest its case Tuesday, but a defense attorney became ill and the Judge delayed the trial until October 30th.

Hovind is a &lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Earth%20creationism"&gt;Young Earth creationist&lt;/a&gt; who does many speaking engagements and debates. He also sells videos giving a pro-&lt;a href="w%3Acreationism"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; perspective, which he receives income for. Hovind, who calls himself "Dr. Dino", received a &lt;a href="w%3ADoctor%20of%20Philosophy"&gt;Ph.D&lt;/a&gt; in "Christian education" from the &lt;a href="w%3ASchool%20accreditation"&gt;unaccredited&lt;/a&gt; correspondence school &lt;a href="w%3APatriot%20Bible%20University"&gt;Patriot Bible University&lt;/a&gt; in 1991. 

<h3>Charges</h3>

Prosecutor Michelle Heldmeyer said from 1999 to March 2004, the Hovinds took in more than $5 million. Heldmeyer charged Hovind on 12 counts for failing to pay about $470,000 in federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes for his ministry employees between March 31, 2001, and Jan. 31, 2004. Counts 13 through 57 include Hovind's wife for making 45 transactions in a little more than a year, sometimes taking out as much as $9,500 at a time. Banks are required to &lt;a href="w%3ASmurfing%20%28crime%29"&gt;report cash withdrawals&lt;/a&gt; that exceed $10,000.

In count 58 against Kent includes filing a frivolous lawsuit against the IRS, demanding damages for criminal trespass, filing an injunction against an IRS agent, making threats against investigators and those cooperating with the investigation, and filing false complaints against the IRS for false arrest, excessive use of force and theft.

In July with his attorney, &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Defender"&gt;Public Defender&lt;/a&gt; Kafahni Nkrumah, Hovind stated that he did not recognize the government's right to try him on tax-fraud charges.

This is not the first time Hovind has found himself in legal trouble. In 2002 he refused to get a $50.00 building permit for his &lt;a href="w%3ADinosaur%20Adventure%20Land"&gt;Dinosaur Adventure Land&lt;/a&gt;, and after three years of legal battles the court ruled that he get a permit or the building would be razed. The park, which depicts dinosaurs as coexisting with humans in the last 6-4,000 years with the more recent "dinosaurs" being the &lt;a href="w%3ALoch%20Ness%20monster"&gt;Loch Ness monster&lt;/a&gt;, is reportedly open after Hovind paid for the permit and fines totaling $10,402.64.

<h3>Government witnesses</h3>

More directly, M.C. Powe, an IRS officer who investigates people who have unpaid tax returns or unpaid tax liabilities, testified at Hovind's current trial on October, 19, 2006 that she first attempted to collect taxes from the Hovinds in 1996. She noted Hovind tried several "bullying tactics" that included suing her at least three times. These resulted in each case being thrown out.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Beard handled Hovind's &lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 testified on Wednesday that in 1996 after Hovind's vehicles were seized by the IRS, he filed under the &lt;a href="w%3ABankruptcy%23Chapter%2013"&gt;Chapter 13&lt;/a&gt; "wage-earner plan," available only to those who have a regular source of income. However, Hovind wrote that he had no form of income, that he rejected his Social Security number and that his employer was God, Beard testified.

In a 2005 affidavit, the Hovinds argue that &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Security%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Social Security&lt;/a&gt; is essentially a "&lt;a href="w%3APonzi%20scheme"&gt;Ponzi scheme&lt;/a&gt;." The Hovinds referred to the United States Government as "the 'bankrupt' corporate government" and said they were renouncing their United States citizenship and Social Security numbers to become "a natural citizen of 'America' and a natural sojourner."

On Thursday an employee of &lt;a href="w%3AAmSouth%20Bank"&gt;AmSouth Bank&lt;/a&gt; explained that the Currency Transaction Reports requires the bank to report any time a cash amount of $10,000 or more is withdrawn or deposited. This employee noted that various records demonstreated Jo Hovind had made transactions up to $15,000 at a time. 

Also on Thursday Hovind's former neighbor testified regarding Hovind's purchasing of her Palafox Street home. On the stand she said Hovind paid her $30,000 in cash as part of the $155,000 sale.

<h3>Hovind's employees</h3>

In this week's trial two of Hovind's workers testified in federal court that they didn't consider where they worked to be a church. In court Hovind maintains he does not have to pay the taxes because his employees were "volunteers," "missionaries" or "ministers" and his business was a ministry.

However, Brian Popp, Hovind's employee for at least eight years, said he considered himself a minister at the time of his employment, but said Hovind's ministry isn't a church. Popp also testified that Hovind knew about the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20Secrecy%20Act"&gt;bank's requirement to report transactions&lt;/a&gt; over $10,000 and said it was "not safe to carry large sums of cash."

Further, Popp said Hovind told his workers not to accept mail addressed to "KENT HOVIND" because Hovind told the workers the government created a corporation in his "all-caps name" and if the mail was accepted, Hovind claimed, it would be accepting the responsibilities associated with that corporation.

Diane P. Cooksey, served as a sales representative for the ministry from January 2003 to June 2005, and said Hovind expected to pay her own taxes. Cooksey said, "He explained what his belief was, right up front in the interview, that I would pay my own taxes." As told's worker, she received $10 an hour in a weekly paycheck, punched a time clock, was given 10 paid vacation days a year, and considered herself an employee, not a missionary as a few others called themselves.

The IRS raided Hovind's Dinosaur Adventure Land in April 2004, after which Hovind required his employees to sign nondisclosure agreements. "I was uncomfortable signing it, I guess, because of not having a full understanding," Cooksey said.

<h3>Pensacola Christian College</h3>

Rebekah Horton, vice president of the &lt;a href="w%3Aschool%20accreditation"&gt;unaccredited&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APensacola%20Christian%20College"&gt;Pensacola Christian College&lt;/a&gt;, took the stand on the second day of the trial and testified that "We know the Scriptures do not promote (tax evasion)". "It's against Scripture teaching."

Horton was given a videotape in the mid 1990s from a woman who worked for Hovind. The video contained "another evangelist advocating tax evasion," Horton explained. The woman who gave the tape to Horton claimed Hovind's philosophy as "You were giving a gift with your work, and they were giving a gift back to you." 

Pensacola Christian College decided to disallow its students from working with Hovind's Creation Science Evangelism and reported Hovind's scheme to the IRS.

<h3>IRS and 'beating the system'</h3>

On Friday, attorney David Charles Gibbs testified that Hovind claimed he had no obligation to pay employee income taxes and explained with "a great deal of bravado" how he had "beat the tax system." Gibbs is an attorney with the Gibbs Law Firm, also is affiliated with the Christian Law Association, a nonprofit organization founded by his father that offers free legal help to churches nationwide in a suburb of St. Petersburg, Florida. Gibbs attended the Marcus Pointe Baptist Church when Hovind was a guest speaker at the church on October 17, 2004. Hovind invited Gibbs and others to Hovind's home for pizza and soda.

Gibbs testified they talked for many hours, and Hovind "tried to stress to me that he was like the pope and this was like the Vatican." Also Gibbs explained Hovind also told him he preferred to deal in cash because "dealing with cash there is no way to trace it, so it wasn't taxable."

Later on Friday, Special IRS Agent Scott Schneider took up the remainder of the day and is expected to resume Monday. Schneider told the jury his investigation revealed that Hovind "hadn't filed tax returns ever, to my knowledge."

Hovind tried suing the IRS and Schneider several times to avoid providing information required by the IRS. Each filing was thrown out by the judges.

Schneider's discussed documents seized during the 2004 raid of Hovind's property. These documents, Schneider explained, indicated Hovind ran his ministry as a business with "meticulous" payroll documents and a time clock employees had to punch in and out.

In the raid cash was found "all over the place." Ultimately, $42,000 in cash was seized along with half-dozen guns (including a &lt;a href="w%3ASKS"&gt;SKS&lt;/a&gt; semiautomatic) at the Hovinds' home.

The Pensacola News Journal noted that "in one memo, Jo Hovind informed her daughter, who works at the park, that her pay would be docked $10 for talking too long on the telephone when she should have been working."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20population%20reaches%20300%20million&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Tuesday, October 17, 2006 at 7:46 A.M. (EDT), the estimated population of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; crossed the 300 million mark.

The United States population reached the 100 million mark in 1915 and the 200 million mark 52 years later in 1967. Only 39 years later, it has touched 300 million.

In 1967, when the population reached 200 million, President &lt;a href="w%3ALyndon%20Johnson"&gt;Lyndon Johnson&lt;/a&gt; held a news conference at the Commerce Department to "hail America's past and to talk about the challenges ahead".

While the current administration doesn't appear to have similar public celebrations for the 300 million mark as President Johnson had for the 200 million mark, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said to the Associated Press "I would hate to think that we are going to be low key about this...I would hope that we make a big deal about it."

During the year the population reached 200 million, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20E.%20Lilienthal"&gt;David E. Lilienthal&lt;/a&gt;, the former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, grimly predicted that 300 million people would cause the country to be impoverished and polluted with scarce national resources. "A population of at least 300 million by 2000 will, I now believe, threaten the very quality of life of individual Americans."
Sam Roberts of ♡❤The New York Times♡❤ notes that while the United States' population is growing by slightly less than 1 percent per year, the nation is the third largest in population behind &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, each with populations over 1 billion. The United States continues to be gaining people while many other industrialized nations are not; &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s population is actually decreasing.

In terms of regional distribution, there has also been major change. Between 1970 and 2000, the portion of population in the southern and western United States went from 48 percent to 58 percent. The Population Reference Bureau also notes a rise in &lt;a href="w%3Asuburbia"&gt;suburbia&lt;/a&gt; in the 30 year gap. While the percentage of the population living in cities remained around 30 percent, the percentage of people living in the suburbs rose from 38 percent to 50 percent.
John McCormick discussed in ♡❤Chicago Tribune♡❤ how the make-up of the US population has certainly changed from 1967 to today. Then, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; was the country where most foreign born people came from more than any other; in 2006 that nation is &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. And in the 39 year span, the percentage of foreign-born U.S. citizens has more than doubled from 5 percent to 12 percent today. According to the Population Reference Bureau, almost 50 percent of Americans under 5 years of age are members of a minority, be it racial or ethnic.

The U.S. Bureau of the Census maintains a &lt;a href="w%3APopulation%20Clock"&gt;current estimated U.S. population count&lt;/a&gt; on its website.

Whilst on a visit to &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; Prime minister &lt;a href="Surayud%20Chulanont"&gt;Surayud Chulanont&lt;/a&gt; indicated that &lt;a href="w%3AMartial%20law"&gt;martial law&lt;/a&gt; imposed following the bloodless September 19 coup may soon be lifted.

Surayud was appointed Prime Minister on October 1 by General &lt;a href="w%3ASonthi%20Boonyaratglin"&gt;Sonthi Boonyaratglin&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the military junta that overthrew the government of caretaker Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;. 

Currently touring the various &lt;a href="w%3AASEAN"&gt;ASEAN&lt;/a&gt; nations, Indonesia is the fourth stop for the new PM.

According to a report in the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;♡❤Bangkok Post♡❤&lt;/a&gt; the discussions between PM Surayud and his Indonesian counterpart President &lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt; included calls for the state of martial law in Thailand to be lifted as well as discussions on the unrest in Thailand's muslim-majority south.

In a statement from Foreign Minister Hassan Wirayuda, the retired privy councilor turned PM was said to be prepared to "consider carefully" calls for the lifting of martial law and that he found Indonesia's approach to the problems they had with rebels in Aceh province "inspired".

Also on the agenda during the discussions were sharing of experience with avian flu. Indonesia has seen 55 people die from the disease.

<h2>French message</h2>

Before I go, I would like to make an address to my French speaking constituents. 

Cheres habitantes, chers habitants de Brampton,

Comme Conseiller municipal, je travaillerai durement pour faire de Brampton, une ville vivante, propre, sécuritaire, exotique et une ville ou il fait bon vivre dans notre diversité linguistique, ethnique et culturelle.
Les habitants de Brampton seront au centre de toutes mes préoccupations et décisions et je rechercherai toujours à satisfaire leur bien-être d'abord et avant tout. La ville de Brampton a certainement besoin de remplir ses caisses, mais je ne l'encouragerai jamais au détriment du bien-être des populations.
J'œuvrerai pour assurer la sécurité des résidents de la ville, en encourageant la présence policière dans les rues et surtout il faudrait combattre les préjugés policiers qui favorisent certains arrestations arbitraires.
Je travaillerai d'arrache-pied pour faire de Brampton une ville modèle dans le Canada. 
Un example d'intégration culturelle dans la diversité multi ethnique et multi culturelle,
Un example dans l'intégration linguistique en rapprochant les populations des deux langues officielles du Canada (français et anglais) et aussi en incluant les autres minorités linguistiques,
Un example de ville récréatif en développant les attractions récréatives pour enfants, jeunes et personnes âgées,
Un example infrastructurel en améliorant l'infrastructure présente dans le but de diminuer les embouteillages et aussi d'améliorer le transport en commun dans la ville et vers Toronto.

Je compte sur votre support pour faire de Brampton une meilleure ville pour nous et nous enfants.

The headmaster of &lt;a href="w%3AScotch%20College%2C%20Perth"&gt;Scotch College&lt;/a&gt; in Perth, &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; is set to meet the parents of the school's Year 11 (aged 15 - 17) students after a set of incidents involving alcohol, use of recreational drugs and the hire of a stripper, who used vegetables and fruit in her act, at a &lt;a href="w%3ARugby%20union"&gt;Rugby union&lt;/a&gt; wind-up.

Reverend Andrew Syme issued a letter late last week to parents informing them of the seriousness of these events and the actions parents need to take. Syme stated in the letter that a number of parents approached him during the year.

Other incidents to occur during the year include 300 gate crashers turning up at a student's party in July, causing injury to the bouncer, and "inappropriate sexual behaviour in parks and other public places".

The meeting is to be held on October 31 in the school's library.

This was a serious cause of concern for the entire community.

The head of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommission%20for%20Racial%20Equality"&gt;Commission for Racial Equality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATrevor%20Phillips"&gt;Trevor Phillips&lt;/a&gt;, in an article in today's ♡❤Sunday Times♡❤, warns that, unless people are prepared to talk honestly with each other about racial prejudices, there could be violence in the streets, much worse than the riots in the North of England five years ago. 

This intervention follows two weeks of interviews and phone-ins, an "air war", involving politicians and Government Ministers, including Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; triggered by leader of the House of Commons, &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw%20%28politician%29"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;'s comments urging Muslim women to drop the full veil. 

Phillips describes the situation, "On one side of the trenches we have those who want a fully fledged auto-da-fé against British Muslims, in which anything any Muslim does or says must be condemned as a signal of their willful alienation and separation; on the other hand the defensiveness of some in the Muslim communities has hardened into a sensitivity that turns the most neutral of comments into yet another act of persecution". 

Phillips writes that although there are other contributory factors, the "real crisis is our failure to adjust to change in our society and our failure to find a civilised way of talking about our diversity."

In an interview Saturday, October 21 with Aljazeera.net, Alberto Fernandez, a senior diplomat with the State Department, made the following statement concerning the war in Iraq:
"We tried to do our best, but I think there is much room for criticism, because, undoubtedly, there was arrogance and there was stupidity from the United States in Iraq,"

Fernandez later apologized, "Upon reading the transcript of my appearance on Al-Jazeera, I realized that I seriously misspoke by using the phrase 'there has been arrogance and stupidity' by the U.S. in Iraq."

With online gaming in persistent worlds becoming more prevalent, a US congressional committee has begun to look into the tax implications of these booming online economies. Games such as &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20of%20Warcraft"&gt;♡❤World of Warcraft♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Life"&gt;♡❤Second Life♡❤&lt;/a&gt; have large player driven economic systems in which - either following the rules or against them - real world currencies are exchanged for in-game currencies. With the &lt;a href="w%3AGross%20domestic%20product"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt; of some of these economies rivaling that of some small countries, the US government is wondering if it is missing out on a potential source of tax revenue: or as some gamers might put it, the &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;IRS&lt;/a&gt; is asking "You buy gold?".

In cases where exchange of a real world currency for in-game currency is permitted by the rules of the game, some of these online games such as ♡❤Second Life♡❤ require that players report any income generated by these means to his or her government. In most on-line games however, a &lt;a href="w%3Ablack%20market"&gt;black market&lt;/a&gt; exists where players buy and sell in-game currencies in direct violation of the game's rules; situations involving black markets are notoriously hard to tax.

Compounding the issue of currency exchange is the existence of in-game assets. In the real world if someone wins a luxury vehicle, he or she is expected to pay a capital gains tax on his or her winnings. If a 40 person "&lt;a href="w%3ARaid%20%28game%29"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;" in ♡❤World of Warcraft♡❤ gets a rare "&lt;a href="w%3AItem%20drop"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;," worth up to thousands of dollars if sold illegally, should they be required to pay a capital gains tax?

Even if the issue of capital gains is ignored, there is still the matter of sales tax. In many of these games, &lt;a href="w%3ANon-player%20character"&gt;non-player characters&lt;/a&gt; and players alike sell items to one another. If sales tax is to be applied, at what rate should it be charged and to what State does it go? Questions such as these have just recently been answered in much less hazy situations such as online versions of &lt;a href="w%3ABricks%20and%20mortar%20business"&gt;brick and mortar&lt;/a&gt; establishments.

Dan Miller, senior economist for the Joint Economic Committee had this to say on the issue, "I found that talking about this issue with some of the other economists on the committee, they are not really familiar with what a virtual economy is. The idea of ♡❤Second Life♡❤ or ♡❤World of Warcraft♡❤ or some of these other synthetic universes, they have trouble wrapping their head around it. So there's an educational hurdle to overcome here." 

The preliminary findings of the committee state that virtual economies deserve clarification of existing tax laws, not new taxes.

Brazilian driver &lt;a href="w%3AFilipe%20Massa"&gt;Filipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;, driving for &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;, won the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Brazilian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AAut%C3%B3dromo%20Jos%C3%A9%20Carlos%20Pace"&gt;Autódromo José Carlos Pace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AInterlagos"&gt;Interlagos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. This is his second &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Prix"&gt;Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; victory. Massa became the first Brazilian to win on home soil since &lt;a href="w%3AAyrton%20Senna"&gt;Ayrton Senna&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1993%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;1993&lt;/a&gt;. Massa started from pole and controlled the race from start to the finish line.

&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; finished second to win the drivers' championship. He became the youngest second-time champion. Alonso, along with the second &lt;a href="w%3ARenault"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; driver, &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt; who finished sixth, won the constructors' cup for their team with only five points ahead of Ferrari. &lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Button"&gt;Jenson Button&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda's&lt;/a&gt; drivers, finished behind Alonso.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; had a few problems this weekend. In the beginning of the third qualification session his car slowed down and forced him to start 10th on Sunday. In the race he was almost on the back of Fisichella, but damaged his tyre in the overtaking attempt and lose all positions. But the retiring champion was right on the back of Fisico for the second time near the end of the race. Giancarlo made a crucial mistake prior to Senna's "S"-curve allowing Michael to pass him. Next aim was &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen"&gt;Kimi Räikkönen&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="w%3AMcLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;, who lost his place to Schumacher in the same turn. Must note that all Schumacher overtook most of the other drivers in the same turn. The "Red Baron" set up the fastest time and the top speed record for this track. Let's say the words &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heidfeld"&gt;Nick Heidfeld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASauber"&gt;Sauber&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ABMW"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; team driver, wrote on the back of his aerodynamical spoiler - "Danke, Michael!". Danke, Michael, for the fantastic race and so many seasons together. You overcomed the difficulties as the true champion.

Kimi and Giancarlo finished 5-th and 6-th respectively.
&lt;a href="w%3ARubens%20Barrichello"&gt;Rubens Barrichello&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APedro%20de%20la%20Rosa"&gt;Pedro de la Rosa&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AMcLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMercedes"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;) and Poland &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Kubica"&gt;Robert Kubica&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ASauber"&gt;Sauber&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ABMW"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;)
were 7-th, 8-th and 9-th respectfully. Takuma Sato closed the season with 10-th place, first who finished in one lap after the winner, the best result for &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Aguri"&gt;Super Aguri&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; team.

With ten laps to go, the most surprising event was Kimi's resistance when his open wheels untimely overlapped with Michael's, especially when one knows Kimi will run with Ferrari next season.

Former &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;n Prime Minister Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AMahathir%20Mohamad"&gt;Mahathir Mohamad&lt;/a&gt; has said that he will not stop his criticism of the Malaysian government, even after "peace talks" were held yesterday between him and current Prime Minister Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20Badawi"&gt;Abdullah Badawi&lt;/a&gt;.

The 82-year old political veteran, who's now known for publicly regretting his handing of power to Dr. Badawi, said that the atmosphere during the dialogue was "cordial", but added that he was not entirely pleased with the results.
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; I can't say I am happy, I am satisfied I am able to say these things directly to him...I will continue to criticise if I feel something is done which is not beneficial to the country...

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – Dr. Mahathir Mohamad&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Political analysts have hailed the meeting as an opportunity for the two leaders to thrash out their differences in private, but some fear that their differences have already divided them beyond quick resolution.

More bones were discovered on Sunday, October 22 in manholes and utility areas on the site of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Center"&gt;World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt;. The people are believed to have fallen victim to the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;. 

City and utility officials have already excavated about five underground areas, yielding at least 100 pieces of humanoid remains. Twelve more areas are expected to be excavated.

"They will go through every grain, every piece of material carefully, and sift through it," said Deputy Mayor Ed Skyler, who is overseeing the recovery effort.

Skyler said the city will focus on finding remains before it reviews how the initial search was handled. He said construction at ground zero did not need to be halted to accommodate the search, but that officials would address the need if it arises. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Mayor Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; has also stated that construction would not be halted.

Amid the official celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the anti-stalinist &lt;a href="Hungary"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956"&gt;uprising of 1956&lt;/a&gt;, a group of about three thousand people who are calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister, Mr. &lt;a href="w%3AFerenc%20Gyurcs%C3%A1ny"&gt;Ferenc Gyurcsány&lt;/a&gt;, are being blocked from entering &lt;a href="w%3ALajos%20Kossuth%20Square"&gt;Kossuth square&lt;/a&gt;. 

The square, in front of the Parliament building, has been the venue of anti-Gyurcsány protests for weeks and also hosted the October 23 official state rally. The police (some of them mounted) have used tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets against the demonstrators. 

The tearful demonstrators have used some of the props of the celebrations to build barricades and even started up a tank, parked in the center of town to recall the events in 1956. 

The demonstrators have been forced to withdraw along Alkotmány utca, Bajcsy-Zsilinszky út and &lt;a href="w%3ASmall%20Boulevard%20%28Budapest%29"&gt;Károly körút&lt;/a&gt; in the direction of the separate memorial rally convened by the main opposition party, &lt;a href="w%3AFidesz%20%E2%80%93%20Hungarian%20Civic%20Union"&gt;Fidesz&lt;/a&gt;, on Astoria square. The tens of thousands there seem to be peacefully sympathetic to the cause of the dispersed demonstrators.

There seem to be several wounded among both the demonstrators and the police.

The ♡❤Scotsman♡❤ uncovers what it calls "a largely-unannounced propaganda campaign" by John Reid, the UK &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, intended to prevent the spread of extremism among young British Muslims. Islamic teachers and preachers have been recruited to put the case against violence and promote moderation. The media used for this campaign include a website - The Radical Middle Way, events held in different parts of the country, courses of lectures, pod casts, and CDs. Listed among the supporters of this campaign, which include a number of book shops. food providers and charities, are the &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Office"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office"&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office&lt;/a&gt;.

One Home Office source is quoted as saying that "...there are forces within this country trying to manipulate the feeling of British Muslims, and we have to do more to combat those forces". 

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; Tony Blair is said to have instructed Ministers to look beyond the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain"&gt;Muslim Council of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; and engage with all streams of Muslim opinion.

Trevor Phillips, chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommission%20for%20Racial%20Equality"&gt;Commission for Racial Equality&lt;/a&gt; is reported as saying on BBC 1's Sunday AM programme that he would not want to be a Muslim, because what should have been a proper conversation between all kinds of British people "seems to have turned into a trial of one particular community, and that can't be right".

What stimulated the rush to the studios of politicians and Ministers to give their opinions on Muslim culture was the objection that the Leader of the House of Commons, Jack Straw had, to women wearing the full veil when attending his surgery.

The annual Living Planet Report compiled by the &lt;a href="w%3AZoological%20Society%20of%20London"&gt;Zoological Society of London&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Footprint%20Network"&gt;Global Footprint Network&lt;/a&gt;, published this week by &lt;a href="w%3AWWF%20International"&gt;WWF International&lt;/a&gt;, assessed "the health of the planet's ecosystems" and measured the demands people make on the planet's resources.

The Living Planet Index is based on population trends between 1970 and 2003 of over 3 600 populations of more than 1 300 vertebrate species from around the world. There has been an overall decline of around 30 per cent over the 33-year period. Tropical species populations declined by around 55 per cent on average from 1970 to 2003, while temperate species populations, have shown little overall change. 

The Ecological Footprint measures the area of biologically productive land and sea required to sustian humanity. In 2003 this was 14.1 billion global hectares, or 2.2 global hectares per person (a global hectare is a hectare with world-average ability to produce resources and absorb wastes). The total supply of productive area, or biocapacity, in 2003 was 11.2 global hectares, or 1.8 global hectares per person. Demand overshot supply first in the 1980s and has been increasing every year since, By 2003 the overshoot was about 25 per cent. Thus, it took approximately a year and three months for the Earth to produce the ecological resources humanity used in that year. 

The Living Planet Index and the Ecological Footprint, along with other measures, have been adopted as indicators for the 2010 targets of the &lt;a href="w%3AConvention%20on%20Biological%20Diversity"&gt;Convention on Biological Diversity&lt;/a&gt;. 

The report concludes with a description of the roles of the various disciplines required to "shift humanity's current trajectory on to a path that will remain within the biological capacity of the planet".
James P. Leape, the Director General of &lt;a href="w%3AWWF"&gt;WWF&lt;/a&gt; International summarises: "The message of these two indices is clear and urgent: we have been exceeding the Earth's ability to support our lifestyles for the past 20 years, and we need to stop. We must balance our consumption with the natural world's capacity to regenerate and absorb our wastes. If we do not, we risk irreversible damage".

Cyclist &lt;a href="w%3AFloyd%20Landis"&gt;Floyd Landis&lt;/a&gt;, who finished first in the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; but is fighting a positive &lt;a href="w%3Adoping"&gt;doping&lt;/a&gt; test that would strip him of the title, is now pushing his case on the Internet. Facing an appeal before the United States Anti-Doping Agency next year, Landis dubbed this approach "the Wikipedia defense".

Landis said on October 12, 2006 that he had published a number of documents in the case "to support his innocence in the alleged positive doping test". These included his attorney's motion for dismissal, a document package containing test information, and a PowerPoint presentation criticizing the test. This action earned considerable but sometimes-skeptical media coverage in the ongoing saga over the disputed race.

Landis did not set up an actual wiki, but attempted to draw on the collective resources of cycling fans, using the Internet to allow widely distributed review of evidence in his case. He succeeded in getting the community to establish its own wiki independent of him personally, based largely on the Daily Peloton Forum discussions noted below. The topic had already drawn intense interest in a variety of places, including Landis's Wikipedia entry, which has figured as something of a battleground. The release serves as both a public relations strategy and a way to potentially strengthen his appeal. As Landis put it, "Why turn down free brainpower?"

In anticipation of the release of these documents, Landis had been personally posting on the forums at the Daily Peloton cycling website. He is largely out of action while rehabilitating from hip resurfacing surgery performed in September. As the documents were about to be released, Landis said, "I am sure you guys will find every mistake, even things we haven't noticed."

In forum discussions, Landis agreed with sympathetic posters who pointed to this as a "wisdom of crowds" approach, while asking others not to judge him based on incomplete information from media reports. He encouraged people to look at all of the evidence, saying, "We'll call it the Wikipedia defense, and I would have given everything to you sooner but had a very hard time selling the idea to the lawyers." At the same time, he said that not all of his arguments against the test had been revealed: "We are not going to compromise our defense by telling all of it."

♡❤Firefly♡❤ premiered and was cancelled in 2002 after 11 episodes aired. Many fans who watched and enjoyed the short-lived show were part of a &lt;a href="w%3Acult%20following"&gt;cult following&lt;/a&gt; that encouraged &lt;a href="w%3AJoss%20Whedon"&gt;Joss Whedon&lt;/a&gt; to create a film called "Serenity" in 2005. There are no current plans for a sequel or the revival of the ♡❤Firefly♡❤ series.

&lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, a media advocacy group out of Paris, has released its Worldwide Press Freedom Index for 2006. The most free countries are &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. The least free, ranking 168th, is &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, whose media is completely controlled by leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Jong-il"&gt;Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; ranks 53rd equal with other countries: &lt;a href="Botswana"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Tonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;, slipping nine places from last year. The US was in 17th place when the Index was first released in 2002. US press rights violations cited by Reporters Without Borders include &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Jazeera"&gt;al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; cameraman &lt;a href="w%3ASami%20al-Haj"&gt;Sami al-Haj&lt;/a&gt;, who has been held without trial in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; since June 2002, and the imprisonment of &lt;a href="w%3AJosh%20Wolf%20%28journalist%29"&gt;Josh Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, a freelance journalist who refused to turn over footage of a protest to a grand jury.

Reporters Without Borders compiles its Press Freedom Index by "assessing the state of press freedom in each country ... such as murders, imprisonment, physical attacks and threats ... censorship, confiscation of issues, searches and harassment." It does not judge the quality of the press.

<h1>U.S. mid-term election to host gay marriage referendum in Virginia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20mid-term%20election%20to%20host%20gay%20marriage%20referendum%20in%20Virginia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The U.S. &lt;a href="w%3Agay%20marriage"&gt;gay marriage&lt;/a&gt; debate will face yet another test in &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; with the up-coming November 7 mid-term elections. 

The yes or no vote cast by Virginians on the referendum will decide whether Article 1, Section 15 (of the Bill of Rights) of the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Virginia"&gt;Constitution of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; would be amended to include the following text:

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; That only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this Commonwealth and its political subdivisions.This Commonwealth and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage. Nor shall this Commonwealth or its political subdivisions create or recognize another union, partnership, or other legal status to which is assigned the rights, benefits, obligations, qualities, or effects of marriage.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – ♡❤Section 15-A. Marriage♡❤ which is proposed to be amended to ♡❤Article I of the Constitution of Virginia ♡❤&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Currently, Section 15 of the Virginia Bill of Rights is titled ♡❤Qualities necessary to preservation of free government♡❤. The referendum, if passed, will take effect January 1, 2007, and would put the above text in a sub-section, Section 15-A, following language that describes "a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue".

Virginia governor &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Kaine"&gt;Tim Kaine&lt;/a&gt;, who says he does not support gay marriage, along with his wife and father-in-law, former Va. governor Linwood Holton and his wife, presented themselves outside the executive mansion in a press briefing Tuesday as a family unified against the broad, anti-same-sex marriage language of the referendum.

"It would invite protracted court challenges in areas including contracts, custody cases and end-of-life decisions," Kaine said of the referendum, according to the ♡❤Richmond Times-Dispatch♡❤.

Bob McDonnell, the Virginia General Attorney wrote in a 13-page legal opinion in September this year, that legal rights raised by the constitutionally of what would be defined as 'unmarried couples' are separate from those granted by the institution of marriage. "The general legal rights to enter into contracts, wills, advance medical directives, shared equity agreements and other legal instruments are not rights that arise from marriage," according to his opinion.

A recent poll by &lt;a href="w%3AMason-Dixon%20Polling%20%26amp%3B%20Research%20Inc."&gt;Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research&lt;/a&gt; finds that there is still a majority in favor of the amendment. There are also clear distinctions between northern Virginians, who tend to oppose, and southern Virginians, who tend to support the amendment.

♡❤Note: All dollar figures are in AU$ unless otherwise stated.♡❤

Victorian Premier Steve Bracks and federal Treasurer Peter Costello unveiled the project to build world's largest solar plant on October 25.

The $420 million plant will sit on 900 ha of land and produce 154 megawatts. It will use mirrored panels to concentrate light.

It is expected to reach full capacity in 2013.

The Victorian Government will contribute $50 million to the plant. The Federal government will contribute $75 million out of its $500 million low emissions technology demonstration fund (LETDF).

LETDF is also contibuting $50 million towards a $360 million pilot for a brown coal drying and a post-combustion carbon dioxide capture and storage project at the International Powers' Hazelwood facility in Gippsland.

&lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; international, &lt;a href="w%3AMateja%20Ke%C5%BEman"&gt;Mateja Kežman&lt;/a&gt;, will sign a three year contract with &lt;a href="w%3AFenerbah%C3%A7e"&gt;Fenerbahçe&lt;/a&gt; today. The striker spent an unsuccessful season with &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; and all three parties have agreed to this 7 million Euro transfer.

Kežman started his career in Serbia and Montenegro, where he became popular while playing for &lt;a href="w%3A%20FK%20Partizan"&gt;Partizan, Belgrade&lt;/a&gt;. He was bought by the Dutch team &lt;a href="w%3A%20PSV%20Eindhoven"&gt;PSV&lt;/a&gt;, where he was a prolific striker, setting a record number of goals per season. His year in Chelsea was not as successful, as he mostly started games as a substitute and managed to score only seven goals in official games.

Other teams that demonstrated an interest in Kežman this summer included &lt;a href="w%3ASevilla%20FC"&gt;Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOlympique%20de%20Marseille"&gt;Olympique de Marseille&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFC%20Schalke%2004"&gt;Schalke 04&lt;/a&gt;.

Kežman led &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;'s scoring during the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; qualifications with 5 goals, including the only goal in the final game against &lt;a href="w%3ABosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt; which in turn allowed Serbia and Montenegro to qualify directly, having come first in their group. He has managed 16 goals in 45 caps for Serbia and Montenegro, as of December 2005.

He failed to make an impact with the London club, and only started 14 games for Chelsea, leaving for &lt;a href="Atl%C3%A9tico%20de%20Madrid"&gt;Atlético de Madrid&lt;/a&gt; after just one season. Despite his disappointing year, Chelsea made a transfer profit on the player. After a short spell in Madrid, Fenerbahçe SK trusted in "Batman" and signed him to a three year contract in August 2006. The management and fans knew he was a risky transfer, especially considering he was to fill the void of departed superstar Nicolas Anelka. The management's faith seemed to pull through as Kežman quickly found his PSV-form back again and scored in consecutive matches early into the season. Kežman scored 3 crucial goals in his first 3 matches (2 were Game-winning and 1 was Game-tying). All three were beautiful strikes and won weekly honours.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Army%20of%20East%20Timor%20calls%20UN%20police%20action%20a%20coup&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The latest outbreak of violence has caused the death of at least two people according to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, as hundreds of people engaged in fighting near &lt;a href="w%3APresidente%20Nicolau%20Lobato%20International%20Airport"&gt;Díli's airport&lt;/a&gt; since Tuesday night. There is a fear that the violence will dramatically escalate after a martial arts gang leader was executed on a &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Díli&lt;/a&gt; street, where for weeks rival gangs have fought fiercely.

<h3>State television goes off the air</h3>
The &lt;a href="w%3ARadio-Televis%C3%A3o%20Timor%20Leste"&gt;national telvision network&lt;/a&gt; went off the air last night, just as the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20East%20Timor"&gt;East Timor army&lt;/a&gt; was preparing to address the nation declaring its troops should no longer be confined to barracks because of the lawlessness. 

The feeling amongst the army's top brass is that the earlier forced resignation of former &lt;a href="w%3AMari%20Alkatiri"&gt;Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri&lt;/a&gt; in June amounted to a coup and that it should be investigated.

This latest unrest began on Sunday, sparked by a UN report which blamed the former Prime Minister for the factional violence earlier this year that killed more than 30 people.

<h3>Australians caught up in the violence</h3>

UN spokesman, Adrian Edwards, told reporters that the situation was volatile. "We've seen ... reports of people being injured and some being brought to the hospital," he said. "We've also heard reports of possible other fatalities, but those are not confirmed at the moment. "We're waiting to see, once we get a clearer picture of them. "But right at the moment, I think the operations to bring it under control are ongoing." &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; soldiers shot at a man today; he escaped unharmed.

An Australian citizen had to be flown back home to Darwin Hospital, after suffering injuries. Australia's Foreign Affairs Department has warned Australians to exercise extreme caution if they go to Timor, and that Australians or Australian interests could be targeted.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;New Jersey Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; has handed down its verdict in &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20v.%20Harris"&gt;Lewis v. Harris&lt;/a&gt;. The details are: &lt;a href="w%3Ahomosexual"&gt;homosexual&lt;/a&gt; couples are entitled to the same rights and privileges as &lt;a href="w%3Aheterosexual"&gt;heterosexual&lt;/a&gt; couples, but also said that totally legalizing gay marriages in the state will be up to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Legislature"&gt;New Jersey Legislature&lt;/a&gt; who have 180 days to determine whether or not the state's constitution shall be rewritten to include gay marriages or civil unions.

"The issue is not about the transformation of the traditional definition of marriage, but about the unequal dispensation of benefits and privileges to one of two similarly situated classes of people," said the court.

"Although we cannot find that a fundamental right to same-sex marriage exists in this state, the unequal dispensation of rights and benefits to committed same-sex partners can no longer be tolerated under our state Constitution," said one of the judges, Justice Barry T. Albin.

The decision passed in a ruling of 4 support and 3 non-support votes.

In 2004, the state ruled that domestic relationships are allowed and that gay couples get some of the benefits that come along with marriage including the right to inherit their partner's belongings if a will was not written and health insurance if one or the other works for the state.

If the state decides to allow same sex marriages, it would be the second state in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to completely legalize gay marriages. &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; was the first and only state thus far to legalize gay marriages while some states such as &lt;a href="w%3AConnecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; have legalized civil unions.

Documents missing from the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory"&gt;Los Alamos National Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; have been found on a USB Flash Drive during a drug bust located inside the Los Alamos trailer park, Royal Crest on October 17 and contain what police say are "classified material." The drives were marked with symbols that indicated they belonged to the Los Alamos Laboratory.

Los Alamos has since confirmed that a breach has occurred and that at least three computer drives from the laboratory were confiscated during the raid.

"During the course of the search, officers realized that some of the items seized appeared to belong to the Los Alamos National Laboratory," said a statement by the Los Alamos County Police Department.

A subcontractor, Justin Stone, 20 was involved in the breach of security at the lab and according to Michael Anastasio, the lab's director, there is an "ongoing investigation." Stone was working in Technical Area 55, an area of the lab where &lt;a href="w%3Aplutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt; is kept or the X Division, where data for the designs of nuclear bombs are kept. Stone says that he was not aware of what the drives contained saying, "I have no idea what's on it because I didn't get a chance to look." Stone also says that he acquired one of the drives a year ago when he traded drugs for the drive and that drive also contained information from Los Alamos Laboratory. Stone had only been living with a female friend, Jessica Quintana for no more than three weeks and was with his girlfriend Jessica Collins when police raided the home.

"I vaguely remember it contained information about nuclear waste sites around Los Alamos. I erased it and used the drive for myself," added Stone.

Quintana, who also worked in the laboratory as an archivist, was being investigated by the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; for charges relating to methamphetamine type offenses and was arrested when authorities executed an arrest warrant for the female. Police say a "large amount" of methamphetamine paraphernalia was discovered in her trailer during a raid by the FBI. Pipes with the remains of &lt;a href="w%3Amethamphetamine"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; were also found at the scene and Quintana also admitted that the items belonged to her.

"This is a serious matter, and we are taking immediate steps to address it. We intend to do everything possible to guard against any criminal activity, particularly where a breach of security may be involved. We have already taken a number of steps to address potential security risks," said Anastasio in a statement.

Drug paraphernalia along with methamphetamine drugs were also seized during the bust. Police were initially responding to a call of a domestic disturbance between Stone and his girlfriend which Stone denies was taking place.

Former &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChoi%20Kyu-hah"&gt;Choi Kyu-hah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; died in Seoul on October 22, 2006. He was 87 years old.

Choi was found unconscious in his home by a nurse at 6 a.m. local time (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; +9) on Sunday morning and was rushed to Seoul National University Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead at 7:37 a.m. Doctors said that he died from acute heart failure.

Choi became acting President after then-President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APark%20Chung%20Hee"&gt;Park Chung Hee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was assassinated on October 26, 1979. He was officially sworn as the 10th President in December of the same year following a military coup, but resigned that post on August 16, 1980. After his resignation, he refused to discuss the coup in much detail.

Born in Wonju, Gangwon Province, on July 16, 1919, Choi was a graduate in English language and literature from Tokyo Teachers College and worked as a professor at the Teachers College of Seoul National University for a short time after the end of Japanese rule in Korea in 1945. He entered politics in 1946 and served as foreign minister from 1967 to 1975 and prime minister from 1975 to 1979.

Choi was buried in Daejeon National Cemetery after a state funeral. His wife, Hong Gi, died in 2004 but her remains were exhumed from the current burial site in Wonju and buried next to those of her husband.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOakland%2C%20California"&gt;Oakland, California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
A developer's recent glossy sales brochure hails the Coliseum Gardens housing development in East Oakland as the most comprehensive development to date for one of Oakland's largest nonprofit housing developers, but close scrutiny of the project reveals that only 4 out of the 178 low-income public housing families displaced by the development actually managed to return to the newly rebuilt housing complex that was recently christened as Lion Creek Crossings. 

Phase 1 of the 20 acre project at the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek Crossings mixed income housing development was completed in June of 2006, with phase 4 of the development expected to be completed by December 2008. 

Documents reveal that as an effort to reduce violence and drug trafficking within and around the Coliseum and Lockwood communities of Oakland, the HOPE VI program enabled the Oakland Housing Authority (OHA) to use nearly $61 million in federal funding to displace Oakland's low-income communities from the above mentioned locations. 

These projects are only a small part of what is known as the Oakland Coliseum Redevelopment Area, which is approximately 11 square miles in size, extending from 22nd Ave., all the way to the San Leandro City limits, and is located between E. 14th St., and the Oakland Estuary/Airport. 

The OHA's Board of Commissioners approved the selection of the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation (EBALDC), the Related Companies of California (Related Companies), and Chambers General Construction as co-developers of the Coliseum Gardens public housing site during its board meeting on October 21, 2002. As partners in the development project, the OHA owns the land, and the developers own the buildings.

As a result of the OHA approval, local nonprofit housing developer EBALDC and Related Companies, LLC., out of New York City, created Creekside Housing Partners, L.P., to take control of Oakland's public housing property at the Coliseum Gardens site.

After the eviction of 178 families and the demolition of their 178 public housing units during 2004, Creekside Housing Partners (CHP) moved as quickly as possible to rebuild and finish off "phase 1," of their project. Phase 1 of the development is managed by Related Companies, the tenants pay their rents to the New York based firm, and during the past 6 months the developers have moved people into 115 newly rebuilt housing units at the development.

Twima Early works at the management office of Related Companies located at Lion Creek Crossings and was eager to help shed some light on whats been going on at the newly privatized public housing site in East Oakland. 

In an October 18 interview, Twima Early said, "During the past 6 months, we have completed phase 1 of our project and moved people into 115 housing units at our new development. Out of the 178 families who were originally displaced by our project, the OHA sent us a list of 13 families who were eligible to move back into this location, and only 4 of those families actually moved into our new development." 

"It seemed odd that the Housing Authority would only allow 13 families to move back into this location, and I can't explain why so few were allowed to return," said Early. 

When Randy Shaw of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic learned how few of the original public housing tenants that were actually allowed to move back into the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek housing development, he said, "The Hope VI program has once again proved to be the major cause of the displacement of low-income people. I've never heard of numbers so skewed before in regards to the displacement of families who were promised that the Hope VI project would be beneficial to them."

Since 1994, Oakland officials and the Federal Government have targeted Oakland's poor with nearly $84 million in federal funding through the Hope VI program.

The privatization of Oakland's public housing units have been occurring at a rapid pace. When wealthy billionaire Stephen M. Ross, CEO of Related Companies, teamed up with local nonprofit housing developer EBALDC to re-develop the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek housing complex, it became apparent that the developers made out much better than the displaced families did. 

Carlos Castellanos of EBALDC is involved in the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek development, and when I asked how did this project benefit the families who used to reside there or how is the City of Oakland benefitting from the displacement of so many families, Castellanos said, "These are loaded questions and not something that I want to talk about. I think that a lot of those tenants did not really want to move back, and I think that you really need to talk to the Housing Authority to find out what happened to all of those families." 

Vivian Haine resided in a public housing unit near the Coliseum Gardens site, and said, "About a year ago, Kim Boyd the site manager where I resided at, told me that I'm lucky to be living here even if there is no money for repairs at this building, because they didn't have enough funding to finish off the project at Coliseum Gardens, and most of the evicted tenants had no where to go. I believe that many of the families displaced from the Coliseum Gardens development couldn't find any housing to move into and may have become homeless," Haine said. 

Records show that on June 24, 2006, the OHA's Board of Commissioners approved the use of market rate rents in its Project-Based Section 8 program at the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek development, to cover a $600,000 funding shortfall after the EBALDC/Related Companies claimed that they needed more money to complete phase 3 of the project. 

A Sept. 19, 2006, OHA memo mentions that EBALDC/Related Companies are co-developing the rental portion at Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek Crossings site, which will include 157 units of public housing. The total number of rental units, including public housing, now planned is approximately 440 units, plus another 28 units of for-sale housing which are planned to be developed by Chambers Construction Company. 

With the demolition of 178 public housing units by the developers, and only 157 public housing units being rebuilt at the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek Crossings housing site, theres been a net loss of 21 public housing units at this location.

The OHA and City of Oakland continue to funnel millions of dollars to the EBALDC/Related Companies partnership, in an effort to privatize part of Oakland's public housing program in East Oakland.

Since its inception, the Hope VI program has resulted in the demolition of more than 120,000 public housing units across the nation, only to be replaced by 40,000 mixed income units, and less than 12% of the displaced families have managed to gain entry back into the locations they were originally evicted from. In order to make way for the new housing projects being developed that resulted in the privatization of the nation's public housing properties, around 30% of the displaced families are given Section 8 vouchers, 49% are moved into other public housing units, and most of the rest of the tenants often end up losing their rental assistance.

In an interview earlier today, the leader of the recent political &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Thailand%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat"&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Sonthi%20Boonyaratglin"&gt;General Sonthi Boonyaratglin&lt;/a&gt;, said that he could not find solid evidence to support corruption charges against ousted Prime Minister &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;.

"It will be difficult to implicate him," said General Boonyaratglin. He added that he is "not sure how far the Office of the Auditor General can investigate suspected corruption cases involving him. They might get to nowhere at all...We cannot impound the money he made with accountable legal evidence, but can only look for some possible hidden (evidence) with questionable background..."

General Sonthi also justified the bloodless coup of September 19 by saying that the rampant corruption in Thailand was undermining democracy there.

After the coup, General Sonthi quickly reinstated the country's corruption watchdog to work alongside his own team of investigators to find evidence of corruption in Mr. Thaksin's leadership. 

In addition to corruption, General Sonthi also cited the Thaksin administration's perceived lack of respect for the king as another reason to have staged the coup. He said that 
"Soldiers are obliged to protect the national security, safeguard the nation, and uphold loyalty to the monarchy. The military cannot tolerate any leaders who lack or have limited loyalty to the king..."

Insulting the 78-year-old monarch, who has spent 60 years on the throne, is considered a very serious crime in Thailand.

The general has admitted that the military could lose public support if no evidence is found to support the accusations.

Mr. Shinawatra is currently living in exile in London.

Three unidentified men have been accused of kidnapping a young Israeli woman in &lt;a href="w%3AKarmiel"&gt;Karmiel&lt;/a&gt; last Monday, and driving her to &lt;a href="w%3ASafed"&gt;Safed&lt;/a&gt; where they allegedly raped her repeatedly, over several hours.

They then drove her back to where they took her from and she found her way to Nahariya hospital, where she has been hospitalized for several days and required several operations for her injuries.

The police suspect that the men are a gang of serial rapists who committed several other rapes in Karmiel recently.

The victim stated that the men were &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arab&lt;/a&gt; and drove a white BMW.

A "critical" campaign ad, launched by the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;, that took a swipe at &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; has been pulled.

"Canada can take care of &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;," a man in the television ad says. "They're not busy."

The ad's purpose was to blast Democratic Senate candidate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarold%20Ford%20Jr"&gt;Harold Ford Jr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who is running against Republican &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Corker"&gt;Bob Corker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The comment about Canada is secondary to the ad's first purpose.

An official for the Republican National Committee told &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the ad had been pulled because it had "run its course," just one day after party chairman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Mehlman"&gt;Ken Mehlman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defended the ad and said it would continue to run.

"Just imagine if I registered a complaint every time my country or president was criticized," said the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Wilkins"&gt;David Wilkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . "Compare that (one ad) with the criticism early this year during the (federal) election that happened every day in Canada ...ads that were run consistently throughout your country."

A source within the Canadian government told the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Press"&gt;Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that Canadian ambassador to the U.S. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Wilson%20%28politician%29"&gt;Michael Wilson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to remind the Republicans of the heavy load Canada is carrying in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Embassy%20in%20Washington"&gt;Canadian Embassy in Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been on an advertising campaign, plastering subway stations in Washington with posters depicting Canadian troops in Afghanistan. There is also a website featuring military cooperation between Canada and the U.S.

The Canadian ambassador to the U.S. has issued a complaint to Washington in response to the television ad.

The 30 second ad (see source below) can now be viewed on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Foreign affairs minister &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20MacKay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt; was accused last week of calling Liberal MP &lt;a href="w%3ABelinda%20Stronach"&gt;Belinda Stronach&lt;/a&gt; a "dog" in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;.

Stronach, a &lt;a href="w%3Afeminist"&gt;feminist&lt;/a&gt;, said the comment was offensive to all women.

NDP leader &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt; said on Saturday that MacKay should apologise or resign.

MacKay said that he did not call her a dog. "I made no such gesture. I made no derogatory or discriminatory remark toward any member of the House," MacKay said yesterday in the House of Commons.

Despite MacKay's comment, the Liberals are still asking for an apology.

A wildfire has been reported near &lt;a href="w%3APalm%20Springs%2C%20California"&gt;Palm Springs, California&lt;/a&gt;. 

At least 4 &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Forest%20Service"&gt;United States Forest Service&lt;/a&gt; firefighters were killed and 1 seriously injured, with burns on nearly 95% of his body. The firefighters were overcome by fire while attempting to put out a blaze inside a home. The fire has burned nearly 10,000 acres and has destroyed 5 houses including 5 other buildings.

"We had a lot of fire activity overnight. Normally the fire dies down and the winds let up but that didn't happen last night. It burned like it was daytime," said California Department of Forestry spokesman, Bill Peters.

"[The] chances of survival are low when you have that bad of an injury," said Arrowhead Regional Medical Centre surgeon, Doctor Dev Gnanadev who also added that the firefighter has suffered "severe respiratory damage."

Witnesses have reported that 2 males were seen leaving the area of the fire at 1:00 a.m. on Thursday morning.

Authorities have determined that the blaze was due to arson and are offering a $500,000 [USD] reward for information leading to an arrest, but no information on how or why the fire was set has been released. Authorities say that murder could be among the arson charges who whoever is responsible.

"This is an arson fire. This is a deliberately set arson fire," said California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention, John Hawkins.

Nearly 1,000 people have been evacuated from the area.

&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Adams"&gt;Scott Adams&lt;/a&gt;, creator of the popular U.S comic strip ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADilbert"&gt;Dilbert&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, posted Tuesday in his blog that he spontaneously recovered from &lt;a href="w%3ASpasmodic%20Dysphonia"&gt;Spasmodic Dysphonia&lt;/a&gt;, a voice disorder that rendered him incapable of speech.

His blog post, titled ♡❤Good News Day♡❤, describes various efforts he had undergone to self-treat the disorder and "re-map" his brain connections to normal speech. According to Adams, the condition was described to him by a specialist who diagnosed it as incurable.

Hundreds of well wishers have commented with support on his blog page after what Adams said was an 18-month-long battle with the affliction.

"My theory was that the part of my brain responsible for normal speech was still intact, but for some reason had become disconnected from the neural pathways to my vocal cords," Adams wrote.

In what Adams wrote was the "weirdest part of this phenomenon", is a person's ability with the disorder to sing, or to speak in public, or in other contexts of vocal interaction, but not in normal conversation. 

For him, the breakthrough to recovery came with the rhyming found in poetry. By reciting ♡❤"Jack be nimble, Jack be quick. Jack jumped over the candlestick."♡❤ he was able to find the reinforcement to talk again.

Following fears earlier this month that, in &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFlu%20vaccine"&gt;flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; would not be available for all those due to be &lt;a href="w%3Avaccination"&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; this autumn, a contributor to the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Medical%20Journal"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ now wants resources diverted from vaccination towards research to establish the efficacy of vaccination.

There have been warnings that production problems have delayed delivery of sufficient vaccine to complete the programme on time. The &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Health%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; had said there should be enough doses in the long-term but some patients would have to wait. This is the third year in which this problem has arisen. 

Now writing in the ♡❤British Medical Journal♡❤, Tom Jefferson, a coordinator at Cochrane Vaccines Field, Rome, calls for resources to be diverted from vaccinating people to research into the value of vaccination. Criticising the present policy, calling it "availability creep", Mr. Jefferson says that "it uses up resources that could be invested in a proper evaluation of &lt;a href="w%3AInfluenza"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; vaccines or on other &lt;a href="health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; interventions of proven effectiveness". 

Another paper, of which T. Jefferson is a co-author, accepts that vaccinating the elderly in institutions reduces the complications of influenza and vaccinating healthy persons under 60 reduces cases of influenza.

Youths attacked &amp; burned three buses in western Paris suburbs.

A gang of about 30 youths stopped each bus with a road block, forced passengers off, doused the bus with petrol and set it ablaze, destroying the bus and causing damage to cars parked nearby. When firefighters arrived, the youths threw stones at them.

No injuries were reported in the Paris attacks, but one woman was seriously burned in a related attack in Marseilles. There has been one arrest for the Paris attacks.

The attacks mark the one year anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;2005 French riots&lt;/a&gt;, when cars and public buildings were set on fire, mostly by young North African Muslims immigrants.

Antonis Tsipropoulos (Αντώνης Τσιπρόπουλος), the administrator of the &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; blog aggregating service blogme.gr, has been sued, arrested and jailed, because one of the linked &lt;a href="w%3ARSS%20%28file%20format%29"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds on his site had satirical content. Although the service was unrelated in any way other than linking to the allegedly offending blog, the blogme.gr server was shut down and its hard drives were confiscated.

Mr Tsipropoulos posted an explanation for the service's downtime, describing his arrest but naming neither the satirical blog nor the plaintiff. Tsipropoulos later removed the explanation at his lawyers' advice because it might appear to be contemptive to the authorities, because it stated that an aggregating service has nothing to do with the various feeds' content. Although Tsipropoulos gave no clues to the identity of the plaintiff, the only satirical blog known to appear in blogme.gr lampooned televangelist and national mysticist &lt;a href="w%3ADimosthenis%20Liakopoulos"&gt;Dimosthenis Liakopoulos&lt;/a&gt;. It is suspected that Liakopoulos is the plaintiff. More will be known in the upcoming trial.

Rap artist &lt;a href="w%3ASnoop%20Dogg"&gt;Snoop Dogg&lt;/a&gt; was arrested for possession of an illegal drug and possession of a firearm, according to police on Thursday.

The rapper's real name is Calvin Broadus. He was arrested at 3:45 p.m. on Thursday at &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Hope%20Airport"&gt;Bob Hope Airport&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3ABurbank%2C%20California"&gt;Burbank, California&lt;/a&gt;. Broadus paid the $35,000 bail and is expected back in Los Angeles County Superior Court on December 12, 2006.

Airport police officers stopped the artist for parking in the airport passenger loading and unloading zone. Upon conducting a search of the vehicle, the police found a gun and a quantity of &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; inside.

Broadus' attorney, Donald Etra, stated "There was no basis for this arrest. We believe that once this is cleared up, all charges will be dismissed". Authorities in California have not yet pressed charges.

In September, Broadus attempted to carry a folding police baton onto an aircraft and was arrested at &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Wayne%20Airport"&gt;John Wayne Airport&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Orange County, California&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, he was also cautioned for fighting in &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt;.

In the &lt;a href="w%3ANHL"&gt;NHL&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20Sabres"&gt;Buffalo Sabres&lt;/a&gt; beat the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Islanders"&gt;New York Islanders&lt;/a&gt; 3-0 in a shutout on Thursday night to tie the NHL record for the best start to a season. The current record holders are the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Maple%20Leafs"&gt;Toronto Maple Leafs&lt;/a&gt;.

"I mean, it's very exciting. I think we're all proud of what we've accomplished so far. But at the end of the day, it's not what we're aiming for down the road," said Daniel Briere, the co-captain for the Sabres.

"We want to be having these kinds of streaks in the playoffs. What we're doing now is carrying momentum. I think it will serve us well in the future, but right now we just need the points," said &lt;a href="w%3ARyan%20Miller"&gt;Ryan Miller&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Sabres goalies.

Currently Buffalo is 10-0-0 and is currently the top team in the NHL. They will play the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%20Thrashers"&gt;Atlanta Thrashers&lt;/a&gt;, who trail the Sabres by only 3 points in the NHL overall, on Saturday October 28. Beginning at the end of last season, the Sabres have won 15 games in a row.

The reward for the nation's worst arson-related attack was increased to $500,000 today after the arsonist caused four deaths to firefighters, and serious burn injuries to a fifth.

The injured firefighter has burns covering almost 90 percent of his body.

The blaze, which was ignited in uninhabited brushlands, dictated a mandatory evacuation of the thousands of civilians in the area and destroyed more than 24,000 acres of land.

No evidence has been produced to show an arsonist was involved, however an investigator, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that the person or people responsible could face first-degree murder charges.

Dale Bosworth, Chief of the US Forest Service released a public statement on the Forest Service website, "It is with deep sorrow that we learn of the deaths of four firefighters from the San Bernardino National Forest in California. Another firefighter is being treated for serious burns, suffered while the crew was battling a wind-whipped wildfire that drove hundreds of people from their homes. My heartfelt sympathies go out to these families, friends and loved one affected by this tragedy."

Theodore Vouyouklais, a Greek &lt;a href="w%3Apathologist"&gt;pathologist&lt;/a&gt; professor, has confirmed that the two children found dead in their hotel room in the Greek village of Gouvia on &lt;a href="w%3ACorfu"&gt;Corfu&lt;/a&gt; were killed by &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20monoxide%20poisoning"&gt;carbon monoxide poisoning&lt;/a&gt;. The two children were found dead next to their father, Neil Shepherd, and his partner Ruth Beatson, who had fallen unconscious. They have not yet received news of the children's deaths.

The children's biological mother, Sharon Wood, has been informed and visited their bodies on Saturday, along with a man believed to be her husband.

The family was found by a cleaner on Thursday morning. The current cause of the carbon monoxide emissions is unknown, however investigators have speculated that it was due to a hot water boiler in the next room to where the four family members were sleeping. This is, as yet, an unproven theory.

A war crimes court trying seven &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; servicemen heard written evidence from Mr Kifah Taha Musa Mutairi, one of eleven &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i detainees allegedly abused by British soldiers in a detention camp in &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. The court is also hearing evidence relating to the death, in custody, of an Iraqi hotel receptionist Mr. Baha Musa.

Mr. Mutairi died in what is said to have been an unrelated incident, when the roof of his house fell on him. 

The &lt;a href="w%3Acourt%20martial"&gt;court martial&lt;/a&gt; now in its fifth week, heard how Mr Mutari said he was treated three years ago in a holding camp in Basra. In written testimony, he said that prisoners had been given names of famous footballers and had been punished if they did not answer to them, even when woken from sleep. 

The prisoners, hooded and handcuffed, were beaten and kicked in the style of a &lt;a href="w%3Akickboxer"&gt;kickboxer&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Mutari testified that when he was kicked in this manner, he feared he would be beaten to death without any mercy whatever. 

He said that &lt;a href="w%3Apetrol"&gt;petrol&lt;/a&gt; had been rubbed on his nose and that he had been threatened with a lit cigarette lighter held close to his head, being told that he would be burned.

The death of hotel receptionist, Mr Baha Musa (26), another of the prisoners is of concern to the court. Mr Mutari's statement referred to how Mr Musa was treated, saying that he was beaten and constantly crying out in pain. It is said that British soldiers found arms, including grenades, &lt;a href="w%3AAK47"&gt;AK47&lt;/a&gt; rifles and Soviet uniforms, in the hotel where he was the receptionist. 
One of the accused, Corporal Donald Payne (35), has already pleaded guilty to crimes under the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court%20Act%202001"&gt;International Criminal Court Act 2001&lt;/a&gt;. The other defendants include Colonel Mendonca who is accused of failing to ensure that the detainees were not ill treated.

All the accused were members of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Queen%27s%20Lancashire%20Regiment"&gt;The Queen's Lancashire Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, now &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster%27s%20Regiment"&gt;The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers have finally tested a theory started by &lt;a href="w%3AEinstein"&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt; in 1906 and predicted in the 1930s on &lt;a href="w%3ABrownian%20motion"&gt;Brownian motion&lt;/a&gt;, the movement of small objects in water or air. The new results show if the tiny objects are rods, their actions are markedly different from the type of Brownian motion previously known.

The research was published in the Journal ♡❤Science♡❤ this week and is direct proof of the behavior. Brownian motion has also been used as a model to predict random behavior, such as the stock market. "It is such a profound and fundamental phenomenon that, as a physicist, I want to learn everything about [Brownian motion]," said Arjun Yodh, Physics professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Einstein first described Brownian motion in a paper in 1906, but only concentrated on the movement of little balls. He concluded that if a small ball, like a dust particle or equivalent in water, spun, that action didn't affect where the ball traveled. It turned out that its location could be predicted with statistics. The University of Pennsylvania scientists took this further and photographed teeny plastic rods moving in water instead. Using a &lt;a href="w%3Acharge%20coupled%20device"&gt;charge coupled device&lt;/a&gt;, or CCD camera, they took millions of pictures at a time, making a sort of movie of the motion. This way they could analyze the motion more directly. They found that the path of a spinning rod is directly related to its spin. 

Post-doc Yilong Han explained this by saying, "since ellipsoids are longer than they are wide, they experience more water resistance going in one direction than the other... It gives rise to the weird behavior we observed."

In terms of the practicality of the experiments, team physicist Tom Lubensky stated that the research was directed at obtaining fundamental understanding of a "ubiquitous and important phenomenon." It is not clear yet what practical applications this research will lead to. But it may help with understanding the mechanisms in cells, because proteins in living cells undergo Brownian motion in response to bumps by smaller molecules.

After discovering the strange movement, the lab rediscovered the work done by the French physicist Francis Perrin in the 1930s, predicting the exact motion the researchers had observed. "One of the exciting aspects of this work is the precise agreement between a relatively simple theory and experiments," said Tom Lubensky, Penn's chair of the physics department.

Public Law 109-364 allows the president to declare a state of emergency anywhere at any time and move &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; troops to suppress any public disorder. It also allows the president to take control of any state troops, forces, or national guard.

Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur responsible for public order in London told &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%20Five"&gt;BBC Radio Five&lt;/a&gt; he was concerned Britain had come to be seen as soft on extremist demonstrators.

He said that the police want additional powers, when approving demonstrations in the Capital, requiring demonstrators not to cover to their faces and to make the burning of flags a crime. There was no intention to interfere with the right of Muslim women to wear the veil.

He warned that, whether or not ministers decide on early changes in the law, senior officers would be ready to take a tougher line in dealing with flag-burners and extremists exploiting demonstrations in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AShahid%20Malik"&gt;Shahid Malik&lt;/a&gt;, recently elected Labour MP for &lt;a href="w%3ADewsbury"&gt;Dewsbury&lt;/a&gt;, is reported as saying "The burning of flags at demonstrations or pickets is quite clearly an act which has the power to incite violence".

Civil rights group &lt;a href="w%3ALiberty"&gt;Liberty&lt;/a&gt; described the proposed new laws as "unnecessary". &lt;a href="w%3AShami%20Chakrabarti"&gt;Shami Chakrabarti&lt;/a&gt;, Liberty's director, said: the police already have wide powers, especially for dealing with people wearing masks".

The &lt;a href="w%3AAttorney%20General"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Goldsmith"&gt;Lord Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt;, is preparing a package of announcements to be made in November.

&lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; severed links with &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Nelson"&gt;Terry Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican strategist, last night because he had connections to a controversial Republican Party advertisement in &lt;a href="w%3ATennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;. The ad's purpose was to blast Democratic Senate candidate &lt;a href="w%3AHarold%20Ford"&gt;Harold Ford&lt;/a&gt; Jr, who is running against Republican &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Corker"&gt;Bob Corker&lt;/a&gt;.

A blonde woman in the ad says, "I met Harold at the Playboy party". As the spot ends, she winks and says breathily: "Harold, call me!". The ad also "criticised" &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. "Canada can take care of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;," a man in the television ad says. "They're not busy."

Nelson and his company, CrossLink Strategy Group, were hired by Wal-Mart last year in an attempt to help the company.

&lt;a href="w%3AJesse%20Jackson"&gt;Jesse Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, an American politician, and other leaders signed a letter distributed by WakeUpWal-Mart.com, asking the company to end its relationship with Nelson.

In an interview with the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; Nelson said, "There was no intention to offend anybody and it's unfortunate if people took offense. That was certainly not what people planned for or hoped for."

A spokesman for Wal-Mart, David Tovar, issued a statement saying Nelson's company had "sent a letter to Wal-Mart ending its working relationship with our company."

The weekly &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; radio broadcast on Saturday featured &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; seat challenger &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Webb"&gt;James Webb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who said "I told you so," referring to his prediction before the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20war"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that, "our troops would become terrorist targets, and that there was no exit strategy because the people who were doing this did not intend to leave."

Calling the war a "strategic blunder", Webb said the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; administration should "make it clear that we have no intention to build permanent bases in Iraq." The presence of U.S. forces in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; destabilize the region, where their withdrawal would take the moral high ground away from {[w|Muslim}} insurgents, Webb said.
Webb also called on the Administration to open a diplomatic dialogue with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Iran, countries with a vested interest in the security of Iraq. "We could also encourage accountability among other nations in that region, who are now threatened by Iraq's instability and will benefit by a proper solution."

The too-close-to-call and hotly contested Senate race between Webb and incumbent Republican opponent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Allen"&gt;George Allen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is closely watched as Democrats try to gain majority control in both the Senate and House of Representatives in the November 7 mid-term election.

The mother of a &lt;a href="w%3Afirefighter"&gt;firefighter&lt;/a&gt; who died in his duties fighting the blaze in southern &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, has pleaded to the &lt;a href="w%3Aarsonist"&gt;arsonist&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the 40,450 acre inferno to give himself up, and that she will not judge him.

Bonnie McKay, mother to 27-year-old Jason McKay, said "I firmly believe you didn't believe that things were going to turn out the way they did, but they did. Don't let the remorse eat you alive. Come forward. I for one will try not to judge you. There is only one who can judge you."

The fire, which has claimed the lives of four firefighters and caused 95% burns to a fifth, is now 60% contained. There is a massive aerial attack on the fire in progress, making use of fire helicopters and planes to dump thousands of gallons of water onto the blaze over the canyons of &lt;a href="w%3ARiverside%20County"&gt;Riverside County&lt;/a&gt;. The blaze has now destroyed as many as 27 homes, and has forced the &lt;a href="w%3Aevacuation"&gt;evacuation&lt;/a&gt; of 500 more.

Incumbent &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoshe%20Katsav"&gt;Moshe Katsav&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been advised by his attorney-general, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMenachem%20Mazuz"&gt;Menachem Mazuz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to step down from his presidential duties and to hand over control of the country whilst police investigate allegations that he raped and sexually molested several female employees. The President denies the allegations.

Mazuz has issued the advisory to the president after police recommended filing charges of rape, sexual assault and fraud against the President after finding evidence to support the charges. 

The advisory asks the President to "consider suspending himself from duty by asking parliament to declare him temporarily incapacitated". Mazuz also commented that a trial would require Katsav to stand down pending a verdict. The justice ministry said "...it would be against procedure and propriety for the president to continue in office," after an indictment had been brought against him.

Katsav, however, has refused to give up his leadership and has said that he is innocent of any and all allegations against him.

"The president reiterates and emphasizes that he is a victim to a low plot spun against him and sooner or later it will be proven that the allegations against him are false stories and a lie, and the truth will be brought to light," said a statement released by Katsav's office.

"The president trusts his righteousness and innocence totally. The authorities must wait until the end of the investigation and for the attorney-general's final stand," added the statement.

The justice ministry is currently compiling the evidence against Katsav and deciding whether it warrants a prosecution. If the case is pursued, it would be the first prosecution of an incumbent Israeli president on felony charges. The president's office has declined to comment.

Repeated incidents of controversial approaches of &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; F-16 jets to &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; military vessels, as well as claims of the opposition parties that &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;'s government had tricked them into approving Germany's &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; mission cause ongoing controversies surrounding the historical deployment of Bundeswehr troops to the Middle East.

The latest event to hit the headlines today was an encounter of a German helicopter with two Israeli jets off the &lt;a href="w%3ALebanese"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; coast during the night of Thursday to Friday. While a speaker of the German Ministry of Defence described this incident as 'not threatening', it occurred only shortly after the German Minister of Defence, &lt;a href="w%3AFranz%20Josef%20Jung"&gt;Franz Josef Jung&lt;/a&gt;, was assured by his Israeli counterpart, &lt;a href="w%3AAmir%20Perez"&gt;Amir Perez&lt;/a&gt;, that no such approaches would be carried out any more. Previous events include Israeli jets aiming at a helicopter carrying the German commander of the &lt;a href="w%3AUNIFIL"&gt;UNIFIL&lt;/a&gt; sea forces and six F-16 passing a German vessel in low altitude presumably firing two rounds above it.

Meanwhile, German State Secretary of Defence &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Wichert"&gt;Peter Wichert&lt;/a&gt; is said to be under pressure over a growing row surrounding the German UNIFIL mandate: opposition politicians accuse the government of having misinformed them prior to the parliamentary approved for the Lebanon mission regarding the constraints of the German forces UN mandate. In particular, limited freedom to act within the 6-miles-zone of the Lebanese coast is seen as endangering the efficiency and feasibility of the Bundeswehr controlling arms smuggling. Peter Wichert apparently was responsible for an unclear statement which Angela Merkel supposedly sees as the cause of the current conflict.

Police are reporting that there has been a passenger jet crash near the &lt;a href="w%3ANigerian"&gt;Nigerian&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href="w%3AAbuja"&gt;Abuja&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AADC%20Airlines"&gt;ADC Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight to &lt;a href="w%3ASokoto"&gt;Sokoto&lt;/a&gt; crashed shortly after take-off. More than 100 passengers were on board, many are feared dead.

An emergency spokesperson has stated that the plane burst into flames shortly afterwards, although eyewitnesses believe that there are some survivors from the crash. The task of recovering the dead is underway.

The BBC reports, that the crash was caused by a storm, contradict the area's &lt;a href="w%3AMETAR"&gt;METAR&lt;/a&gt;, a standard form of aviation weather report, which indicated no major storm or bad weather in the area at the time of take-off. Winds were not severe and cloud cover was broken at 1200 feet, which would not impose a problem for passenger aircraft under normal operating conditions. However, multiple news agencies are reporting that a local radio station commented on bad weather at the time of the crash.

According to the airline's web site, the flight that crashed was Flight 53, a &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737&lt;/a&gt;, scheduled to take off from Abuja at 10:35 a.m. and land in Sokoto an hour later.

A local source said that the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji &lt;a href="w%3AMohammadu%20Maccido"&gt;Mohammadu Maccido&lt;/a&gt;, may have been on board. Senior government officials, senators, politicians and the son of one of Nigeria's former presidents were on board.

A Sokoto State government spokesman Mustapha Sheu said that the northern state's deputy governor, education commissioner and another senator were killed, along with the sultan and his son.

Sultan Muhammadu Maccido, revered as a leader of the Muslims in Nigeria and Niger, will be widely mourned. He will be remembered as the peace maker between sporadically warring Muslims and Christians in Nigeria. 

The local hospital reports that seven survivors have been admitted. One is in a critical condition.

After visiting the crash site, Federal Territory Minister Mallam Nasir el-Rufai told the BBC that the condition of the plane was "deplorable", with "bald tyres".

<h1>Deadly Typhoon Cimaron makes landfall in Luzon</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Deadly%20Typhoon%20Cimaron%20makes%20landfall%20in%20Luzon&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Typhoon Cimaron, known to those in the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; as Typhoon Paeng, made landfall on October 29 in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALuzon"&gt;Luzon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at around 1:00 UTC. Winds of 160&amp;nbsp;mph were sustained for one minute, were recorded shortly before landfall. Already, it has killed at least nineteen people, injured 58, and at least fifteen people may still be missing in the Philippines. Damage in the country is estimated to have reached $443 million pesos, or $8.8 million &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;United States dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (USD).

<h2>Impact</h2>

<h3>Deaths and other affects on people</h3>
So far, six people have been reported to have been drowned or killed by falling trees in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADinapigue"&gt;Dinapigue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsabela%20%28province%29"&gt;Isabela province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A further 15 people were injured there. 

One of those deaths may have been when waves spawned by Cimaron swept away a 19 year old female student, identified as Clarissa Otrera, while swimming near the shore, drowning her. Her two companions, one 18 years old, the other 20, were also swept away, and are still missing. Another girl, Gretchen Bautista of 15 years of age, was also swept into the open ocean along with Clarissa.

Otera and Bautista were rescued right away and taken to Magsingal District Hospital, where Otera was declared dead.

A search and rescue is under way for the two missing students.

A farmer of 29 years of age drowned when his boat overturned in Isabella, police said.

In addition, a 28 year old woman was killed along with her 6 year old child in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAurora%20province"&gt;Aurora province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Their hut was swept away by the powerful currents.

Three more people drowned in the town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKasibu"&gt;Kasibu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANeuva%20Vizcaya%20province"&gt;Neuva Vizcaya province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

A four year old girl was killed by a landslide in Bugias, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABenguet"&gt;Benguet province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , as was a man of 53 years of age in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKalinga"&gt;Kalinga province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaguio%20City"&gt;Baguio City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a house with a mother and her two daughters was buried in landslide, injuring all of them, according to fire official Senior Superintendent Carlito Romero.

A woman died in a road accident that also injured seven other people in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Union"&gt;La Union province&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Another 13-15 people are currently missing, and at least 41 more people not mentioned above were injured to some degree.

In all, Cimaron affected more than 177,000 people.

<h3>Damage</h3>
Ninety percent of the houses in Dinapigue, Isabela province, were damaged in the town of 5,000 residents, says Mayor Renato Candido.

Over 1,872 houses were damaged, while at least 72 homes were destroyed, 300 of the houses in Baguio City were damaged by powerful winds.

The power in Aurora province was out since Sunday night, but whether or not the electricity has been restored is unknown.

The country's Department of Agriculture has said that up to 30% of rice and corn harvests may have been ruined.

Original total damage estimates were placed at $400 million pesos, or $8 million United States Dollars, but were revised to $139 million pesos, or $2.79 million USD in total damage. Of that total, $114.39 million pesos, or $2.3 million USD, was from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainfrastructure"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aagriculture"&gt;agricultural&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; damage, mostly from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACagayan%20Valley"&gt;Cagayan Valley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The remaining money was $22.8 million pesos, or $458,600+ USD in damage to roads and bridges and damage to school buildings was worth $2 million pesos, equivalent to $40,230 USD.

Since then, the damage has been reassessed at $443 million pesos, or $8.8 million USD

Other reports of damage include uprooted trees, fallen electrical posts, and numerous blackouts in Luzon. 

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
In the Philippines, Nueva Vizcaya's provincial board passed a resolution that declared the province under a state of "calamity", allowing the release of $20 million pesos, or $402,290 USD from the province's calamity fund.

Power has been confirme to have been restored in most of Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya.

The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) stated that the Army, the Coast Guard, and the Navy were told to give assistance to the victims of the typhoon. 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20National%20Red%20Cross"&gt;Philippine National Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; noted that many of the agency's different branches were assisting the storm victims since Monday morning.

<h2>Current storm information</h2>
At 2100 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; October 31, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20Meteorological%20Association"&gt;Japan Meteorological Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (JMA) reported the center of Typhoon Cimaron to be near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alatitude"&gt;18.7°N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alongitude"&gt;116.4°E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . It had maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 80 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aknot%20%28speed%29"&gt;knots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (150 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akilometres%20per%20hour"&gt;km/h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , 90 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amiles%20per%20hour"&gt;mph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), with a minimum central pressure of 950 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AhPa"&gt;hPa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and was moving almost stationary. At 1800 UTC, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Joint Typhoon Warning Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (JTWC) reported the center of Typhoon 22W to be located about 270 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anautical%20mile"&gt;nm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (500 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akilometre"&gt;km&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , 310 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amiles"&gt;miles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) south-southeast of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 100 knots (175 km/h, 110 mph), gusting to 125 knots (230 km/h, 145 mph).

&lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; is being very careful with this system, andplanned on evacuating 200,000 people from the country, even though it is expected that Cimaron will continue west-northwest and then curve northward. Due to the size of the system, the outer rainband of the cyclone may be felt in Vietnam.

On November 1, the evacuations were put on hold when the Vietnamese realized that Cimaron would have little impact on them.

Columnist Mark Shields has revealed that one of the "highest ranking men" in the military has recommended removing 'all' U.S. troops from Baghdad.

He explained that the unnamed officer wanted to withdraw from Baghdad itself, but secure the road to the airport and the oil fields, leaving policing Baghdad to the Iraqis.

The comments come as the U.S. is taking heat for its alleged &lt;a href="w%3ASalvador%20Option"&gt;Salvador Option&lt;/a&gt; targeting the Sunni insurgency with &lt;a href="w%3Adeath%20squad"&gt;death squads&lt;/a&gt;, which opponents believe contributed to the sectarian war.

Studies conducted by a team of physicists at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Texas%20at%20Arlington"&gt;University of Texas at Arlington&lt;/a&gt; (UTA) conclude that new &lt;a href="w%3Asynthetic"&gt;synthetic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Basketball%20Association"&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt; basketballs are less lively, more slippery when damp, and bounce more erratically than the traditional leather balls. 

James Horwitz, Chairman of the UTA Department of Physics was contacted by the &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Mavericks"&gt;Dallas Mavericks&lt;/a&gt; owner &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Cuban"&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/a&gt; to study the new ball. Horwitz asked UTA physics professor Kaushik De to lead the project. De's team found that the new balls are tackier when dry, but become much more slippery than leather balls when they get damp. Traditional leather basketballs provide more grip when they are slightly wet. 

The synthetic balls bounce 30% more sporadically, possibly due to deep embossing, and are less lively than leather basketballs. 

Some of these issues could be fixed with a variety of methods, including modification of the embossing, increasing the air pressure in the balls beyond the regulation 8.5 psi, and constantly drying the balls with towels during the game or frequently replacing them with fresh basketballs, say De and Horwitz.

Despite commitments already made by the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; to replace the &lt;a href="w%3ATrident%20missile"&gt;Trident missile system&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Navy%27s%20Vanguard%20class%20submarines"&gt;Royal Navy's Vanguard class submarines&lt;/a&gt;, Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt; is calling for a public debate on the decision. 

The Prime Minister has committed to holding a debate in Parliament over the issue.

Beckett told the ♡❤Sunday Times♡❤ that it was the &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; that prompted the Trident programme but that the security situation now is very different. 

Though Trident is not due for replacement for 20 years, Tony Blair has promised that there will be decision on Trident this year, due to the long lead time for design and construction. The costs involved may be between 10 and 25 billion pounds.

Beckett said that the public should be informed and should think about the issue themselves. 

Her opinion will be welcomed by back bench Labour MPs who are concerned that any opposition to replacing Trident will be suppressed.

Beckett has also taken an independent line before, on Iraq, by expressing 'regrets' over the war and saying she did not disagree with General Sir Richard Dannatt, who said that British troops in Iraq were provoking trouble.

The final round of voting has ended in the first free elections in the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt; (DRC) in over forty years. 

The runoff is between incumbent President &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Kabila"&gt;Joseph Kabila&lt;/a&gt; and Vice-President &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Pierre%20Bemba"&gt;Jean-Pierre Bemba&lt;/a&gt;, who led a field of 33 candidates in the first round of polling held on July 30, but failed to achieve the required majority vote. The voting has been largely peaceful, though isolated incidents of violence and voting fraud have been reported.

<h2>Polling day</h2>
Voting was largely peaceful, with isolated incidents of violence in the 
north-east. Two people were reported killed amidst protests over alleged irregularities in polling. Turnout is expected to be lower than in the last round. 

Thunderstorms and a five-hour spell of rain dampened early morning 
voting in the western Bas Congo province and the capital Kinshasa. 

Bemba supporters protested against alleged ballot-stuffing in Lisala, 
and looted polling stations and burnt ballot boxes in Bumba. Two people 
were reported killed and four others injured when "naval forces" and 
police fired on the protesters. 

A &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; observer estimated that between 15 to 25 thousand people were prevented from voting by Congolese army troops, who blockaded roads and demanded money from voters going to the polls, in the north-eastern Ituri district. 

Polling was open between 6:00 a.m. local time and 5:00 p.m. (0500 GMT to
1600 GMT) in the west, and one hour earlier in the east. Polling was 
extended beyond the closing time in some areas.

80,000 police personnel and 17,000 U.N. peace-keepers backed by 2,000 E.U. troops were deployed to secure the polling. The peace-keepers staged 
"flag-marches" in Kinshasa and other cities.

Over 1,000 international and 40,000 Congolese observers monitored the 
elections in the 50,045 polling stations. Counting is to begin 
immediately, but provisional results are not expected before November 
19. 

Kinshasa was reported as "tense", with over 5,000 armed supporters of 
Kabila and 600 fighters loyal to Bemba reportedly present in the 
capital. Both Kabila and Bemba voted in Kinshasa, but did not speak to 
reporters. A joint statement issued by their parties called for people 
to vote "in a calm, orderly and peaceful manner".

<h2>Transition from war</h2>
Mineral rich Congo has remained largely undeveloped, despite possessing 
rich reserves of gold, diamonds, coltan and Uranium. 

Following independence from Belgium, Congo underwent a turbulent political history, enduring a 32-year dictatorship under &lt;a href="w%3AMobutu%20Sese%20Seko"&gt;Mobutu Sese Seko&lt;/a&gt;. The 1994 &lt;a href="w%3ARwandan%20genocide"&gt;Rwandan genocide&lt;/a&gt; sparked strife in neighbouring Congo, and Sese Seko was overthrown by &lt;a href="w%3ALaurent%20Kabila"&gt;Laurent Kabila&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Congo%20War"&gt;First Congo War&lt;/a&gt;. 

Kabila was challenged by Rwanda and Uganda backed rebels, but drew on support from troops from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Chad, and Sudan. The resulting &lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Congo%20War"&gt;Second Congo War&lt;/a&gt;, the deadliest conflict since the Second World War, killed an estimated four million people and displaced another five million.

A peace accord was signed in 2002 and a &lt;a href="w%3ATransitional%20Government%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;transitional government&lt;/a&gt; set up, with Joseph Kabila as President and two of the rebel leaders, including Bemba as Vice Presidents. A new constitution was approved by referendum held in February this year and the first multi-party elections began on July 30, 2006.

A UN peace-keeping force, &lt;a href="w%3AMission%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20in%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;MUNOC&lt;/a&gt; has been deployed in Congo since 2000 and was charged with keeping security during the elections. The elections, funded by $460 million of international aid, are conducted by the Independent Electoral Commission.

Kabila has won the support of third and fourth placed candidates, &lt;a href="w%3AAntoine%20Gizenga"&gt;Antoine Gizenga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANzanga%20Mobutu"&gt;Nzanga Mobutu&lt;/a&gt; - the son of Mobutu Sese Seko, following the first round of elections. Clashes between Kabila and Bemba supporters have left at least 23 people dead, following the announcement of the results of the last round of elections.

UK Chancellor &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; promises that UK will lead the world in the fight against global warming.

The &lt;a href="w%3AStern%20Review"&gt;Stern Review&lt;/a&gt;, the first about the economic effects of climate change, is published today. Commissioned by the British Government and prepared by &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Nicholas%20Stern"&gt;Sir Nicholas Stern&lt;/a&gt;, former top economist at the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, it forecasts that, if action is not taken now, the world will suffer an economic disaster on an unprecedented scale. 100 million people will be refugees from floods caused by rising water levels, drought caused by the melting of glaciers will affect 1 in 6 of the world's population, up to 40% of present wildlife species will become extinct and the world economy will shrink by 20%.

Sir Nicholas claims that these forecasts are based on the best available scientific evidence about the extent and effects of climate change. He does not claim absolute certainty, only a high degree of probability that the world is facing economic catastrophe if action is not taken immediately. An expenditure of just 1% of the world's wealth now could avert it. Spending £1 now could save £5, or even more, in the future. 

The effects of global warming can be contained, says the Review, if about 1% of the world's GDP is invested in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. This investment must take place over the next 10 to 20 years otherwise the effects of climate change could be disastrous on a scale comparable to the great wars and the slump of the first half of the last century. There has to be action at national, regional and international levels. 

The Review concludes that the actions to be taken include emissions trading, doubling investment in research and development of low carbon energy sources, curbing deforestation and supporting adaptation in poorer countries by developing crops appropriate to the changed climatic conditions.

The Stern Review shows that the scientific evidence for global warming is "overwhelming", said Prime Minister Blair. Chancellor Gordon Brown said that Britain will take the lead in persuading the world of the seriousness of the problem. All the major political parties in Britain have been discussing climate change.

The Review is attracting a great deal of media attention. Salient among the views being reported are those of a number of experts including the following:

Professor Bill Mcguire, &lt;a href="w%3ABenfield%20UCL%20Hazard%20Research%20Centre"&gt;Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre&lt;/a&gt; who says that Stern has greatly underestimated the effects of global warming. 

Martin Livermore, The &lt;a href="w%3AScientific%20Alliance"&gt;Scientific Alliance&lt;/a&gt; asserts that "climate is not driven primarily by human use of fossil fuels" and that the money to be spent is unlikely to have much effect: it would be better spent on the world's poor. 

Pia Hansen, &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; Spokeswoman says doing nothing is not an option, we must act now.

Simon Retallack, &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Think%20Tank%20IPPR"&gt;UK Think Tank IPPR&lt;/a&gt; - this (Review) removes the last refuge of the "do-nothing" approach on climate change, particularly in the US.

Tom Delay, The &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20Trus"&gt;Carbon Trus&lt;/a&gt;t - The Review offers a huge business opportunity.

Richard Lambert,&lt;a href="w%3A%20CBI"&gt;CBI&lt;/a&gt; Director Genera says that a global system of carbon trading is urgently needed.

Charlie Kronick, &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; - now the government must act and, among other things, invest in efficient decentralised power stations and tackle the growth of aviation.

Concurrently with the publication of the Stern Review, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; reports that emissions from the industrialsed world are still rising. There has been a 2.4% increase in emissions across 41 industrialised countries in the first four years of this century. Britain, France and Germany are near to achieving their &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protoco"&gt;Kyoto Protoco&lt;/a&gt;l targets, but the US is the biggest polluter and its emissions have been increasing.

The Kyoto Protocol calls for a reduction of 5% of pollutants below 1990 levels. There has been a reduction of 3.3% since then but this has been the result of the collapse of industry in Eastern Europe which has counterbalanced the increases in the rich countries. The Stern Review suggests that the Kyoto targets are too modest.

After five months of tense protests in the &lt;a href="w%3AOaxacan"&gt;Oaxacan&lt;/a&gt; state capital, &lt;a href="w%3AOaxaca%20City"&gt;Oaxaca City&lt;/a&gt;, in Southern Mexico, &lt;a href="w%3AMexican%20president"&gt;Mexican president&lt;/a&gt;, Vicente Fox, ordered Federal forces to remove protesters and striking teachers from the city centre. On Sunday, &lt;a href="w%3AMexican%20police"&gt;Mexican police&lt;/a&gt; forces clothed in &lt;a href="w%3Ariot%20gear"&gt;riot gear&lt;/a&gt;, armed with &lt;a href="w%3Atear%20gas"&gt;tear gas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aassault%20rifles"&gt;assault rifles&lt;/a&gt;, and backed up by &lt;a href="w%3Aarmoured%20vehicles"&gt;armoured vehicles&lt;/a&gt; took up positions on the edge of the city to begin their march into the city centre.

A male protester manning one barricade was killed as federal police stormed the city, Police did not immediately confirm that. 

But it is still uncertain whether more than one million schoolchildren would return to classes Monday in the embattled city where riot police and burned-out vehicles still line the streets.

Oaxaca suffers from a stand-off between the state government of Oaxaca and the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Popular%20Assembly%20of%20Oaxaca"&gt;People's Popular Assembly of Oaxaca&lt;/a&gt; (APPO), a consortium of groups including teachers, farmers, and other workers. The impetus for federal involvement in Oaxaca appears to stem from the murder of four protesters and wounding of at least one other by state-sanctioned paramilitaries on Friday the 28th. Also potentially contributing to federal interdiction could be a desire, formed following the protests in Mexico City after the country's recent elections, to forge stronger ties between &lt;a href="w%3AVicente%20Fox%27s%20National%20Action%20Party"&gt;Vicente Fox's National Action Party&lt;/a&gt; (PAN) and the &lt;a href="w%3AInstitutional%20Revolutionary%20Party"&gt;Institutional Revolutionary Party&lt;/a&gt; (PRI).

The protests began in May as a teacher's strike. Police and state forces - often in plain-clothes - have shot at protesters, setting off clashes in which at least eight people have died. 

It is still too early to tell when federal police will withdraw from Oaxaca City. Protesters have decided to abandon the centre and regroup at a local university. The protesters accuse Ruiz of corruption and rigging elections. Daniel Reyes a teacher, told reporters "We are going to leave this area . . . while we regroup and look at strategies to recover this area," leaving open the possibility of continued protests, extended federal occupation, and ongoing violence.

Brazilian President &lt;a href="w%3ALuiz%20In%C3%A1cio%20Lula%20da%20Silva"&gt;Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; has been re-elected with more than 60% of the votes against &lt;a href="w%3AGeraldo%20Alckmin"&gt;Geraldo Alckmin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20general%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;Brazilian general elections, 2006&lt;/a&gt;.

61-years old Lula received 58,295,042 votes while Alckmin received 37,543,178 votes, or 39.17%.

Lula was the candidate of &lt;a href="w%3AWorkers%27%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Partido dos Trabalhadores&lt;/a&gt; (PT) with support from 5 other parties, the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Brazil"&gt;Partido Comunista do Brasil&lt;/a&gt; (PCdoB), &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Partido Republicano Brasileiro&lt;/a&gt; (PRB), &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Partido Liberal&lt;/a&gt; (PL), &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;Partido Socialista Brasileiro&lt;/a&gt; (PSB) and &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Party%20%28Brazil%29"&gt;Partido Progressista&lt;/a&gt; (PP).

Alckmin was the candidate of &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Social%20Democracy%20Party"&gt;Partido da Social Democracia Brasileira&lt;/a&gt; (PSDB) with support from three other parties.

In a victory speech, Lula said he would govern for all Brazilians and intensify efforts to alleviate poverty during his second four-year term. Silva promised a much better second term than the first. The President-elect has made income redistribution the priority of his first four years in office.

Lula campaigned on a platform of championing the cause of the country's poor, highlighting a 19 percent decrease in poverty, minimum wage increases and millions of new jobs.

♡❤♡Q:♡❤♡ The Rose Theatre recently launched. What are your thoughts on this facility? Have you had a chance to tour it yet?

<h1>Sokoto mourns after plane crash that killed Sultan</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sokoto%20mourns%20after%20plane%20crash%20that%20killed%20Sultan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Thousands of mourning Nigerian Muslims have gathered outside the temple of the late &lt;a href="w%3ASultan%20of%20Sokoto"&gt;Sultan of Sokoto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammadu%20Maccido"&gt;Muhammadu Maccido&lt;/a&gt;, waiting to pay their last respects following his death in a plane crash on Sunday, along with 95 others on board. He was a widely respected man to whom 70 million Muslims looked to for guidance and leadership.

The crowds are being let into the palace in small groups to meet the surviving family of the Sultan, and other traditional rulers. Figureheads such as President &lt;a href="w%3AOlusegun%20Obasanjo"&gt;Olusegun Obasanjo&lt;/a&gt; paid their respects on Monday, along with a host of other dignitaries, including two former presidents. Among those who died in the crash are former President &lt;a href="w%3AShehu%20Shagari"&gt;Shehu Shagari&lt;/a&gt;'s son, as well as the son of the Sultan, Mohammed, and one of his grandchildren. A northern senator was also recovered from the site.

The possibility of pilot negligence is now circulating the investigation, however a final conclusion as to what has caused the crash of ADC Airlines Flight 53 is not yet available. The investigation on the Boeing 737 is expected to be concluded over the coming weeks.

<h4>Successor to be decided</h4>
Within the next couple of days, the kingmakers will assemble and draw up a list of three possible candidates to be the next Sultan Sultan. This list is then presented to &lt;a href="w%3ASokoto"&gt;Sokoto&lt;/a&gt; State Governor &lt;a href="w%3AAttahiru%20Bafarawa"&gt;Attahiru Bafarawa&lt;/a&gt;, who will choose the next Sultan from the list of three. He is expected to choose the person who is placed at the top of the list. The list from the Kingmakers could come as early as Tuesday, and a decision by the State Governor by the end of the week.

The crowds outside the palace are expected to increase after the appointment of the next Sultan, and they will mix their condolences with congratulations for the new Sultan.

The newly appointed &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;Ontario Provincial Police&lt;/a&gt; Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3AJulian%20Fantino"&gt;Julian Fantino&lt;/a&gt; told reporters on Monday that "the Caledonia land dispute is the single biggest issue facing him" and that, " 'lawbreakers' in &lt;a href="w%3ACaledonia%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Caledonia&lt;/a&gt; will be dealt with swiftly, regardless of which side of the native occupation they are on."

The &lt;a href="w%3ACaledonia%20land%20dispute"&gt;Caledonia land dispute&lt;/a&gt; has been going on since February 28 and still has not been resolved. The native protesters occupied the Douglas Creek Estates, a housing development, southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the property belongs to them.

Townspeople have repeatedly called for police to remove the protesters from the land, which is now owned by the province and being held in trust until the dispute is resolved.

"I certainly don't expect that there will be lawbreaking that isn't dealt with and that will be my message to our people as well, that it's their duty and responsibility is to enforce the laws," said OPP Commissioner Julian Fantino, on his first official day on the job. "I assure that those who do break the law will be dealt with."

While under former commissioner &lt;a href="w%3AGwen%20M.%20Boniface"&gt;Gwen Boniface&lt;/a&gt;, who resigned last year because of the dispute, the OPP were criticised for not enforcing the law, especially when several camera people were assaulted by native protesters.

Fantino said the on-going occupation of a property by members of the Six Nations Reserve is beyond his ability to resolve. His role in the contentious dispute will be to keep the peace in the town of Caledonia.

Officials in Ontario and the federal governments are currently negotiating with &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Nations%2040%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Six Nations&lt;/a&gt; representatives.

The &lt;a href="w%3AStern%20Review"&gt;Stern Review&lt;/a&gt; of the Economics of Climate Change, commissioned by the British &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt;, Gordon Brown, points to the need for urgent action to reduce carbon emissions if a world-wide economic catastrophe is to be avoided. The institution of global carbon trading, control of &lt;a href="w%3Adeforestation"&gt;deforestation&lt;/a&gt;, increased investment in energy R &amp; D and support to poorer countries in adapting to climate change are all key proposals in the Review. 

A leaked letter from &lt;a href="David%20Miliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironment%20Secretary"&gt;Environment Secretary&lt;/a&gt;, to Chancellor Brown contains a package of tax proposals to promote the use of public transport and to encourage people to buy smaller cars and fly less. The proposals also include charges on petrol-guzzling cars, &lt;a href="w%3Aroad%20pricing"&gt;road pricing&lt;/a&gt;, levies on air travel and increased charges for &lt;a href="w%3Alandfill"&gt;landfill&lt;/a&gt; waste disposal.

The findings of the Review and the promise of a Government Climate Bill, containing measures in response to the Review, received a mixed reception from employers and unions.

Miles Templeman, Director-General of the &lt;a href="w%3AInstitute%20of%20Directors"&gt;Institute of Directors&lt;/a&gt;, said: "Without countries like the &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; making decisive commitments, UK competitiveness will undoubtedly suffer if we act alone. This would be bad for business, bad for the economy and ultimately bad for our climate."

The &lt;a href="w%3AConfederation%20of%20British%20Industries"&gt;Confederation of British Industries&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Chambers%20of%20Commerce"&gt;British Chambers of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; and asset managers F&amp;C all pointed out the dangers to business of additional taxation. 

Brendan Barber, General Secretary of the &lt;a href="w%3ATrades%20Union%20Congress"&gt;Trades Union Congress&lt;/a&gt;, was optimistic about the opportunities for industry to meet demands created by investment in technology to combat climate change. The &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20of%20Wales%27%20Corporate%20Leaders%20Group%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Prince of Wales' Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;, formed by 14 of UK's leading companies shared this hope. Chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AShell%20UK"&gt;Shell UK&lt;/a&gt;, James Smith, expressed the hope of the group that business and Government would discuss how Britain could obtain "first mover advantage" in what he described as "massive new global markets."

The markets for low-carbon energy products are expected to be worth £300 billion by 2050.

Nigel Farage, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Independence%20Party"&gt;UK Independence Party&lt;/a&gt;, questions the assertions that there is scientific consensus on global warming. At best, he said, there is uncertainty. Politicians world-wide are jumping on the ‘green' bandwagon, but, if they want popular support, they'd better be sure that this is not simply the ‘new witchcraft'.

Ruth Lea, Director of the &lt;a href="w%3ACentre%20for%20Policy%20Studies"&gt;Centre for Policy Studies&lt;/a&gt;, also questions the notion that there is a ‘scientific consensus' over global warming. She alleges that "authorities on climate science say that the climate system is far too complex for modest reductions in one of the thousands of factors involved in climate change (i.e. carbon emissions) to have a predictable effect in magnitude, or even direction." About economic models, upon which Stern relied for his projections, her experience was that forecasting just two or three years ahead was usually wrong. She described the problem of drawing conclusions from combining scientific and economic models as ‘monumentally complex'. She doubted whether international cooperation was really possible. She concluded that she thought that this Review was designed to cloak the motives of a government that wanted some moral justification for increasing taxation on fuels. 

An unconfirmed report on BBC 24 early Tuesday morning, October 31, stated that the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; had not yet seen a copy of the Stern Review.

In response to the Stern Report &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; promised a AU$60 million to fight climate change. The projects are part of the &lt;a href="w%3AAP6"&gt;Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate&lt;/a&gt;. "The Asia-Pacific Partnership includes countries that represent about half of the world's emissions, energy use, GDP (gross domestic product) and population, and is an important initiative that engages, for the first time, the key greenhouse-gas emitting countries in the Asia-Pacific region," Mr Howard said in a statement.

A statement by Australian Greens senators Rachel Siewert and Christine Milne criticised the saying "ABARE indicated that the type of research undertaken for the Stern Report is beyond them. They can put a price on what ratifying the Kyoto protocol would cost but have no idea or capacity to put a price on the cost of not acting. They are tinkering around the edges of the problem and don't seem to know whether climate change is real or whether there is any urgency."

A successful rail police pilot in the &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Cape"&gt;Western Cape&lt;/a&gt; will now be implemented nationwide according to &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n Transport Minister Joseph Radebe. Radebe announced Monday that the program, which has reportedly resulted in a 68 per cent overall decline in crime on trains and in railway stations, will be implemented throughout South Africa by 2008. More than 5,000 officers will be deployed in railway stations and on trains.

"More than 5,000 police personnel will take their rightful place in the rail environment in order to confront our security concerns. We have made an undertaking to increase our presence, particularly on strategic high volume corridors such as Khayelitsha in Cape Town, Hammanskraal in Tshwane, and Moloto in Mpumalanga, as well as links between Midrand and Thembisa," said Radebe.

Lucky Montana, Chief Executive of the government owned &lt;a href="w%3AMetrorail%20%28South%20Africa%29"&gt;Metrorail&lt;/a&gt;, said, "The levels of crime remain unacceptably high. That is something we are concerned about. But today, we are driving the message that the safety of commuters comes first, as a priority. We are investing millions of rands to make sure that we turn around this environment."

Commuters have been subject to railway "barbarism" for too long, said Transport Minister Radebe. Radebe said that the government plans to invest more than 80 million &lt;a href="w%3ARand"&gt;Rand&lt;/a&gt; ($10.5 million &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;) in the rail police system with the intention of curbing the daily murders, robberies, and kindnappings committed on the Metrorail.

The &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20India"&gt;Reserve Bank of India&lt;/a&gt; (RBI) has hiked the &lt;a href="w%3ARepurchase%20agreement"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; rate by 0.25 percent to 7.25 percent, keeping the reverse repo rate unchanged at 6%. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20rate"&gt;Bank rate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3Acash%20reserve%20ratio"&gt;cash reserve ratio&lt;/a&gt; are left unchanged at 6% and 5% respectively. 

In its mid-year review of monetary and regulatory policy, the Reserve Bank has forecast an annual GDP growth of 8.0%, as against the 7.5-8.0% forecast earlier in its annual policy statement and first quarter review. The Reserve Bank indicated that inflation will be contained between 5.0-5.5%, during the year 2006-07.

The Reserve Bank estimated real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2006-07 at 8.9%, up from 8.5% last year.

Harry's Island will boast 10 luxury, family-oriented hotels, a tree house with family suites, and a 7,500-seat &lt;a href="w%3ACaldera"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; theater which will feature nightly spectacular shows.

Eighth Wonder says it wants to make Harry's Island a world-class, must-see tourist destination and has roped-in several big names in its tender. If selected, the resort will have &lt;a href="w%3Aspa"&gt;spas&lt;/a&gt; and health centers run by health guru &lt;a href="w%3ADeepak%20Chopra"&gt;Deepak Chopra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVera%20Wang"&gt;Vera Wang&lt;/a&gt; hotels with access to her entire wedding collection, and a soccer academy with Brazilian soccer icon &lt;a href="w%3APele"&gt;Pele&lt;/a&gt; giving his input.

Harry's Island will create around 15,000 jobs, including 5000 in the food and beverage industry.

The company believes it can recover its investments by 2015 by generating over $5.6 billion in five years; it hopes to bring nearly 15 million visitors annually by 2014.

The Sentosa IR project is the second of two IR tenders offered by the Singapore Government: the first was located in &lt;a href="w%3AMarina%20Bay%2C%20Singapore"&gt;Marina Bay&lt;/a&gt;.

The Singapore government is expected to announce the winner in December.

The first comprehensive global study of &lt;a href="w%3Asexual%20behaviour"&gt;sexual behaviour&lt;/a&gt;, published today as part of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lancet"&gt;The Lancet's&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Sexual and Reproductive Health Online Series, found that people aren't losing their &lt;a href="w%3Avirginity"&gt;virginity&lt;/a&gt; at ever younger ages, &lt;a href="w%3Amarried"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt; people have the most sex, and there is no firm link between &lt;a href="w%3Apromiscuity"&gt;promiscuity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Asexually%20transmitted%20diseases"&gt;sexually transmitted diseases&lt;/a&gt;.

Experts say data gleaned from the study will be useful not only in dispelling popular myths about sexual behaviour, but in shaping policies that will help improve &lt;a href="w%3Asexual%20health"&gt;sexual health&lt;/a&gt; across the world. Researchers looked at previously published studies on sexual behaviour in the last decade.

Professor Kaye Wellings, of the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20School%20of%20Hygiene%20%26amp%3B%20Tropical%20Medicine"&gt;London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicines&lt;/a&gt;, and her colleagues analysed data on sexual behaviour in the last decade from 59 countries. 

The report also shows no support for the common notion that there is a culture of multiple sexual partners in countries with poor sexual health. Multiple sexual partners, it turns out, are more common in industrialised than in developing nations.

The study also found that contrary to popular belief, sexual activity is not starting earlier. Nearly everywhere, men and women have their first sexual experiences in their late teens; from 15 to 19 years old — with generally younger ages for women than for men, especially in developing countries. 

"A single woman is more able to negotiate safe sex in certain circumstances than a married woman," said Paul van Look, director of &lt;a href="w%3AReproductive%20health"&gt;Reproductive Health and Research&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;, who was unconnected to the study and points out that "married women in Africa and Asia are often threatened by unfaithful husbands who frequent prostitutes".

There is much greater equality between women and men with regard to the number of sexual partners in rich countries than in poor countries, the study found. This imbalance has significant public health implications. Because of the diversity of sexual habits worldwide, Wellings warns that no single approach to sexual health will work everywhere. "There are very different &lt;a href="w%3Aeconomic"&gt;economic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Areligious"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20rules"&gt;social rules&lt;/a&gt; governing sexual conduct across the world," Wellings said.

For example, men and women in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; tend to have an almost equal number of sexual partners. In contrast, in &lt;a href="w%3ACameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHaiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, men tend to have multiple partners while women tend only to have one.

Along with other industrialised countries, Australia was one in which having two or more sexual partners in the past year was comparatively common. 

Single men and women in &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; were fairly sexually inactive: only two-thirds of them reported recent sexual activity, compared with three-quarters of their counterparts in developed countries.

In what researchers said was proof the sexual double standard was still strong, more men than women reported having more than one partner. 

"These findings beg the question of who the men are having sex with," they wrote.
&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; had one of the lowest percentages of men who had sex before age 15 (4 per cent), compared to 18 per cent in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and 30 per cent in &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ADominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers said early initiation was more likely to be non-consensual, unsafe and generally to be regretted later. 

The study suggests that unequal treatment of girls and women as the major sexual-health issue.

The researchers call for providing sexual health services to unmarried young women, supplying condoms, decriminalizing commercial sex and homosexual sex, and prosecuting the perpetrators of sexual violence.

Experts say data gleaned from the study will be useful not only in dispelling popular myths about sexual behaviour, but in shaping policies that will help improve sexual health across the world. 

"There's a misperception that there's a great deal of promiscuity in Africa, which is one of the potential reasons for HIV/AIDS spreading so rapidly," said van Look

Fewer than half of unmarried non-&lt;a href="w%3Avirgins"&gt;virgins&lt;/a&gt; reported having sex in the past month. 

Some of the major findings the survey found were:
<ul>
BULLET::::- School-based sexual education delays and does not hasten onset of sexual activity.
BULLET::::- First sexual experience is often forced or sold.
BULLET::::- Marriage is no safeguard of sexual health. It is more difficult for married women to negotiate safe sex and condom use than it is for single women.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ACondom"&gt;Condom&lt;/a&gt; use is increasing, but condom-use rates remain low in many developing countries.
BULLET::::- Among girls who marry at a very young age, "very early sexual experience within marriage can be coercive and traumatic."
BULLET::::- While there is no major trend toward earlier sexual experience, a trend toward later marriage has led to an increase in premarital sex.
BULLET::::- Public health measures to improve sexual health should focus not only on individual behaviours but also on broader issues such as gender, poverty, and mobility.
BULLET::::- Public-health messages intended to reduce sexual risk-taking "should respect diversity and preserve choice."
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AMonogamy"&gt;Monogamy&lt;/a&gt; is the dominant pattern in most parts of the world. Men report more multiple partnerships than do women. Such men are more likely to live in developed nations.

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Fiji"&gt;Fijian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALaisenia%20Qarase"&gt;Laisenia Qarase&lt;/a&gt; yesterday failed to overthrow the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Fiji"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; Commander, &lt;a href="w%3ACommodore%20%28rank%29"&gt;Commodore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Bainimarama"&gt;Frank Bainimarama&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Fiji"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJosefa%20Iloilo"&gt;Ratu Josefa Iloilo&lt;/a&gt;, decided yesterday to dismiss Bainimarama on the advice of Qarase, but the move backfired when a senior military officer refused to accept an offer by the President to take control of the armed forces.

In response, soldiers have staged exercises on the streets of Suva and sealed off the main army barracks.

Bainimarama has threatened to force Qarase to resign unless he drops two contentious bills, &lt;a href="w%3AReconciliation%20and%20Unity%20Commission%20%28Fiji%29"&gt;one of which&lt;/a&gt; will offer amnesty to some of those involved in the &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20coup%20of%202000"&gt;coup d'état&lt;/a&gt; orchestrated by &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Speight"&gt;George Speight&lt;/a&gt;, which deposed the elected government of then-Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMahendra%20Chaudhry"&gt;Mahendra Chaudhry&lt;/a&gt; in 2000, and in &lt;a href="w%3AMutinies%20of%20Fiji%20coup%20of%202000"&gt;two mutinies&lt;/a&gt;, one of which took place several months after the cuop.

Commodore Bainimarama is currently visiting troops performing peacekeeping duties in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.

Bainimarama and other senior military personnel have continued to call on Qarase to stand down.

According to a senior military officer, Qarase has threatened to resign if Bainimarama is not ousted.

Earlier yesterday, military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni, said it would be "unwise" to remove Commodore Bainimarama.

Mr Qarase called emergency &lt;a href="w%3ACabinet%20%28Fiji%29"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; and National Security council meetings this morning and addressed the nation this afternoon, while senior military officers met this morning. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fijitv.com.fj/_resources/tv/flash/elections_news/Video.html"&gt;In his address&lt;/a&gt;, Qarase refused to resign and said that he would not bow to intimidation.

A joint press conference with acting military commander Elasa Teleni and &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20Police%20Commissioner"&gt;Fiji Police Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Hughes%20%28police%29"&gt;Andrew Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, an Australian, this morning was canceled and Hughes said he had so far been unable to make contact with military leaders today. 

Australia has issued a travel advisory for Fiji, warning of tension between the military and the Government. 

"We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution in Fiji due to increased tensions between the Fiji government and the Fiji military forces and the possibility of military action against the government," &lt;a href="w%3ADFAT"&gt;DFAT&lt;/a&gt; said on its website.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; warned the armed forces of Fiji against carrying out a coup against the elected civilian government of the racially divided Pacific island nation.

Australia has also said it is "very concerned" over the real risk of a military coup in the Pacific Island nation of Fiji, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said on Wednesday.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;New Zealand Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; urged Bainimarama to accept the decision of the country's government to sack him and step down.

Fiji has suffered three coups and a failed mutiny since 1987.

A mid-term re-election campaign rally held Tuesday morning by &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3A%20George%20Allen%20%28U.S.%20politician%29"&gt;George Allen&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ACharlottesville%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Charlottesville&lt;/a&gt; Omni Hotel turned ugly after a University of Virginia law student, &lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Kos"&gt;Daily Kos&lt;/a&gt; contributor and blogger, Mike Stark, was man-handled by Allen staffers in the hotel lobby after he asked the Senator about his 1970's divorce and arrest record.

Three Allen campaign staffers wrestled Stark to the ground, ending what ♡❤Friends of George Allen♡❤ said in a press release were "inappropriate questions" by Stark. Allen was approached by Stark as he tried to exit the conference room following his speech at "a well attended event". Stark is accused by the Allen campaign of stalking Allen, by ♡❤The Washington Post♡❤ of heckling him, and by Stark's own admission on his blog page of doing something that "got the adrenaline flowing".

Stark said he attempted to "stand my ground" after his question about Allen's sealed divorce records was met by pushing and shoving by Allen staffers, according to an interview by blogger Greg Sargent.
"I never raised my hands...They were actually physically pushing me away when I shouted to him, 'is it true that you spat on your wife'? That's when they said, 'now you're getting personal' and tackled me."
The slim polling lead once held by the Republican incumbent Allen has for the first time shifted to Webb, who now leads by a 50 – 46% margin, where the 4-point spread is within the 'margin of error percentage' of those surveyed by the &lt;a href="w%3AOpinion%20Research%20Corporation"&gt;Opinion Research Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.

In response to the &lt;a href="w%3AStern%20Review"&gt;Stern Report&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; announced &lt;a href="w%3AAU%24"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;60 million to fight climate change, on 42 projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The projects are part of the &lt;a href="w%3AAP6"&gt;Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate&lt;/a&gt;. 

"The Asia-Pacific Partnership includes countries that represent about half of the world's emissions, energy use, GDP (gross domestic product) and population, and is an important initiative that engages, for the first time, the key greenhouse-gas emitting countries in the Asia-Pacific region," Mr Howard said in a statement.

Howard told the audience at the &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20Organisation"&gt;CSIRO's Ensis&lt;/a&gt;, a research and development organisation for the &lt;a href="w%3Aforestry"&gt;forestry&lt;/a&gt; industry, the government was taking practical steps to lower greenhouse gas emissions and symbolism would not clean up the air.

"Symbolism will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Practical methods will and that is what I'm interested in...The thing that matters is doing things" he said.

More than half the money is going to projects to develop clean coal technology, including $8 million for a mobile carbon catcher for coal-fired power stations. 

$17.5 million will be spent on &lt;a href="w%3Arenewable%20energy"&gt;renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; projects, including high efficiency &lt;a href="w%3Asolar%20power"&gt;solar power&lt;/a&gt; stations and solar-enhanced transport fuels. 

$11 million will be spent on &lt;a href="w%3Acoal%20mining"&gt;coal mining&lt;/a&gt;. $6 million will be spent on improving energy efficiency of appliances and buildings, and AU$2.5 million will be used to help the &lt;a href="w%3Aaluminium"&gt;aluminium industry&lt;/a&gt; reduce emissions.

Howard dismissed as "pure speculation" the Stern Report's more alarmist projections. 

"Talk about hot air. There's an enormous amount of hot air on this issue," Howard says "what we need are measures which actually achieve results." and that his announcement will achieve results.

&lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; resident &lt;a href="w%3ARoland%20De%20Wolfe"&gt;Roland De Wolfe&lt;/a&gt;, will take a &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt; 554 300 credit boost this week after winning the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Poker%20Tour"&gt;European Poker Tour&lt;/a&gt; (EPT) in &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;.

With a victory at the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Poker%20Tour"&gt;World Poker Tour&lt;/a&gt; (WPT) in &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Prix%20de%20Paris"&gt;Grand Prix de Paris&lt;/a&gt; already under his belt, this latest win makes him the first person to be both an EPT and WPT champion.

"This week I didn't have the luck of the Irish, I had the luck of the whole of Europe", De Wolfe said. "It's an honour to be the first person to win an EPT title and a WPT title when there are so many good players out there. I'm thrilled". 

The Dublin EPT event brought up a field of 389 players from around the globe, De Wolfe managed to outplay the entire field to gain his champion slice of the Euro 1,847,750 prize pool.

Fighting for the top prize or at least a slice of the Euro 1 847 750 prize pool were many international players, and the final table was made up of U.K. players Rob Yong, Gavin Simms, and Nick Slade as well as William Thorson, of &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;; George McKeever, from &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;; and Patrick Bueno and David Tavernier, both from &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3APW%20Botha"&gt;P.W. Botha&lt;/a&gt;, the hardliner who led &lt;a href="w%3Aapartheid"&gt;apartheid&lt;/a&gt;-era &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; for much of the 1980s, died yesterday at the age of 90. 

Known as the "Great Crocodile", Botha defied an international effort to force South Africa to give up white minority rule and also free &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20National%20Congress"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ANelson%20Mandela"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt; from prison. 

Botha led the country first as &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20South%20Africa"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, then as President, from 1978 until 1989 when a stroke forced him from office. 

He presided over a &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20Emergency"&gt;State of Emergency&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to suppress the growing resistance movement to give South Africa's black majority the vote but also introduced some reforms in an attempt to satisfy critics. 

"While to many Mr Botha will remain a symbol of apartheid, we also remember him for the steps he took to pave the way towards the eventual peacefully negotiated settlement in our country," said Mandela in a statement.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to send the government's '&lt;a href="w%3AClean%20Air%20Act%23Canada"&gt;Clean Air Act&lt;/a&gt;' to an all-party committee for review, before its second reading, after Tuesday's 25 minute meeting with &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20the%20Prime%20Minister%20%28Canada%29"&gt;PMO&lt;/a&gt;.

Layton had asked for changes to the conservatives' environmental bill during the meeting with the PM, asking for a "thorough and complete rewriting" of the Conservative party's environmental bill. 

However, Layton was disappointed with Harper's reaction. "I'm not really convinced that the prime minister understands the urgency of the climate change crisis, the threat that climate change proposes and the urgency to move quickly," he said. "Far too much emphasis on consultations that could go on for considerable periods of time as opposed to action.
Layton has introduced a private member's bill on climate change. It calls for emissions to be cut by 25 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020, in an attempt to cut total emissions by 80 per cent of those levels by 2050.

Other parties including the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; are concerned about this.

"What we've been concerned about was really a Halloween stunt from Mr. Layton," Interim Liberal leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt; said at a news conference.

"It will be completely transformed," said BQ Leader &lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20Duceppe"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt;. "The Conservatives won't recognize their legislation."

However, Green Party Leader &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20May"&gt;Elizabeth May&lt;/a&gt; said bringing the 'Clean Air Act' into committee would give the legislation some legitimacy it doesn't deserve.

The committee will be full of critics commenting on the conservatives' bill.

The Tory government may have a possible non-confidence motion as early as Thursday unless it allows opposition parties to rewrite its clean air bill, which the PM had agreed to in the meeting with Layton.

A &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; homeowner Ronald Langley, currently faces surgery in an effort to save his eye after being shot in the face by masked assailants.

Around 9 p.m on &lt;a href="w%3AHalloween"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt; night the Jacksonville resident answered a knock on his door carrying with him (as is traditional) a bowl of candy. Instead of finding &lt;a href="w%3ATrick-or-treating"&gt;trick-or-treaters&lt;/a&gt;, the 67-year-old found three camouflage-wearing masked men, one of the three shot him in the face, hitting the homeowner above the eye. Langley was transported to Shands-Jacksonville Medical Center in &lt;a href="w%3AJacksonville%2C%20Florida"&gt;Jacksonville, Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

"This is a very nice neighborhood the neighbors are very close," said Pat Weyer, a neighbor. "It's just a very strange happening." "He had surgery last night and they may do more," Weyer said. "He definitely will lose the sight in his eye, but they are trying to save the eye itself."

"Outside of Halloween night, that would have aroused suspicion. But they blended very well in the crowd of people," said the &lt;a href="w%3AJacksonville%20Sheriff%27s%20Office"&gt;Jacksonville Sheriff's Office&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Ken Jefferson. "A person should not have to open his door and get shot when you've got legitimate reasons to open your door at night."

Police are asking anyone with information about the shooting to call &lt;a href="w%3ACrimestoppers"&gt;Crimestoppers&lt;/a&gt; at 866-845-TIPS.

A bomb exploded at 7:24 pm on Tuesday at the &lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; headquarters, a subsidiary of &lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, causing the evacuation of employees from the building. Authorities stated that the explosion was "not an accident." Spokespeople for eBay said that the incident was "isolated" and that there were no injuries or deaths reported.

"It's definitely not an accident. Everything else there is accounted for. This was not any kind of accident or malfunction," said San Jose Police Sgt. Nick Muyo. He added that authorities have yet to find any kind of explosive device or material.

"We believe this is an isolated incident. We're working closely with local authorities. We have everything under control," said Amanda Pires, a spokeswoman for the PayPal division of the company.

The blast was seen from the street and was located in an area where workers take breaks. The initial damage reported was a broken window near the blast site.

Fire officials do not yet know the specifics of the bomb's makeup.

"Whatever it was, it disintegrated. Whatever caused this was pretty strong," said San Jose Fire Department Captain Jose Guerrero.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%20Police"&gt;San Jose Police&lt;/a&gt; are working with agents from the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Bureau (&lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20Firearms%20and%20Explosives"&gt;ATF&lt;/a&gt;) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (&lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;), but it is reported that the San Jose Police are in charge of investigating the blast. There are no suspects at this time.

If you put an &lt;a href="w%3AElephant"&gt;elephant&lt;/a&gt; in front of a mirror, it will be able to recognize itself, according to a study performed by scientists on three female elephants at the &lt;a href="w%3ABronx%20Zoo"&gt;Bronx Zoo&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20State"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;.

During a test on the elephants named Happy, Maxine and Patty, a mirror was placed in their habitat and all three of the animals went over to the mirrors when they were released back into their habitats.

"Maxine, Patty and Happy immediately went over to the mirror when they were let out, which was really a surprise to us because most animals, when exposed to a mirror, act immediately as if it were another animal," said a student who took place in the experiment and studies at &lt;a href="w%3AEmory%20University"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, Josh Plotnik.

The mirrors were initially covered and when the elephants went to examine the new item, the cover was removed. Another elephant also began to play with a painted "white 'X'" on its head when it walked in front of the mirror.

"They would go over smell it and then leave. They went straight for it — there was a lot of smelling the very first day. Both Maxine and Patty tried to climb the mirror wall and look over it," added Plotnik.

Despite the activity, the elephants Plotnik says, who are usually very vocal to each other were silent during their examination of the mirrors.

"I was really surprised that there was no audible vocalization. These elephants are extremely vocal," Plotnik said.

Until this study had been performed, only two other animals were known to be able to recognize themselves in mirrors - &lt;a href="w%3ADolphin"&gt;Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AChimpanzee"&gt;chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt;.

"This ability to recognize themselves in a mirror suggests a higher level of self-awareness," said a senior scientist who was a co-publisher of the study, which was reported in the &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, Diana Reiss.

A new strain of &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; or Bird Flu has been discovered in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and has also infected some humans. The virus also "spreads fast" and has covered a "big geographic region" according to Chinese health officials. 

It is not known how dangerous the new virus is and whether it is stronger or deadlier than the current &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; virus. Despite being detected in humans, no evidence has turned up to suggest that the virus can be spread easily from human to human.

"The new variant doesn't indicate any increased risk for people other than the fact it seems to be pretty widespread," said &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s [WHO] Global Influenza Program, which is located in &lt;a href="w%3AZurich%2C%20Switzerland"&gt;Zurich, Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, Doctor Michael L. Perdue.

"This virus seemed to spread very fast over a big geographic region. However, we don't have any evidence to show whether this virus is more dangerous or less dangerous than any other H5N1 viruses," said State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong in China director, Yi Guan.

The strain was discovered during April and June of 2006 in China's Fujian Province when Guan's team examined ducks, chickens, geese and other birds at a market in the province. At least 95% of the birds Guan and his team looked at were infected with the new strain and vaccines formulated to fight the H5N1 virus have not worked.

"This novel variant may have become dominant ... because it was not as easily affected as other strains by the avian vaccine used to prevent H5 infection. This [means] that H5 avian vaccines are not able to prevent infection by this virus as efficiently as they do with other types of H5N1," added Guan.

The team is continuing surveillance on the area where the strain was discovered and according to Guan the virus "is not causing widespread infection outside of our surveillance area" but the new strain is reported in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALaos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHang%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;.

Scientists also say that current vaccines used in birds for the H5N1 virus might have caused the new strain to develop.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki%2C%20Finland"&gt;Helsinki, Finland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The Finnish Parliamentary Ombudsman has found that an &lt;a href="w%3Ainfant%20formula"&gt;infant formula&lt;/a&gt; study has been conducted on thousands of newborns in several hospitals without obtaining &lt;a href="w%3Ainformed%20consent"&gt;informed consent&lt;/a&gt; from the parents, who were not informed of the commercial funding for the study. Additionally, the study was found to have been started and carried out for six months without
&lt;a href="w%3AInstitutional%20Review%20Board"&gt;ethical committee approval&lt;/a&gt;, and suffered from other shortcomings.

<h2>Findings</h2>
Numerous shortcomings were found in a study which according to documents signed by &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; Director-General candidate &lt;a href="w%3APekka%20Puska"&gt;Pekka Puska&lt;/a&gt;, head of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Public%20Health%20Institute%20of%20Finland"&gt;Finnish National Public Health Institute (NPHI)&lt;/a&gt;
"complies with the law regarding medical research and good research
practice. ... informed consent fulfills the requirements of the
law. ... distribution of infant formula does not deviate from legal
norms."

The Finnish Parliamentary Ombudsman Riitta-Leena Paunio disagreed with
professor Puska. On October 25, the 60th anniversary of the filing of the
indictment in &lt;a href="w%3ADoctors%27%20Trial"&gt;Doctors' Trial&lt;/a&gt; (of the &lt;a href="w%3ANuremberg%20Trials"&gt;Nuremberg Trials&lt;/a&gt;) which led to the framing of modern &lt;a href="w%3AMedical%20ethics"&gt;medical research ethics&lt;/a&gt;, she resolved a complaint filed by The Breastfeeding Support Association in Finland. According to the resolution, it was not possible for the parents to give informed consent as required by law due to many reasons.

The Ombudsman lists lack of disclosure of the study's funding, lack of
clear statement pointing the benefits of breastfeeding, lack of
disclosure of the fact that the Principal Investigator working within
NPHI is an inventor and benefactor in a patent on the research formula
owned by the Finnish formula manufacturer Valio, as reasons for
lack of capacity to give informed consent. The Ombudsman also
points out that during discovery of the facts concerning the study,
NPHI gave information which was simply not true. Documents
given during discovery by NPHI were signed by Pekka Puska, the Finnish
candidate for the post of WHO Director-General. NPHI also claimed in
statements signed by professor Puska to have accepted public funding
addressed only directly to it, while in actual fact NPHI accepted
public funding addressed to Valio which Valio directed to NPHI.

Further omissions pointed out by the Ombudsman include lack of the
naming of the one single person responsible for the safety of the
study as required by Finnish law and omissions in giving information
and asking for consent and ethical approval when changes to the study
were made, and the omission of not asking for consent from both parents.

According to the Parliamentary Ombudsman's resolution, both National
Public Health Institute and the ethical committee failed in fulfilling
their duties. The Ombudsman reminds that according to the Finnish
Constitution, everyone has the right to life, personal liberty, integrity and security.
No one shall be treated in a manner violating human dignity. Medical research
has a connection to this basic right. The Ombudsman also cites the &lt;a href="w%3ADeclaration%20of%20Helsinki"&gt;Declaration of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; and international conventions on human rights in her decision. During the discovery phase of the complaint, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health
stated that the Declaration of Helsinki, named after the &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Finnish capital&lt;/a&gt;, is not legally binding.

The aim of the study was to find out whether removal of bovine insulin
from infant formula would reduce &lt;a href="w%3AIDDM"&gt;type 1 diabetes (IDDM)&lt;/a&gt; and find out
mechanisms leading to IDDM, whose prevalence in Finland is more than
in any other country in the world.

<h2>Complaint</h2>
The complaint, filed in April, 2004 by The Breastfeeding Support
Association in Finland (founded 1997), asked the Ombudsman to find out
the legality of an infant formula product development study with
national health implications, funded by the Finnish infant formula
manufacturer Valio and carried out by the National Public Health
Institute of Finland.

The two major points in the complaint were to find out

1) whether the study fulfills informed consent requirements, when
parents are not told enough about the benefits of breastfeeding nor
the product development nature and commercial funding of the study 

2) whether it is legal to distibute infant formula provided by an infant
formula manufacture free of charge from the hospital with means which
resemble the milk nurse practice of some infant formula companies.

The Breastfeeding Support Association based the first part of the
complaint on the law concerning medical research. The second part was
based on the part of International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk
Substitutes established in 1981 by the general assembly of the World
Health Organization (WHO) implemented in Finnish law and the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, (right to best possible
health, advancement of breastfeeding).

The Breastfeeding Support Association pressed that they think the
study's aims (both the product development goals and the scientific
goal of finding out whether dietary bovine insulin triggers the
autoimmune reaction causing IDDM) are valid and important, but that
research should be done according to laws, international conventions
and ethical principles.

<h2>Reaction to the Ombudsman's decision</h2>
While the part of the complaint concerning informed consent was
successful, the Breastfeeding Support Association expressed disappointment that the part regarding formula distribution was not successful. The Parliamentary Ombudsman's resolution stated that the Finnish legislation placing restrictions on gratis infant formula distribution is not meant to apply to medical research, and the same holds for food
safety legislation. The Breastfeeding Support Association is looking into whether international conventions require changes to
legislation. The Breastfeeding Support Association has stated that many of the problems in the study could perhaps have been avoided if infant formula research would have at least the same checks and balances as drug research has. This would be prudent, since infant
formula is the only nutrition for most infants in an important phase of their lives and thus it's effects can be much greater than the
effect of many drugs used only occasionally.

The Breastfeeding Support Association has been concerned with outside, partly commercial funding directing the research of NPHI. According to "Good Research Practic, Handbook" (2005), outside funding amounts to 40 percent of NPHI's spending, and the policy is to get as much outside funding to carry out NPHI's plan of action as possible. Research on breastmilk was planned in the study the complaint was filed on, but was not carried out because of lack of funding.

The director of National Public Health Institute of Finland is a candidate for the Director-General post of the World Health Organization (election to be held 6th-9th November, 2006), and considered to be among the three leading candidates by &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lancet"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Background</h2>
The Breastfeeding Support Association in Finland is a volunteer association, founded in 1997, whose work is based on the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Convention%20on%20the%20Rights%20of%20the%20Child"&gt;United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child&lt;/a&gt; (article 24) and WHO breastfeeding promotion programs.

The Association is funded by membership fees, advertisements in the Imetysuutiset newsletter and fees on training of volunteers. RAY (Finland's Slot Machine Association which funds health and social welfare projects) has awarded the association a grant for 2005/06 for the purpose of establishing a nationwide project, which includes the maintenance and advertising of the Breastfeeding Support Hotline.

The City of Helsinki has awarded the Association a small grant annually to support mothers in the Helsinki area. In the other
municipalities in Finland some local groups have had opportunities to apply for grants from local social authorities.

The Finnish Parliamentary &lt;a href="w%3AOmbudsman"&gt;Ombudsman&lt;/a&gt; exercises oversight to ensure that public authorities and officials observe the law and fulfil their du­ties in the discharge of their functions. In addition to authorities and officials, the scope of oversight includes also other parties performing public functions.

The Ombudsman's office aims to ensure good administration and the observance of constitutional and human rights.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Public%20Health%20Institute%20of%20Finland"&gt;National Public Health Institute of Finland&lt;/a&gt;, according to it's website, promotes people's possibilities to live healthy life and is responsible as an expert body under the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, for providing various professionals and citizens the best available information for their choices.

Drinks, drugs, violence, promiscuity: British youth at the top or near the top of the bad youth list. And they frighten grown ups.

A report by the &lt;a href="w%3AInstitute%20of%20Public%20Policy%20Research"&gt;Institute of Public Policy Research&lt;/a&gt;, to be published next week, describes British youth as among the worst in Europe. The study compares teenage English and Scots with their counterparts in other European countries. 

Fewer British youths ate regularly with their family, and many more spent most evenings with their friends; they were drunk more often, got involved in fights and more had sex than other European youth.

More British adults than Continental adults would be reluctant to intervene should they see youths vandalising a bus shelter fearing a violent response. Many adults were fearful of leaving home after dark and a large number were thinking of moving home because of youths "hanging about".

The demonisation of youth in the British media is said to have induced real fear in many adults.

Many more comparisons are made in this report. 

<h4>Related reports</h4>

A study comparing the behaviour of South of England youth in 2005 with that in 1985, concluded that youth now are better behaved than their predecessors. There were marked differences between boys and girls.

&lt;a href="w%3AASBOs"&gt;ASBOs&lt;/a&gt; (Anti-social behaviour orders) are civil actions that can be taken against those who are likely to cause alarm, harassment, or distress to others outside their family. Research by &lt;a href="w%3ANACRO"&gt;NACRO&lt;/a&gt; (National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders) in 2002 concluded that they were a failure. The average ASBO costs more than £5,000 to enforce and takes over three months to obtain. Over one third of all ASBOs were breached within the first 9 months of issue. 

Another report published today by NACRO criticises some courts for using ASBOs inappropriately and too readily. ASBOs should be seen as the last resort for young offenders. There should be consultations with the local &lt;a href="w%3AYouth%20Offending%20Team"&gt;Youth Offending Team&lt;/a&gt; (YOT) and the reasons why other remedies were not suitable should be given. There were also indications that ASBOs are being used as weapons of racial discrimination, there being a disproportionate number of young black people being served with ASBOs. In some quarters, youths flaunt ASBOs as a badge of honour.

Ontario premier &lt;a href="w%3ADalton%20McGuinty"&gt;Dalton McGuinty&lt;/a&gt; wants the federal government to deal with the &lt;a href="w%3ACaledonia%20land%20dispute"&gt;Caledonia dispute&lt;/a&gt;. The Ontario government says that Ottawa alone is responsible for resolving the dispute, along with another 27 land claims.

Indian Affairs Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Prentice"&gt;Jim Prentice&lt;/a&gt;, who refused to meet with &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20James%20Ramsay"&gt;David Ramsay&lt;/a&gt;, Ontario's aboriginal affairs minister, said &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; share responsibility for resolving a land claim on the &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Nations%2040%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Six Nations&lt;/a&gt; reserve in &lt;a href="w%3ASouthwestern%20Ontario"&gt;Southwestern Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

The Ontario government has spent close to $40 million since February, $12 million to purchase the property back from the property developer, and $15 million going to the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;OPP&lt;/a&gt;. 

"They are just playing games right now," &lt;a href="w%3AHaldimand%20County%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Haldimand County&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMarie%20Trainer"&gt;Marie Trainer&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Press"&gt;Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt;. "We're in the middle. We're the ones suffering. . . . I would like them to stop acting like children. I wish they would quit holding Caledonia residents as hostages. It's pretty frustrating."

"The province has neither the authority nor the power to settle a land claim, so it's up to the federal government," David Ramsay, Ontario's aboriginal affairs minister said. "And quite frankly, to move these negotiations along, the federal government really needs to bring more vigor to these talks."

McGuinty is still urging the federal government to "step up to the plate" and to resolve the dispute.

Until then, the Ontario government will have to wait for more discussions with provincial ministers.

Seven &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i soldier died overnight during an Israeli raid of the North Gaza town of &lt;a href="w%3ABait%20Hanun"&gt;Bait Hanun&lt;/a&gt;. Infantry backed by tanks carried out the attack, as well as surrounding and blocking access to the town's hospital. Later, six homemade rockets were fired into the Israeli border town of Sderot, lightly wounding one person.

An Israeli military spokesman said that the incursion was in response to rockets being fired from the town since the start of the year. 

Israel has been engaged in a now four month-long offensive in the Palestinian territory, in which at least 260 Palestinians and 2 Israelis have died.

The Palestinian prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Haniya"&gt;Mahmoud Haniya&lt;/a&gt; called the massive operation a "massacre". Israeli prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; told MPs on Monday that the Israeli military is "preparing for an even more extensive operation in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;".

&lt;a href="w%3AWinter%20Haven%2C%20Florida"&gt;Winter Haven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; police chief Paul Goward was tired of seeing fat hanging out over the belts of some of his officers. So he posted a memo to encourage the so-called 'jelly bellies' to get in shape.

The memo, entitled 'Are You A Jelly Belly?' didn't single anyone out, and, apart from the title, didn't call anyone names.

Goward, a former deputy police chief in Wichita, wrote "If you are unfit, do yourself and everyone else a favor. See a professional about a proper diet and a fitness training program, quit smoking, limit alcohol intake...Don't mean to offend, this is just straight talk. I owe it to you."

It provided a list of 10 reasons cops should get fit. Goward said that overweight cops poorly represent the profession, are liable to 'poop out' when chasing suspects, and may have to use a higher degree of force.

In the end, Goward resigned from his position as police chief.

Amongst other weapons tested was the Shahab-2, which Iran says can carry a cluster warhead that can deliver 1,400 bomblets at once. 

Major General &lt;a href="w%3AYahya%20Rahim%20Safavi"&gt;Yahya Rahim Safavi&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Revolutionary Guards, said on television that Iran's military exercises were not meant to threaten neighbouring countries. "We want to show our deterrent and defensive power to trans-regional enemies, and we hope they will understand the message of the manoeuvres," he said. "The first and main goal is to demonstrate the power and national determination to defend the country against possible threat."
General Safavi said the exercises would last 10 days and would take place in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and several Iranian provinces.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Society%20of%20Arts"&gt;Royal Society of Arts&lt;/a&gt; (RSA) gave what it called a "cautious welcome" to the &lt;a href="w%3AStern%20Review"&gt;Stern Review&lt;/a&gt; on the economics of climate change.

The leader of the RSA’s CarbonLimited Project, Matt Prescott, agreed that this needed global co-operation, but urged the British government to expand the notion of &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20trading"&gt;carbon trading&lt;/a&gt; downwards to the level of the individual when drafting the Climate Change Bill.

The RSA has produced the first mock-up of personal carbon trading online. There, members of the public can obtain an estimate of their own carbon ‘footprint’ by entering their gas and electricity consumptions, car and air mileages, on the RSA’s Carbon DAQ web site.

The RSA suggest that a personal target of 5 tonnes of carbon emission per annum should be achievable.

The RSA has a three-year project to investigate the feasibility of personal carbon trading. It has initiated research, conducted open public debates and is co-ordinating various trials.

Personal carbon trading entails allocating to each individual an equal share of the overall sustainable level of carbon emissions. There would be an open market that would enable those who had not used up their share to sell their surplus to those who need, or can afford, an entitlement to emit more than their ration.

10,733 fugitive felons have been arrested after Operation Falcon III (Federal and Local Cops Organized Nationally), came to a close after 7 days, &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Attorney General &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. Marshals Service Director &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Clark"&gt;John F. Clark&lt;/a&gt; announced on Thursday. The Operation Falcon projects are part of a federally organized effort involving about 3,000 federal, state and local law enforcement officers, who target fugitives with state and local law enforcement warrants, a Justice Department spokesman said.

According to Clark, there are currently at least 1 million fugitives in the United States, and police across the nation arrest about 1,000 fugitives per week.

Gonzales explained that the operation was designed "to be sure that there aren't second or third victims, especially children. . . by a dangerous fugitive". Included in the operation were 24 states east of the Mississippi River, the &lt;a href="District%20of%20Columbia"&gt;District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;.

Amongst the 10,733 fugitives arrested were 1,659 sex offenders, 971 of which were wanted for failing to register. 360 gang members were also apprehended, and over 270 weapons confiscated in the raid. This latest sweep was preceded in April this year, and in April of last year by similar Falcon operations.

No enforcement officers were killed during Falcon III. According to officers, a male murder suspect was killed when he showed a weapon to the police in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, a suspect's mother fired a weapon at police.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; embassy located in &lt;a href="w%3ANairobi%2C%20Kenya"&gt;Nairobi, Kenya&lt;/a&gt; has issued a warning that "extremists from &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;" are planning to launch suicide bomb attacks in &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. says it has received information from an undisclosed source that specifically mentions the use of suicide bombers to will blow up "prominent landmarks" in Ethiopia and Kenya.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20State"&gt;Department of State&lt;/a&gt; has said that they are concerned "about terrorists in Somalia with links to outside terrorist groups."

"These threats specifically mention the execution of suicide explosions in prominent landmarks within Kenya and Ethiopia. [The] terrorist threats [are] emanating from extremist elements within Somalia which target Kenya, Ethiopia and other surrounding countries," said the statement.

The statement adds that all Americans need to "be vigilant" and to use "extreme caution" while travelling in the area.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, former Presidential candidate, U.S. senator from &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, and decorated war veteran, apologized yesterday for a statement made on Monday at an appearance at &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%20City%20College"&gt;Pasadena City College&lt;/a&gt; that American students who did not study hard and stay in school would end up "stuck in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;."

"You know education," he said, "if you make the most of it, and you study hard, and you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well. If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq."

Kerry posted on his website that he meant to say if you don't study hard, you would end up like U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; stuck in Iraq.
"My poorly stated joke at a rally was not about, and never intended to refer to, any troop," Kerry said yesterday. "I sincerely regret that my words were misinterpreted to wrongly imply anything negative about those in uniform, and I personally apologize to any service member, family member, or American who was offended."

Mr. Bush said Kerry's comment was "insulting" and "shameful" and that he should apologize to the U.S. forces. War veterans also demanded that he say he was sorry.

On November 1, 2006, the following statement was released by the Democratic Senator's office:
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; As a combat veteran, I want to make it clear to anyone in uniform and to their loved ones: my poorly stated joke at a rally was not about, and never intended to refer to any troop.

I sincerely regret that my words were misinterpreted to wrongly imply anything negative about those in uniform, and I personally apologize to any service member, family member, or American who was offended. 

It is clear the Republican Party would rather talk about anything but their failed security policy. I don't want my verbal slip to be a diversion from the real issues. I will continue to fight for a change of course to provide real security for our country, and a winning strategy for our troops.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – ♡❤Senator John Kerry♡❤&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

"Sen. Kerry's apology to the troops for his insulting comments came late, but it was the right thing to do," said the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;, which were quick to respond to Kerry's apology.

In response to the comment, U.S. troops in Iraq held up a sign saying: "Halp us Jon Carry -- We R stuck hear N Irak." Eight U.S. soldiers, who are stationed near the southeastern city of &lt;a href="w%3ANasiriya"&gt;Nasiriya&lt;/a&gt;, are shown holding the sign in a photo that has been widely distributed on the Internet.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Software%20Foundation"&gt;Free Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (FSF) has announced today the release of the first version of &lt;a href="w%3AgNewSense"&gt;gNewSense&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="w%3AGNU"&gt;GNU&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; distribution based on both &lt;a href="w%3AUbuntu%20%28Linux%20distribution%29"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADebian"&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the newly created distribution is to offer an &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt; which is 100% proprietary software free.

Generally, GNU/Linux distributions comes with proprietary software such as &lt;a href="w%3AKernel%20%28computer%20science%29"&gt;kernel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADevice%20driver"&gt;drivers&lt;/a&gt; (eg. &lt;a href="w%3ANVIDIA"&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AATI%20Technologies"&gt;ATI&lt;/a&gt; card drivers), the &lt;a href="w%3AOpera%20%28Internet%20Suite%29"&gt;Opera web browser&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="w%3AVoIP"&gt;VoIP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Skype"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; software among others. According to its developers: “From a philosophical perspective we wanted to create a GNU/Linux distribution where the user has access to all the sources for all software on the system. This includes everything from the heart of the kernel through to the everyday desktop applications." 

&lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Software%20Foundation%23Current%20staff%20and%20employees"&gt;Ted Teah&lt;/a&gt;, FSF's free software directory maintainer explained, "With all the kernel firmware and restricted repositories removed, and the reliance on Ubuntu's proprietary distribution management tool gone, this distribution is the most advanced GNU/Linux distribution that has a commitment to be 100% free." 
gNewSense will provide users with full security updates and is available for immediate download in &lt;a href="w%3ALiveDistro"&gt;LiveCD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Organization%20for%20Standardization"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt; format along with a version of the Ubiquity graphical installer. The developers have also created a set of tools called ♡❤Builder♡❤ that allows users to create their own gNewSense-based distributions.

In the new 1.0 version, gNewSense has removed all non-free firmware from the kernel, removed access to the Ubuntu Restricted component (such as links to &lt;a href="w%3ALaunchpad%20%28website%29"&gt;LaunchPad&lt;/a&gt; which are redirected to the gNewSense webpage for now) and replaced the Ubuntu logos with its own. Also the &lt;a href="w%3AUniData"&gt;UniVerse&lt;/a&gt; component is enabled by default and &lt;a href="w%3AEmacs"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABerkeley%20Software%20Distribution"&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt; games, &lt;a href="w%3ANetHack%20General%20Public%20License"&gt;NetHack&lt;/a&gt;, and build-essential part of the default install.

There already exists such a distribution called Ututo which aims for zero proprietary software but it never really took off in popularity. A few years ago, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Shuttleworth"&gt;Mark Shuttleworth&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Ubuntu distribution, also initiated a similar initiative dubbed Gnubuntu but it never materialized.

A &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%20Hill%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Richmond Hill, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; man is currently released after he was abducted and escaped last night.

Chee Kian Jeff Chan, 28, was forced by three people into a black &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes"&gt;Mercedes SUV&lt;/a&gt; (which was caught on security camera) in the parking garage of his condominium at 23 Oneida Cresant in the Yonge Street and High Tech Road area. A small amount of blood was found at the scene. He was dropped off at an unnamed location in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday night.

The suspects were wearing black clothes and balaclavas covering their faces at the time of the incident. The licence plate number of the Mercedes SUV is not known because there was no plate on the front of the vehicle.

Chan walked into the Major Mackenzie Dr. W. police station, at about 6:45 p.m. last night, suffering from injuries and went to a hospital for examination.

&lt;a href="w%3AYork%20Regional%20Police"&gt;York Regional Police&lt;/a&gt; say that he is a poker player, after hearing about a man with the same name that took seventh place at the &lt;a href="w%3ARiver%20Rock%20Casino%20Resort"&gt;River Rock Casino Resort&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; on November 19, 2005, earning him $44,753.

No ransom note was received and police believe that it was an &lt;a href="w%3Aextortion"&gt;extortion&lt;/a&gt; attempt.

"He was unaware of a lot of things during his ordeal," Constable Laurie Perks said. "He didn't know what they looked like. His vision was concealed and so he therefore didn't know where he was through most of his ordeal."

It is believed that Chan's three captors released him after 28 hours because of the media coverage surrounding his disappearance.

The investigation is still ongoing.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACSRT"&gt;military commissions&lt;/a&gt; set up by the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt; to try &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Guantanamo%20detainees"&gt;Guantanamo detainees&lt;/a&gt; may order indefinite detention of suspects based on evidence secured by torture, concluded an ♡❤amicus curiae♡❤ brief filed by seven former federal judges before the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit"&gt;D.C Circuit Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;. 

Lawyers for &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20bay%20detention%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo detainees&lt;/a&gt; also filed separate briefs arguing that the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20Commissions%20Act%20of%202006"&gt;Military Commissions Act of 2006&lt;/a&gt; (MCA) does not prevent the court from hearing &lt;a href="w%3Ahabeas%20corpus"&gt;habeas corpus&lt;/a&gt; petitions from detainees. 

A court uses the &lt;a href="w%3Awrit"&gt;writ&lt;/a&gt; of habeas corpus to examine whether a person is lawfully imprisoned by the government, and to compel release if the imprisonment is not legal. In &lt;a href="w%3Acommon%20law"&gt;common law&lt;/a&gt; countries, habeas corpus is an important instrument for protecting an individual's freedom against arbitrary state action. 

<h2>Long road to military trials</h2>

The United States has detained 759 men as "&lt;a href="w%3Aillegal%20combatants"&gt;illegal combatants&lt;/a&gt;" at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, of whom about 250 have been released or transferred to the custody of other countries. 

After the Supreme Court ruled in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARasul%20v.%20Bush"&gt;Rasul v. Bush&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (2004) that detainees are entitled to challenge their detentions in federal court, the Defence Department set up the &lt;a href="w%3ACombatant%20Status%20Review%20Tribunal"&gt;Combatant Status Review Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; (CSRT) to review the determinations that the detainees were "enemy combatants". The detentions of 558 were reviewed by the CSRT, which confirmed all but 38 of the detainees as "enemy combatants". John B. Bellinger III, Legal Adviser to the State Department has indicated last month that the administration plans to try only 60 to 80 of the 435 men currently detained.

In December 2005, the &lt;a href="w%3ADetainee%20Treatment%20Act"&gt;Detainee Treatment Act&lt;/a&gt; (DTA) was signed into law under which, the habeas petitions of the detainees were to be transferred to the CSRT. The Supreme Court held in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHamdan%20v.%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (2006) that the DTA did not apply to pending habeas petitions that challenge the legitimacy of the tribunals themselves. This led to the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to be signed into law, under which the administration seeks to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over the detainees' habeas petitions. Instead, detainees can challenge their detention at the CSRT and appeal only for a limited review by the D.C. Circuit Court.

Previously, two district courts have given contradictory rulings over the issue of whether the petitioners, who have not been charged but have been detained indefinitely, can petition for habeas rights in federal courts. 

On Wednesday, attorneys for detainees filed the first full court briefings challenging the administration's interpretation of the detainee laws at the US District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in the cases ♡❤Al Odah v. United States♡❤ and ♡❤Boumediene v. Bush♡❤ and ♡❤Khalid v. Bush♡❤.

Separately, seven former federal judges filed an amicus brief in support of the detainees' brief.

The Justice department is scheduled to file a response by November 13.

<h2>Former judges file ♡❤amicus♡❤ brief</h2>

Seven former Federal Circuit and District judges, &lt;a href="w%3AShirley%20M.%20Hufstedler"&gt;Shirley M. Hufstedler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANathaniel%20R.%20Jones"&gt;Nathaniel R. Jones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAbner%20J.%20Mikva"&gt;Abner J. Mikva&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APatricia%20M.%20Wald"&gt;Patricia M. Wald&lt;/a&gt;, and retired District Judges George N. Leighton, Frank J. McGarr, and Timothy K. Lewis filed an amicus brief supporting the petitioners' claim, saying that the "court-stripping" provisions of the MCA "challenges the integrity of our judicial system".

The brief argued that the government's interpretation of the 
DTA and MCA would force the court to condone the use of evidence obtained by torture to sentence detainees to indefinite imprisonment, which is prohibited by common law and the Constitution. 

The brief pointed out that the CSRTs failed to consider whether evidence presented to them was obtained by torture. The brief cited several cases where records of the tribunal proceedings showed that many of them did not address evidence of torture, some cross-examined detainees about torture allegations, but to distance U.S. forces from the alleged torture. Even when the CSRT referred torture allegations for investigation, it did not wait for results before ruling based on the evidence. 

Based on rules that compelled the tribunal to accept the government's evidence against prisoners as presumptively "genuine and accurate.", the tribunal relied on incriminating statements by detainees, even though they testified that the statements were obtained by torture and that medical records and other reports confirm the use of torture.

The government has maintained that investigating allegations of torture was not "the CSRT's role" and has claimed that the tribunals are permitted to rely on evidence "obtained through a non-traditional means, even torture" to determine that a prisoner was an enemy combatant. 

<h3>Prisoners allege torture</h3>

The brief listed several instances where prisoners have alleged 
the use of torture to extract incriminating statements.

The Australian citizen &lt;a href="w%3AMamdouh%20Habib"&gt;Mamdouh Habib&lt;/a&gt;, who was captured in Pakistan in 2001 was "&lt;a href="w%3AExtraordinary%20rendition"&gt;rendered&lt;/a&gt;" to Egypt, where he alleges he confessed to several terrorism related crimes after being subjected to "horrific abuse" by the Egyptian authorities. The tribunal simultaneously found enough credible evidence to order an investigation into the torture allegations and found Habib an enemy combatant based on the same evidence.
The brief outlined the case of detainee &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20al%20Qahtani"&gt;Mohammed al Qahtani&lt;/a&gt; whose interrogation, the Defence Department has said, produced "detailed information about 30 of Osama Bin Laden's bodyguards who are also held at Guantanamo". Interrogation logs showed al Qahtani was interrogated for about 20 hours per day for seven weeks, subjected to isolation, intimidated with military dogs, sexually humiliated, and subjected to sleep and sensory deprivation. 

Since the CSRT rules permit secret evidence, suspects implicated by al Qahtani's statements will not be told who accused them or under what circumstances and the accusations will be presumed accurate.

The brief pointed out that it was not aware of a single CSRT that allowed a prisoner to develop an evidentiary record to support the allegations of torture. But according to the government's interpretation of the DTA and MCA, the appeals court cannot consider facts outside the CSRT's record when reviewing the CSRT's decision.

<h2>Detainee lawyers challenge new law</h2>

The briefs filed by lawyers for the detainees argues that the text of the MCA does not strip the courts of authority to hear pending habeas petitions and does not permit indefinite detention without charge. 

The briefs argue that if the MCA did indeed repeal habeas rights, then the law is unconstitutional. This, because the CSRT hearings and the limited review by the D.C. Circuit court, which are meant to be the substitute for a habeas review under the Act, are not "adequate and effective" to test the legality of the detentions, and hence would violate the &lt;a href="w%3ASuspension%20Clause"&gt;Suspension Clause&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. constitution.

The MCA interpretation of the review process falls short of the "adequate and effective" remedy constitutionally required, according to detainee lawyers, with the following shortcomings -

<ul>
BULLET::::- The administration contends that detainees, or their attorneys, are not entitled to classified information relevant to the case but not in the CSRT's record.
BULLET::::- The administration claims that the Act forbids the Circuit court from considering any facts not in the record of the CSRT proceedings or excluding any part of the evidence presented in the record (for instance, evidence obtained by torture).
BULLET::::- The government also interprets the Act to require the Court to uphold the CSRT's decision, unless there was ♡❤no♡❤ evidence supporting detention. It does not allow the Court to assess the relative weight of the evidence, thus, as long as some evidence supported detention, this Court would be constrained to uphold the imprisonment.
BULLET::::- Finally, the Circuit court itself has no power under the Act to order the release of a detainee if the CSRT process or its ruling is unlawful.

</ul>
The briefs further argue that the MCA does not prevent the detainees claiming rights under the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AStern%20Review"&gt;Stern Review&lt;/a&gt; of the Economics of Climate Change put the cost of keeping emissions at 550 parts per million at one percent of global GDP

A leaked draft report, by the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Intergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC), due to be published next year, estimates this cost could be between one and five percent of global GDP.
The Stern Review put the costs of not acting to resist climate change could be between 5 and 20 percent GDP.

It is reported that UK Ministers are to travel to India and America to promote the Stern Review. Their task will not be eased by the leaked IPCC report which is now said to be available freely on the internet.

Following the Stern Review, Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; urged the member states of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union%20Emission%20Trading%20Scheme"&gt;European Union Emissions Trading Scheme&lt;/a&gt; to tighten their targets even further.

"It appears this was an uncomplicated, smooth shutdown. The company will need to take a careful and deliberate look at what went wrong," said Nuclear Regularitory Commission spokesman, Neil Sheehan.

A worker at the power plant was injured while the reactor was shutting down, after being scared by steam venting from the reactor, which caused him to fall.

The reactor, which first went operational in 1974, shutdown on Thursday afternoon on the "non-nuclear side of the reactor" at 1:35 p.m. [EST] and as of the moment remains offline, added Sheehan. This is the first time since 1997 that the reactor has shutdown.

In 1979, the Unit 2 reactor suffered a partial meltdown and has remained offline since the disaster.

After hosting the United States gameshow ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Price%20is%20Right"&gt;The Price Is Right&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Barker"&gt;Bob Barker&lt;/a&gt; has decided to call it quits and retire from being the gameshow's 35 year-long host. Barker plans to end the show in June of 2007.

"I will be 83 years old on December 12 ... and I've decided to retire while I'm still young," jokes Barker. Explaining why he has been on American televisions for over 50 years, Barker said "I've gone on and on and on to this ancient age because I've enjoyed it."

"I'm just reaching the age where the constant effort to be there and do the show physically is a lot for me. I might be able to do the show another year, but better [to retire] a year too soon than a year too late," added Barker.

Barker first started to host gameshows in 1956 when he hosted ♡❤Truth or Consequences♡❤ and started to host ♡❤The Price is Right♡❤ on September 4, 1972 where, to this day, he has been the gameshow's host.

Barker is hinting the possibility of appearing in a few movies, but jokes around saying he will not appear in any "nude scenes."

"I refuse to do nude scenes. These Hollywood producers want to capitalize on my obvious sexuality, but I don't want to be just another beautiful body," said Barker in a joking manner.

♡❤CBS♡❤ calls Barker a "legend" and an "entertainment icon."

The first thing he plans to do after retiring is "sit down for maybe a couple of weeks and find out what it feels like to be bored," said Barker.

"Bob Barker is a daytime legend, an entertainment icon and one of the most beloved television personalities of our time," said Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of the CBS Network who also added that the network plans to do a special television show in Barker's honor, but Barker will not be saying a special goodbye to his viewers saying he will say what he always does at the end of every show; "Help control the pet population. Have your pets spayed or neutered."

"From the bottom of my heart, I thank the television viewers, because they have made it possible for me to earn a living for 50 years doing something that I thoroughly enjoy. They have invited me into their homes daily for a half a century," said Barker.

Three &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; fighters, including Luaye al-Burnu, a local official in the &lt;a href="w%3AIzz%20al-Din%20al-Qassam%20Brigades"&gt;Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades&lt;/a&gt;, were among over 17 dead as a result of &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; assaults in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;. Two women were gunned down by Israeli soldiers who opened fire on a group of woman that formed in front of a mosque where Hamas men had taken refuge. Israeli soldiers reacted to the mosque as a Hamas defense position, and to the women who ran to the mosque as a human shield to aid those inside to escape. 

Hamas leader Ismail Haniya praised the women, but the Israelis said they had served as "human shields" for the resistance militia. Palestinian officials have termed the Israeli attacks "&lt;a href="w%3Amassacre"&gt;massacres&lt;/a&gt;". 

The incident occurred when the local womenfolk were asked, on radio, to intervene in the tense standoff between the &lt;a href="w%3AIDF"&gt;Israeli troops&lt;/a&gt; and about 15 Hamas fighters in the mosque. One lady, Nahed Abou Harbiya, told the BBC Arabic Service that the men were given womens' clothes so that they could escape. &lt;blockquote&gt;"All the women headed to the mosque to get the Palestinian resistance men... But the Israeli occupation forces were firing heavily at us with their machine guns and also threw stun grenades at us.

"We entered the mosque and indeed we got all the resistance men out and put female attire on them so that the Israeli occupation forces wouldn't arrest them," she said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The firing began as the women approached the Israeli gunmen, injuring 10 people, including one Palestinian camerman. Hamas radio reported that all 15 men had escaped safely.

Palestinian doctors confirmed that seven people died as a result of 
Israeli air raids in Beit Hanoun. A spokesman for Israel's military stated that five towns-&lt;a href="w%3ABeit%20Hanoun"&gt;Beit Hanoun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABeit%20Lahiya"&gt;Beit Lahiya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJabaliya"&gt;Jabaliya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARafah"&gt;Rafah&lt;/a&gt; had been targeted. An Israeli official claimed that the attacks were aimed at "suspected Palestinian militants who were planting explosives or who had carried out rocket attacks." 

A Hamas official said that the "militants had been involved in manufacturing rockets that were to be fired at Israel." About 30 people, including some gunmen and a four-year-old child have been killed by Israeli attacks in Beit Hanoun. Israeli human rights group &lt;a href="w%3AB%27Tselem"&gt;B'Tselem&lt;/a&gt; says over 300 Palestinians have been killed by attacks carried out by Israel following the capture of &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Corporal Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt; on 25 June this year.

An advertisement for &lt;a href="w%3ADove%20%28brand%29"&gt;Dove&lt;/a&gt; beauty products has been viewed by well over three million people, without ever being on television. A copywriter from &lt;a href="w%3AOgilvy%20%26amp%3B%20Mather"&gt;Ogilvy Toronto&lt;/a&gt;, the advertising agency that created a spot named "evolution", uploaded the advertisement to video sharing website &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.

While the official upload of the ad itself has been viewed 1,119,262 times, there are dozens of copies of the ad on YouTube, adding to a minimum of 3,059,546 views. The official copy of the video is the website's 12th most viewed this month, 53rd of all time.

Unofficial uploads have each received high levels of viewership, with 449595, 445322, 207906, 201670, 195265, 116501, and 102634 plays.

The agency did not originally intend to upload the video to YouTube, only display it on the company's homepage. Staff member Tim Piper uploaded it to his account on October 6, about a week before it first got media coverage on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Morning%20America"&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The ad begins with a woman walking into a photo shoot. From there, she is primped and plucked by hair and makeup artists, then tweaked on a &lt;a href="w%3APhotoshop"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt;-like program. The photo-manipulation is then posted on a billboard for the fictional "Easel Foundation Makeup" brand. Two young, teenage girls walk past, glancing at the board. "No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted" ends the ad in text, "Every girl deserves to feel beautiful just the way she is."

The creative team for the ad included Tim Piper, Mike Kirkland, Janet Kestin, Nancy Vonk, directors T Piper (treatment and post production) and Yael Staav (live action) from Reginald Pike, Soho post production, Rogue editing, Vapor music, Gabor Jurina and Make-up: Diana Carreiro, and Reginald Pike.

The official French copy of the ad has only received 132 views, although it was only uploaded on November 2, 2006.

<h1>Evangelist Hovind found guilty for tax fraud</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Evangelist%20Hovind%20found%20guilty%20for%20tax%20fraud&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Evangelist &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Hovind"&gt;Kent Hovind&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, Jo, was found guilty on all counts of tax fraud concerning merchandise and amusement park admission sales. The trial began at &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20Florida"&gt;United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday October 18, 2006, and prosecutors rested their case against Hovind on November 1. Defense lawyers rested their case on the same day without presenting evidence or calling witnesses; Hovind claims that he runs a church, and thus should not have to pay taxes, while prosecutors claimed that he was actually running a business.

<h2>Pensacola tax trial</h2>
Hovind is a &lt;a href="w%3AYoung%20Earth%20creationism"&gt;Young Earth creationist&lt;/a&gt; who earns income for speaking, selling merchandise (videos), and runs a amusement park that asserts humans and dinosaurs lived together. His talks and videos give a pro-&lt;a href="w%3Acreationism"&gt;creationism&lt;/a&gt; perspective, which he receives income for. Hovind, who calls himself "Dr. Dino", received a &lt;a href="w%3ADoctor%20of%20Philosophy"&gt;Ph.D&lt;/a&gt; in "Christian education" from the &lt;a href="w%3ASchool%20accreditation"&gt;unaccredited&lt;/a&gt; correspondence school &lt;a href="w%3APatriot%20Bible%20University"&gt;Patriot Bible University&lt;/a&gt; in 1991.

Hovind faces a maximum of 288 years in prison while his wife faces up to 225 years. The charges against his wife are "aiding and abetting her husband with 44 counts of evading bank-reporting requirements." Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Heldmyer said Dinosaur Adventure Land, a theme park, "grew and grew and grew," grossing as much as $2 million a year. Whereas Hovind was paid in cash for his speeches, and then got cash for mechandise he sold at his lectures, Jo "was handling the money." This includes, as the &lt;a href="w%3APensacola%20News%20Journal"&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/a&gt; noted, "on Dec. 20, 1999, she cashed a check from the Creation Science Evangelism account for $7,500 at 1:15 p.m. She returned at 2:50 p.m. to cash another check from the same account for $7,500." Also "On the day the IRS searched the Hovind home, Kent Hovind withdrew $70,000 from the Creation Science Evangelism account. Half in a check; the other in cash." 

Hovind's defense had insisted that experts assured him he was right, but "he sought out only the people who agreed with him, not the people who knew better," Heldmyer said.

Mark O'Brien of the &lt;a href="w%3APensacola%20News%20Journal"&gt;Pensacola News Journal&lt;/a&gt; wrote, "The saddest thing: Had they cooperated with the agents, they probably wouldn't be worrying about prison sentences now."

The couple will be sentenced on January 9, 2007 and Hovind is expected to remain in custody until then. Heldmyer said Kent Hovind was a flight risk and a "danger to the community."

&lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Prime Minister Blair&lt;/a&gt; has pointed to the great opportunities afforded by tackling climate change. One company in London has cornered 80% of the &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20trading"&gt;carbon trading&lt;/a&gt; market, part of the green goldrush created by the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Climate%20Change%20Treaty"&gt;Kyoto Climate Change Treaty&lt;/a&gt;. This company, Climate Exchange plc, now dominates the carbon exchange markets, increasing its turnover from 95 million tonnes of carbon last year to 257 million in the first eight months of this year. Climate Exchange plc is now valued at more than £160 million 

Climate Exchange plc was founded by James Cameron, previously a negotiator of the Kyoto Treaty. Mr Cameron is quoted as saying about the development of this new market, "It's what we hoped for. Investment power is power, and you need power to make a change. There is huge vested interest in the status quo, and to shift that you need power". In Europe the market is expected to more than double from €9.4 billion (£6.3 billion) last year to €22 billion (£15.4 billion) this year, according to the analysts Point Carbon. 

At present USA is not participating in the carbon trading scheme, but individual states may decide to join in. It has been estimated that if ever carbon becomes a world commodity, the value of permits could reach €1000 billion (£700 billion). 

It is claimed by advocates of the scheme that, by putting a price on carbon emissions, pollution can be costed into business decisions. This enables market forces to drive the reduction in emissions, making government regulation unnecessary. Carbon trading is not without detractors who see this free market as an intrusion into public space and point to corruption and failures in accounting and the application of science. 

Sean Park, of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, gave an example: a &lt;a href="w%3Awind%20farm"&gt;wind farm&lt;/a&gt; developer could receive tradable carbon credits because the technology had zero carbon emissions. These credits could then be used to raise the capital needed to build the wind farm. In this way, carbon trading promoted the development of low carbon technologies.

Following publication of the &lt;a href="w%3AStern%20Review"&gt;Stern Review&lt;/a&gt;, which he had commissioned, UK &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Chancellor Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; urged member states of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union%20Emissions%20Trading%20Scheme"&gt;European Union Emissions Trading Scheme&lt;/a&gt; to aim for new carbon emission targets. He said that they should reduce emissions by 30% below 1990 levels by 2020 and by at least 60% by 2050.

On the night of November 3rd a blackout in &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; left 5 million in the dark. The blackout, which started at about 10 P.M. local time (2100UTC), is said to have affected the French capital, &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, and 15 other areas, including Rhône, Isère, Loire, Ain and Saône-et-Loire (&lt;a href="w%3ABurgundy"&gt;Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;).

As of early Sunday morning, about 5 million people are still without power, and the French power authority, &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89lectricit%C3%A9%20de%20France"&gt;Électricité de France&lt;/a&gt;, said that the failure had originated in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, which has also effected other European countries.

The blackout was triggered due to a sudden drop in temperature, which over heated the power system. The French emergency services were so overloaded with calls that they were forced to ask that people not call.

Air traffic around Paris was unaffected by the blackout.

An unnamed &lt;a href="w%3Asubtropical%20cyclone"&gt;subtropical storm&lt;/a&gt; known only as "Storm 91C" packing winds of up to 40&amp;nbsp;mph struck the U.S. state of &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. The storm was a very rare occurrence, and caused minimal damage.

It formed from an &lt;a href="w%3Aextratropical%20cyclone"&gt;extratropical storm&lt;/a&gt; around October 30 in the Central Pacific and became subtropical on November 1, and was recognized as "Storm 91C" by the U.S. Navy. The storm was out of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt; (NHC) and the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Pacific%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;Central Pacific Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt;'s (CPHC) areas of responsibility, and therefore didn't receive a name. In addition, the CPHC doesn't issue advisories on subtropical storms.

The cyclone moved into the East Pacific and organized into a hurricane-like system with winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;mph.

The storm began to lose convection and weaken, but managed to make it to Washington and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; as a 40&amp;nbsp;mph storm with gusts up to 60&amp;nbsp;mph.

A high wind warning was issued by the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; for the southern &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; coast to &lt;a href="w%3ATillamook"&gt;Tillamook&lt;/a&gt;.

Heavy rain and high winds were brought along the northern Pacific coast of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

On November 2, &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Haggard"&gt;Ted Haggard&lt;/a&gt; resigned from the presidency of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20Evangelicals"&gt;National Association of Evangelicals&lt;/a&gt; and his pastorship in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Life%20Church%2C%20Colorado"&gt;New Life Church&lt;/a&gt; after allegations that he repeatedly engaged in homosexual sex with a prostitute (Mike Jones) and used &lt;a href="w%3Amethamphetamine"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt;.

Haggard, a critic of &lt;a href="w%3Agay%20marriage"&gt;gay marriage&lt;/a&gt; and homosexuality, is a leading social conservative voice. Author Jeff Sharlet reported that Haggard "talks to. . . Bush or his advisers every Monday" and opines that "no pastor in America holds more sway over the political direction of evangelicalism."

In his church, Haggard preached "we don't have to debate about what we should think about homosexual activity, it's written in the Bible."

On Wednesday Haggard denied knowing the male escort, Jones, but admitted Friday that he had summoned the escort to give him a massage in a Denver hotel room and bought methamphetamine from him. He then followed up and said, "I was tempted, I bought it, but I never used it."

November 5, is &lt;a href="Guy%20Fawkes%20Night"&gt;Guy Fawkes Night&lt;/a&gt;. On this day, 401 years ago there was an attempt to blow up the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20parliament"&gt;British parliament&lt;/a&gt;.

Since that time, Guy Fawkes day is celebrated by bonfires, fireworks and the parading of effigies called "guys".

The event is not only celebrated in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, but other &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; countries including &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANewfoundland"&gt;Newfoundland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bahamas"&gt;Bahamas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Kitts"&gt;Saint Kitts&lt;/a&gt; and formerly &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

Britons celebrate a national day of thanksgiving that the Gunpowder plot did not destroy their king and parliament. But as tradition goes, the oppression that Roman Catholics felt was always de-emphasised.

This year sees rising opposition to the traditional fireworks and bonfires celebrations. A smog warning has been issued for &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; on the 5th and British Labour MP &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Sheerman"&gt;Barry Sheerman&lt;/a&gt; called for the event to be scrapped.

<h2>The Gunpowder Plot</h2>

The &lt;a href="w%3AGunpowder%20Plot"&gt;Gunpowder Plot&lt;/a&gt; of 1605 was a failed attempt by a few radical &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholics"&gt;Roman Catholics&lt;/a&gt; to kill &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20James%20I%20of%20England"&gt;King James I of England&lt;/a&gt;, his family, and most of the &lt;a href="w%3AProtestant"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; aristocracy in a single attack by blowing up the Houses of Parliament during the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Opening%20of%20Parliament"&gt;State Opening&lt;/a&gt;. The conspirators had then planned to abduct the royal children, not present in Parliament, and incite a revolt in the &lt;a href="w%3AMidlands"&gt;Midlands&lt;/a&gt;.

The plot occurred during the long-running religious battle that followed &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Henry%20VIII"&gt;King Henry VIII's&lt;/a&gt; break from &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; in 1534. 

Far from helping their fellow Catholics avoid religious persecution, the plotters put many loyal Catholics in a difficult position. Before this period Catholicism had been associated with &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AInquisition"&gt;Inquisition&lt;/a&gt; but after the plot it also became thought of as treasonous to be Catholic.

Fawkes was hired to do the "dirty work". He entered the Roman Catholic faith at the age of nine, when his mother married a Roman Catholic after the death of his father. As a soldier who went to war in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, Fawkes was noted for bravery; he was one of the last to hear of the plot, and rushed into it before knowing the details.

The plot was actually planned by Robert Catesby, whose father had been imprisoned for refusing to convert to the Anglican Church. He started his planning two years previously in 1603. But he needed money and ammunition, which forced him to confide in at least 13 people. One of these was Francis Tresham, a brother-in-law of &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Monteagle"&gt;Lord Monteagle&lt;/a&gt;, and a member of the House of Lords

The plot failed when one of the conspirators warned his brother-in-law not to attend the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Lords"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;, who, in turn, set off the alarm that resulted in the ringleaders, including Guy Fawkes, being captured and executed.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Iraqi%20Criminal%20Tribunal"&gt;Iraq Special Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; has finally sentenced the deposed &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i President &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; to death by hanging over the killings of 148 villagers in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ADujail"&gt;Dujail&lt;/a&gt; in 1982.

Hussein was charged with &lt;a href="w%3ACrime%20against%20humanity"&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt; for ordering the killings after a failed assassination attempt was made on him in the mostly Shiite town.

Of his seven co-defendants in the trial, the former head of the Iraqi secret police, Hussein's half-brother &lt;a href="w%3ABarzan%20al-Tikriti"&gt;Barzan al-Tikriti&lt;/a&gt; and the former chief judge of the Revolutionary Court, &lt;a href="w%3AAwad%20Hamed%20al-Bandar"&gt;Awad Hamed al-Bandar&lt;/a&gt; were also sentenced to death. Former vice-president &lt;a href="w%3ATaha%20Yassin%20Ramadan"&gt;Taha Yassin Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; was sentenced to life in prison, three other officials received 15 years in prison and one was acquitted.

<h2>Proceedings</h2>

The five-member Special Tribunal was authorised by the Iraqi Interim Government to try Iraqi nationals or residents accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or other serious crimes committed during the Ba'ath party rule between 1968 and 2003.
During today's hearing, Judge Rauf Rasheed Abdel Rahman ordered bailiffs to force Saddam, who was shouting out protests, to stand as the verdict was read out. 

Hussein was reported as appearing shaken as the verdict was pronounced, and later shouted "&lt;a href="w%3ATakbir"&gt;Allahu Akbar&lt;/a&gt;!" (God is greatest) and "Long live the nation!".

The sentences of death and life in prison carry an automatic appeal, and no time-limit is set for the appeals court review of the case. The law mandates the death sentence to be carried out within 30 days, after all appeals are exhausted.

Former U.S. Attorney General &lt;a href="w%3ARamsey%20Clark"&gt;Ramsey Clark&lt;/a&gt;, who is a defence attorney in the case, was ordered out of the court by the judges, who said that he had come to mock the Iraqi people and the court. Clarke had described the court yesterday as prejudiced and lacking impartiality, and called attention to the killings of Hussein's defence lawyers and the removal of judges from the tribunal.

<h2>Reactions</h2>
<h3>In Iraq</h3>
Ali al-Dabbagh, a spokesman for the Iraqi coalition government said the verdict was as expected, adding "This is the least that Saddam deserved because his crimes were great. No further punishment was possible." 

Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih called the court "just and professional" and said that Saddam was "given the justice he denied to the people of Iraq over 35 years".

A Sunni member of parliament, speaking under anonymity to Reuters, however called the judgement "a political verdict from a political court."

<h3>Popular reaction</h3>

The verdict was announced amidst increased security measures in Iraq, including curfews in Baghdad and other cities. Despite the curfew, around a thousand people were reported as coming out into the streets of the Shiite-dominated Sadr City in celebration and gunfire was heard in Baghdad. 

Celebrations were also reported in Dujail, where the killings took place. 

Despite the curfew, about a thousand people demonstrated in Tikrit carrying pictures of Saddam Hussein. Some Sunnis were reported as denouncing the verdict as a "product of the US occupation forces".

Fighting is reported to have broken out in Adhimiyah, a Sunni district of Baghdad, within half an hour of the verdict. There was heavy firing and mortar shells landed near the Abu Hanifa mosque.

<h3>International reactions</h3>
The U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad said the verdict was "an important milestone for Iraq". 

The U.K. Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett welcomed the trial's conclusion, saying it was "right" that Saddam and the other accused have to face Iraqi justice, and that they have been "held to account for their crimes".

Malcolm Smart, the Middle East and North Africa Director for &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; said that the tribunal's proceedings failed to meet necessary standards for a fair trial.

Hussein's verdict was delivered during highly contested midterm elections in United States; where the party most insistent upon an American occupation of Iraq (Republican - GOP) lagged in polls due to domestic controversies.

A sudden cold snap across &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; caused a surge in demand for electricity. Two &lt;a href="w%3Ahigh%20voltage"&gt;high voltage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apower%20line"&gt;power lines&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; failed. This triggered a cascade of cuts as automatic safety devices cut millions of customers in order to prevent a total &lt;a href="w%3Ablackout"&gt;blackout&lt;/a&gt; of the continent. Parts of Germany, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (including parts of &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; were affected. High speed railways were also impacted. Power was restored within two hours. Later reports said that &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACroatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; were also affected. 

An alternative cause has been suggested; that the opening of the Ems powerline crossing to let a ship pass may have triggered the blackout.

A senior director with French power company &lt;a href="w%3ARTE"&gt;RTE&lt;/a&gt; is reported as saying "We weren't very far from a European blackout".

After 13 years of isolation, Southeast Europe (including &lt;a href="Albania"&gt;Albania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina"&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;) were reconnected to the main European transmission system in November 2004. Now, with 400 million users, the European electrical transmission system has become, in terms of consumption, the world's largest electrical energy system.

Italy's Prime minister, Romano Prodi, said there was a "contradiction" in having a unified power network but no &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; central authority.

Christopher Soghoian, 24, a doctoral student in information security at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndiana%20University"&gt;Indiana University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , released a boarding pass generator for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Airlines"&gt;Northwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on October 25th. In the release, he stated that it demonstrates flaws in airport security and the no-fly list.

A few days later, on October 27th, Soghoian was visited by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who told him to take down the site. Soghoian complied with the FBI request. However, the FBI then raided his apartment that evening; apparently due to lack of a warrant during the first visit.

&lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Representative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Markey"&gt;Ed Markey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Mass.&lt;/a&gt;) had called for Soghoian to be arrested in October.

Fake boarding passes are quite easy to create in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Word"&gt;Microsoft Word&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; assuming you have access to a old boarding pass for comparison. Indeed, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has created a similarly passable &lt;a href="http%3A//www.amnestyusa.org/stoptorture/resources/boarding_pass.pdf"&gt;fake boarding pass&lt;/a&gt; for their &lt;a href="http%3A//www.airtorture.com/"&gt;AirTorture&lt;/a&gt; fundraising site. 

In February 2005, &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Schumer"&gt;Charles Schumer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; noticed this loophole in no-fly list. He urged the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATransportation%20Security%20Administration"&gt;TSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to "check every passenger's ID against the passenger's face and his boarding pass and ticket", as has been done immediately after the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011th%20attacks"&gt;September 11th attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . TSA declined to follow the senator's recommendation.

Mirrors of the fake boarding pass generator are available online.

Match Referee R S Madugalle set up a new target of 116 runs in 35 overs by &lt;a href="w%3ADuckworth-Lewis%20method"&gt;Duckworth-Lewis method&lt;/a&gt; for Australia to win because of time loss due to rain.

It is reported that &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt;, UK Foreign Secretary, is considering becoming the first UK Government Minister to admit to a link between the invasion of Iraq and the threat of terrorism in UK. This follows a leak last week of &lt;a href="w%3ACabinet"&gt;Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; papers that demand "a significant reduction in the number and intensity of the regional conflicts that fuel terror activity".

Prime Minister Tony Blair has always claimed that the war in Iraq has not fuelled terrorism in UK; that there was terrorism long before the invasion. This despite the posthumous video recording of one of the &lt;a href="w%3A7/7"&gt;7/7&lt;/a&gt; bombers, &lt;a href="w%3AShehzad%20Tanweer"&gt;Shehzad Tanweer&lt;/a&gt; who said his actions were provoked by British foreign policy and that attacks would continue until British soldiers were withdrawn from &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Beckett is considering admitting the link between Iraq and terrorism in UK when discussing the problem of Muslim youth becoming influenced by international terrorists. She has already disagreed openly with Prime Minister Blair recently by demanding that there be public debate into the need for the replacement of the &lt;a href="w%3ATrident%20missile%20system"&gt;Trident missile system&lt;/a&gt; and the Royal Navy's &lt;a href="w%3AVanguard%20class%20submarines"&gt;Vanguard class submarines&lt;/a&gt;, by apologising for the Iraq invasion and by not disagreeing with General Sir Richard Dannatt, who said that British troops in Iraq were provoking trouble.

On November 5, 2006, &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Abdullah%20II"&gt;King Abdullah II&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; met with 90 survivors of the &lt;a href="w%3ABeslan%20school%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;Beslan school hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt; during their week long vacation in Jordan, organised at the King's expense.

The King watched the students perform traditional dances and reviewed artworks that they had created celebrating the theme of cross-cultural communication and understanding. The event took place at the &lt;a href="w%3AKing%27s%20Academy"&gt;King's Academy&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AMadaba"&gt;Madaba&lt;/a&gt;, Jordan.

The traditions of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Fawkes%20Night"&gt;Bonfire Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; peculiar to the Sussex area were once again observed in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALewes"&gt;Lewes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on November 4.

Consistent with the town traditions in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Sussex"&gt;East Sussex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; county of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , effigies of various figures were carried through the town, and later burnt. The effigies this year included &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; (as Wonder Woman) and Crocodile Hunter &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Irwin"&gt;Steve Irwin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

As per tradition and local fame, effigies were carried through the town and burned on huge fires. These include The Pope, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Fawkes"&gt;Guy Fawkes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other unpopular figures. One of this year's unfortunate guest appearances was also rendered as a hugely grotesque likeness of the U.S. Secretary of State &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The unflattering effigy clutched a tattered &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; flag in one hand, and a miniature &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the other. Crowds shouted "Burn it!". 

Smaller scale effigies, and so called 'enemies of bonfire', were also represented. This year's enemies included &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Transport%20Police"&gt;British Transport Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , whose attitude and handling of Bonfire night is an issue of local contention. Transport police were quietly represented by a pig head wearing a police helmet.

The event was not without incident. Six arrests occurred in respect of criminal damage and public order offences, but the event was less rowdy than in previous years and eras in the history of the Bonfire.

Superintendent Cliff Parrot of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASussex%20Police"&gt;Sussex Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said, "The event passed safely and was a resounding success with fewer arrests than last year, People were well behaved and acted responsibly, which in turn allowed everyone else to enjoy the celebrations."

The steep streets of the small town, located one hour south of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , were filled during the chilly winter evening with crowds carrying burning torches, with police, and with alcohol consumption accompanied by loud deafening bangs. The air was thick with woodsmoke.

In addition to effigies, flaming crosses were carried in recognition of the town's 17
Protestant Martyrs. These preceded elaborate costumed parades where participants dressed as
Vikings, Antique firemen, Mongol warriors, and Zulus (including for the first time at Lewes, a female chieftain). Arthurian Knights and pirates were also featured. The pirates towed a cannon which they fired and shocked the crowds.

The traditional striped jerseys worn by various Bonfire Society members were also in evidence.

Bülent Ecevit, former prime minister of &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; and poet, has died at 81. Ecevit was in a coma for nearly six months following a stroke.

Ecevit was the prime minister of the government ordering a military intervention on July 20, 1974, to prevent a coup in &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; forces, dividing the island and setting the stage for the foundation of the breakaway &lt;a href="Turkish%20Republic%20of%20Northern%20Cyprus"&gt;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;. 

Following the September 12, 1980, military coup led by General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKenan%20Evren"&gt;Kenan Evren&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Ecevit was incarcerated and was suspended from active politics for life. A referendum in 1987 lifted his ban from politics, and he became the chairman of the Demokratik Sol Parti (Democratic Left Party) in 1989, inheriting the position from his wife, Rahşan Ecevit. 

He was a deputy prime minister under the last government of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMesut%20Y%C4%B1lmaz"&gt;Mesut Yılmaz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and then was briefly caretaker Prime Minister in the run-up to the 1999 general elections. In those elections, Ecevit's party gained the largest number of seats, leading to Ecevit's final stint as Prime Minister in a coalition with the Anavatan Partisi (Motherland Party) of Mesut Yilmaz and the Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi (Nationalist Movement Party).

The short-term economic pain caused rifts within his coalition and party, and eventually forced new elections in 2002. Ecevit, at this time visibly frail, was unsuccessful in leading his party back into the National Assembly. Ecevit subsequently retired from active politics in 2004.

Bülent Ecevit was not only a politician but a poet and writer. He studied Sanskrit, Bengali, and English and translated works by Rabindranath Tagore, T. S. Eliot, and Bernard Lewis into Turkish. 

Ecevit was hospitalized at the Gülhane Military Hospital in Ankara and placed in a medically induced coma after suffering a stroke on May 19, 2006. He died on November 5 without regaining consciousness.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ipsos%20Reid%3A%20Poll%20shows%20more%20Canadians%20oppose%20Afghan%20mission&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Support for Canada's Afghan mission is declining over the course of the last month according to a new &lt;a href="w%3AIpsos-Reid"&gt;Ipsos Reid&lt;/a&gt; opinion poll conducted for &lt;a href="w%3ACanWest%20Global%20Communications"&gt;CanWest News Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Television%20Network"&gt;Global Television&lt;/a&gt;.

When citizens were asked if they would support the mission until 2009, 58 per cent of Canadians said "no" and 39 per cent said they "strongly oppose" the mission. When asked if they supported the mission, 41 per cent of Canadians said "yes".

44 per cent of Canadians say they support the "use of Canadian troops for security and combat efforts against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan."

Opposition is highest in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; with 73 per cent of the population, followed by &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Canada"&gt;Atlantic Canada&lt;/a&gt; at 61 per cent, &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt; supports the mission, while &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; is split right down the middle.

"There's no good news on Afghanistan, that's the thing," said Ipsos Reid senior vice president Darrell Bricker. "The only thing we hear out of Afghanistan is about what Canadian got injured or killed today. There's no sense of progress."

While in Canada for a visit to Ottawa and Montreal from September 21 to 23, Afghan President &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt; thanked Canada for its contribution. "They have sacrificed so that we in Afghanistan may have security and they have sacrificed to ensure the continued safety of their fellow Canadians from terrorism," said Karzai in his address to the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Canada"&gt;Canadian Parliament&lt;/a&gt; in September.

People between the ages of 18 and 34 are the most likley to oppose the mission, according to Ipsos Reid.

So far, Thirty-nine Canadian soldiers have died in Afghanistan since 2002.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt; wants to reopen the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Canada"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; to have a debate about &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; as a nation within Canada. It is to be debated at the convention two days before the new leader is chosen.

&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt;, current Liberal leadership candidate, warned about reopening the Constitution. 

According to Ignatieff's website it says that Rae "supported the notion that Quebec is a nation," and "we can be both a Quebecker and a Canadian." 

"I'm not somebody who is going to set this country on a constitutional adventure, whose consequences and whose outcome I'm not certain of," Rae said. "For me, what's important is to stay open to Quebec, but we will not reopen the Constitution," he said yesterday at an &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; book signing for his new book, ♡❤Canada In The Balance♡❤.

The other seven leadership contenders have expressed their feelings on this issue saying that they have some discomfort with it.

Former Liberal PM &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Chr%C3%A9tien"&gt;Jean Chrétien&lt;/a&gt;, repeatedly said in the past that Canada was working well and most people did not care about changing the Constitution.

"They say that when you have a nation, there must be a corresponding state to this nation. That is the equation they make," said Intergovernmental Affairs Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABeno%C3%AEt%20Pelletier"&gt;Benoît Pelletier&lt;/a&gt;. "They have the impression that each state must correspond to a single nation. That is false. States can be made up of a plurality of nations. The sovereigntists make the same mistake."

"You should not raise expectations that cannot be met and we should not be engaging in an abstract debate in this country at this point in time. We should be focusing our attention on issues that really matter to people," says Rae.

Ignatieff will outline his ideas for Quebec being a nation within Canada at the convention two days before the new leader will be picked in Montreal, December 3.

Former deputy governor &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Etiaba"&gt;Virginia Etiaba&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as the Governor of &lt;a href="w%3AAnambra%20State"&gt;Anambra&lt;/a&gt;, a state in south-central &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, making her the first female governor in the country's history. Her instatement comes as the previous governor, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Obi"&gt;Peter Obi&lt;/a&gt;, was impeached by the state legislature for alleged gross misconduct.

Etiaba initially refused the position, saying that the impeached man was still the governor and her boss. However, she later accepted the position due to what she called the "peculiarity of the situation". Both the 64-year-old Etiaba and 45-year-old Obi have been in office since March 2006 after the previous governor's election was overturned by a court.

The new governor may not last in her job, however. While Obi does not contest the legality of Etiaba's swearing in, he intends to contend the impeachment in court. Additionally, the ongoing impeachment proceedings may yet cause Etiaba herself to be removed from office if she is indicted for the same misconduct as her former boss. 

Etiaba was also criticized by a number of local religious and community leaders, who put out a statement condemning both the original impeachment of Obi as well as the promotion of Etiaba. The statement reads in part:

Etiaba is expected at the impeachment hearing today.

Taiwan's president &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shui-bian"&gt;Chen Shui-bian&lt;/a&gt; has said that he had not made any money illegally and apologized for a corruption scandal involving him and the first lady, &lt;a href="w%3AWu%20Shu-chen"&gt;Wu Shu-chen&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking in an hour-long televised speech on Sunday night, he added that he would resign from the post if his wife is convicted of the charges filed against her.

President Chen's wife and three ex-aides were indicted on embezzlement, forgery and perjury charges on Friday. They were accused of skimming 14.8 million New Taiwan dollars (US$450,000) in corruption scandal in June, 2002.

President added that he and his wife are innocent and they did not take any money in the scam. He refused to resign from the post.

Taiwan's main opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3AKuomintang"&gt;Kuomintang&lt;/a&gt; has launched a third bid to remove Chen from the post of president. Party spokesman Tsai Chin-lung said that the party would formally propose the recall motion as they had sufficient evidence to charge Chen with graft.

A &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; teenager was killed and seven others, including six children, injured in an &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aairstrike"&gt;airstrike&lt;/a&gt; near a school in the town of &lt;a href="w%3ABeit%20Lahiya"&gt;Beit Lahiya&lt;/a&gt;, according to Dr. Muawiya Hassanin, a local emergency services official. 

Israeli military officials said that the strike targeted militants who were retrieving a device used to fire missiles. 
Israel's incursions into northern &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;, which are aimed at curbing rocket attacks by Palestinian militants, have killed over 50 people over the last six days.

Friday saw 17 killings, including the gunning down of two women outside a mosque in &lt;a href="w%3ABeit%20Hanoun"&gt;Beit Hanoun&lt;/a&gt;. At least seven people, including a 12-year-old girl were killed by Israeli action on Saturday, and three others yesterday. 

The Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; denied that his country was planning to re-occupy Gaza, and said that the offensive is aimed at stopping rockets from being fired into Israel by Hamas militants.

&lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; has termed the incidents "massacres" and has called for the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the issue.

Israeli troops have regularly made incursions into Gaza following the capture of &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt; in June this year.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAir%20America%20Radio"&gt;Air America Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; filed for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on October 13th, with close to $20 million in liabilities.
A recent memo from ABC has suggested that Air America's financial problems are partially the result of the loss of revenue from 90 corporate advertisers who requested their ads not be run on stations who carry Air America.

It is common for U.S. advertisers to avoid the time slots of controversial shows, such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARush%20Limbaugh"&gt;Rush Limbaugh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . However, the practice of blacking out the entire affiliated station is relatively unusual, raising the question of whether the move was politically motivated to favor right wing syndicated news programming over the liberal leanings of Air America reports.

In a news report published by ♡❤The Huffington Post♡❤, author Josh Silver claims that the difference is not political ♡❤per se♡❤, as several of the companies that withdrew advertising support were companies that made major contributions to the Democratic parties. Instead, he suggests the difference is that Air America journalism occasionally focuses on corporate malfeasance.

Other political programming, such as Rush Limbaugh or the Daily Show, rarely cover corporate behavior.

The bankruptcy filing by Air America underscores the dilemma faced by news media outlets that depend on advertising revenues from business and government to survive. The exact reasons for the blackballing of Air America are unclear, but if unflattering editorial programming can be held hostage to protect the interests of a news organization's sponsors, chances for a vibrant press are reduced.

Air America Radio was known best for its flagship program, &lt;a href="Al%20Franken"&gt;Al Franken show&lt;/a&gt;. Franken himself is owed $360,750 by Air America.

The PM and Quebec premier &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Charest"&gt;Jean Charest&lt;/a&gt; have announced a $1 billion highway development in Montreal. This project would be one of Canada's largest ever public private partnerships. It will be a 35 kilometer (21.8 mile) four-lane toll road &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20Autoroute%2030"&gt;Highway 30&lt;/a&gt; project, in &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;.

"It opens up a new horizon in Quebec's economic development," &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; said in a speech in &lt;a href="w%3ALery%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Lery, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. "As prime minister of Canada I am very proud and welcome this latest example of the fruitful collaboration between our government and that of Quebec."

"Since we formed the government of Canada, I have wanted to practice an open federalism, inspired by the spirit which gave birth to the Canadian confederation," said Harper. "That includes respecting provincial jurisdictions and the sharing of responsibilities."

"You know that open federalism is not a constitutional theory or an electoral slogan," the prime minister added. "It's a new approach that allows partners in the Canadian federation to work better together in the realization of projects."

Completing the highway will allow through traffic to bypass Montreal, reducing traffic congestion and air pollution in the area.

"The announcement today speaks to the willingness of both governments to work together to better serve the interests of the population," said Charest, who is expected to head into an election next year. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Canada"&gt;Bank of Canada&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20A.%20Dodge"&gt;David Dodge&lt;/a&gt; and other public officials have endorsed agreements between governments and private companies to invest in roads and hospitals.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Railways"&gt;Indian Railways (IR)&lt;/a&gt; has tied up with the Canadian transport solutions major &lt;a href="w%3ABombardier%20Transportation"&gt;Bombardier Transportation&lt;/a&gt; to produce electronic freight locomotives in the country for the proposed &lt;a href="w%3ARupee"&gt;Rupee (Rs)&lt;/a&gt; 22,000-&lt;a href="w%3ACrore"&gt;crore (one crore is 10 million)&lt;/a&gt; dedicated freight corridors on the eastern and western routes. 

Bombardier produces regional aircraft and business jets to rail transportation equipment. 

Bombardier Transportation officials have met Railways' officials for exploring the option of setting up a greenfield electronic freight locomotive manufacturing facility and an assembling unit in India. 

Analysts feels that IR will need at least 500-600 electronic freight locomotives, besides the same number of diesel locomotives for dedicated freight corridors in the first phase. "Conservative estimates for a normal locomotive are between Rs 13 crore and Rs 15 crore. The investment required for manufacturing electronic freight locomotives is around Rs 10,000 crore," the analysts said. 

It is also been learned that IR would also pick up a stake in this project. 

Bombardier President, Transportation, Andre Navarri confirmed talks with IR, "We are keen to take part in the dedicated freight corridor project, but the nature of the agreement with the Indian government is yet to be finalized."

IR will come up with a detailed plan and tenders for the proposed corridor by mid-November.

&lt;a href="w%3AGatorland"&gt;Gatorland&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="Orlando"&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; tourist attraction known for its gator wrestling shows and its conservation programs for alligators, crocodiles, and other reptiles and birds, was heavily damaged by fire on Monday morning, November 6, 2006.

The four-alarm fire was reported at 5:55am EST. The entrance building, which contains the administration offices and the gift shop, was destroyed. The only thing left standing of it was its iconic gator head front gate, whose upper jaw was almost completely charred.

At least four animals &amp;mdash; two gators and two snakes, which were being kept near the gift shop &amp;mdash; were feared dead. No humans were hurt. The other gators in the public display took refuge in the central pools, and were okay. The birds were in the aviary in the back, and were in no danger.

None of the attraction venues beyond the gift shop, however, were damaged. Gatorland hopes to reopen for tourists in a week, using a temporary entrance.

Orange County Fire Rescue is investigating the cause of the fire.

The Indian External Affairs Minister &lt;a href="w%3APranab%20Mukherjee"&gt;Pranab Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; has talked with the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Nepal K P Sharma Oli to discuss the status of ongoing peace talks with the Maoist rebels.

Oli met Indian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; and Pranab Mukherjee during his visit in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;. Oli discussed the situation of the peace negotiations between the Nepal government and Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). He provided them an overview about the efforts being made by government to persuade the Maoists to quit the arms.

During an-hour long talk between Mukherjee and Oli, they reviewed the implementation of the economic package announced after Koirala's visit to India in June. They also discussed about the key infrastructure projects in Nepal, like, export of power from India to Nepal and construction of transmission lines.

The talk was important as Maoist and Nepal government are trying to resolve the issue. Maoist chief Prachanda met Nepal Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGirija%20Prasad%20Koirala"&gt;G P Koirala&lt;/a&gt; in the presence of United Nations Secretary General's special representative &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Martin"&gt;Ian Martin&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. During the meeting they tried to sort out most of the issues regarding crucial arm management issue and agreed to hold fresh talk on Monday.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Nepal%20%28Maoist%29"&gt;Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)&lt;/a&gt; chairman &lt;a href="w%3APrachanda"&gt;Prachanda&lt;/a&gt; and Nepal Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGirija%20Prasad%20Koirala"&gt;Girija Prasad Koirala&lt;/a&gt; resumed the fifth round of peace talks today evening, following a meeting in the presence of UN Secretary General's representative &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Martin"&gt;Ian Martin&lt;/a&gt; held on Sunday. The aim of the peace talk was to settle the issue of arms management.

The meeting was held at Baluwatar in Nepal to finalise the political package prepared by the ruling seven-party alliance (SPA) and CPN (Maoist). They tried to narrow down the differences to reach the final conclusion on all the issues.

Prachanda held a meeting with Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) General Secretary, &lt;a href="w%3AMadhav%20Kumar%20Nepal"&gt;Madhav Kumar Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, and leader of the United Leftist Front, Prabhu Narayan Chaudhari, to discuss the political package in the morning before the talks.

The submit meeting was adjourned after six and half hours long talk. It is likely to resume in Tuesday morning.

Prachanda said that he will make his first public address in twenty five year in a mass meeting in &lt;a href="w%3AKathmandu"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt; this Friday.

The &lt;a href="w%3Ade%3A"&gt;German version&lt;/a&gt; of the encyclopedia Wikipedia, has been used in an attempt to spread a "malicious code" which would unleash a virus on to personal computers worldwide. 

The page titled: &lt;a href="w%3Ade%3AW32.Blaster"&gt;"W32.Blaster" (link in German)&lt;/a&gt; was edited in a way where a link was placed in the article directing users to a site where an alleged fix for the Lovesan/MS Blaster worm, but the fix turned out to be false and the file was considered "malicious." Computers that were target would receive e-mails from what appeared to be the ♡❤Wikipedia.org♡❤ website telling them to download the fix and including a link to it.

"The good news is that the authorities at Wikipedia quickly identified and edited the article on their site," said senior technology consultant at &lt;a href="w%3ASophos"&gt;Sophos&lt;/a&gt; anti-virus, Graham Cluley.

Although the edit has since been reverted or removed, until recently the edit remained in an archived version of the page; eventually, the archived version was also removed.

"A version of the page remained in the archive, allowing the hackers to send out spam and continue to direct visitors to the malicious code," added Cluley.

It is not known how many computers have been affected by the worm, if any at all. It is also not known when the edit was made and how long it was active on the site before it was deleted. However it appears that it was deleted on October 31, as the page was partially deleted on that day twice, according to &lt;a href="http%3A//de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DSpezial%253ALog%26amp%3Btype%3Ddelete%26amp%3Buser%3D%26amp%3Bpage%3DW32.Blaster"&gt;log files&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http%3A//64.233.179.104/translate_c%3Fhl%3Den%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF-8%26amp%3Boe%3DUTF-8%26amp%3Blangpair%3Dde%257Cen%26amp%3Bu%3Dhttp%3A//de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%253Ftitle%253DSpezial%25253ALog%2526type%253Ddelete%2526user%253D%2526page%253DW32.Blaster%26amp%3Bprev%3D/language_tools"&gt;english translation&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of google translate).

Two polls in the last 24 hours have shown the gap closing in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20general%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;US Mid term elections&lt;/a&gt;. A month ago &lt;a href="w%3AGallup%20poll"&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt; had the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; 23% ahead in a generic ballot, and now it is 7% amongst registered voters and 4% amongst likely voters.

Up to 100 million Americans go to the polls tomorrow to decide control of &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; in the last two years of &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush's&lt;/a&gt; presidency. 
With both parties focused now on turning out voters. Bush campaigned in marginal &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; districts in conservative states while the top congressional Democrat campaigned in the left-leaning &lt;a href="w%3ANortheastern%20United%20States"&gt;Northeast&lt;/a&gt;. 
"Here's the way I see it," Bush told a crowd in &lt;a href="w%3ANebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;. "If the Democrats are so good about being the party of the opposition, let's just keep them in the opposition." 
Republicans and Democrats have sent out thousands of volunteers in the closest states to work phone banks and canvass neighbourhoods. Both parties also have assembled legal teams for possible challenges. 
Republicans repeated their assertion that Democrats would raise taxes and prematurely pull out of Iraq if they controlled Congress. 
&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; has dominated the campaign, and Republicans and Democrats sparred again after &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein's&lt;/a&gt; conviction and death sentence for &lt;a href="w%3Acrimes%20against%20humanity"&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt;. 
"To pull out, to withdraw from this war is losing. The Democrats appear to be content with losing," said Senator &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20Dole"&gt;Elizabeth Dole&lt;/a&gt;, who leads the Senate Republican campaign.

Two hangars at the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; in which space shuttles are processed were evacuated when a leak of hydrazine was detected coming from &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20shuttle%20Atlantis"&gt;Atlantis's&lt;/a&gt; Orbital Maneuvering System. The leak was first discovered in Bay No 1, where Atlantis is being post-flight serviced. Nearly 150 people were evacuated from Bay No. 1 hangar and Bay No 2. Both the space shuttle Atlantis and &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20shuttle%20Endeavour"&gt;Endeavour&lt;/a&gt; were inside the hangar when the leak was detected.

&lt;a href="w%3AHydrazine"&gt;Hydrazine&lt;/a&gt; is a toxic fuel which combines with &lt;a href="w%3Anitrogen%20tetroxide"&gt;nitrogen tetroxide&lt;/a&gt; to provide power for the shuttle's two maneuvering engines while it is in space. 

A concentration of 60 parts per million was detected near Atlantis's engines, which is not a dangerous level.

"That's not what we consider a dangerous level. But with any reading above zero, we would take precautionary measures and evacuate the facility," said Jessica Rye, a spokeswoman for Kennedy Space Center.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; said that no workers were exposed to fumes or injured.

"We wanted to make sure to take the employees who were around that area, make sure they were OK and there was no exposure to the hydrazine. Then what they'll do is make sure the bay is ready for people to go back, and I would anticipate if people aren't already back they will be shortly," added Rye.

Allegations of paedophilia made against Indian &lt;a href="w%3Aguru"&gt;guru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASathya%20Sai%20Baba"&gt;Sathya Sai Baba&lt;/a&gt; are back in the limelight again, after the UK's Sai Youth movement was recognised as an accredited partner of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh%27s%20Award"&gt;The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Baba's followers deny the allegations, and the Sai Youth UK's National Co-ordinator called them "totally unfounded". Sai Baba attracts followers from many countries around the world who revere him as a "living god".

Around 200 youth are due to fly to India on November 13th after receiving a "divine commandment" to carry out a month-long "humanitarian pilgrimage" that will coincide with the birthday celebrations of Sai Baba, who will be 81 on November 23rd. 

Pressure has been mounting on the &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; award scheme charity to break its association with the Baba's organisation. 

<h2>Background</h2>

Claims of &lt;a href="w%3Asexual%20abuse"&gt;sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt; by Sai Baba have been circulating for several decades, stating that such abuse takes place during private interviews at his base in &lt;a href="w%3APuttaparthi"&gt;Puttaparthi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAndhra%20Pradesh"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;.

Large numbers of youth have travelled to &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; to visit the holy man and hear his teachings. Followers say that their experiences were "spiritually enriching". Some former devotees who were interviewed in a &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; programme, ♡❤The Secret Swami♡❤, claimed that the religious guru massaged their testicles with oil and coerced them into &lt;a href="w%3Aoral%20sex"&gt;oral sex&lt;/a&gt;. During the last youth group pilgrimage in &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;, group interviews were granted to several young people although no abuse was reported.

The allegations are denied by the Baba's followers and Sai Baba has never been charged with any offenses. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;US State Department&lt;/a&gt;, however, issued a &lt;a href="w%3Atravel%20advisory"&gt;travel advisory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A2001"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; that warned of "inappropriate sexual behaviour by a prominent local religious leader", which refers to the Baba, as officials confirm.

<h2>Duke of Edinburgh Awards</h2>

In July the UK Sai Organisation was awarded a certificate for their "invaluable contribution" to the Awards scheme at a garden party in &lt;a href="w%3ABuckingham%20Palace"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt;. An official Sai Baba website hosted a news story about this event that was later removed after a personal intervention by &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Westgarth"&gt;Peter Westgarth&lt;/a&gt;, who stated that it contained misrepresentations of the events. 

In the posting, Shitu Chudasama (National Co-ordinator for Sai Youth UK and a devotee) had spoken of giving a speech to "various dignitaries, diplomats, ministers [and] famous celebrities" at Buckingham Palace, and related that every listener was "hanging on to his every word". Chudasama had also claimed to have had a private audience with &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;HRH Prince Philip&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20James%27s%20Palace"&gt;St. James's Palace&lt;/a&gt; sometime last year, where he attributed the inspiration and motivation of the Sai Youth to their leader.

<h2>Reactions</h2>

The humanitarian work carried out by the youth will consist chiefly of providing medical aid, and will earn them a Duke of Edinburgh award that is bestowed for projects that enhance personal development and welfare work. 

In a response to &lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20News%20%26amp%3B%20Analysis"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;, an unnamed public relations officer representing Sathya Sai Baba confirmed that the youth would be arriving at the &lt;a href="w%3Aashram"&gt;ashram&lt;/a&gt; in a fortnight. Speaking about the sex abuse allegations, he said: "We do not care what the [US State Dept.] advisory says. People and organisations can write whatever they want to believe. We have no more to say on this issue."

Shitu Chudasama also stated that the pilgrimage was merely a humanitarian mission for the benefit of the improverished people in the local area, and that the sexual abuse allegations levelled against the Baba were "totally unfounded". He continued: "We hope to have an interview with Sai Baba but it's not guaranteed. If he wants to see us, he'll call us."

Tom Sackville, a former &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Office"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt; minister and chairman of &lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20Action%20Information%20Resource"&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;: ""It is appallingly naive for the award scheme to involve young people and the royal family with an organisation whose leader is accused of paedophilia. Parents who plan to send their children on this month's pilgrimage ... should be aware of the danger their children are being exposed to."

However, Peter Westgarth, chief executive of the Awards charity, said: "This is not the only religion accused of paedophilia. Young people who are participating on these trips are doing so because they choose to." He continued: "The awards accredit the good work they do for poor people in India. We make no judgment about their religion. We would no sooner intervene here than we would the Church Lads' and Girls' Brigade."

Conservative MP Hon. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Gove"&gt;Michael Gove&lt;/a&gt; stated that he would compose a letter to the charity urging them to consider stricter controls and monitoring of organisations that they associate and work with. "As a society we need a more determined effort to identify and expose those religious cults and extremists that pose a direct threat to people, so that they do not enjoy patronage that should be directed elsewhere," he said.

As of 10:00 p.m EST November 8, 2006, the Democratic Party is projected to have gained control of both the &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20general%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;2006 United States general elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . MSNBC projects that the Democrats now control 234 seats in the House of Representatives, 16 more seats than the 218 needed to control the House of Representatives as all 435 seats were up for election. In the Senate, where the balance of power is closer, one-third of all seats were up for grab. As of 10:00 p.m. EST, AP and Reuters were projecting that the Democrats had picked up all six seats they needed to retake the Senate, including the seats of incumbents &lt;a href="Rick%20Santorum"&gt;Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Penn.&lt;/a&gt;), Lincoln Chafee (&lt;a href="Rhode%20Island"&gt;R.I.&lt;/a&gt;), Jim Talent (&lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;), Mike DeWine (&lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;), John Tester (&lt;a href="Montana"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="Jim%20Webb"&gt;Jim Webb&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;VA&lt;/a&gt;). The Tester victory by less than 3,000 votes was projected at approximately 2 p.m. EST after the State of Montana announced the results of overnight recounts. Democrat Jim Webb has prevailed in that race by slightly more than 7,000 votes, though his opponent has not conceded and a recount may still occur.

<h2>Issues</h2>
Although the Bush Administration's policy on &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; was seen as a major issue by voters, exit polls indicated that corruption was of greater concern. Republicans found themselves plagued by a series of scandals in recent months, ranging from the &lt;a href="Jack%20Abramoff"&gt;Jack Abramoff&lt;/a&gt; corruption scandal to revelations about sexual improprieties involving well-known Republicans, including Congressman Mark Foley and White House confidant Ted Haggard. Many conservative evangelical Christians, the GOP's most reliable voting block, have become disappointed by the scandals and may not vote in great numbers. &lt;a href="Pat%20Buchanan"&gt;Pat Buchanan&lt;/a&gt;, whose campaigns have often appealed to that voting block, told ABC News, "There's the spending orgy, the arrogance of power . . . . The war in Iraq, failure to protect our border, hurting the working class in Ohio, for example, the list goes on and on. We're more dissatisfied with the Republican Party than we've ever been."

Voter turnout was also influenced by a number of initiatives on state ballots. Michigan's Proposal 2 would outlaw affirmative action in virtually all government programs. Oklahoma voters were slated to decide if stores could sell alcohol on election days. In South Dakota, voters were asked if the state should make marijuana use legal for therapeutic purposes. Many states included initiatives related to eminent domain powers, same-sex marriage, and taxes. In California, voters faced a whopping 36 initiatives. Voters energized by initiatives were more likely to show up at the polls, and more likely to vote for candidates from their party.

<h2>Campaigns turn nasty</h2>
Several races turned nasty in the closing days of the campaign, with candidates from both parties turning up the heat on their opponents and accusing their rivals of dirty tricks. MSNBC reported that the FBI was investigating calls made to voters in Virginia in an apparent attempt to intimidate and confuse voters. This follows a similar investigation in California, where staff in Republican Congressional candidate Tan D. Nguyen's campaign office sent letters to Latino voters telling them that "You are advised that if your residence in this country is illegal or you are an immigrant, voting in a federal election is a crime that could result in jail time." Naturalized citizens are allowed to vote in elections.

Candidates in both New York and Michigan reported that automated telephone calls had been made to voters in the dead of night, purporting to be from their campaigns. The candidates said their campaigns had nothing to do with the calls, and had been made fraudulently in an attempt to make voters angry at them. 

It was unclear whether these calls were related to other calls, financed by the National Republican Congressional Committee, that had been made to voters in several states in the previous week. Those calls had generated complaints by voters from both parties who said they were repeated several times in the same day. In at least one state, the calls were pulled when the attorney general notified the NRCC that the calls violated state law.

A different kind of "robocall" was reported in Iowa, where three Democratic candidates for the state House reported that they had been the target of anonymous attack ad calls. The calls inaccurately claimed that the candidates support free health care and college tuition for illegal aliens.

The New Jersey Attorney General's office sent deputies to polling places after Republicans reported possible fraud. The deputies reportedly found no problems.

The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund photographed armed men attempting to prevent Hispanic voters from entering polling places in Tucson. The photographs and reports of the incidents were sent to the FBI.

<h2>Polling Problems</h2>

Problems with voting devices, both electronic and manual, required some polling places to remain open later than scheduled. Electronic devices were being used for the first time in about a third of the states.

Air America Radio reported that electronic voting machines in Delaware County, Indiana and Cleveland, Ohio malfunctioned, frustrating voters and election workers. A report published on the USA Today website said election workers in some parts of Florida had resorted to using paper ballots when their electronic voting machines failed to work. National Public Radio reported that some electronic voting machines in Texas had to be turned off when they improperly gave votes to candidates not selected by voters. Problems were also reported in Maine, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.

A voting problem of a different type was reported in Kentucky. A Louisville poll worker is alleged to have physically assaulted a voter. Jefferson County clerk spokesperson Paula McCraney said that the voter wanted to press charges after being allegedly choked and pushed by the election worker. No information was available on what led to the incident.

Today, in Woolwich Crown Court, Dhiren Barot was sentenced to life imprisonment having been found guilty of conspiracy to murder. 

Evidence was presented that Barot had planned, among other things, to bomb prominent buildings in Britain including the Savoy Hotel, to discharge 'dirty' bombs and to destroy a tube train under the Thames with the intention of flooding the underground system.

Barot was the author of a terrorist's handbook published in Birmingham in which he upheld the IRA as an example to be followed, although he thought that their methods were a bit out of date. 

Barot had planned to attack buildings in the United States before 9/11, but, it was thought, he had no prior knowledge of that attack.

In delivering the sentence, the judge, Mr Justice Butterfield, told Barot that he must serve at least 40 years before he would be considered for release.
