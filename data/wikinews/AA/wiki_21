According to family, former &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; senator for &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and former Treasury Secretary, &lt;a href="w%3ALloyd%20Bentsen"&gt;Lloyd Bentsen&lt;/a&gt; has died at the age of 85 in his home located in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston, Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

Bentsen is most famous for his words during a Vice Presidential debate on October 5, 1988. Indiana Senator &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Quayle"&gt;Dan Quayle&lt;/a&gt;, the Republican candidate for Vice President, compared his congressional experience to that of former President John F. Kennedy when he sought the presidency. Bentsen replied, "Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy." The sharp rebuke, however, didn't save Bentsen, as George H.W. Bush and Quayle defeated Michael Dukakis and Bentsen in the 1988 elections.

In 1998, Bentsen suffered a small stroke, which he said was caused by a 3-month long trip to 15 different nations. 

"I enjoy challenges and being involved," Bentsen said.

Bentsen was born on February 11, 1921 and represented the state of &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; for 28 years.

<h1>Amnesty Report 2006: disadvantaged pay price of war on terror</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Amnesty%20Report%202006%3A%20disadvantaged%20pay%20price%20of%20war%20on%20terror&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The human rights watchdog &lt;a href="w%3ANGO"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; described 2005 as a year of contradictions with signs of hope for human rights being undermined through "deception and failed promises" of "arrogant" governments. Amnesty International issues annual reports on the development of human rights issues, with detailed reports on the situation in every individual country.

At the launch of its 2006 International Report, the Secretary General for Amnesty International (♡❤AI♡❤), &lt;a href="w%3AIrene%20Khan"&gt;Irene Khan&lt;/a&gt;, said that a number of governments have "paralyzed international institutions and squandered public resources in pursuit of narrow security interests, sacrificed principles in the name of the &lt;a href="US%20War%20on%20Terror"&gt;'war on terror'&lt;/a&gt; and turned a blind eye to massive human rights violations. As a result, the world has paid a heavy price, in terms of erosion of fundamental principles and in the enormous damage done to the lives and livelihoods of ordinary people".

According to the release report, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; sank into a "vortex of sectarian violence in 2005." Secretary General Khan warned: "When the powerful are too arrogant to review and reassess their strategies, the heaviest price is paid by the poor and powerless – in this case, ordinary Iraqi women, men and children." A 2004 Lancet study estimates that 100,000 excess deaths have occurred with roughly three times as many injured since the US-led invasion in 2003.

Continuing her criticism of international bodies, Ms Khan stated that "Intermittent attention and feeble action by the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="African%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; fell pathetically short of what was needed in &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur%20conflict"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;," referring to the conflict that a number of reports estimate has killed over 300,000 people.

<h2>Torture</h2>
The Amnesty International annual report claims that European governments have been "partners in crime with the United States," by defying the absolute ban on &lt;a href="w%3ATorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; through the alleged use of &lt;a href="w%3AExtraordinary%20rendition"&gt;extraordinary rendition&lt;/a&gt;.

The United Kingdom pursued "diplomatic assurances" to deport people to countries where they face torture. "Just as we must condemn terrorist attacks on civilians in the strongest possible terms, we must resist claims by governments that terror can be fought with torture. Such claims are misleading, dangerous and wrong - you cannot extinguish a fire with petrol," said Ms Khan. "Powerful governments are playing a dangerous game with human rights. The score card of prolonged conflicts and mounting human rights abuses is there for all to see ... the ‘war on terror' is failing and will continue to fail until human rights and human security are given precedence over narrow national security interests," said Ms Khan.

<h2>Amnesty Key Demands</h2>
Amnesty International list their key demands in 2006: to address the conflict and end human rights abuses in Darfur; to negotiate for an Arms Trade Treaty to govern the trade of small arms so that they cannot be used to commit human rights abuses; that the US Administration close Guantánamo Bay detention camp, and disclose the names and locations of all ‘war on terror' prisoners elsewhere; and to insist on equal standards of respect of human rights from all governments, whether in Darfur or Guantánamo, Chechnya or China.

"The political and moral authority of governments will be increasingly judged on their stand on human rights at home and abroad. More than ever the world needs those countries with power and international influence... to behave with responsibility and respect for human rights. Governments must stop playing games with human rights," declared Ms Khan.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) said in a statement that all seven Indonesian individuals infected with the deadly &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Avian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; (Bird Flu) virus, six of whom have died, contracted the disease through "close and prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness." All victims were part of the same family. A 10-year old boy is believed to have contracted the disease through his aunt and then spread the virus to his father. This is the first report of the virus spreading through a three-person chain.

According to the WHO, experts have not been able to find the birds or animals responsible for spreading the disease. 

"Although human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, the search for a possible alternative source of exposure is continuing," said the WHO in a statement on its website.

"All confirmed cases in the cluster can be directly linked to close and prolonged exposure to a patient during a phase of severe illness" and that the 32-year old father was "closely involved in caring for his son, and this contact is considered a possible source of infection," said the WHO in a statement.

However; the WHO also said that that tests performed on samples from the patients, "found no evidence of genetic reassortment with human or pig influenza viruses and no evidence of significant mutations. The viruses showed no mutations associated with resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir (Tamiflu)"

They also stressed that "to date, the investigation has found no evidence of spread within the general community and no evidence that efficient human-to-human transmission has occurred." In January, &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; taken from two &lt;a href="w%3ATurkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; teens confirmed that they died from a mutated strain of the Bird Flu virus.

A $5 toll proposal for travel on &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%2095"&gt;Interstate 95&lt;/a&gt; is gaining momentum in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, and has passed this week in the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; General Assembly. Toll booths would be set up at the border between the two states to collect revenues estimated in excess of $150 million annually, money that would be split by each state to help pay for needed maintenance of the interstate highway.

Virginia has apparently changed plans to go it alone with road improvement priorities to the I-95 section at the approach and departure corridors to Washington, D.C. The state strategy of partnering with private, for-profit road construction companies, such as Clark Construction Group and Fluor Virginia Inc., necessarily meant the placement of revenue collecting toll booths where they are least wanted and most inconvenient, on the already congested interstate travel points near the capital city of the United States. 

Two proposals to widen the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.springfieldinterchange.com/news/pa032006.html"&gt;Springfield Interchange Improvement Project&lt;/a&gt; with more &lt;a href="w%3AHigh-occupancy%20vehicle%20lane"&gt;high-occupancy-vehicle&lt;/a&gt; lanes near Washington, D.C. on the Virginia side come at a combined cost in the range of $1.5 billion for the state to complete. A public-private partnership to fund the improvements, looked at by Virginia's Department of Transportation in January 2005, has now taken on a less region specific funding solution in favor of an interstate solution.

As a practical matter, toll collection booths located at the North Carolina-Virginia state line would spare motorists in the most affected Virginia region the hassle and expense of toll payments, but it misses imposing a toll on roadway users who are most responsible for the needed improvements. That expense, as currently proposed, is passed on to motorists using I-95 for the longer haul.

North Carolina governor &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Easley"&gt;Mike Easley&lt;/a&gt; has remained opposed to a Virginia-North Carolina Interstate Toll Road Compact. The estimated $4 billion in needed repairs to I-95 in that state, where in some places the roadway is 20-years-old, places a stress on budget resources necessary for the state to perform needed maintenance.

Senator Clark Jenkins of &lt;a href="w%3ATarboro%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Tarboro County&lt;/a&gt; in North Carolina proposed legislation "to get the discussion started about the concept."

A new audiotape of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda's&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;, has surfaced on the Internet.

On the tape, bin Laden claims that it was him alone who assigned the hijackers to perform the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and that Zacarias Moussaoui had nothing to do with the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11 attacks&lt;/a&gt;.

"The truth is that he has no connection whatsoever with the events of Sept 11th, and I am certain of what I say, because I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers -- Allah have mercy upon them -- with those raids, and I did not assign brother Zacarias to be with them on that mission," said bin Laden who was speaking about the 9/11 highjackers.

"Since Zacarias Moussaoui was still learning how to fly, he wasn't number 20 in the group, as your government has claimed. It knows this very well," added bin Laden.

Bin Laden also said that Moussaoui confessed because of "pressures exercised against him during four and a half years [in jail]."

The &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; is aware of the tape and has confirmed its authenticity.

In April, bin Laden released an audiotape to Aljazeera saying that the isolation of the Hamas-led Palestine is a "war by crusaders and Zionists against Islam" and spoke of the "situation in Iraq, Palestine and Sudan."

57-year-old Clifford Wayne Senter, of New Hampshire in the US, died when he slipped on wet ground while exiting the helicopter, and plunged down a steep bluff near Lois Peak in Mount Aspiring National Park. He had been hunting chamois at the time. 

Low cloud and fog has prevented search and rescue teams from reaching him on Monday night but a recovery team was deployed early Tuesday. The team found Mr Senter's body at the base of the bluff in the afternoon.

Police said that Mr Senter had been in New Zealand for a week on a hunting holiday, with his wife and two friends.

On Tuesday Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Mayo"&gt;Division of Mayo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;) told parliament that the government has received fresh reports of violence in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr. Downer told the Australian &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; that he has received fresh reports of violence erupting in parts of the East Timorese capital, &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other parts of the nation.

According to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), there were shootouts near Becora and Fatuahi on Tuesday involving the East Timorese military and militia.

Violence erupted in East Timor in April 2006 following the dismissal of 585 East Timorese soldiers for deserting. On April 28, 2006, five people were killed in violent clashes in Dili. An independent commission has been setup by the East Timorese government to investigate complaints by the dismissed soldiers. Mr. Downer urged the commission to "conclude its work quickly as a first step to the resolution of the current crisis".

Mr. Downer said that he had made it clear to the East Timorese government that Australia will assist in East Timor if requested. He said that the Australian military have a rapid response team, consisting of naval ships, aircraft and troops deployed in Northern Australia ready to go to East Timor if requested.

DFAT is advising Australians not to travel to East Timor due to what it calls an "extremely dangerous security situation". It advises that those who are already in East Timor consider leaving.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=The%20Australia%20Institute%20identifies%20ideal%20sites%20for%20nuclear%20power%20stations&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; Institute, an Australian research organisation that some consider to be aligned to the political left, has released its analysis of ideal locations for a nuclear power plant in Australia.

According to the institute, they consulted with a number of nuclear energy experts and determined the best possible sites for a nuclear power reactor in Australia. These sites include the popular holiday destinations of &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Stephens%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Port Stephens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWesternport%20Bay"&gt;Westernport Bay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;.

The institute identified sites based on the needs of nuclear power generators. They said the most important criteria is for the site to be on the coast so it has access to large volumes of water used by the reactor for cooling. The institute found inland locations are not suitable as "Australia’s inland water supplies are unreliable and are already over-committed."

The institute also reports that Port Stephens and Westernport Bay meet other desirable criteria, being near major electricity transmission lines and have good rail and port access for imported fuel rods.

The institute said that unused fuel rods would need to be imported, but "spent fuel will need to be stored in perpetuity". According to the institute, in Europe nuclear waste is often stored on the power plant's site.

Dr Clive Hamilton, executive director of the Australia Institute said that the government is yet to give an indication on potential nuclear power sites and there is only a small number of sites which would be suitable for a power generation reactor. “It is not clear whether the Government has yet considered where the proposed nuclear power plants will be located, but there are only a limited number of suitable sites. Other likely sites include the Central Coast and the area south of Wollongong in NSW, the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, and Port Phillip Bay and Portland in Victoria”.

Mr Hamilton said that the institute had decided to investigate possible locations as there is little point having a nuclear debate where no possible sites are identified. “The Prime Minister has said he wants a national debate about nuclear power, but there is little point in debating it in the abstract”.

Mayor of Port Stephens, Craig Baumann is not impressed by the Australia Institute's findings. He said he would be opposed to any nuclear power facility being built in Port Stephens.

"I just don't like the idea of any power station, something like Vailes Point being stuck on the shores of Port Stephens,"

"Obviously the power station should be close to transport, obviously large volumes of water and the grid that it's meant to service" Mr Baumann said.

Mr Baumann did however suggest a possible location for a power plant.
"I'd suggest that they move the ships out of Garden Island and stick it right in the middle of Sydney."

If the government decided on a location in Victoria for a nuclear power plant there would be some legal implications, requiring the federal government to overturn state law (which is difficult). Victoria enacted the Nuclear Activities (Prohibitions) Act in 1983 which states it is to "protect the health, welfare and safety of the people of Victoria and to limit deterioration of the environment in which they dwell by prohibiting the establishment of nuclear activities".

Under the act, nuclear power generation is specified as a prohibited activity.

&lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; sailor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdrian%20Flanagan"&gt;Adrian Flanagan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , seeking to become the first person to single-handedly circumnavigate the globe in a north-south direction, set sail from &lt;a href="Honolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt; on May 17 after a nine-day stop for supplies and repairs to his boat.

Flanagan had spent his stay as a guest of the Waikiki Yacht Club, which arranged for emergency repairs to his boat.

Flanagan, 45, left &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; on October 28, 2005, headed south through the &lt;a href="Atlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; and around the coast of &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;. His boat, the 40-foot vessel Barrabas, suffered structural damage during stormy weather around &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Horn"&gt;Cape Horn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the southern tip of South America, as a loose wire cut a gash into the mast of his boat. He also suffered dislocated wrists while navigating through the storm.

Flanagan had initially sought to become the first person to circumnavigate the globe solo without stopping, but the stop in Honolulu brought that goal to an end. When Flanagan reached &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, he had traveled 18,221 miles (29,318 km), becoming the first person to sail solo from Britain to Hawaii westward via Cape Horn.

Flanagan said it had been a dream since he was 15 to be the first to sail the world through the frigid &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArctic%20Ocean"&gt;Arctic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; instead of the more traditional &lt;a href="Pacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt;/Atlantic route. 

The next major landmark on Flanagan's journey is the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABering%20Strait"&gt;Bering Strait&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to Flanagan, to successfully navigate the Arctic Ocean, he would need to reach the Bering Strait by July 15. He hopes to travel along the northern coast of &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; to the United Kingdom, conditions permitting.

A huge fire that started in the cargo area has engulfed part of &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AAtat%C3%BCrk%20International%20Airport"&gt;Atatürk International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIstanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;. All flights to and from the airport have been diverted and major fire-fighting efforts are in progress. 

Hundreds of people have evacuated the area, which is about 1 kilometre away from the passenger terminal.

A witness told Turkish news channel &lt;a href="w%3ANTV"&gt;NTV&lt;/a&gt; that the blaze broke out in the cargo area of Terminal A, presumably due to an electrical spark, at around 12:30 UTC. The area in which the fire is raging is near the location of the fuel depots. Unconfirmed reports suggest that there were about 250 cargo-handlers present there but most of them seem to have escaped unharmed.

Thirty metre high plumes of smoke are rising into the air and the billows can be seen from all over Istanbul, which indicates the severity of the inferno. Several fire engines and ambulances are rushing to the scene even as aircraft overhead try to douse the fire in an attempt to prevent it from spreading to a hotel nearby. The airport, incidentally, is located very close to a military hangar.

James Yee, a Muslim chaplain formerly stationed at the Guantanamo detention camp, spoke at the University of California, Davis on May 5. The UC Davis Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas (CSHRA) hosted a forum about the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay.
Yee, who earlier said that journalists and congressmen who visit Guantanamo prison don't get a real unsanitized picture of conditions there, told about his personal experience, what prisoners and interpreters told him during his time as Guantanamo chaplain, and what happened afterward.

The Australia Institute, an Australian research organisation that some consider to be aligned to the political left, has released its analysis of ideal locations for a nuclear power plant in Australia.
According to the institute, they consulted with a number of nuclear energy experts and determined the best possible sites for a nuclear power reactor in Australia. These sites include the popular holiday destinations of Port Stephens in New South Wales and Westernport Bay in Victoria.

In &lt;a href="w%3ASiberia"&gt;Siberia&lt;/a&gt;, fishermen made what experts are calling a "very rare" discovery. A complete and nearly intact skeleton of a &lt;a href="w%3Amammoth"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt; has been found in Krasnoyarsk, Russia off the shores of a small lake. The skeleton became visible when waters from a recent flood receded.

"It happens very rarely. I've been in the area 14 years and this is the first time. The bones are usually spread around over a wide area. The find has retained a backbone, a skull with teeth and a tusk and other anatomic details," said Alexander Kerzhayev, deputy director of the museum and archeologist in Novoselovo, Russia.

Kerzhayev also said that the mammoth appeared to have lived until about 50-years old. "It was an adult mammoth, judging by the size of bones it was at least 50 years old," he added also saying the mammoth appeared to have died from being sick.

However, Kerzhayev also says that the museum does not have the resources to retrieve the remains and that "no one seems to care" about the discovery adding that small portions of the animal could be retrieved.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=California%20Supreme%20Court%20revives%20High%20School%20Exit%20Exam&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The on-again, off-again requirement that &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; high school seniors must pass the High School Exit Exam is back on again, after the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;California State Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; today granted the state's request that the court stay a lower court's decision to stop schools from requiring the test.

Lawyers for State Superintendent of Schools &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20O%27Connell"&gt;Jack O'Connell&lt;/a&gt; asked for the stay after &lt;a href="w%3AAlameda%20County"&gt;Alameda County&lt;/a&gt; Superior Court Judge Robert Freedman ruled May 12 that the test requirement was unfair and unconstitutional, and forbade the state's schools from using it as a graduation requirement. O'Connell's lawyers also asked the Supreme Court to hear their argument that the Court should endorse the test and overturn Freedman's ruling, but the Court sent the case down to the 1st District Court of Appeal for hearings.

"I am extremely pleased that the Supreme Court has reinstated the California High School Exit Exam as a condition for graduation," O'Connell said after the decision was announced. "As a result, school districts can continue their graduation exercises as planned before this litigation began."

Arturo Gonzalez, lead counsel for the students who challenged the test in court, told the James Logan Courier, "Our clients are disappointed in today's 4-3 split decision of the California Supreme Court. However, this fight is not over. We intend to seek immediate relief in the court of appeals in San Francisco. We are hopeful that oral argument can be scheduled in time to obtain an order that would allow the Class of 2006 to graduate."

O'Connell said he's instructing school districts to withhold diplomas from those who haven't passed the test. "I will communicate with districts today to ensure they are aware that the exit exam is a graduation requirement," he said. " Students who have worked hard to pass this exam will be given a diploma that signifies their mastery of essential skills in reading and math. I hope that this decision will give students in the class of 2006, their parents, and their schools certainty.

California Gov. &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; praised the court's decision. ""Today's ruling is a victory for the children of California and for our future as a state," said Schwarzenegger. "The exit exam ensures that our schools are living up to their responsibility by giving our students the skills and the knowledge they need to succeed in college and in the workplace. Postponement would have deprived us of the best tool we have to measure how well schools are doing their job."

The ruling affects about 70 students at &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20High%20School"&gt;James Logan High School&lt;/a&gt; who haven't passed either the math or language arts portions of the test, or both. As many as 47,000 are affected statewide.

"It's crazy, I want to cry," said Zuhal, a senior who hasn't yet passed the test after she heard the news. Then she started crying.

Raymond, a senior who has had trouble with the math portion of the test, said he had made plans for graduating based on Freedman's banning of the test. "I'm really disappointed," he said. "I feel really bad. They should cancel it right now. Graduation day is too near."

Both students took the test earlier this month, but won't know if they passed until August 15, said Ray, too late to receive a diploma with their classmates.

"The Supreme Court did not say that Judge Freedman was wrong. Four justices simply questioned whether allowing our clients to graduate was the appropriate remedy," said Gonzalez, "We intend to demonstrate that the relief was proper. If the constitutional rights of our children are violated, we cannot punish them further by depriving them of a diploma that they have rightfully earned by passing all required courses."

O'Connell said students who haven't passed the test would have more opportunities. "We will not give up on the students who are still struggling to pass," O'Connell said, " They will continue to be given every option to master those skills they will need in order to succeed beyond high school."

O'Connell said he looked forward to arguing the case in the appellate court. ""In sending this case to the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court has provided us an opportunity to argue the merits of this case," he said.

O'Connell, who wrote the law when he was a state legislator in 1999, said the test is an important ingredient in California's school reform efforts. "We know, and look forward to sharing with the court, that as a result of the exit exam, our students have studied harder and learned more than they would have otherwise," he said. "Schools, administrators, school board members, parents, and even policy makers here in Sacramento paid more attention to the needs of students who were falling behind their peers.

"Today’s court action marks an important step for school accountability. I will continue to fight to make sure every student who graduates in California has the skills necessary to succeed," he said.

A &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; plane caught on fire in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. It was a four-engine propeller aircraft that got into trouble while landing. One of the aircraft's tyres exploded.

Ambassador &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Evans"&gt;Stephen Evans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; escaped injury after the military transport plane, in which he was travelling, caught fire at an airstrip in southern Afghanistan. 

None were seriously hurt. All 27 people on board were safe.

After the breakdown of law and order in the world's newest nation, East Timor's Foreign Minister, Jose Ramos Horta has requested military assistance from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and Malaysia. The force would "disarm renegade troops and police rebelling against the state" and "...Australia and New Zealand will come soon" Mr Horta said to reporters.

The first troops from Australia's 1300 strong commitment to East Timor, which also includes three ships, helicopters and armoured personnel carriers, will likely arrive in East Timor by this afternoon, having been on standby in recent weeks in preparation for such a possibility. Two of the Royal Australian Navy's amphibious landing ships, HMAS Kanimbla and Manoora, are currently heading north to East Timor with troops on board, and the rest of Australia's 1300 strong task force would likely arrive in the next 48 hours. Approximately 120 Portuguese military police and 60 police and troops from New Zealand would join them. Australia may also send troops from 4 RAR (Commandos) and SASR from Holsworthy, NSW and Perth respectively.

The uprising in East Timor has resulted from the firing of nearly 600 East Timorese soldiers who went on strike, alleging ethnic discrimination and poor pay and conditions. They are led by the highest ranking officer in the renegade force, Australian-trained Major Alfredo Reinado, who East Timorese President Xanana Gusmao has vowed to hunt down, and who will undoubtedly be an important target for the Australian task force entering an ill-defined Area of Operations (AO) where East Timorese government forces have been battling the renegade troops and police.

Foreign minister Ramos-Horta told the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian_Broadcasting_Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; that he hoped foreign forces would not have to engage the renegade East Timorese troops but would have "an immediate calming effect throughout the country" and "encourage political dialogue."

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; has placed pressure on the federal government to reveal potential sites for nuclear power plants. The pressure comes after the release of a report by The Australia Institute, which identified several locations on the East Coast of Australia as "ideal" nuclear power sites.

Speaking in the Australian &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Brand"&gt;Brand&lt;/a&gt;, Labor) asked Australian treasurer and acting &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Higgins"&gt;Higgins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;) to name potential nuclear sites.

"As part of the government’s intention to consider nuclear power in Australia, will it nominate the proposed sites of its nuclear reactors and their associated high-level nuclear waste dumps?" Mr Beazley asked.

Mr Costello replied by attacking Labor's policy on limiting Australia to three uranium mines, supporting uranium exports while being opposed to an Australian nuclear energy industry. Mr Costello said "It would be a funny kind of a policy if Australia was prepared to mine uranium
and to sell it to other countries but was so opposed to the nuclear industry".

Labor member, Maria Elliot (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Richmond"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; asked Mr Costello to rule out nuclear reactors and waste dumps in the Northern Rivers region of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; (part of which falls into Mrs Elliot's electorate) and the adjoining region of South-East &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Costello gave no assurances that there were no plans to build a reactor in the region.

During an interview whilst in &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, Australian PM, John Howard took the opportunity to attack Labor's nuclear policy. He said Mr Beazley's opposition was "hypocritical". "I’m also in awe of his hypocrisy on the issue. Apparently it is alright to export uranium to other countries that will then produce nuclear power with all the problems he says are unacceptable in Australia. Well in my view if nuclear power is unsafe, unacceptable and anti the environment, you shouldn’t export uranium to any other country" he said.

State Labor leaders have voiced their opposition to nuclear energy.

Queensland Premier Peter Beattie said he would fight strongly against any plans for a nuclear reactor in his state.

NSW Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; said that NSW had laws prohibiting the building of a nuclear power plant in NSW. Under NSW law, the mining and enrichment of Uranium and construction of nuclear reactors is illegal unless unless the &lt;a href="w%3AANSTO"&gt;Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (ANSTO) operates those reactors. The only nuclear reactor in Australia, &lt;a href="w%3AHIFAR"&gt;HIFAR&lt;/a&gt; is owned by ANSTO and is situated in &lt;a href="w%3ALucas%20Heights%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Lucas Heights&lt;/a&gt;, South of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; in NSW. HIFAR's replacement &lt;a href="w%3AOPAL"&gt;OPAL&lt;/a&gt; is due for completion in 2007, and will operate alongside HIFAR for six months.

&lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bracks"&gt;Steve Bracks&lt;/a&gt; said he was strongly opposed to the construction of nuclear reactors in Victoria despite many locations in the state being identified as ideal. As with NSW, Victoria also has laws prohibiting nuclear power generation.

<h1>Howard's revival of nuclear debate &quot;surprising&quot;: Political expert</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Howard%27s%20revival%20of%20nuclear%20debate%20%26quot%3Bsurprising%26quot%3B%3A%20Political%20expert&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Dr Frank Cain, a political expert and Lecturer in Defence and &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Political and Economic History at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;University of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; has told Wikinews that many political commentators are finding &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard's&lt;/a&gt; revival of the nuclear debate "surprising".

Australia came close to building a nuclear power reactor in the &lt;a href="w%3AJervis%20Bay%20Territory"&gt;Jervis Bay Territory&lt;/a&gt; in the late 1960s but was later abandoned in 1971 after massive anti-nuclear demonstrations. The fear that Australia would produce nuclear weapons as a by-product of its nuclear energy programs killed the plans and a change in government ended the plans.

The fear that the Jervis Bay reactor could have been used to produce weapons grade &lt;a href="w%3APlutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt; was substantiated when secret 1969 cabinet documents were released in 2000 stating that "The government will acquire a facility with long term defence implications" and "Over 25 years of operation the reactor will provide six tonnes of plutonium".

&lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt;, the opposition's Shadow Minister for Environment and Heritage accused Mr Howard on Tuesday of living in the past and of not being serious about the debate.

In an interview with Wikinews, Dr Cain said that there are a number of possibilities for Mr Howard's nuclear revival. Dr Cain said one of these could be to challenge the opposition over its three mine policy. "One of his (Howard's) motives might be to challenge the ALP over its three-mine policy" said Dr Cain.

Dr Cain warned that such a move would be unpopular with younger voters, "The young people would not support his programme for the uranium mining companies to expand their mine numbers and production" he said.

Speaking on the economics of nuclear energy in Australia, Dr Cain said it was still uneconomic due to Australia's large supplies of coal and natural gas. "It still remains uneconomic for Australia to commence generating electricity from nuclear plants. Our coal supplies will last for another century and the natural gas deposits seem unlimited. These gas supplies will probably displace coal generation and thereby reduce the &lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse%20effect"&gt;greenhouse&lt;/a&gt; gas problem" he said.

Martin Sevior, an associate professor in particle physics at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Melbourne"&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Cororation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; Radio on Monday that nuclear power can be generated "almost as cheaply as coal". He said in the future nuclear power should be able to be produced for $&lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;40 per megawatt-hour, versus the current price of $30 per megawatt-hour for coal.

Prof Sevior said that when the cost of &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20dioxide%20sink"&gt;carbon sequestering&lt;/a&gt; was included in the running costs for coal fired power plants that nuclear energy was "very, very competitive".

John Price, a professor at &lt;a href="w%3AMonash%20University"&gt;Monash University&lt;/a&gt; and expert in nuclear energy (having designed some in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;) told ABC Radio that nuclear energy is competitive in many parts of the world, including &lt;a href="w%3AEurope"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Asia"&gt;Eastern Asia&lt;/a&gt;.

Prof Price said that the use of nuclear energy in Australia is "inevitable" in Australia's future and that it may well be economically competitive with new lower emission coal fired power plants of which the costs are not known.

According to Prof Price, &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; will need to generate 3 gigawatts more electricity within the next ten years, but conceded that it is likely that gas and coal fired plants will be built to meet that need.

Howard would not be proposing for the government to own its own uranium enrichment plant and would need to entice an overseas company to establish a plant in Australia according to Dr Cain. Dr Cain questioned whether a company from France, Russia, the US or China would be willing to come to Australia to "do what it has been doing quite well in its own country for decades".

Dr Cain said overseas companies would see "no financial advantage for them to do so".

Forty-five percent of American adults surveyed in a &lt;a href="w%3AZogby%20International"&gt;Zogby&lt;/a&gt; poll think that the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember_11%252C_2001_attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; should be investigated anew. Poll results indicated that 42% believe that there has been a cover up (with 10% unsure) and 45% think "Congress or an International Tribunal should re-investigate the attacks, including whether any US government officials consciously allowed or helped facilitate their success" (with 8% unsure). 

These are figures from a nationwide telephone survey of 1200 individuals conducted by Zogby International from Friday, May 12 through Tuesday, May 16, 2006. The results have a margin of sampling error of +/- 2.9.

The poll was commissioned by 911truth.org, a single issue website aimed at pinning the blame of 9/11 on the Bush administration.

The results of this Zogby poll were released last Monday (22 May), but went largely unreported by the mass media, possibly due to bias within the source.

A &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i immigrant was convicted on Wednesday of plotting to blow up a &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; subway station in a case that shed light on police investigation tactics since the &lt;a href="9/11"&gt;Sept 11&lt;/a&gt; attacks.

Shahawar Matin Siraj, faces a maximum life sentence after a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrooklyn"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; federal court jury convicted him of conspiring to place and detonate an explosive on the city's mass transit system.

Siraj, 23, was arrested on the eve of the 2004 &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; National Convention on charges he planned to attack a subway station in Herald Square, the dense &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shopping district that includes &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMacy%27s"&gt;Macy's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; flagship department store.

Siraj claimed he was entrapped by an over-zealous police informant twice his age, &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian Osama Eldawoody, 50, who met the Siraj in an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; bookstore while spying on mosques for the New York police.

Taped conversations between the two men were played by prosecutors during the trial plans were discussed to bomb the Herald Square subway station in midtown Manhattan.

Mr Eldawoody testified in 2003 and 2004 that he served as the 'eyes and ears' of the police and was paid more than &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;100,000 to report about daily mosque activities, including prayers.

Prosecutors said Siraj had the will to carry out a plot supporting his extremist views. Their case was strengthened by the testimony of a co-conspirator who pleaded guilty in the case and an undercover police officer who said Siraj openly supported &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The jury also heard testimony by a &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;i-born undercover police officer, who met Siraj while infiltrating a Muslim neighborhood as part of an investigation following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 

During one conversation, Siraj "complimented" Osama bin Laden, the officer testified. 

"He said he was a talented brother and a great planner and that he hoped bin Laden planned something big for America," said the officer, who testified under an alias because he is still involved in active investigations.

"The verdict is an important milestone in safeguarding New York against terrorist plotters whether home-grown or foreign," said New York Police Commissioner &lt;a href="Raymond%20Kelly"&gt;Raymond Kelly&lt;/a&gt;.

"About 20 [Ministers of Parliament] but 40 journalists including photographers," said filmmaker Amir Muhammed about a screening of his controversial documentary at the National Film Institute on Sunday, May 21. 

Among the ministers to comment on the film, Culture, Arts and Heritage Minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim has been widely quoted in the press.

On May 21, Malaysia's national news agency, Bernama, filed a story entitled, "Rais finds the 'Last Communist' not offensive." With reference to the May 18th screening, Bernama reports Rais said, "The plot isn't controversial and there's nothing that could be deemed as offensive from the cultural viewpoint."

Commenting on interviews with former members of the Malayan Communist Party, "they were vague, not conclusive for any quarters," he said.

The national daily &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Straits%20Times"&gt;New Straits Times&lt;/a&gt; also reported on the screening. It reports Rais said the film is "not important enough to be controversial".

The daily followed up with an article where Rais is reported as saying the film "indeed 'glorifies' former communist leader Chin Peng", filed May 24. "Amir should have interviewed the security forces, the Home Guard, the families of the home guard who were killed by the communists, and government officials of the time," said Rais.

The Bernama article incorrectly attributes the source of the ban to the Internal Security Ministry, it was widely reported that the Home Ministry was responsible.

The film has picked up controversy because it is inspired by the &lt;a href="w%3AMalayan%20Emergency"&gt;Malayan Emergency&lt;/a&gt;. 

Chin Peng himself is living in exile in North Thailand. He released an autobiography last year entitled, "Chin Peng: My side of history."

Ahead of the deployment of 1000-1300 Australian troops in the next couple of days, fighting between renegade East Timorese military forces and government security forces has continued in East Timor's capital, Dili, from which at least 21,000 people have fled. The 600 renegade military personnel were fired from East Timor's 1400 strong army after striking over poor pay and conditions, including ethnic discrimination. Based in the Aileu mountains, the rebel force is making small attacks around the southern, eastern and western sides of Dili, but reports of gunfire in the city centre are developing.

Australian-trained Major Alfredo Reinado, who leads the renegade force, has said that he aims to “guarantee justice and the creation of a professional defence force,” not topple the East Timorese government.

Lieutenant General Peter Leahy, the Vice Chief of the Australian Defence Force, is to touch down in Dili today to discuss Australian troops' deployment in Dili and their Rules of Engagement (ROE) with the East Timorese Prime Minister, Mari Alkatiri, and other government officials. However, gunfire and the burning of houses has been reported on a main road to Dili international airport, cutting it off from the city. In response, Australian Prime Minister John Howard announced the deployment of 150 soldiers from 4 RAR (Commandos) with Blackhawk helicopters and C-130 transport planes in order to take the airport and secure its perimeter to allow for flights to continue.

The multinational deployment has been met with appreciation amongst both the rebel and government forces. Foreign minister Jose Ramos-Horta has said that that the arrival of troops and police from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and possibly Malaysia (which has indicated it may send up to 500 police and troops), is still necessary for security. News of the arriving Australian-led peacekeeping force, was welcomed by Dilinese refugees Mr Ramos-Horta said; "Their mere presence in Dili, the capital city, will have a psychological calming effect." The leader of the rebel forces, Major Reinado has also welcomed the deployment, saying that he hoped the peacekeepers would be able to create a peace. MAJ Reinado has said "This is the only solution, ...There is no other way, or it will be war forever. The Government has taken too long. It is not capable of resolving this." and even told Portuguese news agency Lusa that he would personally shake the hands of the arriving multinational force. The United Nations Security Council, having appealed for an end to fighting, welcomed the deployment of military forces to East Timor.

Australia also led the successful International Force East Timor (INTERFET) and United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) forces from 1999 to 2002.

The Defence Secretary-level discussion between India and Pakistan on demilitarising the Siachen glacier ended in a stalemate, without any major breakthroughs being made. Both sides however declared they would abide by the cease-fire agreement made in 2003. 

India says that it will not pull its troops back from their current position on the world's highest battlefield till Pakistan agrees to validate its present position on the ridges that hem the glacier. Indian Liuetenant General Pattabiramayyah has said that unless the Pakistan clarifies its current position on a map, India will be susceptible to a surprise attack similar to the one that occurred in the &lt;a href="w%3AKargil%20War"&gt;Kargil&lt;/a&gt; sector in 1997. Pakistan believes that recognition of Indian positions would be a de-facto surrender of its claim over territory from the last marked point on the Line of Control - Point NJ 9842 - to the Karakoram Pass.

Both countries have maintained troop positions on the ridges for over 20 years. The inhospitable Siachen glacier, according to a Ladakhi proverb, is a place where "one is only visited by either his closest friends or deepest enemies".

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The U.S. &lt;a href="w%3A9th%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals"&gt;9th Circuit Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday ruled that &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;'s ban on aerial advertising is constitutional and rejected the arguments of a pro-life/anti-abortion group that contended that the ban restricts free speech.

In a unanimous ruling, the court ruled that the city's ban on aerial advertising is not pre-empted by federal law and violates neither the free speech provisions of the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;First Amendment&lt;/a&gt; nor the equal protection clause of the &lt;a href="w%3AFourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Fourteenth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;. Writing for the court, Judge Margaret McKeown wrote that "Honolulu’s airspace is a nonpublic forum, and the Ordinance is reasonable, viewpoint neutral, and rationally related to legitimate governmental interests." ("Nonpublic forum" is defined as a place that is not traditionally or explicitly opened to free expression.)

The &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Bioethical%20Reform"&gt;Center for Bioethical Reform&lt;/a&gt; (CBR) challenged Honolulu's ban, claiming that the ban infringes on their right to public advocacy. The group planned to fly a plane towing a 100-foot banner showing graphic images of aborted fetuses, and contended that authorization they sought and received from the Federal Aviation Administration authorized the group to fly in all fifty states and Puerto Rico.

The CBR has driven vans with such images around Honolulu in the past few years.

Judge David Ezra, U.S. District Judge for Hawaii, ruled in November 2004 that the ordinance was constitutional. The appeal was argued before the 9th Circuit in Honolulu in November 2005.

Announcing their intent to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Gregg Cunningham, executive director of the CBR, said, "We never expected to get justice in the U.S. District Courts or in Honolulu. Our goal has always been to get to the U.S. Supreme Court. It's the only place we feel we'll get a fair hearing.

"If the environmental groups and political leftists who are trying to suppress the truth about abortion think we're going to go away because we lost two cases that we fully expected to lose, they're in for a rude awakening," Cunningham said.

Hawaii has had a statewide prohibition on billboards and similar forms of advertising since 1927, and is unique among U.S. states in this regard. In addition, since 1957, Honolulu has had a comprehensive law regulating the size and content of signs. Honolulu's ban on all aerial advertising was enacted in 1978. 

Honolulu Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMufi%20Hannemann"&gt;Mufi Hannemann&lt;/a&gt; praised the decision, saying, "This obviously has strong implications for our visitor industry to know that when people come here they're going to see things here that really make for an island paradise type of vacation. This is great news for us."

Mary Steiner, head of the Outdoor Circle, an environmental group that supports the ban, said, "We have never doubted for a moment the importance of the scenic environment that it is just as important as any of the rest of the environmental issues that are out there. We're not going to stand by and let it be destroyed in any way, shape or form."

A 17-year-old student faces expulsion by the &lt;a href="w%3APlainfield%20School%20District"&gt;Plainfield School District&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APlainfield%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Plainfield, Illinois&lt;/a&gt; as a result of blog posts he made on xanga.com which were critical of the school staff, alleging bullying and intimidation. The student has already been suspended for 10 days for the "inappropriate comments" and "threats" the school felt he had expressed on his blog. The posts were not made on school time or with school equipment.

On May 1, the student posted the following message that apparently initiated the suspension:

On May 2, the student continued his passionate rant, giving some background to the controversy:

Attorney Carl Buck, who feels the school authorities have overstepped their boundaries, says, "The district is going to take away the student's education for exercising his freedom of speech... I feel like they are trying to control his freedom of speech. ... He is saying, 'You can't bully people and we have a right to object and you can't throw people out of school for voicing their opinions.'"

Other students at the school posted messages of support in their own Xanga blogs. A blogger named &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xanga.com/SesshomaruMegumi"&gt;Meghan&lt;/a&gt; wrote, "As Americans, we have the right to speak our mind." Another student, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.xanga.com/accursed_land_of_enchantment"&gt;Heather&lt;/a&gt;, who found out about the possible expulsion through the local news, wrote that "first of all, Xanga is outside of school ... second of all ... there was no threat towards anyone on his posts."

In a related case in March 2006, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that an Alaska high school acted improperly by suspending a student for carrying a banner reading "Bong Hits 4 Jesus" across the street from the school.

From Washington D.C. to New York City, trains powered by overhead electric lines stalled for more than two hours due to what Amtrak called a "major power outage." While working to restore power, Amtrak attempted to provide alternative transportation in the form of diesel locomotives and buses. Power was restored at 10:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_Daylight_Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;. Delays continued for much of the day. 

Besides long-distance rail services such as Acela, local commuter trains were affected. Seven SEPTA lines in the Philadelphia area were temporarily shut down, and five more ran shortened routes. Also affected was Maryland's &lt;a href="w%3AMARC"&gt;MARC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey%20Transit"&gt;New Jersey Transit&lt;/a&gt;.

No specific cause has been reported, but Amtrak's site indicates that they are investigating.

A jury in Houston found Former &lt;a href="w%3AEnron"&gt;Enron Corp.&lt;/a&gt; CEOs &lt;a href="w%3AKenneth%20Lay"&gt;Kenneth L. Lay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJeffrey%20Skilling"&gt;Jeffrey K. Skilling&lt;/a&gt; guilty of 6 kinds of white-collar crime on May 25. Lay was convicted of all ten counts against him, while Skilling was convicted of only nineteen of the charged twenty-eight counts. The variety of charges on which both men were convicted was astonishing; conspiracy, wire fraud, false statements to banks and auditors, and others. Both men now face many years in prison.

Outside the courtroom, Skilling continued to proclaim his innocence. "Obviously, I'm disappointed, but that's the way the system works," Skilling said after the verdict. He is expected to appeal. Lay did not immediately speak to reporters outside the courtroom.

The verdict was reached on the sixth day of deliberations after a four-month-long trial and brings to a close the first of the wave of accounting scandals earlier in the decade. The verdict also represents another major victory for the government, which has successfully prosecuted a number of high-profile executives involved in accounting scandals, as well as obtained sixteen guilty pleas from former Enron executives.

Sentencing has been set for September 11, 2006. U.S. District Judge Sim Lake ordered Lay to post a $5 million bond and surrender his passport before leaving the courtroom.

East Timor

Ahead of the deployment of 1000-1300 Australian troops in the next couple of days, fighting between renegade East Timorese military forces and government security forces has continued in East Timor's capital, Dili, from which at least 21,000 people have fled. The 600 renegade military personnel were fired from East Timor's 1400 strong army after striking over poor pay and conditions, including ethnic discrimination. Based in the Aileu mountains, the rebel force is making small attacks around the southern, eastern and western sides of Dili, but reports of gunfire in the city centre are developing.

Valence Media, the parent company behind popular &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; index site &lt;a href="w%3ATorrentSpy"&gt;TorrentSpy&lt;/a&gt;, has filed a federal lawsuit against the &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (MPAA), alleging that the organization hired a hacker to break into TorrentSpy's servers and steal private information.

The lawsuit, which Valence Media and various employees filed in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Central%20District%20of%20California"&gt;United States District Court for the Central District of California&lt;/a&gt;, charges the MPAA with conspiracy, unlawful business practices, misappropriation of trade secrets and violations of the California Invasion of Privacy Act and the &lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Communications%20Privacy%20Act"&gt;Electronic Communications Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1985.

According to the lawsuit, MPAA employee Dean Garfield paid an unnamed hacker US$15,000 to steal email correspondence and other sensitive information, allegedly telling him that they "don't care how you get it".

In June of 2005, TorrentSpy alleges, the hacker then broke into the servers, obtaining private emails, invoices, billing information and an Excel spreadsheet detailing TorrentSpy's income and expenses.

In an interview with ♡❤CNET♡❤, Kori Bernards, the vice-president of the MPAA, called the allegations "false" and implied that TorrentSpy might be trying to deflect attention from the MPAA's own lawsuits against the site.

After approximately 150 &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; troops from 4 Royal Australian Regiment (Commandos) secured Comoro airport in &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, the total number of Australian troops in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; has risen to 600, with a further 1200 in transit or directly supporting Operation Astute. &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; have also begun their deployments. Malaysia has now sent 25 military officers ahead of its 500 strong commitment of military and police personnel; New Zealand has committed two C-130s, and an infantry company is on standby pending negotiations over rules of engagement; Portugal's 120-strong commitment has commenced preparations, but is not expected to arrive for a matter of weeks. The Australian contingent involved in Operation Astute has been placed under the command of Brigadier Michael Slater, who arrived in Dili this morning.

Currently, the Australian Department of Defence states Operation Astute's tasks are:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. to facilitate the evacuation of Australian and other foreign nationals as is appropriate and necessary;
BULLET::::2. to stabilise the situation and facilitate the concentration of the various conflicting groups into safe and secure locations;
BULLET::::3. to audit and account for the location of weapons that belong to each group; and
BULLET::::4. to create a secure environment for the conduct of a successful dialogue to resolve the current crisis.

</ol>
Australian forces are already actively operating in Dili; Infantry patrols are operating in the area, supported by the four Blackhawks from the 5th Aviation Regiment that have arrived so far. Blackhawks have also been operating missions above the hills around Dili to seek out rebel positions and communicate a strong presence to the rebel soldiers. Two Armoured Personnel Carriers and an infantry platoon have set up position in and around the UN Headquarters and Dili police station, which came under attack earlier today, and was the location of considerable violence yesterday when East Timorese army soldiers killed 12 East Timorese police and wounded numerous others, including 2 UN personnel. "At the moment things are relatively stable, the troops are arriving and we are establishing good control throughout the Dili area" BRIG Slater said of the situation.

Yesterday 80 Australian nationals were evacuated by &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Australian%20Air%20Force"&gt;RAAF&lt;/a&gt; C-130, a number that is rising as flights in and out of East Timor have been unhampered since the securing of Comoro airport. Approximately 800 Australian nationals were in East Timor at the beginning of conflict.

Events involving East Timor's government are complicating the situation. Reports state that Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri is reluctant to allow foreign troops to independently operate in the country and arguing with President Xanana Gusmao over who should control the small nation's still loyal military of 800 troops. After President Gusmao declared he had taken over command of the military and ordered all East Timorese military personnel to barracks, Alkatiri stated that he believed the President does not have a constitutional right to take control of the military, as that depends on a 'situation of emergency' being declared, which is itself dependent on the parliament.

According to Mark Thompson, a military budgeting specialist from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Operation Astute would cost a similar amount to Australia's earlier peacekeeping operation in East Timor - approximately $200 million.

<h1>Appeals Court asked for quick decision in California High School Exit Exam case</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Appeals%20Court%20asked%20for%20quick%20decision%20in%20California%20High%20School%20Exit%20Exam%20case&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Lawyers for students who sued to stop the use of the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20High%20School%20Exit%20Exam"&gt;California High School Exit Exam&lt;/a&gt; today filed a request for an expedited hearing of their case in appellate court, hoping to have the test set aside in time for graduation.

"It would be tragic if students were deprived of the once in a lifetime opportunity to graduate with their classmates due to scheduling issues in this matter," according to the text of the appeal filed in Division Four of the First Appellate District.

Today's filing fulfills a promise made by lead attorney Arturo Gonzalez yesterday after the State Supreme Court issued a stay of an &lt;a href="w%3AAlameda%20County"&gt;Alameda County&lt;/a&gt; Superior Court judge's order that the test not be used to determine graduation. ""Our clients are disappointed in today's 4-3 split decision of the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;California Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;. However, this fight is not over," Gonzalez said, " We intend to seek immediate relief in the court of appeals in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;. We are hopeful that oral argument can be scheduled in time to obtain an order that would allow the Class of 2006 to graduate." 

On May 12, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Robert Freedman decided that the test was unfair and unconstitutional and issued an injunction against the use of the test. The following week, attorneys for State Superintendent of Schools &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20O%27Connell"&gt;Jack O'Connell&lt;/a&gt;, author and avid supporter of the law requiring the test, appealed Freedman's decision directly to the State Supreme Court, asking the court to stay the effect of the injunction immediately and to over rule it. Yesterday, the court issued the stay, but send the state's appeal down to the appellate court. 

"Yesterday, the Supreme Court noted that it was "not persuaded" that the injunction was the appropriate remedy," according to the papers filed in court today. "It stayed the injunction and remanded the case to this Court with instructions to "establish a schedule for expedited briefing and argument."

"Plaintiffs respectfully submit that, if the schedule established by this Court does not allow for a decision on the remedy issued by the trial court before the bulk of high school graduations have taken place, then that schedule cannot be considered to be expedited," according to the filing, "There is only one issue that needs to be decided by this Court prior to the pending high school graduations — whether, assuming Plaintiffs prevail on their constitutional claims, the injunction granted by the trial court was an appropriate remedy."

In the filing, lawyers for Liliana Valenzuela, et al., who sued in February to have the test set aside so she and the other students involved in the case could graduate, remind the appellate court that the State Supreme Court needed only a few days to reach its decision.

"With the majority of graduations occurring in early June, Plaintiffs respectfully submit that it is a reasonable interpretation of the Supreme Court's Order to set a hearing for this matter next week," lawyers wrote in the filing.
Cynthia O'Brien, who oversees testing at &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20High%20School"&gt;James Logan High School&lt;/a&gt; in Union City, expressed some exasperation over the on-again, off-again situation regarding the test. "What is happening at this time with the emotional lives of students who are in limbo is not reasonable or in their best interest" she said. "Although the exam's intention is to create a better education environment for students (my words), it is now more about politics than the students."

However, she's not opposed to the test itself. "I believe that the intent of minimum proficiencies is in the right direction. We do a disservice to students who are not prepared to compete in their adult world," she told the &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20Courier"&gt;James Logan Courier&lt;/a&gt;, " I do believe that the State needs to study real alternate paths that could be pursued, such as using proficiency on STAR, a senior project demonstrating both math and English proficiency or some other pathway."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia"&gt;United States District Court for the District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt; has ordered four &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Department%20of%20Justice"&gt;U.S. Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; (DOJ) officials to give testimony after a &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt; (FOIA) lawsuit was filed by &lt;a href="w%3ACitizens%20for%20Responsibility%20and%20Ethics%20in%20Washington"&gt;Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington&lt;/a&gt; (CREW).

Judge &lt;a href="w%3AEmmet%20Sullivan"&gt;Emmet Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; granted a motion for discovery by CREW to serve &lt;a href="w%3Adeposition"&gt;depositions&lt;/a&gt; to James Kovaka and Steve Brady, both attorneys with the DOJ responsible for processing FOIA requests in the case. Also ordered to provide testimony were Daniel Metcalfe, head of the DOJ'S Office of Information and Privacy, and &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20McCallum"&gt;Robert McCallum&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Attorney General whose nomination as U.S. ambassador to Australia is currently pending in the Senate.

CREW sued after the DOJ failed to respond to the group request for information for close to a year. The request relates to the DOJ's lowering of the government penalty request from $130 billion to $10 billion in the landmark case ♡❤United States of America v. Philip Morris Incorporated, et al.♡❤, which CREW believes to be politically motivated.

CREW specifically requested the DOJ to disclose contacts between McCallum and his former law firm, which the group says represented the tobacco companies. McCallum is also before a different court with 5 other justice department officials in a trial where they are accused of ethics violations relating to a case involving North American Indians.

Rail services between &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; are expected to be disrupted until early next week following a fatal crash between a truck and freight train in &lt;a href="w%3ALismore%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Lismore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; 170 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometres"&gt;Km&lt;/a&gt; (105 &lt;a href="w%3AMiles"&gt;miles&lt;/a&gt;) South-West of &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.

The B-Double truck hit the side of a 1,375 metre long freight train at a level crossing at 7:13 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday in heavy fog, derailing two locomotives and 44 goods wagons. Victorian police said that the truck had been wedged beneath the wreckage of the train.

The driver of the truck, thought to be a 34-year-old man from &lt;a href="w%3AWedderburn%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Wedderburn&lt;/a&gt; in Victoria's North-West died in the crash. The train driver and an observer escaped uninjured. Police said it could take a number of days to retrieve the truck driver's body. "It could possibly take days to retrieve the body" a Victorian police spokesperson said.

&lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Southern%20Railways%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Great Southern Railways&lt;/a&gt;, which operates "The Overland" passenger train service between Melbourne and Adelaide said it expected rail services to be disrupted up until early next week. The company will transfer passengers to bus services or allow them to claim a full refund.

The crash will also disrupt freight services between Melbourne and Adelaide.

Local residents and the Victorian opposition are blaming the crash on the level crossing itself, which has no booms, lights or bells.

Rob Dennis, a local resident said the level crossing is the cause of the crash, as it is not fitted with boom gates or flashing lights.

"And it's a blind turn for anything in a large vehicle," he said. 

Terry Mulder, the opposition's transport spokesperson said the &lt;a href="w%3ABracks%20Government"&gt;Bracks Government&lt;/a&gt; should have spent part of the $750 million allocated to fast rail projects to upgrading level crossings in Victoria.

"The State Labor Government has wasted $750 million on fast rail projects," Mr Mulder said.

Mr Mulder said that Victoria has 2,274 level crossings, 1,468 which have no warning systems in place.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; police officers and customs officials working with Hong Kong authorities have seized &lt;a href="w%3Amethamphetamine"&gt;methamphetamine&lt;/a&gt; with a street value of $135 million dollars (NZD).

The drugs were found in a container from China, among bags of cement.

There were 96 1-kg bags of crystal methamphetamine, or P, worth $1 million each and 150kg of &lt;a href="w%3Apseudoephedrine"&gt;pseudoephedrine&lt;/a&gt;, the main ingredient in the making of P, worth $40 million.

"It's a group that's operating offshore that's sending produce to New Zealand and possibly to other places," Police Detective Inspector, Bruce Good said. The inquiry team also found loaded guns, fake passports and $50,000 in cash while searching an &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; home. Weapons discovered included a &lt;a href="w%3AM16%20rifle"&gt;M16 assault rifle&lt;/a&gt;, three handguns and a tiny pen gun, which is banned in New Zealand.

Six people have been charged and are in custody, two New Zealanders, one person from &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; and three from mainland China.

This is 10 times bigger than any other drug bust in New Zealand, reports Detective Superintendent Nick Perry. The previous largest confiscation of crystal methamphetamine was just over 8 kg, which was discovered in &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt; after being smuggled into New Zealand from the Port of Auckland.

The &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="U.S.%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; today approved a comprehensive immigration reform bill Thursday by a vote of 62-36. Among other provisions, the bill seeks to bolster security along the U.S.-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; border, create a guest worker program, and grant many illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, all positions supported by the &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration.

The bill passed today by the Senate is in stark contrast to the version passed by the &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; in December 2005, which provides for no guest worker program and makes illegal immigration a felony.

In a statement, President Bush said, "I look forward to working together with both the House of Representatives and the Senate to produce a bill for me to sign into law." 

Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist called for swift talks with the House to create a compromise measure. Frist, who had earlier supported the House version of the bill, voted in favor of the bill passed today. He expects that "the most contentious part" of the bill would be how to handle the status of illegal immigrants already in the United States.

While &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; senators were mostly united in support of the bill (38-4 in favor), &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; support was divided (32-23 against). Sen. Jeff Sessions, &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said, "The vast majority of the 11 million or so people here will be given every benefit this nation can bestow as a product of their illegality. I don't think that's a good principle."

House Majority Leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Boehner"&gt;John Boehner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , acknowledged the difficulty in reaching a compromise, but expressed optimism that an agreement could be reached. "I'm hopeful that we will come to a resolution and pass a bill," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; Minister for Education, Science and Training, Julie Bishop visited the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Nuclear%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Organisation"&gt;Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALucas%20Heights%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Lucas Heights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; today. The purpose of her visit was to inspect progress on Australia's newest nuclear research reactor - &lt;a href="w%3AOPAL"&gt;OPAL&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst at the facility, she received a report on the economics and safety of a nuclear power industry in Australia.

&lt;a href="w%3AOPAL"&gt;OPAL&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for Open Pool Australian &lt;a href="w%3ALight%20Water%20Reactor"&gt;Light water&lt;/a&gt; reactor is expected to become fully operational by early 2007 and is in its final stage of development.

The reactor, which will replace Australia's sole nuclear reactor - &lt;a href="w%3AHIFAR"&gt;HIFAR&lt;/a&gt; will be used to research microbiology, biotechnology and gene therapy in addition to the production of agents used in &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20medicine"&gt;nuclear medicine&lt;/a&gt;.

The report presented to Ms Bishop at ANSTO was written by Professor John Gittus and discussed the economics and safety of nuclear energy in Australia.

The major conclusion of the study was that new generation nuclear power plants would be as competitive as newer types of coal power plants in Australia. The report also found that nuclear energy is "the safest, most secure way of generating electricity with greater price stability in comparison to gas or coal power generation" according to Ms Bishop.

Prof Gittus' report found that when the cost of environmental damage and &lt;a href="w%3ACarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; emissions from coal or gas fired power stations were considered, nuclear power becomes more attractive.

Speaking on the report, Ms Bishop said she wishes for an evidence-based debate about nuclear energy in Australia. “I welcome this report as a useful contribution to what I hope will be an evidence-based debate about nuclear power in Australia. The debate must focus on the facts and not be biased by emotion.” she said.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20National%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -Left coalition government at the Centre was asked by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20India"&gt;Communist Party of India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to advise the government of the state of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChattisgarh"&gt;Chattisgarh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; not to accept any offer by the &lt;a href="U.S.A."&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/a&gt; to help combat &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANaxal"&gt;Naxalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the area. The CPI also expressed concern at the fact that a foreign country was being allowed to interfere in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s internal affairs. 

The U.S embassy in India had earlier offered to help train local law-enforcement authorities in Chattisgarh and to remove thousands of land mines planted by Naxals in the area. Reports stated that America's offer had been "welcomed" by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABharatiya%20Janata%20Party"&gt;Bharatiya Janata Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -led government in the state. This is the first time another nation has offered to help India tackle Naxalism in the latter country.

The Communist Party of India's Politburo reacted sharply to the offer, and condemned the Chattisgrah government for allowing foreign interference in India's affairs without the prior consent of the Centre. The CPI also asked the Central Government to clarify to the U.S Embassy that Washington's involvement in India's internal affairs was not welcome. CPI leaders A. B Bardhan and Shamim Faizi said such meddling was not new for the US, and recalled US Ambassador David Mulford's letter to West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee criticising the latter's remarks against the American interference in India's internal matters. The CPI had recently criticised the Centre for voting against Iran at the IAEA. 

Chattisgarh is one of at least 13 Indian states combating Naxals and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaoist"&gt;Maoists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who claim they are fighting for the rights of the impoverished peasants in the region. Thousands have died over three decades of violence, and the last 17 months have seen a rise in the number of attacks. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Army"&gt;Indian Army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; released a report earlier this year that showed that by 2010, 30% of India's land area could become part of the "Red-Corridor", which currently stretches from the Indo-Nepal border all the way down to the Southern State of &lt;a href="Andhra%20Pradesh"&gt;Andhra Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;. Prime Minister &lt;a href="Manmohan%20Singh"&gt;Dr. Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; stated last month that Naxals were a big threat to India's internal security.

<h1>Shots fired on Capitol Hill</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Shots%20fired%20on%20Capitol%20Hill&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

There have been reports of gunfire heard in the &lt;a href="w%3ARayburn%20House%20Office%20Building"&gt;Rayburn House Office Building&lt;/a&gt; in Washington D.C. at approximately 10:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_Daylight_Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; (1430 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), leading to a lock down of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Capitol"&gt;United States Capitol&lt;/a&gt;. Senate &lt;a href="w%3AUnited_States_Senate_Sergeant_at_Arms"&gt;Sergeant at Arms&lt;/a&gt; Bill Pickle announced there were no injuries. FOX News reported that a man with a gun was apprehended by Capitol police, but no confirmation has been made of this.

The Senate was in session when the lockdown occurred, but the House of Representatives was not. Many members of congress had already departed in advance of the long &lt;a href="w%3AMemorial%20Day"&gt;Memorial Day&lt;/a&gt; holiday in the US. BBC News initially reported some witness as saying the sound may have been a car backfiring. The Associated Press and FOX News also reported speculation about fireworks or the gunfire having come from an indoor shooting range located in the basement of the Rayburn building. MSNBC suggested the noise may have been from a maintenance man working on an elevator shaft near the area where the shots were heard.

Police evacuated portions of Capitol Hill and told staff members to lock their office doors and "stay inside" as police searched the Rayburn Building floor by floor. At 3:15 p.m., CNN reported that Capitol Police had declared an "all clear" and employees and others inside the Rayburn Building were allowed to leave.

Employees in the Capitol complex were alerted to the incident via messages sent to their &lt;a href="w%3ABlackBerry"&gt;BlackBerries&lt;/a&gt;. They first urged employees to move to an interior office space away from windows, closing doors, grabbing their 'Go-Kits' and then to await further instructions. A second message sent at 12:20 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_Daylight_Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt; reminded employees to lock their office doors, and issued a code word that Capitol Police would use to confirm their identity when knocking at any door.

As the events unfolded, Bill Pickle said "we have been told by staff of shots fired and the smell of smoke in the lobby of the Rayburn House building," said Mr Pickle. In a later statement he said "Police responded to the area where they believed the shots came from and smelled what seemed to be gunpowder."

At a Press Conference lead by Sergeant Kimberly Schneider, public information officer of the U.S. Capitol Police, reported that shots were fired inside Rayburn House Office Building garage but that there were no current reports of injuries. It was later announced at 1:20 local time that there were two minor injuries, a woman who was shaken up and a policeman who twisted his ankle.

Current evidence indicates that the reports of gunfire in the Rayburn Building were actually staffers and Congresspeople hearing the sound of construction work in the elevator. A mechanic was reported to be using a pneumatic hammer, the sound of which, when echoing up the elevator shaft, could be misheard as gunfire by those unaccustomed to either sound. Reports of smoke have not been officially explained, though several comments have chalked the reports of smoke up as paranoia induced, suspecting people heard the warning of gunfire and attributed the origin of a slight or strange smell to the ignition of gunpowder.

<h1>US marines may face death penalty for &quot;massacre&quot; of civilians in Iraq</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20marines%20may%20face%20death%20penalty%20for%20%26quot%3Bmassacre%26quot%3B%20of%20civilians%20in%20Iraq&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Congress"&gt;Congressional&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , military and Pentagon officials" said Thursday that it is expected an investigation will find that the deaths of more than 20 civilians in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; were a &lt;a href="war%20crimes"&gt;war crime&lt;/a&gt;. According to NYT source a group of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corps"&gt;US Marines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "carried out extensive, unprovoked killings of civilians" and the killings were "methodical in nature."

The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is expected to call for criminal charges, including murder, negligent homicide, dereliction of duty and filing a false report. Lawyers involved in discussion thought it could lead to charges of murder, an offense carrying the death penalty.

The incident happened in the Iraqi town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHaditha"&gt;Haditha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on November 19, 2005, after an attack on a convoy when one US marine was killed. According to NYT source evidence indicates sustained operation by marines that lasted three to five hours. Civilians, including women and children were killed inside two or more homes, as well as five men standing near a taxi at a checkpoint. Military Officials initially indicated that 15 Iraqi civilians had died when gunmen attacked a convoy with a roadside bomb and small arms fire, prompting the Marines to return fire.

On Thursday, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hagee"&gt;General Hagee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the commandant of the Marine Corps, said without referring to any specific incident "Recent serious allegations concerning actions of marines in combat have caused me concern" in a speech emphasizing the rules of lawful combat. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kline%20%28politician%29"&gt;John Kline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Representative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; (R) and retired Marine colonel said about the allegations "this was not an accident. This was direct fire by marines at civilians". He continued "This was not an immediate response to an attack. This would be an atrocity".

John Sifton of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said "If the accounts as they have been alleged are true, the Haditha incident is likely the most serious war crime that has been reported in Iraq since the beginning of the war". He continued "Here we have two dozen civilians being killed — apparently intentionally. This isn't a gray area. This is a massacre".

The US Marines are from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarine%20Corps%20Base%20Camp%20Pendleton"&gt;Camp Pendleton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , located in southern &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. Three Marine officers, the battalion commander and two company commanders who were stationed in Haditha at the time, have been relieved of duty, although statements by military officials have not linked the action to the incident.

<h1>Symantec AntiVirus vulnerability found</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Symantec%20AntiVirus%20vulnerability%20found&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Vulnerability allegedly affecting at least two versions of &lt;a href="w%3ASymantec"&gt;Symantec&lt;/a&gt; AntiVirus software has been found. The vulnerability requires no interaction from the end-user, and has the potential to grant complete system level access to an attacker, according to eEye Digital Security, the organization that originally discovered the vulnerability.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AeEye"&gt;eEye&lt;/a&gt;, the Symantec AntiVirus 10.x and Symantec Client Security 3.x product lines are both vulnerable, and other Symantec products may be vulnerable as well.

Symantec released a brief statement early today, in which they confirmed that they have received a report pertaining to a "potential remotely exploitable vulnerability," but that it affected only AntiVirus Corporate Edition 10.x. The company denies that any of its 'Norton' line of consumer-grade products are affected.

<h1>Ahern, Blair to lead Northern Ireland talks</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ahern%2C%20Blair%20to%20lead%20Northern%20Ireland%20talks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hain"&gt;Peter Hain&lt;/a&gt;, has announced that next month, the Prime Ministers of both Ireland and the United Kingdom will meet with the parties of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt; before the summer break.

&lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, will meet at &lt;a href="w%3AHillsborough%20Castle"&gt;Hillsborough Castle&lt;/a&gt;, possibly on June 27, to hold "intensive talks" with the parties and to establish a "clear timeline" to the restoration of devolved government in &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.

Hain has invited all the parties of the Assembly to form a committee to discuss obstacles to formation of a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. 

Hain has asked Assembly speaker &lt;a href="w%3AEileen%20Bell"&gt;Eileen Bell&lt;/a&gt; to convene the first meeting of the committee on June 6 in order to prepare for the talks. The committee is expected to have three members from the four main parties (the DUP, UUP, SDLP and Sinn Féin) and two from the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20Party%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt;.

The two main parties did not take the news kindly. The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; will not sit on the committee if it leads to negotiations with the republicans as it continues not engage in direct talks with Sinn Féin nor will DUP take part in talks running alongside the talks between the parties and the premiers. 

&lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt; says it will not sit on the committee if it turns out to be only a "&lt;a href="w%3Atalking%20shop"&gt;talking shop&lt;/a&gt;". However, &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20McGuinness"&gt;Martin McGuinness&lt;/a&gt; of Sinn Féin said the party will judge the committee "on its ability to contribute to the restoration of the power-sharing executive".

The &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic and Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; says it will only enter if the committee "is the vehicle for restoration of the agreement's institutions, not a talking shop or meaningless sideshow".

However, &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Ulster Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Reg%20Empey"&gt;Sir Reg Empey&lt;/a&gt; was more optimistic and welcomed the initiative, commenting that the committee would "ensure adequate cross-community consensus". Empey further added, "This committee prevents the DUP from running away from the substantive work that needs to be done in identifying the blockages that are standing in the way of the restoration of devolution."

Attempts to form a new &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Executive"&gt;Northern Ireland Executive&lt;/a&gt; failed Monday when &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, refused the nomination to be the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;First Minister of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; after being nominated by Sinn Féin leader &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt;.

Last month, Blair and Ahern made a joint statement calling for the return of &lt;a href="w%3Ahome%20rule"&gt;home rule&lt;/a&gt; government in Northern Ireland as part of a plan by the two. They set a deadline of November 24 for power-sharing government to be set up in the Northern Ireland Assembly, which has been suspended since October 2002 over allegations of a IRA spy ring. One of the men implicated, &lt;a href="w%3ADenis%20Donaldson"&gt;Denis Donaldson&lt;/a&gt;, turned out to be a spy for British intelligence, he was murdered in his home on April 4, 2006, a few days before the statement by Blair and Ahern.

If no power-sharing government is formed by November 24, direct rule from London will continue but with greater input by the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, a proposition which has greatly irked some unionists.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=No%20diplomas%20for%20now%3B%20California%20Exit%20Exam%20appeal%20must%20wait&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Seniors who haven't been credited with passing the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20High%20School%20Exit%20Exam"&gt;California High School Exit Exam&lt;/a&gt; won't be getting diplomas when graduation ceremonies are held next month because the First District Appellate Court won't hear the court case about the test until July 25. 

The attorney for the students suing to block use of the test says he still expects to prevail.

"This case is far from over," said Arturo Gonzalez, the lead attorney in Valenzuela vs. O'Connell, in which Liliana Valenzuela, a Richmond High School student, and others sued to block the state's use of the test as a graduation requirement, "We think there is a strong chance that students in the Class of 2006 will receive their diplomas, even if it is after commencement ceremonies. It is important that students not get discouraged. They have to stay in school and pass their classes."

On May 12, &lt;a href="w%3AAlameda%20County"&gt;Alameda County&lt;/a&gt; Superior Court Judge Robert Freedman agreed with Gonzalez' argument that the state's use of the test as a graduation requirement was unconstitutional because poor and minority students don't have access to equal educational resources, and therefore don't have equal protection under the law. He issued an injunction against the use of the test. 

That injunction seemed to pave the way for those of the 47,000 seniors statewide who haven't yet passed the test, but have completed all other requirements, to receive diplomas with their classmates at upcoming graduation events. 

But State Superintendent of Schools &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20O%27Connell"&gt;Jack O'Connell&lt;/a&gt; quickly filed an appeal of Freedman's ruling and asked the State Supreme Court to issue a stay of Freedman's injunction. Earlier this week, the Court granted O'Connell's request for a stay, allowing schools to deny diplomas to students who haven't passed the test. The Court also ordered the Appellate court to hear O'Connell's appeal of Freedman's ruling against the test.

On Thursday, Gonzalez petitioned the Appellate Court to expedite their hearing of the case to as soon as next week, but today the court denied Gonzalez' request and scheduled the case for a hearing on July 25.

In an email to the &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20Courier"&gt;James Logan Courier&lt;/a&gt;, Gonzalez said he thinks his case is strong enough to withstand the appeal. "We intend to vigorously defend Judge Freedman's ruling," he said, "The record strongly supports his decision."

"If the court of appeals upholds Judge Freedman's ruling, students in the Class of 2006 may still receive their high school diplomas," he said.

About 70 seniors at &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20High%20School"&gt;James Logan High School&lt;/a&gt; in Union City, Ca., mostly minorities and those who are learning English, still need to pass the test.

O'Connell, an avid defender of the test, which is required by a law he wrote and championed when he was in the state legislature, said this week that he would make sure school districts knew that they had to require the test be passed in order to hand out diplomas to students.

"I will communicate with districts today to ensure they are aware that the exit exam is a graduation requirement" he said, "Students who have worked hard to pass this exam will be given a diploma that signifies their mastery of essential skills in reading and math."

<h1>Peacekeepers take control in East Timor</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Peacekeepers%20take%20control%20in%20East%20Timor&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n presence in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; so far has been characterised by vigorous patrolling into the capital &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt;, with the main goal being to lock down the city in order to separate and concentrate the various conflicting forces in East Timor. Despite the Australian military being provided strong rules of engagement by the East Timorese government, so far no soldiers have fired their weapons or been fired upon, although they might have been fired over by gangs earlier today. Outside the Hotel Timor today, where East Timorese Prime Minister Alkatiri was about to hold a press conference, an Australian patrol arrested what appeared to be two gangs about to storm the hotel with the help of reinforcements. The men numbered around 30, carrying machetes, knifes, spears, slingshots, and arrows. The Prime Minister claimed that the gangs were attempting a coup d'etat. Civilian gangs, allegedly provided arms by the East Timorese military, have so far been blamed for much of the violence in Dili.

As the rest of the 1300 strong Australian deployment is expected to arrive in East Timor tomorrow, Australian Prime Minister John Howard has said that although his government did foresee the current situation in East Timor, military action would have constituted an invasion until mandated through the United Nations' or East Timorese government's request. "...People say you should have seen it coming. The answer is yes, I did, but until you are asked, it happens to be an invasion." said Mr Howard. East Timor requested military assistance from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal on May 23, Foreign Minister Jose Ramos-Horta explaining that the government "...[couldn't] control the situation,"; all four nations responded positively to the request.
Despite one newspaper running the headline "We'll stay till job's done, says PM", the Chief of Defence Force, Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston has said that he hopes the Australian military will be able to be replaced within a few months by a UN peacekeepers. In any case, ACM Houston has said that he is believes the Australian presence will stabilise the situation soon, perhaps aided by the good relations that exist between the ADF and the leader of the rebel group, Major Alfredo Reinado. MAJ Reinado was trained by the ADF for three months and has openly welcomed the arrival of the peacekeeping force, saying that the deployment is the "only solution" in the face of the government's inability to resolve the conflict.

After praising the speed of the deployment, Washington revealed that the US assisted the transport of Australian troops to position in Townsville and Darwin two weeks earlier.

Indonesia has now closed its border to East Timor, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono saying that "besides security reasons, the closure of the border is to prevent the possibility of issues that may worsen the image of Indonesia."

<h1>Gang violence continues in East Timor</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Gang%20violence%20continues%20in%20East%20Timor&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Gang violence continued in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; today, despite patrols by foreign soldiers being stepped up. There are presently 600 troops from &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; in the East Timorese capital of &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt;, with that number expected to rise to 1,300 by the end of the weekend.

The East Timorese government requested international assistance on Thursday following weeks of violence. The violence started when 600 East Timorese soldiers were dismissed from the military after claiming they had not been considered for promotion due to them being from the Western region of the country. They also claimed that the top positions in the military had been reserved for those from the Eastern regions.

East Timorese youths are forming gangs and allying with groups of feuding police and military personnel. There have been reports of youths patrolling neighborhoods carrying machetes, swords and knives near government buildings. They said they were protecting the areas against "rogue army elements".

As with the East Timorese military, the general population's support is divided between the remaining army and the sacked soldiers. The police force in the country is said to be non-existent, which is helping to fuel the violence.

Ethnic attacks are also occurring in the country. Gangs from opposing ethnic backgrounds rampaged through the streets torching buildings and looting shops. Tit-for-tat arson attacks by opposing factions have become common.

Speaking to Australia's ABC Radio, a UN spokesperson said that the tension has been increasing in East Timor for sometime. "It's basically pay-back time between the different groups," 

"This is a communal dispute that's escalated because of the overall situation," they said.

<h1>Tamiflu maker on alert after bird flu deaths in Indonesia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tamiflu%20maker%20on%20alert%20after%20bird%20flu%20deaths%20in%20Indonesia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) on Saturday asked the Swiss manufacturer of the antiviral medicine &lt;a href="w%3ATamiflu"&gt;Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt; to prepare the global stockpile of the drug for distribution after a family of seven &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;ns died from the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aavian%20flu"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt; virus. However, the WHO says that there is no cause for alarm at this point.

"Whenever there is a cluster, we contact Roche just to let them know that if we need to send the stockpile that they should be ready to do so," said a spokeswoman for the WHO, Maria Cheng. However, Cheng says "we have not asked that anything be sent, and nothing from Roche has been sent."

Jules Pieters, director of the WHO's rapid response unit, informed &lt;a href="w%3ARoche%20Holdings%20AG"&gt;Roche Holdings AG&lt;/a&gt; to be on alert for the next two weeks after the Indonesian health ministry informed the WHO of the deaths of the members of a family cluster in Kubu Simbelang village in North &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. "We were quite keen to inform Roche quite timely, we knew Thursday would be a holiday in Europe and wanted to make sure Roche warehouses would be open," he said. 

Pieters also said that the move was part of standard procedure in cases where there is reasonable suspicion of human-to-human transmission. The WHO flew 9,500 doses of Tamiflu into Indonesia along with protective gear as a precaution.

According to the WHO, the virus has not mutated into an easily human-transmittable form, nor had it spread outside the family, who were all blood relatives in close contact.

Officials in Indonesia also reported on Friday that two more fatal cases of avian flu were reported, this time between an 18-year-old man and his 10-year-old sister. Tests on the two victims are expected to be sent to WHO laboratories for confirmation.

The WHO also says that they have "no intention of shipping that stockpile" and that they consider this "a practice run," said spokesman for the WHO, Dick Thompson. The WHO also said that the virus has not mutated and so far has not shown any signs of human to human transmission outside the affected family members.

Roche Holding is expected to remain on high alert for at least two weeks.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanterbury%20Crusaders"&gt;Canterbury Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; won the inaugural &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%2014"&gt;Super 14&lt;/a&gt; title, downing the &lt;a href="w%3AWellington%20Hurricanes"&gt;Wellington Hurricanes&lt;/a&gt; 19 points to 12 at &lt;a href="w%3AJade%20Stadium"&gt;Jade Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;. The game was dominated by surreal conditions - a thick fog made viewing the game from the top of the stands impossible. Only one try was scored in the mistake-riddled game, to Crusaders centre &lt;a href="w%3ACasey%20Laulala"&gt;Casey Laulala&lt;/a&gt;.

Both sides were consulted prior to the match on whether the final should be postponed, as a thick fog engulfed the sold-out Jade Stadium. Patrons in the South Stand turned their attention to the stadium screen behind them, as they could not see anything through the mist. The television audience was in a similar position, with most of the pictures being shrouded in a white cloud. Sky Sports commentators split the commentary between themselves and a sideline commentator, as they could not see the other side of the pitch from the commentary box.

Referee &lt;a href="w%3AJonathon%20Kaplan"&gt;Jonathon Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; and the players of both the Crusaders and Hurricanes were asked if they wished to continue at half time, there was apparently a clear view that everyone wanted to continue with the final. The final score was 19 points to 12, a converted try being the difference. For the Crusaders, it was the team's sixth championship in 11 years. Despite the eerie conditions, jubilant celebrations followed after full-time.

The West Indies beat India by six wickets in the fourth &lt;a href="w%3Acricket"&gt;One- Day International&lt;/a&gt; at the Port of Spain, to clinch the 5 match series 3-1. The Indian batting order failed again, managing to make only 217/5 at the end of 50 overs. The highest scorer was Mohammad Kaif, who scored 62 runs before being bowled by Dwayne Bravo. The top-order including &lt;a href="w%3AVirender%20Sehwag"&gt;Sehwag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARahul%20Dravid"&gt;Dravid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASuresh%20Raina"&gt;Raina&lt;/a&gt; collapsed, with the top three batsmen raking up only 33 runs between them.

The West Indies began the chase strongly, but was dealt an early blow by &lt;a href="w%3AIrfan%20Phatan"&gt;Phatan&lt;/a&gt; who sent Samuels back to the pavilion in the 5th over. &lt;a href="w%3AAjit%20Agarkar"&gt;Ajit Agarkar&lt;/a&gt; dispatched &lt;a href="w%3ARamnaresh%20Sarwan"&gt;Sarwan&lt;/a&gt; for 49 four overs later, putting more pressure on the Windie middle-order. &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Lara"&gt;Brian Lara&lt;/a&gt; pleased his home fans with a 61-run knock before scooping one to Raina. The skippers' fellow Trinidadian teammate &lt;a href="w%3ADwayne%20Bravo"&gt;Bravo&lt;/a&gt; put up an unbeaten 69, notching his first ODI half-century and pulling the West Indies out of their early slump, in the process. In the end the home-team reached the target of 218 comfortably with 6 overs to spare.

The match was played at the Queen's Park Oval, Port-of-Spain, and Trinidad and was refereed by E.C Broad. The match-umpires were B.R. Doctrove and Simon Taufel. West-Indian veteran S. Bucknor was the T.V umpire. D.J. Bravo was awarded the Man-of-the-match award for his fine performances both with the ball and the willow.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Less than five years ago, a Yale University grad student by the name of Jason Sorens wrote an essay for ♡❤The Libertarian Enterprise,♡❤ a libertarian news and commentary site published by science-fiction author L. Neil Smith. Frustrated by a lack of political clout, Sorens proposed that &lt;a href="w%3Alibertarians"&gt;libertarians&lt;/a&gt; - people who are socially tolerant and fiscally conservative - could move to a single state and have a much greater impact. Sorens received more than 200 messages in response, and the &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20State%20Project"&gt;Free State Project&lt;/a&gt; was born.

The strategy has matured since that announcement, but the core idea remains intact. In a state with a population of 1.3 million, 20,000 activists can break beyond the novelty value of American third-party viewpoints.

As of this writing, over 7100 people have made that original pledge. This year, spurred by the success of early movers, a second pledge was created. Known as the "First 1000", this pledge has a strict timeline for success; 1000 people must agree, by the end of 2006, to move to New Hampshire by the end of 2008. Like the original statement of intent, should the signers fall short of the goal, none of them are obligated to follow through. As of today, nearly 300 people have signed on to the First 1000.

Most Free Staters, or "Porcupines" so named for the group's mascot, know each other only by way of communicating over the Internet. Once per year, they shed their online monikers and meet in real life, at the annual Porcupine Freedom Festival, known affectionately as "Porcfest".

Porcfest '05 brought an estimated 500 activists from around the country, including former Presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Badnarik"&gt;Michael Badnarik&lt;/a&gt;. While the press attended the event, Free Staters used the festival as an opportunity to socialize and relax.

Pope &lt;a href="w%3ABenedict%20XVI"&gt;Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; is currently visiting &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; on his third pilgrimage. The motto of his pilgrimage to the home country of previous Pope, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20II"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;, is "Stand firm in your faith".

The Pope arrived at Okęcie airport in &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt; on May 25. He met with President &lt;a href="w%3ALech%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Lech Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt; and prayed in an evangelic-augsburg church together with representatives of seven minor Polish churches. The following day he said mass at &lt;a href="w%3APi%C5%82sudski%20Square"&gt;Piłsudski Square&lt;/a&gt;, mirroring a precedent set by his predecessor 27 years earlier. Benedict XVI talked in Latin and in small parts in Polish. Later that day he went to &lt;a href="w%3ACz%C4%99stochowa"&gt;Częstochowa&lt;/a&gt;.

On May 27, Benedict XVI visited &lt;a href="w%3AWadowice"&gt;Wadowice&lt;/a&gt;, home town of John Paul II, and &lt;a href="w%3AKrak%C3%B3w"&gt;Kraków&lt;/a&gt;. Crowds of people gathered on the Błonia meadows. Benedict XVI addressed young people in his speech and was met with applause. Benedict XVI expressed his contentment with his visit in Poland.

Tomorrow will be the last day in the pilgrimage; the Pope will visit the site of the Nazi concentration camp in &lt;a href="w%3AAuschwitz%20concentration%20camp"&gt;Auschwitz&lt;/a&gt; and meet with representatives of other religions.

<h2>Reactions to the visit</h2>

There were some concerns about the reaction of Polish people to Benedict XVI - based on their strong attachment to his predecessor. However, the Pope was warmly welcomed and people were excited by the visit.

The pilgrimage garnered significant media attention, not only Polish press, but also from other countries. Seven TV stations, including CNN, NBC, BBC, and EuroNews, broadcast live reports from the event. Journalists from several German stations and Russian NTW came to Poland for the visit.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASale%20Sharks"&gt;Sale Sharks&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href="w%3ALeicester%20Tigers"&gt;Leicester Tigers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20Premiership"&gt;Guinness Premiership&lt;/a&gt; final, claiming the team's first title of the modern competition. The game was played at a rainy &lt;a href="w%3ATwickenham%20Stadium"&gt;Twickenham Stadium&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, May 27, the final score being 45 points to 20.

Sale entered the game as the top English &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; club after finishing atop of the &lt;a href="w%3A2005-06%20Guinness%20Premiership"&gt;2005-06 Guinness Premiership&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Leicester finished second, so it was 1st v 2nd. The scoring opened up in the 3rd minute, with fly-half &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Hodgson"&gt;Charlie Hodgson&lt;/a&gt; land a penalty kick for the Sharks, scoring continued for the Sharks a few minutes later when &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Cueto"&gt;Mark Cueto&lt;/a&gt; scored the opening try of the match.

Leicester hit back in the 9th minute with flanker &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20Moody"&gt;Lewis Moody&lt;/a&gt; scoring the team's first try, with &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Goode"&gt;Andy Goode&lt;/a&gt; converting the try, the score was now a lot closer, ten minutes into the game. Moody's try was followed by a period of no scoring, until &lt;a href="w%3AMagnus%20Lund"&gt;Magnus Lund&lt;/a&gt; scored a try for the Sharks in the 17th minute to extend Sale's lead. More points came for the Sharks over 10 minutes later, with Hodgson kicking another penalty goal in the 31st minute.

Leicester also got a penalty shortly after Hodgson kicked Sale's, Goode was successful in kicking the penalty goal for Leiceter in the 36th minute. Sale hit back in the closing moments of the first half, with &lt;a href="w%3AOriol%20Ripol%20Fortuny"&gt;Oriol Ripol Fortuny&lt;/a&gt; scoring a try, which was converted by Hodgson. Sale went into halftime leading Leicester 23 points to 10.

Penalty kicks were exchanged in the early stages of the second half, with Leicester's Goode kicking one in the 43rd minute, with Hodgson kicking one in the 45th minute for the Sharks. Hodgson got another penalty goal in the 48th minute, extending the Sharks' lead over Leicester.

In the 63rd minute, Charlie Hodgson kicked another penalty goal for Sale, furthering the lead, with less than 20 minutes left in the final. In the 70th minute, with 10 minutes remaining on the clock, Charlie Hodgson landed a drop goal. Leicester replied with a try in &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Hamilton"&gt;James Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; in the 74th minute, although it may have been too late, Goode converted the try. Sale got more points on the board in the 78th minute, with Hodgson landing another penalty goal. In the final moments of the game, &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Mayor"&gt;Chris Mayor&lt;/a&gt; scored a try, which was converted by &lt;a href="w%3AValentin%20Courrent"&gt;Valentin Courrent&lt;/a&gt;.

Lebanese officials have stated that jets from &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; have bombed the bases of a Palestinian militant group near Beirut. Reports say missiles were fired at camps run by the &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Palestine"&gt;PFLP&lt;/a&gt; a few hours after an Israeli soldier was hurt when a rocket which was fired from Lebanon hit an army base near the Israeli town of Safed. 

Israeli officials stated that they were holding the government of &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the attack that originated from within the latter country's borders. According to the Associated Press, Israel is going to make an official complaint to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt;. A spokeswoman for the Israeli Army said, "The state of Israel holds the Lebanese government responsible for any terror attack emanating from its territory."

No militant group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack, although the Lebanese extremist group &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; and Palestinian militants based in Lebanon have, in the past, claimed responsibility for such attacks. Israel has also responded to such incidents by conducting air-operations similar to the one it conducted today. There were reports that the Israeli planes fired up to eight missiles during the two runs they conducted, but there do not seem to be any casualties. 

Hezbollah said Israel's air strikes were "part of Israel's targeting of security and stability in Lebanon".

The &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; parties in &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; have moved towards unification following separate meetings today. In most states of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and at the federal level the two parties co-operate with each other to form a &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20%28Australia%29"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt;.

The coalition is generally led by the more dominant party, which in other states and at the federal level is generally the Liberals. In Queensland this is reversed.

If the Queensland proposal is successful it will create a single conservative party in the state. Many see it as the only way to challenge &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; government, which holds a 31-seat majority in Queensland's lower house.

The idea was originally floated by Queensland Nationals leader Lawrence Springborg two years ago but was rejected by most Liberals who feared such a merger would disassociate them from the federal Liberals. The idea was also unpopular with National party members.

The new party would be led by Opposition leader Lawrence Springborg, currently of the Nationals, with Liberals leader Bob Quinn as his deputy. Liberal State Director Geoff Greene said that the party would follow a Liberal-style structure with branding to be "negotiated".

The news has made big shockwaves in Canberra with most of the fedreal National party with Mark Vaile strongly against the move and Queensland senaton Banabry Joyce saying he would sit as an indepent. 

Mr Geoff Greene said that there would be discussions held in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; over the coming days. It is believed that Liberal &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; will be involved in the discussions. If the parties merge, both will need to make changes to their constitutions.

Activists from &lt;a href="w%3ATunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;'s only independent human-rights body have been assaulted by the police in that country, according to reports. Witnesses say the roads leading to the &lt;a href="w%3ATunisia%20Human%20Rights%20League"&gt;Tunisia Human Rights League&lt;/a&gt; were blocked by plainclothes policemen who insulted and kicked activists who attempted to breach the cordon. U.S diplomats and French lawyers, who had been invited to the meeting, were also present at the scene. No arrests have so far been reported in this incident, which according to human-rights activists, is the latest in a chain of government atrocities that include beating lawyers, jailing opponents and stifling the press.

&lt;a href="w%3AMokhtar%20Trifi"&gt;Mokhtar Trifi&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the group, said: "It is shameful that those invited to support human rights in Tunisia cannot gain access to the headquarters of the human rights league." Some pro-government members of the Human Rights League, however, accuse their leadership of cronyism, physical and verbal violence against militants and of sidelining members who disagree with them. 

Meanwhile, members of the Tunisian National Organisation for Lawyers have begun a hunger strike in protest against the law of the Supreme Bar Institute that was endorsed by the Tunisian parliament. The lawyers accuse the Ministry of Justice of seeking to control the lawyers' syndicate. The government says it is committed to democracy and respects human rights, adding it has no political prisoners and that it has not jailed anyone for expressing their opinions.

A father and his two sons are dead after he threw them off the Loews Hotel balcony 15 floors above the ground in &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Edward van Dyk, 43, threw both of his sons, 4 and 8, off the hotel balcony and then jumped off the balcony himself. 

Police say that van Dyk and his wife Qinuo were having problems in their marriage but were getting ready to celebrate their ten year wedding anniversary and did not have a fight before the tragedy. Police also say that van Dyk was attempting to get back at his wife for the problems.

According to Qinuo, she heard one of the boys yelling. When she got to the room to see what was wrong, all she saw was her husband jumping off the balcony. She then looked off the balcony to find her two sons and her husband lying motionless on the roof of the hotel, two floors above the ground.

"It's unfortunate that this gentleman was so selfish and in an effort to get back at his wife he took the two most loved people in the world away from her. It's a terrible tragedy," said Bobby Hernandez a spokesman for the Miami Beach Police Department.

Van Dyk was working out of Alton Memorial Hospital and was a doctor of radiation oncology and was employed at the hospital for just over one year. He was also in charge of the hospital's cancer unit.

"We are shocked and saddened by this tragedy and we offer our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Van Dyk and her family," said Rob Shelton spokesman for the hospital. 

Van Dyk left no note or clues as to the reasons why he killed his sons and himself. Guests in rooms near the incident did not hear any noise. The family was on vacation from &lt;a href="w%3AAlton%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Alton, Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Interview with LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire</h1>

Old books never die. They don't even fade away. Instead, their copyright expires and they are released into the &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20domain"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt;, where hordes of volunteers breathe new life into them. Groups like &lt;a href="http%3A//www.gutenberg.org/"&gt;Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pgdp.net/"&gt;Distributed Proofreaders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//wikisource.org"&gt;Wikisource&lt;/a&gt; digitize, preserve and categorize classic works of literature, old encyclopedias, and even periodicals.

Hugh McGuire, a writer from Montreal, decided that he did not only want to read these voices from the past &amp;mdash; he wanted to hear them. "On a practical level," he says, "I wanted to download a free audiobook." Disappointed with the somewhat meager outcome of his search, he decided to create an open community website dedicated to creating spoken word versions of public domain texts. In August 2005, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.librivox.org/"&gt;LibriVox&lt;/a&gt; was born. The call to action is simple enough:

Less than a year later, the website features a hundred or so completed books, and 300 people have contributed chapters or poetry. "Probably another 400
have done or are expected to do chapters for books not yet completed or cataloged," McGuire explains. The finished audio files, like the texts they come from, are released into the public domain and offered in the &lt;a href="w%3AMP3"&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOgg%20Vorbis"&gt;Ogg Vorbis&lt;/a&gt; file formats. Volunteers use the active &lt;a href="http%3A//librivox.org/forum/"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http%3A//librivox.org/wiki/moin.cgi/"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; to collaborate. We asked Hugh McGuire about the state of the project, internationalization, and the place of LibriVox in the larger free content community.

♡❤♡Why did you decide to take the acoustic fate of public domain works into your own hands, and how did you go about it? ♡❤♡

I think that a vibrant public domain is very important to a healthy world, and so I thought: here's a way to help the cause. I launched LibriVox, emailed some friends and some podcasters who where doing literary stuff, and invited them to record a chapter of Joseph Conrad's ♡❤Secret Agent.♡❤ Things have grown steadily since. By the way, &lt;a href="http%3A//akma.disseminary.org/"&gt;AKMA&lt;/a&gt; was the first guy I know of to do something like this, with [Lawrence] Lessig's ♡❤Free Culture.♡❤ That, I think, started my thinking about this, but it took a while for the idea to crystallize.

♡❤♡Do you personally record audiobooks, and did you already do so before LibriVox?♡❤♡

LibriVox was my first experience recording audiobooks. I still do the odd chapter, but i am a bit delinquent in finishing some of them these days!

♡❤♡Is there a particular LibriVox book which you think stands out because of the quality, the overall effort involved, its popularity, or for some other reason?♡❤♡

My personal favourite is &lt;a href="http%3A//librivox.org/notes-from-the-underground-by-fyodor-dostoyevsky/"&gt;♡❤Notes from the Underground♡❤&lt;/a&gt; (Dostoyevsky). Other random good ones: 
<ol>
BULLET::::1. Austen, Jane. Pride and Prejudice
BULLET::::2. Christie, Agatha. The Mysterious Affair at Styles
BULLET::::3. London, Jack. White Fang
BULLET::::4. Macaulay, Thomas Babington. History of England (Volume 1, Chapter 1)

BULLET::::6. Twain, Mark. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (solo)

</ol>
[Ed.: See the &lt;a href="http%3A//librivox.org/completed-books"&gt;LibriVox catalog&lt;/a&gt; for a full index.]

♡❤♡Browsing the catalog, I find that the quality of the spoken audio varies greatly from text to text or even from chapter to chapter. If someone wanted to re-record a chapter because they didn't like the speaker, would you then offer two versions?♡❤♡

Yes. We take the Wikipedia approach: if you think it should be better, please help it be so. You'll note we offer a couple of versions of some books. Indeed our &lt;a href="http%3A//librivox.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D1114"&gt;weekly poetry project&lt;/a&gt; celebrates this diversity of voice: each week a new short poem is chosen and as many readers as wish to record a version, so you get 20+ versions of the same poem, a very interesting audio experience.

♡❤♡Besides works whose copyright has expired, there is an increasing number of modern books available under Creative Commons and similar licenses. You mentioned Larry Lessig's ♡❤Free Culture♡❤, but it also includes some out of print titles by publishers who are open to the concept, such as O'Reilly. Do you want to limit the scope of LibriVox strictly to old public domain works, or do you have plans to include recent works under reasonably permissive licenses as well?♡❤♡

We are only doing public domain works, for a number of reasons, partly to keep simplicity in our copyright situation -- public domain means its as simple as can be. CC makes things more complex. Also, there are other sites, notably podiobooks.com, which are better suited to CC works than LibriVox. we find it makes things clear and easy to say: published works, public domain, and leave it at that.

♡❤♡As far as I can tell, podiobooks.com features "free as in beer" content &amp;mdash; material which you can download, but which isn't under a free content license. Instead of "public domain", wouldn't "free content" work just as well, using something like the &lt;a href="http%3A//freecontentdefinition.org/"&gt;Free Content Definition&lt;/a&gt; to limit the scope?♡❤♡

This needs more discussion obviously: we chose public domain because the texts we use are public domain and we didn't want to add new
restrictions, especially not non-commercial, since already our recordings are being used for a number of commercialish projects (I can't recall any specific project names, but some pay-education sites use LV stuff). That's good and well and fine with us. We don't want to have to give anyone permission to use our recordings, we want anyone to use them for whatever they want.

Also, for the thing to work you need to have many dedicated volunteers willing to do the management (onerous) and many willing to do the reading. While ♡❤Pride and Prejudice♡❤ will attract many readers, I don't know about O'Reilly's latest tome on XML... though I might be wrong.

♡❤♡Are there plans to fully internationalize the website?♡❤♡

LV is a totally open project, so where the volunteers go, we go. We have books in German, Italian, French, Spanish, Hebrew, Finnish, Japanese, Old English... and possibly a few more. We also have a wiki, and our response to such questions is to encourage any non-anglos to make translations there, and we can incorporate into the site as needed. We have a &lt;a href="http%3A//librivox.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D882"&gt;language policy&lt;/a&gt;, which basically says that in general the forum language is English (so that admin know what's going on) but that if a non-English book project is started, the language in that thread can be whatever volunteers wish to use.

♡❤♡I was thinking specifically about things like the user interface of the website and the forums. Are there plans to internationalize these? Many people speak no English at all, so an English website might not work for them.♡❤♡

In order for this to happen we need volunteers willing to do it. We have no budget (literally zero) and our structure is totally loose and open, so if a volunteer or group of volunteers offer to do this, we will find a way to help make it happen. There is the constraint that we'd be most comfortable with active volunteers doing it, who understand the project and its particularities. 

Since everything is volunteer, the current admin would have to find the time to manage this, too, but I expect if there were a serious desire on the part of some volunteers, we'd have no problem adding the text. We have a wiki, where anyone is welcome to write the text in whatever language, and then we could easily post pages up to the site.

♡❤♡Has &lt;a href="w%3Apodcasting"&gt;podcasting&lt;/a&gt; helped you in gaining more awareness?♡❤♡

Sure! Podcasting was the inspiration for LV ... easy, cheap, do-it-yourself audio! Superb. Podcasting is an important part of our distribution, but &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;torrents&lt;/a&gt; and regular downloads are probably bigger.

♡❤♡So, do you have an idea how many people listen to your podcast?♡❤♡

Last estimation was in the 5000 range.

♡❤♡Besides human readers, there's also the fully automated approach of turning text into sound. Text-to-speech software is getting better every year, with an increasing focus on "natural" voices.♡❤♡

I don't find text-to-speech very interesting. LV is about people reading to you, which is very different than having a computer - no matter the naturalness - read to you. Our recordings have mistakes, fumbles, coughs, and beautiful human voices being human, reading wonderful works of literature. It's not ♡❤just♡❤ transmission of audio information, it's something much more, and something no computer, robot etc. could ever replicate. 

♡❤♡Do you not sometimes get worried that your work might eventually be made obsolete by technology?♡❤♡

See above, but we don't really feel like we are in competition with other projects. Many of us are working for similar goals, and there's room for many of us. Personally, I am very much interested in what the ♡❤readers♡❤ get out of the process, as much as the listeners. If there are computer-generated public domain audiobooks, so much the better. There are also many other audiolit projects, and we all seem to be doing parallel stuff. I think that's great. The beauty of LV, podcasting etc. is that it's all so cheap to do - you can have your choice. I will choose a real human reading over a computer reading any day, but others might not agree. That's fine. LVers read out of love of literature, and nothing more. 

♡❤♡Wikisource is the Wikimedia project which digitizes and archives free content texts. There's also an existing Wikimedia effort to create spoken versions of Wikipedia articles. Are you guys aware of each other, and possibly already working together?♡❤♡

We're aware of some of these projects, and have corresponded with some of these and others. There's so much to do! It's great that so many are doing this stuff, and that people can choose the things that interest them. this is the thing about LV (as with Wikipedia etc) ... we can't control our volunteers, nor do we want to. We just give a framework, and hope for the best. 

♡❤♡What is the last audiobook you've listened to?♡❤♡

To be honest, I haven't listened to a full book in a long while! Last chapter I listened to was from &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Whitman"&gt;Whitman&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤Leaves of Grass.♡❤

&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Monaco Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in his career today. 

During Saturday's qualifying session, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; made a strange mistake in the La Rascasse corner, when he driver locked his car's wheels, bringing the vehicle to a halt and finished the race causing the drivers behind him to lose time on their fast laps. After a long investigation the FIA's stewards decided to cancel all his fast laps as a penalty for the unsporting behaviour displayed by him. Article 112 of the regulations, applied by FIA, prevents the F1 team &lt;a href="w%3AScuderia%20Ferrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; to appeal this decision. Thus, Schumacher and &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt;, who crashed his car earlier in the qualification, were last on the starting grid. The Ferrari team decided to change the engine in both cars, because there was no more stringent penalty that could have been imposed on them. Michael started the race from the pit-lane.

Alonso was in the lead for the most of the race. &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20Raikkonen"&gt;Kimi Raikkonen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Webber"&gt;Mark Webber&lt;/a&gt;, who were the only serious competitors to Alonso for the first part of the race, lost their cars (due to engine failure) almost simultaneously, one by one. After that Alonso drove to victory with little opposition from the other drivers.

With a huge gap from the Spaniard, &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AJuan-Pablo%20Montoya"&gt;Juan-Pablo Montoya&lt;/a&gt; took second place.

The circuit was a great success for &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Bull%20Racing"&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt; team as &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Coulthard"&gt;David Coulthard&lt;/a&gt; came in at third place.

There was no traditional champaign douse after the race in memory of &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89douard%20Michelin%20%28born%201963%29"&gt;Édouard Michelin&lt;/a&gt;, one of the owner of &lt;a href="w%3AMichelin"&gt;Michelin&lt;/a&gt; company died a couple of days before the race.

Two more major earthquakes about 30-minutes apart, have struck in the countries of &lt;a href="w%3APapua%20New%20Guinea"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS). Experts do not believe that the two quakes are related.

The first quake struck in Papua New Guinea on the small island of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Britain"&gt;New Britain&lt;/a&gt; at 0312 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; and had a &lt;a href="w%3Amagnitude"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt; of 6.2. The second quake, on the island nation of Tonga struck at 0336 UTC with a magnitude of 6.7. No injuries or damage have been reported from either of the quakes.

"They're probably unrelated, they just happened at the same time," said geophysicist with Hawaii's &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt;, Barry Hirshorn. He also said that neither quake posed a &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; threat.

"No destructive Pacific-wide tsunami threat exists based on historical earthquake and tsunami data," said a statement n the warning center's website. 

However; the statement also said that large earthquakes like these could sometimes "generate tsunamis that can be destructive" within 100 km of the epicenters and added that cities in that range should be warned of the possibility and take "appropriate actions."

Just yesterday, a magnitude 6.3 quake struck the island of Java in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; that killed over 3,000 people.

According to St. Johns County Sheriff's Office in &lt;a href="w%3AJulington%20Creek%2C%20Florida"&gt;Julington Creek, Florida&lt;/a&gt; ten homes had to be temporarily evacuated after a suspicious package was left on a doorstep of a home on West Pleasant Place in the city and featured a photo of the skyline of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and the former World Trade Center towers.

"We have a Sept. 11 scene - a scene of New York City prior to Sept. 11. After that fact, we're not going to too many specifics about the device itself, certainly we'll let ATF and our investigators look at that," said Chuck Mulligan, St. Johns County officer.

The tenants were not expecting a package and called police to report it as being suspicious. The bomb squad responded and used a special robot to look at the package and open it. When the robot opened the package, authorities saw what appeared to be a bomb. They then detonated the package two times, both of which exploded. After recovering the material, they determined that two pipe bombs had been inside the package.

"Normally, even if someone has designed a package to look as though it's an explosive device, we find nothing explosive inside. Certainly different today," added Mulligan.

It is still unknown who placed the bombs on the doorstep and why they did it. So far no arrests have been made and no suspects have been announced. Authorities have set up a tip line for anyone who has information on the case.

<h1>Opposition should push for Australian federal electoral reform: Whitlam</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Opposition%20should%20push%20for%20Australian%20federal%20electoral%20reform%3A%20Whitlam&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Former &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGough%20Whitlam"&gt;Gough Whitlam&lt;/a&gt; has attacked the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; party's stance on electoral reform during a speech at the opening of Labor member Kevin Rudd's new office in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr Whitlam said that the Australian opposition's recent record of defending the rights of citizens and improving the functioning of governance was "abysmal".

He also said that the Labor party seemed to have ignored the fact that the incumbent government has an advantage in determining election dates.
"They don't seem to care that the national elections are held on the date which the incumbent prime minister calculates will give the biggest advantage to his party," he said.

"In this way, he restricts the capacity of the alternative government to choose candidates, prepare policies and plan campaigns."

As well, Mr Whitlam voiced his belief that Labor should push for fixed four-year terms, much the same as those which operate in some Australian states.

Mr Whitlam said the joint standing committee on electoral affairs' report last year, which found that election terms should be fixed for three-years at the least could be used to push for reform. Mr Whitlam added that it has long been Labor party policy for Australia to fix four-year terms for both houses of parliament.

Mr Whitlam said the issue of electoral reform was urgent.
"Referendum proposals must be submitted to the electors... not less than two nor more than six months after they have been passed by an absolute majority in each house of the Parliament. The issue is urgent."

Mr Whitlam also warned that if Labor won the next election that it would be frustrated by a coalition majority in the senate. Senators are elected for six-year terms with half of them due for re-election every three-years.

<h1>Violence in East Timor causes United Nations evacuation</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Violence%20in%20East%20Timor%20causes%20United%20Nations%20evacuation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
An upsurge in violence in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; has made the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; evacuate hundreds of staff members and families from the country. 

Sukehiro Hasegawa, the Special Representative to Secretary-General Kofi Annan in Dili said, "A temporary relocation for non-essential staff is the most judicious choice at this time."

The decision comes after the Australian-led peacekeeping operation and the East Timorese government struggled to contain unrest in &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt;, the country's capital. 

Gang members, some wielding machetes, have been fighting along ethnic lines. There also has been looting and buildings have been razed. 

Staff members and families will be relocated to Darwin, Australia. Over 100 United Nations staff will remain in East Timor awaiting the arrival of more Australian peacekeeping forces.

The peacekeeping operation began after an appeal by the government for international help. Australian forces are part of the multinational force that numbers over 2000 military personnel. 

The peacekeepers say they do not directly engage in combat. This brought confusion from one child who said, "Why aren't the Australians doing anything?" 

The Australian Prime Minister John Howard said, "It's a trickier operation than some people think, nobody should assume that it's just a simple walk-in-the-park military operation -- it's quite challenging."

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; opposition leader, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Debnam"&gt;Peter Debnam&lt;/a&gt; has called the maintenance backlog in NSW schools a disgrace following an announcement by the &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Iemma&lt;/a&gt; government to spend &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$120 million over four-years.

Mr Debnam challenged the government to fix the problem before the election in March next year and said that the plan was a "fraud".

In 2005, the NSW Auditor-General released a report disclosing a $116 million maintenance backlog in schools across the state. The report stated that there were 1,000 outstanding maintenance jobs, ranging from leaking roofs and fraying carpets to classrooms in need of paint across the states' 2,224 government-owned schools.

On Sunday, NSW Premier, Morris Iemma announced that his government would be spending $120 million over a four-year period to clear the backlog. During the announcement, he admitted that the government needed to do more to clear the backlog. “It is part of our plan to ensure our children have the best possible education and the best possible learning environment,” he said.

Teachers have said that the level of funding and time frame were not enough to clear a backlog spanning 10 years. President of the NSW Teachers Federation, Maree O'Halloran said, "Why should children have to wait four years for overdue maintenance work which forms the maintenance backlog?"

"In 2005, the Auditor-General identified a $115 million maintenance backlog and Professor Tony Vinson called for an additional $90 million dollars for maintenance per year, over two years." said Ms O'Halloran.

Opposition education spokesperson, Brad Hazzard said that the government's plan is a fraud and that the reason students are leaving school is because of the out-dated infrastructure.

"The announcement of extra money is a fraud because it is over four years," said Mr Hazzard.

"The State Government has shown no foresight about the major problem that causes … students to walk away from the public school system annually - 1960 infrastructure in the 21st century." said Mr Hazzard.

Adam Leatham, 22, was arrested on Saturday for armed robbery of a Cherrywood Westpac bank branch last week, Tuesday, May 23.

Leatham appeared in Tauranga District Court this morning for five charges relating to the robbery.

Police say that he was wearing orange overalls, a balaclava and a pistol when he stole $6300 from Cherrywood at about 3:15 p.m.

Outside the bank Leatham was trying to hijack a car, he threatened an old man with his pistol, eventually stealing a black Mitsubishi Mirage. The car was later found abandoned around Fairmont Terrace in the Glenn Terrace or Ridge Street area.

Leatham will be back in court Friday.

Police would like any information from anyone who saw "suspicious activity" around the bank on Tuesday, around 2:00 p.m.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Manjit Kaur of the Malaysian Star reports the controversial documentary ♡❤The Last Communist♡❤ or ♡❤Lelaki Komunis Terahkir♡❤ has finally been banned by the Home Ministry under the Film Censorship Act 1991.

The film was passed without any cuts by the National Film Censorship board in March but the Home Ministry retracted the approval ten days before film was scheduled to start screening. 

The film is described as a "semi-musical documentary" and is inspired by the leader of the disbanded &lt;a href="w%3AMalayan%20Communist%20Party"&gt;Malayan Communist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChin%20Peng"&gt;Chin Peng&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMalayan%20Emergency"&gt;Malayan Emergency&lt;/a&gt; during which over ten thousand Malayan and British troops and civilians lost their lives.

The film features "interviews with the people in the towns [Peng] lived from birth to national independence" that is "interspersed with specially composed songs in the mould of old-fashioned propaganda films." The film made its world debut at the &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin%20Film%202006%20Festival"&gt;Berlin Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. It also appeared at this year's &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20International%20Film%20Festival"&gt;Seattle International Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Film%20Festival"&gt;London Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;.

The ban comes after &lt;a href="w%3ABerita%20Harian"&gt;Berita Harian&lt;/a&gt;, a conservative Malay daily, printed a series of articles critical of the film and the Censorship board. In the first article, the reporters ask government ministers and professors to comment on the impact of the film.

A 42 year-old woman has died following an accident during a backburning operation on a farm at Black Forest, near &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales'&lt;/a&gt; central west. According to police the woman died after suffering burns to 98 percent of her body.

A backburn is carried out to reduce the amount of material that could fuel a fire during the bushfire season. In Australia, it is common for these backburns to be carried out this time of year, in preparation for the fire season.

At around 2PM on Sunday, the woman and a group of people were conducting the backburn on the property when the wind suddenly changed direction. The woman tried to move out of the fire's path but tripped when she was climbing a fence where she was engulfed by the fire.

The woman was rushed to Bathurst Base Hospital before being airlifted to the Royal North Shore Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; where she died at 1:30 a.m. today.

<h1>Boeing delivers final 717 to AirTran, ending Douglas era</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20Commercial%20Airplanes"&gt;Boeing Commercial Airplanes&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday delivered the final &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20717"&gt;717&lt;/a&gt; jet built to &lt;a href="w%3AAirTran%20Airways"&gt;AirTran Airways&lt;/a&gt; in ceremonies in Long Beach, California, bringing production of &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonnell%20Douglas"&gt;McDonnell Douglas&lt;/a&gt; jets to an end. 

"AirTran Airways would like to thank the many Boeing employees for their hard work and dedication over the years and enabling us to build a world-class aircraft fleet that is unparalleled in the aviation industry," said Joe Leonard, Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of AirTran Airways.

The final Boeing 717 was the 15,599th plane built by the Long Beach plant, the original home of &lt;a href="w%3ADouglas%20Aircraft"&gt;Douglas Aircraft&lt;/a&gt; and McDonnell Douglas. It also marked the end of the popular &lt;a href="w%3ADC-9"&gt;DC-9&lt;/a&gt; family of jets, which has sold over 2,400 units over its 41-year history.

In 1995, McDonnell Douglas introduced the MD-95, which later became the Boeing 717 when McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1996. The 717 had suffered from slow sales throughout its history, with 155 planes ordered. In January 2005, Boeing announced that it would cancel the 717 program after completing all outstanding orders.

The 717 program's demise leaves the &lt;a href="w%3AC-17"&gt;C-17&lt;/a&gt; military cargo jet as the only remaining jet aircraft built in California. Some workers from the 717 program have transferred to the C-17 program. Its future is also uncertain as Boeing's contract to produce the aircraft expires in 2008.

If you've always wanted to live in a world populated by elves, dwarves and wizards, you don't need to pay for a ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20of%20Warcraft"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ subscription or buy the Special Extended DVD Trilogy Edition of ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings"&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ just yet. You could instead give ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20for%20Wesnoth"&gt;Battle for Wesnoth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ a try &amp;mdash; an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; turn-based strategy game in a fantasy setting. For the practically minded, "open-source" means that the code which the game is made of is available to anyone who wishes to use, redistribute or change it. It was created by volunteers and can be freely shared. Even the multiplayer online part of the game is free (no ads or spyware either).

But ♡❤Wesnoth♡❤, as it is often abbreviated, is notable not only because it is free. While its graphics are simple by modern standards, the sheer number of units and scenarios that are available for the game is staggering. This is where the "open source" philosophy comes truly into play: anyone can contribute art or new campaigns. As of May 2006, the forum where users can share and discuss their own art contained over 25,000 messages. Most of this art is made available under the same open source terms as the game itself.

♡❤Battle for Wesnoth♡❤ lets you command armies of units such as archers, swordmen, mages and gryphons during the course of a campaign consisting of multiple missions. Typically, your mission is to defeat an enemy leader, but some scenarios let you liberate a prisoner, find a lost artifact, traverse dangerous territories, and so on. Your best units can be taken from one mission to the next, "levelling up" in the process. Even units of the same type vary in their abilities, making the tactical use of the right unit at the right time very important.

The game is reminiscent of turn-based strategy classics such as ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHeroes%20of%20Might%20and%20Magic"&gt;Heroes of Might and Magic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ or ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWarlords%20%28game%20series%29"&gt;Warlords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. Throughout each campaign, the player is informed of the progress of the story. For instance, in the "Heir to the Throne" campaign, the player follows the story of Prince Konrad, who must reclaim the throne of Wesnoth from an evil queen.

The game was originally designed by David White, who is still the project's lead developer. We exchanged e-mails with David about the state of open source gaming, the future of ♡❤Wesnoth♡❤, and the collaborative aspects of game development.

♡❤♡David, thanks for taking our questions. Open source games suffer from the problem that very few people have all the abilities needed to make a good game: programming, graphics, story development, sound effects, music, and so on. When you started Battle for Wesnoth, how did you deal with this?♡❤♡ 

Not very well. :) 

Version 0.1 of Wesnoth was developed entirely by me, and it was ugly. It had awful graphics, and no sound or music at all.

I think the best way to deal with the problem is to make an early version of the game which showcases the desired gameplay. Then, people with the appropriate skills who like the game will contribute. This worked out well with Wesnoth, anyhow, as I soon attracted a fine artist, Francisco Munoz, and once the graphics were decent, more people started wanting to help.

♡❤♡I noticed that the forum allows anyone to submit art for the game. How important have contributions from ordinary players been for development?♡❤♡

Well, as with almost any free software project, contributions from users have been very important. In the area of art, this is definitely so, though making a substantial contribution of art generally requires a reasonable amount of skill, so the number of people who can contribute art is somewhat limited.

This has meant that the number of people who contribute art is much smaller than, say, the number of people who contribute bug reports or feature requests. Still, there are plenty of good pixel artists out there, and we have had many good contributions from our community.

♡❤♡Also, within the game itself, it's possible to directly download new campaigns from the Internet, many of which have been created by players. Do you think that, in essence, we are seeing the beginnings of applying "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awiki"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " principles to game development?

On one hand, I see the ability to directly download new campaigns as a mild convenience &amp;mdash; it wouldn't be much more difficult for the user to, for instance, go to a web page and download campaigns.

On the other hand, it does blur the line between 'developer created content' and 'user created content' and so, like a Wiki, makes it much easier for any user to contribute to the game.

I think that for an Open Source game, making it as easy as possible for users to contribute content is a key way to help make the game succeed. We have tried hard to do this in Wesnoth. I don't think that with something dynamic like a game, it's quite as easy to make absolutely anyone be able to edit it or contribute as easily as they can in a Wiki, but we have tried to make it as easy as possible. 

♡❤♡How do you moderate user-submitted content? Are there scenarios or graphics you have rejected because they crossed a line &amp;mdash; sexual content, excessive violence, etc.?♡❤♡

Well, there are basically three levels of content acceptance:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. 'Official': content can be accepted into the game itself &amp;mdash; the content will reside in our SVN repository, and will be in the tarballs released by developers.
BULLET::::2. 'Campaign Server': Content can be allowed on the campaign server (the server which users can connect to in-game to download more content).
BULLET::::3. 'Disallowed': Finally, content can be disallowed on the campaign server, which means that the creator could only distribute it using their own channels (for instance, having a web site people could download it from).

</ol>
Content only makes it to (1) if the developers happen to like it very much. We don't have any firm rules as to what is allowed and disallowed, and a campaign that has short-comings from the developer's point of view might still be allowed if it is exceptional in other areas. As an example of this, the campaign 'Under the Burning Suns' contained explicit references to religion. To avoid controversy, we wanted to avoid references to religion in Wesnoth. However, recognizing the exceptional quality of the campaign, we decided to accept it into the official version of Wesnoth in spite of this one aspect we didn't like.

Artwork containing nudity has also been a controversial point in the past, as has violence (particularly explicit depiction of blood). We generally take the point of view that we will review each item as it comes, rather than making blanket rules.

With regard to whether we allow things onto the campaign server, (2), our general policy is that to be allowed onto the campaign server, the content need only be licensed under the . However, we reserve the right to remove content that we consider to be distasteful in any way. Fortunately, our content submitters are generally very reasonable, and we haven't had to exercise this right.

Our aim is to keep Wesnoth appropriate for users of any age and background &amp;mdash; of course, it contains some level of violence, but this is not depicted very explicitly, and only parents who do not want to expose their children to animated violence of any level need be concerned. For this reason, we also do not allow expletives on our forums or IRC channels.

♡❤♡How do you feel about games like "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecond%20Life"&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ", where players trade user-generated content for money?♡❤♡

I've never understood the appeal of games like that. I don't enjoy cheating in games, and to me buying items with real money seems like cheating &amp;mdash; except worse, since it actually costs money.

♡❤♡What changes to the game or gameplay do you anticipate in the coming months and years?♡❤♡

Well, we've avoided making many gameplay changes at all, since very early on in Wesnoth's development. Wesnoth is meant to be a simple game, with simple gameplay, and 'changing' gameplay will probably lead to it being more complex. We want to keep it simple.

Changes will probably focus on improving existing features, and making the engine a little more customizable. Enhancing the multiplayer component is big on the list &amp;mdash; we've progressively added more and more features on the server. We also want to add more graphical enhancement. For instance, a particle system to allow various combat effects.

♡❤♡If you had unlimited resources at your disposal to improve the game, what would you change about it?♡❤♡

Wesnoth was always designed to be a simple game, with simple goals. It has exceeded all the expectations I originally had for it. There is still some 'polishing' work going on, but really I don't think there is too much I would dramatically change.

Probably the largest thing I can name is a much better AI than we currently have. I'm pretty happy with the AI developed for Wesnoth &amp;mdash; I think it's much better than AIs for most commercial games &amp;mdash; but it could be better. That's the only area of Wesnoth that I think could really be very dramatically improved.

I am pretty happy with our in-game graphics. Some people compare our graphics to modern commercial games, and think our graphics are laughably poor. We often get comments that our graphics are around the same quality as those seen in SNES or Genesis games, or PC games from a decade ago. (These people should try playing a strategy game on the SNES/Genesis/PC from this long ago; Wesnoth's graphics are much better).

I am very happy with our graphics overall. I think our artists have done an excellent job of making the game look attractive without detracting from functionality. Adding 3D graphics, or changing the style of the 2D graphics would only be wasted effort in my mind &amp;mdash; I think we've achieved a great balance of making the game easy and clear, while making it look good.

With unlimited resources, I would like some more storyline/cutscene images, and a nice new title screen, but these are relatively small concerns I think.

There are some enhancements to multiplayer I would like added &amp;mdash; multiplayer campaigns is a long-time feature request. As are more options and features on the multiplayer server.

Overall though, if I had 'unlimited resources', I'd much rather develop an entirely new game. We don't have enough good Open Source games &amp;mdash; it's a waste to pour all the resources we have into one. :) 

♡❤♡Wesnoth has dwarves with guns, ♡❤World of Warcraft♡❤ has gnomes and goblins with explosives and flying machines &amp;mdash; where do you, personally, define the limits of the fantasy genre? Are there scenarios playing in a steampunk world, or ones with modern technology? Would you allow those?♡❤♡

Actually we have Dwarves with 'Thundersticks' :) &amp;mdash; mysterious weapons that make a loud sound and do lots of damage, but are clumsy and unreliable. The developers do not comment on whether or not these 'thundersticks' are or are not like 'guns' on earth. We like to keep Wesnoth slightly mysterious, and leave some things up to the player's interpretation, rather than spell it out.

We once used to have dragoons with pistols, and other weapons like that, but we made a very intentional decision to remove them.

I don't like categorizing things into 'genres'. Many people debate whether Wesnoth is an 'RPG', or 'strategy game', etc. I think the debate of what genre something is in is largely irrelevant.

We do have a vision for what the world of Wesnoth is like though &amp;mdash; and Wesnoth is a world of ancient-era weaponry, with a little magic. Of Elves and Dwarves and Orcs. Very much inspired by Tolkien. I actually originally chose this setting because my focus was on technical excellence &amp;mdash; writing a good, solid engine &amp;mdash; not on creating a new fantasy world. I decided to stick with a very well-known, proven theme, figuring I couldn't go wrong with it.

We probably wouldn't allow anything that departs dramatically from the world we've made into the official version of the game, but we'd be happy to have it on our campaign server. The main attempt at a 'total modification' of Wesnoth is a project known as Spacenoth, which has a sci-fi/futuristic theme.

At this time though, there is no release of this project. I hope they do well though.

♡❤♡How do you feel about turn-based games like "Heroes of Might and Magic" with their massive army-building and resource management? Do you think there's going to be an open source equivalent of this type of game soon?♡❤♡

I haven't played Heroes of Might and Magic very much. The few times I have played it, I thought it was boring to be honest. I don't like the type of game where one marches armies around a 'large map' and then must 'zoom in' to a different 'battle field' every time a battle takes place. I find games like that to take far too long, and tend to become tedious.

I would prefer a civilization or perhaps colonization type game. FreeCiv is nice, though it's close to being a clone of Civilization II. I'd like an original game that had the same sort of theme as civilization, but with new and innovative rules.

♡❤♡Every online game and community is also a social space. Have you met interesting people through Wesnoth whom you would not have met otherwise? Are there other stories you can tell from the community &amp;mdash; have there been real world meetups, chat rooms, etc.?♡❤♡

I've come into contact with lots of very interesting people through Wesnoth, and have learned a great deal from them. The Wesnoth developers &amp;mdash; many of whom are from Europe &amp;mdash; used the LSM conference in France in 2004 as an opportunity to meet each other. Nekeme, an organization dedicated to developing and promotion Free games was kind enough to sponsor two developers to go. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend, but the developers who did had a very nice time.

We have several IRC channels on irc.freenode.net, and the most popular ones &amp;mdash; #wesnoth and #wesnoth-dev are usually fairly busy with both discussion about Wesnoth, and friendly discussion of other topics.

Also, the developers have tried to make a habit of playing "co-operative multiplayer" games against the AI. During these games, we use the in-game chat facility to get to know each other better, and discuss improvements to the game.

♡❤♡Are there other open source games that have personally impressed you, or that you enjoy playing?♡❤♡

I'm afraid I haven't played many. I like RPGs, and I know lots of people love &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANetHack"&gt;NetHack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and similar games, but I much prefer party-based and generally more storyline-oriented RPGs.

FreeCiv is pretty well-done, though I am happy to play commercial games, and so I think Civilization 3 and Civilization 4 are both technically superior in virtually every regard. I think that's an inevitable problem when you make an Open Source game a straight clone of a commercial game.

Probably the most promising Open Source game I've seen is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGalaxyMage"&gt;GalaxyMage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but it still has a long way to go.

Honestly, I don't play that many games. I like playing commercial RPGs, usually console-based, with my wife, and I occasionally like playing the commercial &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACivilization%20%28computer%20game%29"&gt;Civilization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; series. To play an Open Source game, it'd have to be very good, and appeal to my tastes, and I haven't found any Open Source games like that, sadly.

A vacation bench of the &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; Supreme Court comprising Justices Arijit Pasayat and L.S Panta issued a notice to the Central Government questioning the basis for the government's decision to reserve 27% of the seats in universities for members of the &lt;a href="w%3AOther%20Backward%20Class"&gt;Other Backward Class&lt;/a&gt; group of &lt;a href="w%3Acaste"&gt;castes&lt;/a&gt;. The notice also asked the government to explain how this move would be implemented without depriving meritorious students from the "forward" castes their fair chance at securing seats. The court also wanted the Centre to explain the basis on which castes would be classified as "backward" or "forward".

The government has been granted eight weeks time by the Bench to file an affidavit in regard to this notice. The apex court also said that it would examine the effects of this policy, which, the petitioner said, would divide the country on the basis of caste thereby threatening India's integrity. The Bench said that the questions posed to it had serious social and political significance and would hence be dealt with appropriately. The two petitions were filed by Shiv Khera and advocate Ashok Kumar Thakur. Additional Solicitor General Gopal Subramianam, who was representing the respondents, accepted the notice and appreciated the Court's view that striking medical students should return to work in the interest of the patients.

The medical students welcomed this move and have decided to start running parallel outpatient clinics from tomorrow onwards. They have however clarified that their movement will continue despite the government's assurances that the number of seats in institutes will be increased. The main opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3ABharatiya%20janata%20Party"&gt;BJP&lt;/a&gt; has said that it supports the reservation policy, but that financially disadvantaged students from the "forward" castes should also be given consideration.

A fan that set up his own company and bought the rights of his favourite sitcom has today released the DVD.

Craig Robins, 41, was so frustrated that ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJoking%20Apart"&gt;Joking Apart&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, originally shown on BBC Two in 1993, had not been released that he secured the rights from the BBC and did it himself. As a video technician, he was able to produce the DVD, and has established a label to sell the product.

He is thought to be the first individual to have achieved such a feat.

♡❤Joking Apart♡❤ was written by &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Moffat"&gt;Steven Moffat&lt;/a&gt;, best known for writing Coupling and some episodes of the new ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADoctor%20Who"&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤ It is based upon the collapse of Moffat’s first marriage.

The show stars &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Bathurst"&gt;Robert Bathurst&lt;/a&gt;, who played David in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACold%20Feet"&gt;Cold Feet&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and &lt;a href="w%3AFiona%20Gillies"&gt;Fiona Gillies&lt;/a&gt;, who appeared in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APeak%20Practice"&gt;Peak Practice&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The cast members say that people who remember the show often approach them. Bathurst, Gillies, Moffat and co-star Tracie Bennett recorded interviews and a commentary for the disc in central London in January.

The disc, available from today, is being distributed via Robins’ website. He hopes to release further forgotten classics.

Moffat says: "I would be absolutely delighted if this was a success."

A roadside bomb in the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; has killed four people, including two journalists working for television network &lt;a href="CBS%20News"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt;. The two journalists, cameraman Paul Douglas and soundman James Brolan, both &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;, were embedded with the &lt;a href="US"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; 4th Infantry Division and were on a routine patrol when a nearby car packed with explosives was detonated. A U.S. army officer and an Iraqi interpreter were also killed. CBS correspondent Kimberly Dozier, who the journalists were working with, was seriously injured and was flown to an U.S. military hospital to receive surgery.

With the addition of these two journalists, Iraq is now "the deadliest war for reporters in the past century", according to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEditor%20and%20Publisher"&gt;Editor and Publisher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the total coming to seventy-one. This compares to sixty-nine reporters killed during &lt;a href="World%20War%20Two"&gt;World War Two&lt;/a&gt;, and sixty-three in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20war"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

CBS President Sean McManus said it was "a devastating loss".

The highest ranking member of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal Party of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has said he would not support a joining together of the &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; Liberal and &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt; parties. 

The Prime Minister said, pointedly: "There is one thing that I will fight for to my last political breath, is to preserve the nationwide unity of the Liberal Party of Australia. I don’t want any arrangement that in any way disturbs that". Mr Howard's statements come after the Queensland branches of both parties held separate meetings where the proposal to amalgamate them was supported in-principle.

In an interview with ABC Radio yesterday, Mr Howard said there had only been an agreement made to discuss whether a merger of the two parties should occur and that nothing was concrete at this stage. Mr Howard warned that the proposal would need to be discussed with both parties at a federal level and that the state's decision would not be able to be made in isolation.

The Australian leader said that as the leader of the Liberal party he would not support any move that would dilute the party's identity. "Now speaking for myself as leader of the Liberal Party throughout the country, I am totally opposed to anything that would alter the existing identity of the Liberal Party," he said.

"I am opposed to any new name for the Liberal Party in Queensland, I don’t want New Liberals, or Old Liberals, I just want the Liberal Party of Australia operating throughout the country" Mr Howard told ABC Radio.

Mr Howard said that he believes the &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20%28Australia%29"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt; between the Liberal and National parties had served him well over the past ten years and that he supports a close relationship between the two parties.

The Prime Minister hinted that the only merger he would support would be one in which the Liberal party takes over the National party. He said he would not support a new conservative party in the state.

While quick to say that he was not wishing for National party members to quit the national party and join the Liberals, it was noted Mr Howard did not say he was opposed to the idea.

In the statesman's view the Queensland Liberals are part of a nation-wide party, and Mr Howard vowed to fight any proposal that would split them from the rest of the country. 

Australia's highest ranked National party member, Deputy Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Vaile"&gt;Mark Vaile&lt;/a&gt; has said that he sees little need for change. He told ABC Radio that he believes the coalition have a "winning formula" federally. Mr Vaile also said he had concerns about how the proposal could affect the coalition at the federal level.

Mr Vaile said that the decision to merge would be left to the National party's Queensland members. He said that the national party operates differently to other parties in that it is based at a divisional level within each state and then forms together federally. Essentially, each state branch can operate differently from others so long as it fits into the federal system.

New Zealand Post is set to new bring in four digit postal codes for New Zealand, at a cost of $80 million (&lt;a href="w%3ANZD"&gt;NZD&lt;/a&gt;).

The New Zealand Herald reported that a new &lt;a href="w%3Apostal%20code"&gt;postal code&lt;/a&gt; system will be revealed Wednesday, May 31.

There will be 1800 different zones and an automatic mail sorter will sort the mail into 10,000 different mailboxes within the new zones.

On Thursday everyone will get a sheet in their mailbox explaining the changes.

New Zealand Post communications spokesman Richard MacLean said that hundreds of jobs will be lost, mainly in provincial areas such as Tauranga, Taupo and New Plymouth.

An &lt;a href="earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; measuring &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 6.3 struck &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYogyakarta"&gt;Yogyakarta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJawa%20Tengah"&gt;Central Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; early on Saturday morning, killing at least 5,427 people, and injuring thousands more. Severe damage has been reported in the city of Yogyakarta, with over three thousand buildings having collapsed and electricity and communications links broken. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (USGS) reports that the quake struck at 5:54 a.m. local time (2254 UTC Friday) and the epicentre was offshore, approximately 25 km (15 miles) southwest of the city.

Nearby &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Merapi"&gt;Mount Merapi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which has seen increased activity in recent weeks, had emitted a large cloud of purple smoke and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Avolcanic%20ash"&gt;ash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shortly before the earthquake, and vulcanologists have confirmed that the earthquake has increased the volcano's activity. Indonesia lies on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ring%20of%20Fire"&gt;Pacific Ring of Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a zone containing the boundaries of tectonic plate that encircles the basin of the Pacific Ocean, and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

Hospital efforts were being hampered by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aaftershock"&gt;aftershocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which the USGS have measured as being up to 4.8 in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMoment%20magnitude%20scale"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and currently by a lack of doctors, beds, and medical supplies. The Indonesian Transport Minister Hatta Radjasa has said that the earthquake has damaged the Yogyakarta &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aairport"&gt;airport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Arunway"&gt;runway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , closing it to air traffic until at least Sunday.

Many countries have offered aid to the devastated region, with the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; offering three million pounds ($5,600,000 U.S), &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; offering three million Australian dollars ($2,270,000 U.S) &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; offering two million U.S dollars, and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUNICEF"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; offering further immediate aid. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Red Crescent, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOXFAM"&gt;OXFAM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as well as UNICEF have been providing tents and emergency supplies to the victims.

Many residents spent the night outdoors, either afraid to return for fear of more aftershocks, or because they had lost their homes. In the Bantul district, up to 80% of houses were destroyed, leaving an estimated 150,000 homeless. The Indonesian President, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , visited the disaster area and has called in the army to assist in rescue efforts.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Nearly a million commuters were immobilized and some businesses closed as &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Transit%20Commission"&gt;Toronto Transit Commission&lt;/a&gt; workers walked off the job yesterday and formed &lt;a href="w%3Apicket%20line"&gt;picket line&lt;/a&gt;s outside subway stations, bus terminals and other TTC facilities. None of their buses, streetcars or subway trains were operational.

Some service in the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Toronto%20Area"&gt;Greater Toronto Area&lt;/a&gt; continued through other transit services, but was of limited use without a link to downtown Toronto.

TTC workers said they'd been locked out, but Toronto Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Miller"&gt;David Miller&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Hydro%20v.%20Ontario%20%28Labour%20Relations%20Board%29"&gt;Ontario Labour Relations Board&lt;/a&gt; ruled yesterday afternoon that the walkout was illegal and ordered employees back to work. They complied with this order. They had not complied with a cease-and-desist order issued that morning.

Service resumed sporadically during the evening (after &lt;a href="w%3Arush%20hour"&gt;rush hour&lt;/a&gt;) and is expected to continue as normal today.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; saw the worst violence on Monday since the fall of the &lt;a href="Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;, after a large &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Military cargo truck crashed into about a dozen vehicles at an intersection in Kabul killing at least 7 civilians and injuring about 40. "There was a traffic jam and all the vehicles were stopped," said one witness, 21-year old shopkeeper Mohammad Wali. "The American convoy hit all the vehicles which were on the way. They didn't care about the civilians at all." 

A U.S. military spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Fitzpatrick, said no U.S. troops had been hurt, and that an investigation has begun into the incident. 

The U.S. military also said the crash was caused by brake failure but Afghans often complain about aggressive driving tactics of the U.S. military. Convoys often pass through crowded areas at high speed and occasionally disregard road rules. U.S. military says such driving is necessary to protect the troops from attack. 

Afghan rioters also claimed U.S. troops had shot and killed civilians at the scene of the accident. 

Chanting "Death to America," rioters stoned the U.S. convoy involved in the accident Monday before heading to the center of Kabul where they ransacked offices of international aid groups and searched for foreigners. Smoke billowed from burning buildings along the path of destruction.

<h1>Dutch pedophiles set to go political</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Dutch%20pedophiles%20set%20to%20go%20political&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A group of &lt;a href="w%3APedophilia"&gt;pedophiles&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; will make a political party tomorrow, May 31. The party titled ♡❤Naastenliefde, Vrijheid en Diversiteit (NVD)♡❤ - Neighbourly Love, Freedom and Diversity - is set to enter the &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATweede%20Kamer"&gt;Tweede Kamer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (Lower House) elections, though they are not expected to gain any seats.

Controversially, the party - or NVD - wants to abolish the legal minimum age for youth sexual contact with other youth, lower the legal minimum age for sexual contact with adults to 12, then eventually abolish age restrictions altogether. The members think, contrary to established law protecting minors from sexual abuse, legalising voluntary sex at a young age will diminish the risk of excesses. 

Ad van den Berg, one of the pedophile party's founders, says: "Forbidding it will only feed the curiosity of children. (...) Raising children also means letting them get acquainted with sex." The minimum ages for youth-youth sex and youth-adult sex in the Netherlands currently stands at 16 and 18 respectively. 

The NVD also wants to decriminalise much of the porn industry with plans to legalize the possession of &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20pornography"&gt;child pornography&lt;/a&gt;. They want to lower the minimum age for participation in a &lt;a href="w%3APornography"&gt;pornography&lt;/a&gt; production; this currently stands at 18, but the group wants the age to be lowered to 12. The child sex advocates from the NVP say any child who is sexually active at age 12 could voluntarily act in a porn movie. 

The party also wants to establish a child pornography "hallmark", which would somehow ensure involvement of minors in a specific production was voluntary. 

&lt;a href="w%3AIreen%20van%20Engelen"&gt;Ireen van Engelen&lt;/a&gt; exposes the underlying motives of the small but radical group of pedophile campaigners: "They make it appear as if they wish for more rights for children, but their stance that children from age 12 up should be allowed to enter into sexual contacts of course only serves their own interest."

&lt;a href="w%3APolitical%20science"&gt;Political scientist&lt;/a&gt; Joop van Holsteyn thinks the establishment of the NVD to decriminalise acts most people find abhorrent is a Trojan horse to insert the subject into an otherwise unwilling &lt;a href="w%3APolitical%20debate"&gt;political debate&lt;/a&gt;. "What is ethically sound is not laid down in the law: it is an element of the political struggle. If it gains publicity, they already have attained their goal, but they will find more opponents than proponents."

The Indian government has begun to send humanitarian aid to the earthquake hit Yogyakarta region of &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. The relief effort, named Operation ♡❤Marham♡❤ involves the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Indian Air Force&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Navy"&gt;Indian Navy&lt;/a&gt; and aims to deliver aid materials to the victims.

Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3APranab%20Mukherjee"&gt;Pranab Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; was away on an official visit to China and Japan - a result of which the Indian response was initially delayed. Mr. Mukherjee, however, on Sunday night asked the Defence Ministry to make preparations to dispatch aid to Indonesia immediately. 
On the sea, the naval vessel ♡❤INS Rajput♡❤ has been redeployed from the South China Sea to &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;. It is expected to reach the Indonesian capital with 7 tons of relief material today. The ♡❤INS Tabar♡❤ will leave the port of &lt;a href="w%3AChennai"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt;, India, today carrying additional aid. 

In the air, an I.A.F cargo plane carrying 35 tons of relief material has been sent to Indonesia. Another airforce plane, an IL-76, will fly out from India today carrying a similar quantity of relief material. 

Among the supplies India is sending to the victims of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Java%20earthquake"&gt;Indonesian earthquake&lt;/a&gt; are tents, medical equipment and rice. Military doctors may also be sent to aid the casualties.

The Indian President &lt;a href="w%3AAPJ%20Abdul%20Kalam"&gt;Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam&lt;/a&gt; and Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Dr. Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt; conveyed their condolences to the Indonesian President &lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20East%20Timor"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AXanana%20Gusm%C3%A3o"&gt;Xanana Gusmão&lt;/a&gt; has taken special security powers in a bid to quell the violence raging in &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;. The period of emergency rule, which would last 30 days, was imposed to "prevent violence and avoid further fatalities" and lead to "rapid reestablishment of public order."

Gusmão, a popular former guerilla leader, will take sole control of the army and police and also the management of the 1,300 strong &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n-led peacekeeping force on the troubled island. 

At least 27 people have been killed, criminal documents reported stolen, and looting widespread in the East Timorese capital, &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt; during the present period of unrest.

The Australian military commander in East Timor, Brigadier Michael Slater has called the mobs "gutless thugs."

The decision to give emergency powers to President Gusmão was taken in "close collaboration" with &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20East%20Timor"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMari%20Alkatiri"&gt;Mari Alkatiri&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Alkatiri was unable to stop the rioting that followed the government's decision in March to lay-off 600 soldiers when they refused to work, complaining of discrimination.

As the disorder grew during April and May, East Timor appealed for international assistance. Justice Minister Domingos Sarmento said that &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; had offered to provide East Timor with 120 security personnel by the weekend.

<h1>Bomb blasts near Greek Minister's house</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bomb%20blasts%20near%20Greek%20Minister%27s%20house&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A bomb exploded near the house of the &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; Culture Minister,Georgios Voulgarakis, in Lycabettus Hill, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, wrecking a number of cars.

The device, which the police said consisted of 2-3 kg (4-7lb) of dynamite, had been placed on a bike left between two cars.

The explosion at 7:42am (GMT +2), close to the home of &lt;a href="w%3AGiorgos%20Voulgarakis"&gt;Minister Voulgarakis&lt;/a&gt;, is the second time the former Minister for Public Order has been the target of a bomb attack.

While the perpertrators are not yet known, Giorgos Voulgarakis, who had been receiving death threats, is unpopular with leftist parties over questions of immigration.
A trained dog of a Greek anti-terrorist unit had been sniffing around the area of the Minister’s home each morning. The September 2003 attack nearly burned down his house.

Two primary schools and a kindergarten nearby were slightly damaged but there were no reported injuries. 

As bomb technicians searched the school grounds, frantic parents rushed to take their children home.

The leftist "Epanastatikos Laekos Agonas"(Revolutionary popular rally), is the group which some Greek media have accused for today's bomb attack. No official claim of responsibility has yet been made and the police investigation continues.

All the Greek parties, including the major opposition party, &lt;a href="w%3APASOK"&gt;PASOK&lt;/a&gt;; the Communist Party (KKE), Synaspismos and LAOS parties, have strongly condemned the terrorist attack.

<h1>Iraq to investigate alleged massacre in Haditha</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iraq%20to%20investigate%20alleged%20massacre%20in%20Haditha&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i government is to launch a formal investigation into &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHaditha%20massacre"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Marines murdered civilians in the Iraqi town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHaditha"&gt;Haditha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in November 2005.

In an interview with the &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, the Iraqi Prime Minister &lt;a href="Nouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt; said: "It is not justifiable that a family is killed because someone is fighting terrorists." and speaking to the &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; news agency, said "We will hold those who did it responsible."

Following the announcement, on Tuesday, May 30, the White House spokesman Tony Snow said they would make the details of the US investigation into the incident public.

Initial reports from the Pentagon stated the gun battle that ended in 15 civilian casualties, as well as 8 terrorist deaths, was a fight with militants. 
Eyewitness reports claim that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marine%20Corps"&gt;US Marines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; went house to house gunning down innocent men, women, and children without cause or provocation. The Wall Street Journal reports that there is evidence to support these claims.

Lance Corporal Roel Ryan Briones of Hanford, California, who was in Haditha on that day, told the Los Angeles Times, "They ranged from little babies to adult males and females. I'll never be able to get that out of my head. I can still smell the blood."

While some politicians sounded a note of caution that not all facts are yet known for conclusions to be drawn, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Murtha"&gt;John Murtha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Congressman&lt;/a&gt;, said in an interview with CNN "It is as bad as Abu Ghraib, if not worse." 

The United States President, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is said to have learned of the Haditha incident from a journalist earlier this year and has already had a briefing on it from his national security advisor, Stephen Hadley.

<h1>Third GayFest begins in Bucharest</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Third%20GayFest%20begins%20in%20Bucharest&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The third edition of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest's&lt;/a&gt; gay pride festival, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGayFest"&gt;GayFest&lt;/a&gt;, opened yesterday, May 30. The festival, which will last until June 4, consists of a series of LGBT cultural events, including film screenings, theatre and photographic exhibitions, as well as public debates about LGBT issues, and a gay pride parade on June 3, expected to attract hundreds of people. GayFest is organised by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AACCEPT"&gt;ACCEPT&lt;/a&gt;, Romania's largest &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALGBT"&gt;LGBT&lt;/a&gt; organisation, and supported by the Romanian Government and Ministry of Health, as well as various private organisations.

The main theme of the third GayFest is the legalisation of same-sex &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Acivil%20unions"&gt;civil unions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Asame-sex%20marriage%20in%20Romania"&gt;marriages in Romania&lt;/a&gt;. Florin Buhuceanu, the executive manager of ACCEPT, said that, "The time has come for Romania to acknowledge the rights of all its citizens. Guaranteeing the equality of rights through the recognition of gay marriage... is just a step forward." He added that, "The [GayFest] activities mark the most focused drive yet to change opinions on gay marriage in Romania." Same-sex couples currently have no legal recognition in Romania. Legalisation of either civil unions or marriage between people of the same sex would be possible through an amendment of the Family Code, if approved by a majority in parliament.

Last year's GayFest, which included the country's first gay pride parade, attracted a significant amount of controversy from right-wing groups, as well as the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARomanian%20Orthodox%20Church"&gt;Romanian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;. It was initially not given authorisation from the Bucharest City Hall, which claimed that it could not guarantee its security. Approval was, however, later given due to pressure from the Romanian President, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATraian%20B%C4%83sescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt; and the Justice Minister, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMonica%20Macovei"&gt;Monica Macovei&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom support LGBT rights. 

Unlike recent gay pride parades in Poland and Moscow, which ended in violence and were actively opposed by government officials, this year's Bucharest GayFest parade was authorised by the City Hall without controversy, even though the Romanian Orthodox Church is once again expected to protest its organisation. In the past few years, Romania has significantly changed its gay rights record, introducing an anti-discrimination law in 2000 that includes sexual orientation, and repealing its last anti-gay law, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArticle%20200"&gt;Article 200&lt;/a&gt; of the Penal Code, in 2001.

Legislation pending in the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Parliament"&gt;French Parliament&lt;/a&gt; would require that music purchased online for use on digital music players be compatible across all players. It has become popularly known in France as the "&lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; bill," after the popular music player made by &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt;, and could pit France against Apple and other distributors of online music. 

The National Assembly (lower house) and Senate (upper house) have passed two separate versions of the legislation. Both would reduce the penalties for piracy, require software companies to provide details on how their programs work, and create an agency that would have jurisdiction over digital copyright issues, including how often music can be legally copied by a customer for personal use and ensuring compatibility across devices.

Unlike the Assembly version, the Senate version does not contain provisions that would require manufacturers such as Apple and Sony to open all music sold on their platforms to work on players other than their own. Currently, the stores for Apple and Sony sell music only for use on their own players. Critics of the changes say that the Senate's changes would defeat the purpose of the bill. 

The two versions must now be reconciled in conference committee, a process that could take months.

Speaking in support of the bill, Assembly member Christian Paul said, "We oppose the idea that the seller of a song or any kind of work can impose on the consumer the way to read it, forever, and especially in the consumer's home. Can we allow a couple of vendors to establish monopolies tightly controlling their clients and excluding competition?"

Christian Vanneste, the National Assembly sponsor of the iPod bill, said, "In France, there are two distinct mentalities. On one side is the backwards left, which is anti-American, and on the other is the right, which thinks that the U.S.A. shouldn't be the only one with good ideas, and who want to compete with them."

After the National Assembly's vote in March, Apple denounced the measure as "state-sponsored piracy." They refused to comment on the legislation after the Senate's vote on May 10.

Francisco Mingorance, European policy director for the &lt;a href="w%3ABusiness%20Software%20Alliance"&gt;Business Software Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, said that the Assembly's proposal is "about ripping off technology from those who developed it and putting it in the public domain." The Business Software Alliance represents Apple, Dell, Microsoft Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and other major computer hardware and software companies.

The Yangtze River, the third longest river in the world, is polluted. It supplies water to 186 cities. The river takes 40% of China’s waste, 80% of which is untreated. It is the only source of drinking water to Shanghai, a city with 20 million people.

“Many officials think the pollution is nothing for the Yangtze, but the pollution is actually very serious,” said Yuan Aiguo, a professor with the China University of Geosciences.

In China 300 million people do not have access to drinkable water. Clean up campaigns have made limited progress because of inconsistent law enforcement. 

The Yangtze is part of a plan to move 45 billion litres of water by 2050 to the north via canals. Environmentalists fear the water may not be safe to drink.

The pollution has caused a fall in the biodiversity of the Yangtze. Animal species have fallen from 126 in the mid 80s to 52 in 2002.

High Court proceedings have commenced with every Australian state challenging the legality of the Howard Government's radical new industrial relations workplace reforms.

Acting Employment Protection Minister John Kobelke said the new laws reduced the pay, employment conditions and job security of many Western Australian workers and their families.

The minister said the proceedings challenged the validity of John Howard’s Work Choices legislation that came into effect on March 27, this year.

All the state governments have objected to the legislation on the basis that it is unconstitutional and New South Wales led the combined states’ legal challenge.

Mr Kobelke said it would remain to be seen whether the Howard government has the right to overrule established constitutional practise by its reliance on the corporations power to underpin its Work Choices legislation.

The corporations power of the Constitution enables the Commonwealth to regulate foreign, trading or financial corporations but the Acting Minister disputed the corporations power gave the Commonwealth ‘a blank cheque’ over industrial relations.

John Kobelke said, ‘contrary to assertions from Canberra, the scope of the corporations power has yet to be judicially settled.’

"No other Federal Government has attempted to do what the Howard Government has done with the corporation's power,’ the minister also said.

Mr Kobelke said he believes the High Court challenge will be one of the most significant constitutional cases in modern history and that the Carpenter government opposes the potential ill-effects of the legislation on workers and their families.

"The laws threaten the very essence of federalism and if the Howard Government has its way, the corporations power will be used to sideline the States."

The High Court proceedings concluded yesterday, with a decision not expected until next year.

A Western Australian teachers’ website has come under fire by the Education and Training minister for publishing racist comments.
&lt;a href="w%3AEducation%20and%20Training%20Minister"&gt;Education and Training Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALjiljanna%20Ravlich"&gt;Ljiljanna Ravlich&lt;/a&gt;, today expressed concern about racist, abusive and offensive comments appearing on the anti-outcomes based education website PLATO.

Minister Ravlich said she was disgusted by some of the highly offensive comments made by members belonging to the group, &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20Lobbying%20Against%20Teaching%20Outcomes"&gt;People Lobbying Against Teaching Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;.

'Some of the comments are obscene and, quite frankly, I worry that these people might be teaching our children,' she said.

PLATO has since confirmed a teacher who is employed in the non-government education sector in Western Australia made the abusive comments.

The PLATO website was established to express dissent about the controversial Outcome Based Education system after Minister Ravlich insisted it continue to be used despite claims it was ineffective.

Last month the ongoing controversy even prompted a response from Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AHoward"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; who criticized the OBE method of teaching school children used in WA, describing it as '&lt;a href="w%3Agobbledegook"&gt;gobbledegook&lt;/a&gt;' and that it could be 'dumbing down' the high school English syllabus.

One member from the school teachers’ forum named, 'Fed up teacher,' launched a vicious and racist verbal attack on a member who posted a comment supporting the OBE system.

When the member objected to being labelled a '&lt;a href="w%3Anazi"&gt;nazi&lt;/a&gt;' and the use of the term because her parents had suffered under the nazi regime, her response drew a further personal attack.

The posting by Fed up teacher said, 'the nazis had the right idea, it is a pity they didn't get to your parents before you were conceived, you really are a pathetic piece of trash that somehow escaped the final solution.'

Minister Ravlich condemned the attacks as disgusting and said it was just one of many offensive postings appearing on the website.

'The website is littered with insults, foul language and abusive and racist comments,' said Ms Ravlich.

The minister said PLATO has only about sixty members and as such was not broadly representative of the 'thousands of dedicated and professional teachers in Western Australian schools.

A raid involving 50 members of the &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; National Criminal Police has taken the servers of and (the Pirate Bureau) &amp;mdash; a Swedish lobby organisation that originally developed The Pirate Bay &amp;mdash; into custody. The search warrant was given on grounds of alleged copyright violation and assisting copyright violation. This move comes as a bit of a surprise, as the legality of the site has been under public debate for over three years, with the operators frequently issuing public press releases. 

♡❤WiredFire♡❤, in an interview with Rickard Falkvinge, head of the Swedish , is reporting that police arrested three staff members, ultimately taking only two into custody. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, however, is reporting that Ulf Goranzon, a police spokesman, is claiming that none were arrested, they were just under suspicion of violating copyright law.

The site operators speculate that the police wish to test the legality of the operation. Purportedly, this move comes due to political pressure exerted by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; media corporations. Swedish public broadcaster has backed this claim. Rickard Falkvinge has stated that the (Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau) has admitted to being behind the police action, and he suspects the IFPI is also involved. Tobias Andersson, of Piratbyrån agrees, claiming that The Antipiratbyrån "has clearly misled the police" and "has fooled the police into shutting down its antagonists, the Piratbyrån. The Antipiratbyrån previously gained notoriety by paying an infiltrator to plant copyrighted material on the Swedish &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Service%20Provider"&gt;ISP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABahnhof"&gt;Bahnhof&lt;/a&gt;'s servers.

Dan Glickman, CEO of the &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (MPAA), has applauded the move, citing it as a reminder that "there are no safe harbors for copyright thieves". Kori Bernards, an MPAA representative, claimed The Pirate Bay to be "one of our No. 1 targets." The MPAA allege that The Pirate Bay made available over 150 thousand files, including summer blockbusters such as "&lt;a href="w%3AMission%3A%20Impossible%20III"&gt;Mission: Impossible III&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="w%3AX-Men%203"&gt;X-Men 3&lt;/a&gt;". 

However, The Pirate Bay claimed that as they only host &lt;a href="w%3A.torrent"&gt;.torrent&lt;/a&gt; files and not copyrighted material, they are not in contravention of copyright laws. The Pirate Bay also served as a distribution point for freely licensed material such as some &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; distributions and independent music and film.

The Pirate Bay claims to be the world's largest tracker.

In the raid, the police also took several private servers unconnected to The Pirate Bay. Some have claimed that there is no legal basis for these seizures.

Initially, there were also rumors that this could be another stunt by The Pirate Bay to promote awareness. This possibility, however, has been already dismissed and only had some credibility given the fact that approximately one year ago today they claimed something similar like this, but instead were simply updating their servers. At current there are already some publications made available by officials confirming the authenticity of the raid.

On June the 1st &lt;a href="http%3A//www.thepiratebay.org"&gt;The Pirate Bay site&lt;/a&gt; changed its "Site down" note to "Site down - will be up and fully functional within a day or two".

Gottfrid Svartholm, owner of webhotel &lt;a href="w%3APRQ"&gt;PRQ&lt;/a&gt; said "I was arrested for interrogation, and they begun to ask question about Pirate Bay, what I knew and what connections I had to it. I got no public defender, and my regular legal representative was also under arrest, so I said nothing at all". According to Mr. Svartholm, the police told him that they were not obligated to provide a public defender, as the crime he was accused of doesn't lead to jail sentence if he is found guilty. 

The day after the raid, Mr. Svartholm is trying to limit the damage for PRQ's other customers that also had their servers confiscated, even if they didn't have any connections to The Pirate Bay.

Between 3,000 (police estimate) and 8,000 people (organiser's estimate) took to the streets in &lt;a href="w%3AGie%C3%9Fen"&gt;Gießen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; today, protesting the planned introduction of tuition fees at &lt;a href="w%3AHesse"&gt;Hessian&lt;/a&gt; universities.

Beginning at 1pm CEST (1100 UTC) students, pupils and ordinary citizens marched through much of downtown Gießen, accompanied by a massive police presence, in the largest demonstration the city has seen in years.

They occupied the office of the &lt;a href="w%3ARegierungsbezirk"&gt;Regierungsbezirk&lt;/a&gt; and the city office. 

From 4 to 7pm, at least 200 people also blocked the Berliner Platz, the most important inner city crossing, bringing most of the downtown bus and car traffic to a standstill. The crowd dispersed after the police threatend several times to clear the crossing by force.

Students unions from all parts of Hesse called for the joint demonstration in Gießen.

In July, the Hessian state legislature is due to pass a bill that would require all undergraduate students to pay a tuition fee of 500&lt;a href="w%3A%E2%82%AC"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt; per semester; graduate students could be charged up to 1,500€.

Terrorists in Kashmir threw a grenade at a tourist bus in the heart of Srinagar, killing one person and injuring 21 others. Eyewitnesses say that the vehicle, in which were travelling tourists from West Bengal was attacked near the Dal Gate. The injured are being treated at the Kashmir Institute for Medical Sciences. 

No terrorist outfit has yet claimed responsibility for this attack, which is the fourth incident this week. This is also the second time tourists were the targets. The number of militant attacks this month has increased after Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh decided to hold a round table conference with the moderate parties in Kashmir. 

State Tourism Director Farooq Ahmed Shah condemned the attack saying, "It is a very unfortunate incident and we are trying our level best to improve the situation. However, it is unfair to say that tourists are unsafe in the Valley. Such incidents take place all over the world." Tour operators however are concerned that attacks such as this one will result in customers calling off trips to Kashmir.

&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Rutte"&gt;Mark Rutte&lt;/a&gt; has been elected leader of the Dutch &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Party%20for%20Freedom%20and%20Democracy"&gt;People's Party for Freedom and Democracy&lt;/a&gt; (VVD). In a close &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20VVD%20leadership%20election"&gt;internal election&lt;/a&gt;, the junior minister for Education beat the minister for Immigration and Integration &lt;a href="w%3ARita%20Verdonk"&gt;Rita Verdonk&lt;/a&gt; and backbencher &lt;a href="w%3AJelleke%20Veenendaal"&gt;Jelleke Veenendaal&lt;/a&gt;.

On 31 May 2006, the party's president Jan van Zanen announced the result, which was broadcast live on Dutch television. He announced that 28,788 people voted in this election, that is 74% of the eligible VVD members. They voted mostly by telephone and via the Internet. Mark Rutte obtained 51.5%, leaving Rita Verdonk second, with 45.5% of the vote. Jelleke Veenendaal obtained 3.0% of the vote.
Mark Rutte is the current junior minister for Education, Culture and Science, with a special responsibility for higher education and science. He was the first to put forth his candidacy and the VVD leadership and the party board backed him. After studying history and leading the VVD youth (JOVD) Rutte became manager for Unilever. In 2002 he became junior minister for ♡❤Social Affairs and Employment♡❤, after a cabinet reshuffle he became junior minister of the ministry for Education, Culture and Science. Rutte is generally perceived to stand on the progressive side within the VVD. He promised "to make the VVD a party for everyone and not just of the elite". His youthful and charismatic appearance has been likened to the successful leader of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) Wouter Bos. It is generally expected that Rutte will stand down as junior minister and return to his seat in parliament.

The elections were called after the 2006 municipal elections. Jozias van Aartsen, who led the VVD until after the elections, stepped down as political leader of the VVD, after his party performed particularly bad in those elections.

The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization, both part of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, have stated that some countries, particularly &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; and some countries in &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; are "under-reporting" the number of human cases of the deadly &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; (Bird Flu) virus, but also said that the countries are not hiding them "deliberately."

"We know that some countries might be under-reporting ... most do not do it deliberately. We are concerned about China and Indonesia and Africa because the virus seems to be so widespread that we could not get all the information. It is difficult to know about each individual outbreak in a back yard," said Doctor Christianne Bruschke, in &lt;a href="w%3ARome%2C%20Italy"&gt;Rome, Italy&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday and who is head of the OIE's Bird Flu taskforce.

Bruschke also said that farmers lack the education they need on the virus and need to be reimbursed financially for any education they need citing that the "richer nations" should help fund the education they need and that lack of veterinary clinics, distance to them, and time are also to blame for the under-reporting.

In Africa, "farmers will probably not report sick animals," said Bruschke.

"Their veterinary services are very weak and many countries do not have laboratory facilities - we have all the ingredients there that could lead to under-reporting," she added.

Bruschke also said that Indonesia may not be reporting all human or animal cases also stating that the virus is "permanently infecting poultry" in the country which makes it increasingly difficult for anyone to report outbreaks.

"I think it could be the case because in certain regions the virus is getting more or less endemic, so in regions like Java, they might not report every single outbreak anymore," said Bruschke.

According to Bruschke, China is cooperating but she also said that "[China] is a very big country" and that there are cases of infections in wild birds.

"We sometimes see the outbreaks in wild animals - they will not always detect them. There is also not a very good compensation scheme in place so we feel there might be under-reporting," said Bruschke.

Scientists in &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; say that a cave containing an ecosystem with unknown life forms have been discovered in the Israeli city of &lt;a href="w%3ARamle"&gt;Ramle&lt;/a&gt;. The cave was found when miners were drilling in a rock quarry.

"Until now eight species of animals were found in the cave, all of them unknown to science," said a biologist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Dr Hanan Dimantman. He also said that all of the life forms were found alive except for one.

At least eight species of unknown life forms were found to closely resemble scorpions. Dimantman also said that the cave has been sealed off from the outside world, receiving no sunlight for at least 5 million years, when parts of Israel were under the &lt;a href="w%3AMediterranean%20Sea"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The life forms consist of four freshwater and seawater species and at least four terrestrial species. Scientists believe that they are related. Bacteria were also found, which scientists say served as food for the life forms. DNA tests have shown these life forms to be "unique" and unknown in science.

"Every species we examined had no eyes which means they lost their sight due to evolution," added Dimantman. "This is a cave of fantastic biodiversity."

The cave has been closed off to the public so researchers can examine it further.

There were been several large chemical explosions at the Terra Nitrogen UK chemical plant (previously owned by ICI) in &lt;a href="w%3ABillingham"&gt;Billingham&lt;/a&gt;, Teesside, England. The explosions started at 0015 BST. People living in Billingham and nearby &lt;a href="w%3AMiddlesbrough"&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; were advised to stay inside and keep windows closed if at all possible. Nearby roads were closed off for approximately two hours by police, for safety reasons.

Cleveland Fire and Rescue previously declared the incident a "major emergency", but was brought under control later in the morning. An ammonia leak was also reported, with nearby residents noticing the smell was contained, but is not cause for concern as it ignited immediately on release, preventing any fumes getting into the atmosphere. The plant was safely shut down later in the morning.

The explosion, resulting in a fire "involving mixed gases" was the immediate ignition of an ammonia gas leak, said a spokesman for the fire brigade.

The fire was visible for up to 10 miles, and the blast was heard up to 20 miles away.

Human rights group &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; has released satellite images showing how the &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;an community of Porta Farm, which once housed some 10,000 people, has been completely destroyed. Taken in 2002 and 2006, the photos starkly contrast the previous built-up area with the empty scrubland that remains.

According to Amnesty International, residents of Porta Farm were given less than 24 hours notice to leave their homes. Human rights monitors reported that several people died in the chaotic environment of the ensuing demolitions and forced evictions. Two children were reportedly among the dead.

Zimbabwe's forced evictions programme (called &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Murambatsvina"&gt;Operation Murambatsvina&lt;/a&gt;) has been widely condemned both within Zimbabwe and beyond. A 2005 report on Operation Murambatsvina by &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Envoy"&gt;Special Envoy&lt;/a&gt; Anna Tibaijuka estimated that it has cost 700,000 people their homes or livelihoods. She was present at Porta Farm during the second day of its demolition, and was shocked by the brutality of the evictions.

Residents of Porta Farm had fought eviction in the past, winning judgements from the High Court of Zimbabwe that they should not be evicted unless the government provided suitable alternative accommodation. However the High Court dismissed a contempt of court action that attempted to stop the 2005 evictions, giving no reason.

The Zimbabwean government (led by President &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt;) says that the programme is in the public interest and was not against the law. It has denied responsibility for the deaths.

Hans Mobius, 72, a former candidate for mayor in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;, a horse farmer and owner of properties 1109-1121 Elmwood in Buffalo where a hotel is proposed to be placed, reported that he had taken pictures allegedly of "&lt;a href="w%3ABigfoot"&gt;Bigfoot&lt;/a&gt;" to which experts later dismissed as a "hoax."

While Mobius was taking photos of a wooded area on his &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Clarence, New York&lt;/a&gt; horse farm on Tuesday, he caught the creature in a photo who was running out from behind a John Deere tractor nearly 200 feet from him. The creature appeared to have two legs and have fur all over its body.

"I called my friend and said, 'I think I saw Bigfoot.' I told my wife and daughter to keep it to ourselves. But my daughter said, you'd better send [the pictures] to somebody," said Mobius.

Mobius claims that the incident is not a hoax and that he believes that it is possible he could have seen the creature. "I don't want to come across as a nutcase here. It's the damned craziest thing." he added also saying he "saw this thing out of the corner of my eye. It looked like he might have been confused." Mobius says it then vanished into the woods.

However; experts are convinced the incident is a hoax.

"It's obviously a man in a suit. Look at the forearms. There's not natural taper at the wrist. It looks like a sleeve transitioning into a glove," said a professor of primatology, paleontology, evolutionary morphology and anatomy at Idaho State University, Doctor D. Jeffrey Meldrum.

"[The hair] looks unnatural. It disperses light like artificial fur would. That raises real questions about the credibility of the photos. Is someone pulling a prank on him? Or is it him having a laugh, just killing time at others' expense,?" added Meldrum.

"There's no doubt in my mind that what we're looking at is a guy in a gorilla suit," said professional videographer David Bittner, who helps to identify the authenticity of videos and photos with Meldrum.

The last Bigfoot sightings occurred in &lt;a href="w%3ABatavia%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Batavia, New York&lt;/a&gt; in the 19th century and in Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties in Western New York.

In a major foreign policy shift, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday announced that it would join European nations in multilateral talks with &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; over its nuclear energy issue if Iran fully and verifiably suspends its nuclear enrichment activities.

"We urge Iran to make this choice for peace, to abandon its ambition for nuclear weapons," she said. At the same time, Rice acknowledged that Iran had a right for civil nuclear energy.

However, the official Iranian news agency, IRNA, said in a dispatch following Rice's remarks, "Given the insistence by Iranian authorities on continuing uranium enrichment, Rice’s comments can be considered a propaganda move." Iranian lawmaker Kazem Jalali, speaking unofficially, said that the U.S. offer "can be considered positive but the precondition set by the U.S. is not appropriate."

&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; foreign policy chief Javier Solana welcomed Rice's remarks. "Direct U.S. participation would be the strongest and most positive signal of our common wish to reach an agreement with Iran," Solana said.

Iran and the United States have had no diplomatic relations and no direct official contact since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in which 52 Americans were held hostage in the American Embassy in Tehran.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Amid chaos in the &lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Yuan"&gt;Legislative Yuan&lt;/a&gt; over a proposal about creating direct transport links with Mainland China, Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party deputy, Wang Shu-hui, snatched the written proposal and shoved it into her mouth. Opposition members failed to get her to cough it up by pulling her hair. She later spat the proposal out and tore it up. This is the third time that the DPP’s actions have stopped a vote over this issue. 

During the incident another DPP members, Chuang Ho-tzu, spat at an opposition member. 

The amendment to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area would have permitted direct transit between mainland China and Taiwan, which now has to be routed through an intermediate&amp;mdash;usually Hong Kong. Opening such links is supported by the opposition pan-blue alliance, which controls the legislature, but opposed by the independence leaning DPP government.

Direct transport links between Taiwan and Mainland China have been banned after the two sides split amid a bloody civil war in 1949. The Communist government in the mainland and opposition politicians in Taiwan supporting Chinese reunification have vowed to lift the ban, but their efforts have repeatedly been blocked by the ruling DPP, which cites national security concerns.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has accused speaker of the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, David Hawker (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Wannon"&gt;Wannon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) of failing to be impartial.

During question time today, opposition leader, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Brand"&gt;Brand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) asked the government to confirm comments made by Cameron Thompson (Liberal, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Blair"&gt;Blair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), which asked for Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; (Liberal, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Bennelong"&gt;Bennelong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) to explain his role in the failed merger of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Nationals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Liberals in &lt;a href="Queensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;. According to Mr Beazley, Mr Thompson claims that the president of the Liberal party in Queensland was appointed by Mr Howard and that his actions would have been known and agreed upon by the Prime Minister.

The house's speaker refused to allow Mr Beazley to debate his question claiming it was not relevant. Mr Beazley argued that his question directly related to Mr Howard in his capacity as Prime Minister and to disallow his question was "shutting down accountability".

The opposition's next woe came when Stephen Smith (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Perth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) asked the Prime Minister to confirm accusations that the government's new industrial relations laws (called &lt;a href="Workchoices"&gt;Workchoices&lt;/a&gt;) had placed pressure on the low pay commission to lower the minimum wage of Australian workers. Mr Howard took the opportunity to attack Mr Beazley's role as Minister for Employment, Education and Training in 1993 saying that he had contempt for the unemployed.

&lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt; (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Grayndler"&gt;Grayndler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) raised a point of order, claiming that the Prime Minister's answer was irrelevant. This was refused by the speaker, who said that Mr Howard was attempting to answer a "lengthy question". Mr Albanese then interrupted Mr Howard as he was continuing his attack on Mr Beazley telling the speaker that the question was very specific and that Mr Howard's answer was irrelevant. Mr Albanese was ordered to resume his seat, and when he failed to do so was ordered out of the house.

Following Mr Albanese's ejection, Mr Smith argued that the Prime Minister was not answering his question before also being ordered out of the house by the speaker. As Mr Howard began to continue his answer, Julia Irwin (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFowler"&gt;Fowler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) interrupted Mr Howard. Mrs Irwin was then ordered to leave the house.

The opposition found itself another member short in the house after Julia Gillard (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Lalor"&gt;Lalor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) was removed for calling Health Minister Tony Abbott (Liberal, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Warringah"&gt;Warringah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) an "idiot". Ms Gillard's comment followed Mr Abbott tabling a document written by Medibank Private relating to a media campaign to counter negative views on its sale. Part of the document claimed that Medibank Private had "established a hypothetical but possible scenario: Julia Gillard arguing that the sale will mean higher premiums".

Mr Abbott joked that "Medibank Private sure know the member for Lalor (Julia Gillard)".

It was Ms Gillard's second ejection in two days. She was removed from the house yesterday for calling Mr Abbott a "snivelling grub", the same term Mr Abbott labeled an opposition MP last week without being removed.

Following the house's question time, Mr Abbott and Peter Costello (Liberal, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Higging"&gt;Higgins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) accused Lindsay Tanner (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), Wayne Swan (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Lilley"&gt;Lilley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) and Kim Wilkey (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Swan"&gt;Swan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) of deliberately blocking a camera's view of Mr Howard during one of his answers. Mr Tanner said "It's not our fault he's short" and Mr Wilkie said that he never raised from his chair and that Mr Abbott needed to "get his facts straight".

Following her removal, Ms Gillard told reporters that speaker of the house, Mr Hawker had double standards. "We've reached a stage ... where there are no rules in the House of Representatives," Ms Gillard said.

"Four Opposition members were tossed out of Parliament today. I don't think anybody watching question time could say that's a fair result."

"We've seen double standards in operation all week" she said.

She said that it was not unusual for people to walk around the chamber and talk to each other during question while government members were speaking.

"At the end of the day there is wandering around and chatter in question time," she said.

"But why is that? Because the quality of what's coming off the government front bench doesn't bear listening to" she said.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ubuntu%20releases%206.06%20LTS%20version%20of%20popular%20Linux%20distribution&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUbuntu%20Foundation"&gt;Ubuntu Foundation&lt;/a&gt; released its fourth version of the popular &lt;a href="w%3AGNU/Linux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; operating system distribution yesterday. Codenamed "Dapper Drake", the release improves on its predecessor, Breezy Badger, or 5.10. The 6.06 LTS version will be the first to offer Long Term Support: three years on the desktop and five years on the server.

Upgrades to existing Ubuntu 5.10 installations can be accomplished by running the update manager program, where an option to upgrade to 6.06 will be displayed.

Because the software in the GNU/Linux operating system comes with permission for everyone to modify and redistribute it, there are many versions (called "distributions") of the operating system available. Ubuntu builds on the popular &lt;a href="w%3ADebian%20GNU/Linux"&gt;Debian GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; distribution. Like Debian, it is made almost entirely of &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt;.

Users quickly swarmed Ubuntu's servers and mirrors trying to download the new version. The servers are currently responding slowly; moderators at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ubuntuforums.org"&gt;Ubuntu Forums&lt;/a&gt; suggested that users download with &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; if at all possible, which is much less prone to such slowdowns.

Since its first official release in October 2004, &lt;a href="w%3AUbuntu%20Linux"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; has become one of the most popular Linux distributions. It is intended to be user-friendly without being insecure by design, a charge sometimes leveled against other beginner-friendly distributions like &lt;a href="w%3ALinspire"&gt;Linspire&lt;/a&gt;. The distribution is offered for free, and CDs are available for order via the Internet without charge (including shipping).

A United States military MH-47 Chinook helicopter has crashed in &lt;a href="w%3AColquitt%20County%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Colquitt County, Georgia&lt;/a&gt; after clipping a wire connected to the &lt;a href="w%3AWFXL"&gt;WFXL&lt;/a&gt; television tower. It is not known whether the wire was the cause of the crash, or if the helicopter was having problems prior to the incident.

According to Lisa Eichhorn, a spokeswoman for Fort Rucker, Alabama, at least 5 soldiers were on board the helicopter. Four of the five soldiers have been killed. The surviving soldier only suffered cuts on his hands and above his eye. The names of the victims are not known and the military says they will not release any names for at least 24 hours after family members have been reached.

Authorities also say that the 1,000 foot tower "has a conspicuous tilt," said Ken Clubb, a chief engineer on the scene of the crash.

Reporters and onlookers were being kept from the scene mainly as a result of the possibility that the tower may collapse. A reporter for &lt;a href="w%3AWTXL-TV"&gt;WTXL&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; affiliate out of &lt;a href="w%3ATallahassee%2C%20Florida"&gt;Tallahassee, FL&lt;/a&gt; was arrested at the scene.

Investigators from Ft. Rucker, where the chopper was scheduled to land, were en route to the scene.

A fuel storage tank at &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20International%20Airport"&gt;Los Angeles International Airport&lt;/a&gt; (LAX) caught fire today.

The 1-million gallon storage tank caught fire at about 8:30 a.m. local time (PDT) according to Ron Myers, a spokesman for the LAX fire department. Myers said that planes were not at risk and no flights were cancelled, delayed or diverted. No injuries were reported and no evacuations were ordered.

The fire is said to have been caused by a spark from a welder performing work on the tank. Reports say the fuel container was mostly empty, but authorities are still investigating.

An attack against the &lt;a href="w%3ARashtriya%20Swayamsevak%20Sangh"&gt;Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3ANagpur"&gt;Nagpur&lt;/a&gt; was thwarted by the Maharashtra police early today morning. The militants were driving a white Ambassador car and were armed with AK-47s. They were confronted and killed by security forces as they tried to break through the security cordon surrounding the building.

Nagpur Police Commissioner S.P.S Yadav said that the car was chased by police after it broke through the first barrier about 200 metres away from the headquarters. When confronted, the militants opened fire and were killed after a five-minute shootout. Yadav also said that two policemen had been injured in the incident, one of whose condition was serious. The identities of the three men is yet to be established. A diary was also recovered from the terrorists. 

A high level security alert has been declared in Nagpur and other sensitive areas in the vicinity. R.S.S chief Ram Madhav urged the government to take more steps to safeguard the offices of the organisation. This is the second time the police has prevented a major terror attack from taking place in Maharashtra. Last month the Anti-Terrorist Squad had recovered 30 kilograms of RDX, 17 AK-47 rifles and 50 hand-grenades from a jeep in Aurangabad. Eleven suspected militants were also arrested.

Two women, one of them about to give birth, were shot dead by &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; forces as they rode in a car headed toward a maternity hospital in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamarra"&gt;Samarra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , 60 miles north of &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, according to witnesses and &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i police Capt. Laith Mohammed.

Nabiha Nisaif Jassim, 35, and her 57-year-old cousin, Saliha Mohammed Hassan, were killed by the gunfire, according to the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. Jassim, a mother of two, was pregnant with her third child; doctors at a nearby hospital tried unsuccessfully to save the baby.

Khalid Nisaif Jassim told reporters that he was rushing his sister to the hospital for childbirth. "I was driving my car at full speed because I did not see any sign or warning from the Americans. It was not until they shot the two bullets that killed my sister and cousin that I stopped.

"God take revenge on the Americans and those who brought them here," he added. "They have no regard for our lives."

A US military statement released Friday disputed the account. "A local national sedan entered a clearly marked prohibited area near coalition troops at an observation post," the statement read. "As the vehicle neared the troop location and failed to stop despite repeated visual and auditory signals, disabling shots were fired into the vehicle. The vehicle stopped, changed direction, and quickly departed the area."

The e-mailed statement to the Associated Press also expressed regret for the loss of life, noting that "coalition forces go to great lengths to prevent them."

♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reported that the women's bodies were "wrapped in sheets and lying on stretchers outside the Samarra General Hospital before being taken to the morgue, while residents pointed to bullet holes on the windshield of a car and a pool of blood on the seat".

The US military has increased the number of investigations into charges of misconduct against US troops, most notably following the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHaditha%20killings"&gt;alleged mass murder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of as many as 24 civilians in the town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHaditha"&gt;Haditha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , west of Baghdad. Initially, 15 civilians and eight insurgents were reported dead in gunfire following a roadside bombing that killed a US Marine. Military spokesman Major-General William Caldwell said, "there are three or four (investigations) at least at this time" and that they are in "the first stages."

Debate about the raid on the world's largest &lt;a href="w%3ABittorrent"&gt;Bittorrent&lt;/a&gt; site in &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; continues. According to the Swedish public television network SVT, requests for the closure of "&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pirate%20Bay"&gt;The Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt;" were made at a meeting between the Swedish justice department, police and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; government in April. U.S. officials presented issues relating to The Pirate Bay on behalf of the MPAA.

According to the SVT report, the Swedish justice department asked police to act, which allegedly claimed that the legality of The Pirate Bay was unclear. An official of Sweden's justice minister subsequently contacted the country's head procecutor and head of police, who ordered the raid. Debate is rife in Sweden about whether or not the Swedish justice minister should cave to US demand where the legality of the issue in Sweden is not clear. The justice minister has firmly denied SVT's story and having had any influence on the police action.

According to a statement on The Pirate Bay web site and interview with Slyck News, The Pirate Bay plans to have the site up and running within a few days. There is speculation that the new site will be running in a country other than Sweden.

Henrik Pontén of Sweden's IP protection organisation, Antipiratbyrån, said to Dagens Industri that the main target of the raid was the anti-copyright lobby organisation Piratbyrån and not The Pirate Bay. He has since claimed that he was misquoted.

The Pirate Bay's and Piratbyråns' sites were hosted by the Swedish company PRQ. According to a statement on PRQ's website, "all servers and network equipment was seized in an act of blatant abuse of power by public prosecutor Håkan Roswall". PRQ accuses the police of not only seizing servers hosting The Pirate Bay and Piratbyrån, but also other servers which were unrelated to the two sites. PRQ is planning to sue the Swedish government to get their hardware back and for compensation of economic losses. According to IDG, 9 other sites were taken offline when police seized PRQ's equipment. Expressen.se writes that owners of PRQ were running The Pirate Bay as a hobby project and that was the reason why all servers were seized.

A mine accident killed at least nine miners in a coal mine in western &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. A methane explosion collapsed a mine shaft about 150 meters below the town of Odakoy, in Balıkesir Province, near the border with Bursa Province. Rescue work was slowed by the presence of gas, with rescue workers having to be hospitalized for methane poisoning.

Turkey suffers relatively frequent mine accidents, especially due to methane pockets either igniting or poisoning miners. Some observers fault old &amp; untrustworthy equipment, or a disregard for safety regulations.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; federal and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; governments will not be selling their shares in Snowy Hydro Limited (the owner and operator of the &lt;a href="w%3ASnowy%20Mountains%20Scheme"&gt;Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme&lt;/a&gt;). Snowy Hydro Limited's major shareholder is the NSW government with a 58 percent shareholding. The &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; government owns 29 percent and the federal government has a 13 percent stake.

NSW Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; announced in December 2005 that he wished to sell the state's share in Snowy Hydro that caused the federal and Victorian governments to follow.

The proposed sale has attracted immense criticism by those who believed that the sale would affect the environment and water supplies along the &lt;a href="w%3ASnowy%20River"&gt;Snowy River&lt;/a&gt;, this was reinforced yesterday when 58 eminent Australians presented a petition to the government opposing the sale.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; announced today that the federal government would not be selling its 13 percent share of Snowy Hydro following what he calls "intense community reaction". In a statement, Mr Howard said, "This decision to sell the Snowy Hydro has created significant unhappiness, concern and unrest throughout the Australian community."

Mr Howard said that the sale was not an election promise by his government and that the federal government failed to see any long-term benefits from the sale. He also said that the government needed to "safeguard the interests of all those dependent on Australia's iconic water resources".

The federal government has however stated that despite refusing to sell its share in Snowy Hydro that it will not be purchasing additional shares if NSW and Victoria push ahead with the sale of their shareholdings.

Despite telling Macquarie Radio earlier this morning that his government would be pushing ahead with the sale as it was in the best "interests of NSW", Premier Iemma announced shortly after Mr Howard's release, that the NSW government would be withdrawing its shares from sale.

Mr Iemma conceded that the sale would be extremely difficult with the federal government withdrawing its 13 percent from sale. "The Prime Minister has pulled the rug out from under the sale," Mr Iemma said. "The circumstances are significantly changed."

"The Commonwealth decision makes it extremely difficult for NSW to proceed," he conceded.

Victoria is yet to announce whether or not it will be withdrawing its shares from sale.

Katharine "Kerry" Close, a 13-year-old 8th-grader from &lt;a href="w%3AAsbury%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Asbury Park, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, spelled "&lt;a href="wikt%3AUrsprache"&gt;ursprache&lt;/a&gt;", a word for the ancestor of a language or language group, to win the 79th annual &lt;a href="w%3AScripps%20National%20Spelling%20Bee"&gt;Scripps National Spelling Bee&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday night. Close beat out 274 other contestants from 9 to 15 years old. This was Close's last year of eligibility; she was one of only two contestants this year to be in her fifth year at the national competition. She finished seventh in 2005, having gotten a better ranking every year she's competed.

This is the Bee's first appearance on network television, with the finals airing on &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;; earlier rounds were televised in the afternoon on &lt;a href="w%3AESPN"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;. Close, who enjoys running, music, reading, and her puppy, is the first New Jersey resident ever to win the competition, which she prepared for up to two hours each day. 

Saryn Hooks, 14, was nearly eliminated in the eighth round, with "hechsher", a symbol indicating that a food has been certified kosher. The judges mistakenly had the word down as "hechscher"; after being removed, she was reinstated in the next round after the judges received the correction. Hooks, who spent six months reading the entire dictionary to prepare, came back with confidence and finished in third place, missing "icteritious" in round twelve. This is the first time the judges have made such a visible error in the televised broadcast.

Kendra Yoshinaga, 12, of &lt;a href="w%3AThousand%20Oaks%2C%20California"&gt;Thousand Oaks, California&lt;/a&gt;, a favorite for the finals, was knocked out in the seventh round just before the ABC broadcast began by "cointise", a scarf worn on a lady's headdress. Yoshinaga said that this third national bee she's competed in felt "a lot more rigid" than the previous two. 

This year's schedule was rearranged for the ABC news broadcast: previous championships have been held earlier in the day. The spellers have all been given more media attention; for this reason Yoshinaga is perhaps one of the few who didn't want to win, claiming that it would be too much. She has already received her share of attention, as co-author of ♡❤The Spelling Bee And Me: A Real-Life Adventure In Learning♡❤, a children's book about her experiences.

"People I don't know very well seem to make a big deal about it, but my really close friends know that it's not a really huge part of my life," she says, of her relative fame. Keenly interested in politics and social issues, Yoshinaga spent a large portion of her last two trips sightseeing in Washington, but this trip, she says, has been more focused on studying.

"My mom sometimes finds words for me from books and magazines," says the homeschooler, who studied over 30,000 words in the week preceding the national bee. Paige Kimble, bee coordinator, wouldn't have been surprised to see her break into the top ten.

Another favorite eliminated earlier on in the competition was Samir Patel, who tied for second in last year's 19-round marathon and placed third in 2003. Patel misspelled "eremacausis" in round 7, joining Yoshinaga and 6 others in a tie for 14th place. 

The studious 12-year-old has one more chance at the national finals; Yoshinaga has two, as students may compete from their fourth through eighth grade years.

Cody Boisclair, a 23-year-old graduate student at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Georgia"&gt;University of Georgia&lt;/a&gt;, misses the competition. He competed in the 1997 and 1998 finals, placing fourth in his second try. The Bee has changed since he began participating, becoming more international, and with increased media attention putting more pressure on spellers. Though many critics claim that the rote memorization and drilling of spelling bees is not a particularly beneficial activity, Boisclair believes his experience in the bee helped his knowledge of language rather than serving as a simple display of memory.
"I was one of those people who tried to dissect the word into its component parts, to find similarities to other words that I was familiar with," says Boisclair, who began reading at the age of two. "Although I did do some drilling, I tried to find relationships to help me remember words, and even tried to analyze the words I was studying as I studied them." His analysis skills led him not to a career in lexicography or linguistics but rather to graduate study in computer science.

Boisclair, who spent the evening watching the Bee on television while in a chat room with several other former national finalists, looks back on the competition as one of the highlights of his school years. "I think the best thing about it was a sense of camaraderie&amp;mdash;for once, I really felt like I fit in somewhere. I was with people my age who were, by and large, 'on the same wavelength'." 
Also, Jasmine Kaneshiro, 14, from Honolulu, Hawaii, was not a favorite, having done quite badly last year, did better. She moved up from 72nd place in the 2005 bee to 45th place. It was her second year. "I'm pleased with my performance this year," Kaneshiro said.

The International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations has rated Taupo airport the worst in the world due to its “critically deficient” safety measures.

The main concern is over the complete absence of air traffic controllers at Taupo.

In 2004, the Civil Aviation Authority rejected a recommendation made by its own staff to install a flight information service. CAA director John Jones said that the proposal was rejected because it was not cost effective. A spokesman yesterday reaffirmed that position.

"Failure to endorse the major safety recommendation of the study team would expose the director to a level of risk that would be difficult to defend in the event of an incident at Taupo that might have been mitigated by an [information service]. We believe your recommendation would place the travelling public and aviation participants at risk and would be indefensible in a Coroners Court," study team leader Len Wicks wrote in an internal memo.

The New Zealand Airline Pilots Association has issued 11 "special operating procedures" for pilots at the Taupo airport. The airport that had the next lowest number of air traffic controllers is that of Umtata, South Africa, which has five.

Taupo is the tenth busiest airport in New Zealand. It receives and sends out more flights than Napier, Dunedin or Invercargill, but this distinction is largely negated by its air traffic control woes.

Air New Zealand Eagle Air general manager Doug Roberts, however, said that his airline had been flying to Taupo for decades without difficulty. Likewise, Taupo Air Charter, which has operated in Taupo for 25 years, has suffered no problems in its flights.

In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , top diplomats from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; reached an agreement on Thursday on an incentive package to offer to &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for its giving up &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20program%20of%20Iran"&gt;uranium enrichment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The specifics of the incentive package were not revealed, but a delegation from Europe led by European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana is expected to formally deliver the offer to Iran in the coming days. Iran would then have several weeks to respond.

In a prepared statement, British foreign secretary Margaret Beckett said, "We have agreed on a set of far-reaching proposals as a basis for discussions with Iran. We believe they offer Iran the chance to reach a negotiated agreement based on cooperation."

Beckett did not mention any sanctions to be taken against Iran if it refuses to comply. The United Nations Security Council is expected to take up the question of sanctions should Iran turn down the offer.

The agreement comes a day after the United States offered to participate in multilateral negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program if Iran suspends its uranium enrichment program. Iran agreed to the idea of holding talks but rejected the preconditions.

In the first direct reaction by the Iranian government to the offer, Iranian foreign minister &lt;a href="Manouchehr%20Mottaki"&gt;Manouchehr Mottaki&lt;/a&gt; said on Thursday; "Iran welcomes dialogue under just conditions but won't give up our rights," Iranian state-run television reported. "We won't negotiate about the Iranian nation's natural nuclear rights but we are prepared, within a defined, just framework and without any discrimination, to hold dialogue about common concerns," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scottish&lt;/a&gt; police have arrested a man and a woman after finding Britain's largest ever stash of &lt;a href="w%3AGamma-butyrolactone"&gt;Gamma-butyrolactone&lt;/a&gt;. The man in charge of the operation, Graeme Pearson, director of the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Drug%20Enforcement%20Agency"&gt;Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency&lt;/a&gt;, called the find "the most significant discovery of the drug in the UK." 

Denise Caron MacPherson, 45, and Hanan Rabin, 53, have been charged with exporting the drug, also known as GHB, to the United States between 19 April and 24 May. The news of the Scottish factory comes as a US study found drug use was involved in two-thirds of sex attacks, while 5 per cent were given an actual "&lt;a href="w%3Adate%20rape"&gt;date rape&lt;/a&gt;" drug.

Graham Rhodes for The Roofie Foundation, a helpline for victims of drug rape, said: "I am very relieved this has been recovered as in the wrong hands it is very dangerous. Not only is it used to spike the drinks of people to rape them but it's also used to assault and rob people."

Used by ravers, robbers and bodybuilders, the base chemical (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) was taken during a raid on a house and business in West Lothian. The haul would have been put on the United States illicit drug market and sold for fun and more sinister purposes.

In its non-powder form GHB is barely detectable: clear and having no smell it can be particularly potent with a few drops mixed into an alcoholic drink. Once a sufficient amount of the salty liquid has been ingested the victim can be knocked out within an hour.

While GHB is known both as "liquid ecstasy" and the date rapist's "Plan A", the versatile compound is also used by body builders instead of &lt;a href="w%3Aanabolic%20steriod"&gt;anabolic steroids&lt;/a&gt;, by dieters and as a sleeping aid.

In Britain, GHB is a "&lt;a href="w%3AMisuse_of_Drugs_Act_1971%23Class_C_drugs"&gt;Class C&lt;/a&gt;" drug which means making it, holding it and selling it is punishable with up to two years in prison. The effects of rape, for which the drug is reportedly used, can last a lifetime. Jane Cumming, from support group Crisis, said she received an average of 4 calls a week from people claiming to be victims of date rape.

The pair, who were caught in Livingston, were accused of distributing the drug in Scotland from MacPherson's house around the same time as they were exporting to the United States, while MacPherson was also charged with Cannabis possession.

Convicted on the first of June by a military jury for participating in prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, former sergeant Santos Cardona, 32, a dog handler in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;United States Army&lt;/a&gt;, was today sentenced to ninety days of hard labour and demoted to the rank of &lt;a href="w%3Aspecialist"&gt;specialist&lt;/a&gt;. 

Cardona was charged and convicted on two counts: aggravated assault, for using a &lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20shepherd%20dog"&gt;Belgian shepherd dog&lt;/a&gt; to threaten detainees with actions "likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm," and for dereliction of duty in relation to this act. He was cleared of seven other charges. 

Cardona faced up to three and a half years in prison on these charges, and despite the conviction his attourney has expressed relief at the sentence. He will not be held in confinement during the term of his sentence.

Hackers have brought the &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20Police%20Service"&gt;Swedish Police Service&lt;/a&gt;'s website down. It is suspected this might be retaliation for &lt;a href="The%20Pirate%20Bay%20and%20Piratbyr%C3%A5n%20raided"&gt;the raid on The Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt; on May 31.

The police's website went down on late June 1, after a sent large amounts of traffic to the site, causing it to crash.

Police spokesmen Lars Lindahl said today that a link with The Pirate Bay "♡❤is quite possible, but that is only speculation♡❤." He added that a criminal investigation has started.

It was later revealed a 17-year-old student, who claims “it only took 10 minutes”, carried out the attack that kept the site down for almost a day.

Rahul Mahajan's condition has improved and has been taken off ventilator support. Rahul's CT scan report is normal and his vital parameters have shown an improvement. He will however, be kept under observation for another 3 days. "The condition of Rahul Mahajan has gradually improved over the last 12 hours. After due assessment of clinical status and investigation, our team of doctors found his vital parameters improving," a ♡❤♡♡❤medical bulletin♡❤♡♡❤ released by the Apollo Hospital said.

Rahul Mahajan, the son of late BJP leader &lt;a href="w%3APramod%20Mahajan"&gt;Pramod Mahajan&lt;/a&gt; has been admitted to the Apollo Hospital in New Delhi in a critical state, apparently after a drug overdose. Rahul was found in an unconscious state in his father's residence in New Delhi early today morning. Vivek Moitra, Pramod Mahajan's secretary who was with Rahul at the party has been declared dead presumably as a result of the same drug. Police say the Rahul, Vivek and three other men were drinking champagne together and were also apparently consuming cocaine. This assumption is based of the fact that opiate traces were found in the deceased Mr. Moitra's pocket.

Doctors described Rahul's condition as "critical but stable". They said that details regarding what led to his present condition would be revealed after the conduction of a toxicology test. Two domestic helps rushed the men to hospital in the early hours of today morning. The helps disturbed the scene by clearing up the glasses and the bottles. Traces of what seems to be cocaine were however found in one the glasses. 

Rahul is currently on a ventilator and his condition will have to be closely monitored for the next couple of days. He was supposed to visit Assam tomorrow to immerse his father's ashes in the Brahmaputra. Mr. Pramod Mahjan died about a month ago after being shot by his brother. Rahul was on anti-depressants as a result of this.

At dawn this morning a team of 250 policemen stormed a building in , London, England. A part of the police teams were armed, while others were equipped with chemical weapons gear. Two men were arrested and one was shot in the raid made under the 2000 .

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke, the Metropolitan Police's anti-terror chief, said he had acted on specific intelligence, "we planned an operation that was designed to mitigate any threat to the public either from firearms or from hazardous substances." 

The injury to the man who was shot was not life threatening and the Independent Police Complaints Commission, who have opened an investigation into the incident, say a single shot was fired. At where the man, later arrested, was taken armed guards were seen at the entrances.

The man, said to be 20 years old, who was not shot, has been questioned at &lt;a href="w%3APaddington%20Green%20Police%20Station"&gt;Paddington Green&lt;/a&gt; police station. Others at the address have been moved out - two residents have been treated in hospital for shock.

The search at the house in Lansdown Road is said to be ongoing. Police have closed Lansdown Road, Rothsay Road and Prestbury Road and a blind has been erected around the premises. The Civil Aviation Authority report a four-day "no fly area" below 2,500ft is in force over east London. 

The British intelligence agency, , and the Health Protection Agency also had a role in the operation, which British Prime Minister had been told about. The raid is not thought to be linked to the London tube and bus in July 2005.

Police say the raid was carried out in search of a 'suicide vest' that could be used to release poison gas. Police say MI5 believe there exists 'firm intelligence' that such a vest exists.

As of Friday evening, police had yet to discover weapons, chemicals or any other evidence of a planned attack.

The two men arrested are believed to be 23 and 20 year old brothers, and , both of Bangladeshi origin. Abdul Kahar was shot in the shoulder during the raid, his injury is said to be non life threatening.

A &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Air%20Marshal"&gt;Federal Air Marshal&lt;/a&gt; decided to exit a Southwest Airlines flight today after dropping ammunition on the aircraft floor. The incident occurred at Chicago’s Midway Airport.

After earlier arriving from Philadelphia, the Marshal was on board a Southwest Airlines jet bound for Kansas City, when his gun’s clip fell to the aircraft floor, spilling bullets. According to Southwest Airlines spokeswomen Whitney Eichenger "He picked up the bullets immediately." She also added, "Since he was no longer traveling incognito, he decided not to continue on the flight to Kansas City."

Because of the incident, the flight was delayed 45 minutes.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
In a statement, attorney Arthur Giacalone in charege of the case, Nancy Pollina et al opposing Savarino's Elmwood Village Hotel, who is co-owner with Patty Morris of Don Apparel at 1109 Elmwood in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; has said that the preliminary hearing in New York State Supreme Court has been delayed.

"The court appearance has been adjourned for two weeks to 6/22," said Giacalone.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a 72-room, seven-million-dollar hotel proposed by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. Its construction would require the demolition of at least five buildings, currently at 1109-1121 Elmwood, which house several shops and residents. Although the properties are "under contract," it is still not known whether Savarino Construction actually owns the buildings. It is believed that Hans Mobius, a resident of Clarence, New York and former Buffalo mayoral candidate, is still the owner. The hotel is expected to be a franchise of the Wyndham Hotels group. 

Buffalo's Common Council, Planning Board, Mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown, Savarino Construction Services Corporation, Hans J. Mobius and his son Hans S. Mobius owners of the properties at stake, Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, and Cendant Corporation, the parent company of Wyndham Hotels are among those named in the suit.

According to Giacalone, the city of Buffalo has requested two week extension to prepare their defense. Area councelman Joseph Golombek has been contacted to further confirm the date change request, but has not yet responded.

Eight oil workers have been kidnapped after gunman boarded the Bulford Dolphin oil platform off the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;African&lt;/a&gt; coast of &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;. One &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;, and six &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;Britons&lt;/a&gt; were among those kidnapped. The names of the victims are not known, but families have been notified. At least 84 workers were on the platform at the time of the incident.

"Some unknown persons boarded the rig at 0300 local time (0200 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) and took eight workers. One of the abductees was made to call their onshore office in an attempt to open negotiations. Other than that, we don’t know who appears to be responsible or what the condition of the abductees might be," said a spokesperson for the Dolphin Drilling company.

Gunmen boarded the platform from three speedboats firing shots from their weapons while doing so. At least twenty gunmen are blamed for the incident.

Authorities investigating the crime do not know who is responsible. "We are on their trail and trying to secure the hostages’ release as soon as possible," said a spokesman for the Nigerian police.

Oil drilling on the platform has been suspended until further notice.

NSW Senator Bill Heffernan wants the Federal government to take control of all the nations waterways. He is calling for a referendum on this issue.

The move comes after the Federal government &lt;a href="Federal%20and%20NSW%20governments%20withdraw%20Snowy%20Hydro%20shares"&gt;pulled out of the sale of the Snowy Hydro scheme&lt;/a&gt; because of community opposition

Mr Heffernan has accused the states of bad mismanagement of the waterways, and says that a central nationwide organisation should look after them. "Australians today should have great heart and great national pride in the fact that people power has convinced the politicians that we ought to retain one of the seven engineering wonders of the world in safe hands," he said.

New South Wales Environment Minister Bob Debus has rejected the proposal to give responsibility to the Federal government, he says he cannot see how they could manage it by themselves, "It has no particular skills to do so and we still need the states to be involved," he said.

The competition will most likely be similar to similar to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Provincial%20Championship"&gt;National Provincial Championship&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ACurrie%20Cup"&gt;Currie Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

It was revealed that the eight-team competition will involve three teams from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, two from &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; and one each from the &lt;a href="w%3AACT"&gt;ACT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20Rugby%20Union"&gt;QRU&lt;/a&gt; later revealed that one of the Queensland sides will most likely be playing out of Queensland Rugby's old home &lt;a href="w%3ABallymore%20Stadium"&gt;Ballymore Stadium&lt;/a&gt;, with the other team going to either the &lt;a href="w%3AGold%20Coast"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; or Northern Queensland.

Some Sydney clubs, in particular, &lt;a href="w%3ARandwick%20DRUFC"&gt;Randwick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20University%20Football%20Club"&gt;Sydney University Football Club&lt;/a&gt; were opposed to the competition, and want stand-alone status in the competition rather than being part of a cumulative Sydney team, also believing that the competition will see them lose funding. Businessman &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Singleton"&gt;John Singleton&lt;/a&gt; came out and showed his interest in having one of the NSW sides playing at &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Coast%20Stadium"&gt;Central Coast Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.

Super 14 players will be playing, but as there will be twice as many clubs as the Super 14, so there will be a lot of available spaces for club footballers. There is no plan for an immediate draft. Although Super 14 players will be playing, around 30 players will be unavailable due to &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Wallaby&lt;/a&gt; duties. The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; has apparently expressed interest in broadcasting the games next year.

Seventeen people, including five minors, have been arrested in the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; area on terrorism-related charges. Over 400 officers, drawn from the &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; (RCMP), the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Service"&gt;Canadian Security Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; (CSIS), and the Toronto, Peel, and Durham police departments raided a dozen locations throughout the greater Toronto area. More arrests are expected overnight.

Anonymous sources have told Canadian Press that those arrested are suspected to have been inspired by al Qaeda, and that they had plans to detonate explosives somewhere in Ontario. According to BBC News, three tonnes of &lt;a href="w%3Aammonium%20nitrate"&gt;ammonium nitrate&lt;/a&gt;, a common fertilizer that can be used as an explosive, have been seized. RCMP assistant commissioner Mike McDonnell stated, "To put it in context, the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people was completed with only one ton of ammonium nitrate.” In order to protect the investigation, he was unable to provide any information as to the potential targets, but did state that the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Transit%20Commission"&gt;Toronto Transit Commission&lt;/a&gt; was not targeted. 

The suspects are currently being held under extremely heavy security at a police station in Pickering, just east of Toronto. According to RCMP spokeswoman CPL. Michele Paradis, “The investigation is ongoing.” The suspects are expected to appear in court today, in Brampton.
They have all been charged under &lt;a href="http%3A//laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/267115.html"&gt;Section 83&lt;/a&gt; of the ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/index.html"&gt;Criminal Code of Canada&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

The father of one of the suspects, Mohammed Abdelhaleen, told reporters: "I'm shocked. It's crazy - it's just crazy. It has no meaning whatsoever."

<h2>The Arrested</h2>
The following contains the names released by the RCMP, that have been arrested. The list does not contain the names of the 5 charged minors. Under Canadian law, the police may not reveal any information concerning anyone under the age of 18. It is arranged by city of residence.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australia%20in%20the%20midst%20of%20a%20%26quot%3Bbaby%20boom%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; would appear to be in the middle of a baby boom, with the largest number of births recorded since 1992. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that 261,400 births were registered in 2005, 6,200 more than 2004.

Australian treasurer, Peter Costello believes his speech during the 2004 election may have influenced Australians to have more children. In 2004, Mr Costello said that each family should have three children. After seeing the statistics for 2005, he said "One for mum, one for dad, and one for the country - it was a light-hearted way of making a serious point,"

"I am delighted that at least some families have been taking up the challenge," said Mr Costello.

The Howard government believes that Australia's aging population and low birth rates will threaten the country's economy in the future.

As part of the 2004 budget, the Howard government introduced an &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; $3,000 maternity payment to all mothers who give birth to a child. As of July, the payment will increase to $4,000. As a further incentive to have more children the government increased family tax benefits and from July, will allow families to claim a 30 percent childcare rebate (capped at &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$3000 per year).

Wayne Swan, the opposition's treasury spokesperson said Mr Costello isn't the reason for the boom. "I am willing to let Peter Costello claim credit for higher interest rates, even higher fuel prices, but I think claiming his charms have lifted the national libido may be a bridge too far" he said.

&lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Aotearoa%20New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand Green party&lt;/a&gt; has elected a new party co-leader, &lt;a href="w%3ARussel%20Norman"&gt;Russel Norman&lt;/a&gt; at the AGM this weekend.

Russel Normans election to co-leader follows the death of previous co-leader, &lt;a href="w%3ARod%20Donald"&gt;Rod Donald&lt;/a&gt;.

Russel Norman, 39-year-old, was elected on the first ballot at Silverstream, &lt;a href="w%3AUpper%20Hutt"&gt;Upper Hutt&lt;/a&gt; on the Greens Annual General Meeting.

Norman was up against four other candidates, including MP &lt;a href="w%3ANandor%20Tanczos"&gt;Nandor Tanczos&lt;/a&gt;. Tanczos would have been automatically put in as co-leader if a remit had passed stating that a co-leader had to be an MP.

Dr Norman will make his first speech on climate change on June 4, 2006.

"Members chose me for a variety of reasons, mainly because... I focused on the main issues for the Greens, around climate change, public transport, those kinds of things." Dr Norman said. Dr Norman said he would not try to fill Donald's shoes but make his own mark instead. He is the Greens party development coordinator in Wellington. He also holds a PhD in political studies.

Swedish &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; site &lt;a href="The%20Pirate%20Bay"&gt;The Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt; is back online following the Swedish police raid of their office on May 31.

Pirate Bay has previously announced on their website that they "will be up and fully functional within a day or two". A Pirate Bay spokesperson identified as brokep told Slyck News that if necessary, they'd reopen in another country. The reopened website is currently hosted in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.

The web page titles have been changed to ♡❤The Police Bay♡❤ and the indexing capability is reduced, with the search function disabled, though this is expected to change. All searches are now returned with the error message:

Searches can still be done with Google and other search engines by adding site:thepiratebay.org to the search. Most attempts at downloading .torrent files resulted in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHTTP%20404"&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; error messages during the first hours after the site went back online, however torrent downloads seem to be working fairly well now. 

Currently 11:00 a.m. June 6 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Daylight%20Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , The Pirate Bay seems to be back and operational, but downloads still aren't working too well; you may be able to, you may not. There's probably a lot of traffic right now.

Five months later, &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; public opinion is numbed as the developments of the missing child case bring five children, aged from 11 to 13, to admit that they killed Alex after a fight. According to the Police directorate of &lt;a href="w%3AImathia"&gt;Imathia&lt;/a&gt;, the alleged murderers are two Greek brothers, one &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian"&gt;Romanian&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href="w%3AAlbanian"&gt;Albanian&lt;/a&gt; boys.

The juveniles allegedly confessed to the act and have indicated the place where they buried the body in the center of Veria, at an abandoned house just behind the Municipal building. 

While the search for the finding of Alex' body continues, the local Police bureau in collaboration with the &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt; Police department continue their own investigation, based on all the information available since the disappearance of the 11-years old boy, reviewing all scenarios and any relevant information. 

If there is confirmation of Alex Meschisvili's murder by the alleged juveniles, it will be the first known case of a teenager's murder by teenagers in the crime history of Greece.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Indonesian%20human-to-human%20bird%20flu%20infection%20may%20be%20false%20alarm&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Human-to-human transmission of the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; (Bird Flu) virus was earlier suspected in an Indonesian nurse currently hospitalised who was showing symptoms of the virus. However it is now being reported that tests on the woman for avian virus have been returned showing negative results, and that the samples are being sent to a &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; approved laboratory in Hong Kong for further analysis and confirmation.

"Thank God, the result came back negative," said senior official for the Indonesian Health Ministry, Hariadi Wibisono.

The nurse had been in close contact with two children, brother and sister, who have died. The sister, nine, was confirmed of having died from the virus by local lab tests. The brother was buried before any blood tests could be taken, but showed similar symptoms.

It was reported on Friday that an analysis has shown that the virus has not mutated, and the WHO has said that there was no evidence so far of human-to-human transmission.

Other members of the same family are currently ill, but all members have received the &lt;a href="w%3ATamiflu"&gt;Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt; antiviral drug.

"I think it is a cluster. The local test from the victim in Pamulang is bird flu positive. The symptoms of the virus are very similar to previous clusters we've had. The parents are also suffering from flu, and we are giving them a full dose of Tamiflu now," said Indonesia's Health Minister, Siti Fadilah Supari.

"The characteristics of germ (the boy had) is very similar (to his sister's), and now their mother and father are suffering from flu. They are all in the Pamulang district," added Supari.

The nurse, whose initials are "C.I.," 25, has been put in isolation at Bandung's Hasan Sadikin Hospital, but officials say that her condition is stable and that her case may be the result of human-to-human transmission due to the fact that she has not had any contact with poultry.

"We could not confirm whether she is positive of having been infected by avian influenza virus or not, although she had earlier have contacts with siblings, 18-year old Ad and 10-year old Ai, who died of bird flu virus recently," said Hadi Yusuf, chief of the Bird Flu team at Sadikin Hospital.

"When she arrived at this hospital last night, her body temperature was very high, namely 39.6 Celsius degrees but now it has decreased to 37 Celsius degrees. After considering her contact with dead bird flu victims, we declared her a suspected bird flu case. But she is still fully conscious, her breathing problems are not too serious and she's not experiencing chest pain," added Yusuf.

The names of the children and the nurse have not been released. The nurse is undergoing treatment and has been administered &lt;a href="w%3ATamiflu"&gt;Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;. She is expected to be released when the required amount of doses is given, which officials say could be as early as next week.

<h1>Montenegro prepares to declare independence</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Montenegro%20prepares%20to%20declare%20independence&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AMontenegro"&gt;Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; is preparing today to declare its independence from Serbia in a special parliamentary session in the capital, &lt;a href="w%3APodgorica"&gt;Podgorica&lt;/a&gt;. The official announcement comes two weeks after a referendum, where just over 55% of voters chose to support the split.

The 650,000-strong nation has been tied in this current union with Serbia since 1918, and the two countries are the last to remain joined since the dissolution of &lt;a href="w%3AYugoslavia"&gt;Yugoslavia&lt;/a&gt;. This evening, the alliance will come to an end to the sounds of the Montenegrin national anthem, which will be played to mark the occasion.

The main feature of tonight's session is to be the reading of the official declaration, which prioritises Montenegrin membership of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;. A draft version of the document states that "Montenegro is determined to build its state policy by respecting the principles of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, EU, &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOrganization%20for%20Security%20and%20Cooperation%20in%20Europe"&gt;Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe&lt;/a&gt;."
Despite initial intentions that the event be low-key, thousands are expected to turn out in celebration of the split. Among those not expected to attend the session is Serbian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AVojislav%20Ko%C5%A1tunica"&gt;Vojislav Koštunica&lt;/a&gt;, who openly supports pro-union movements. Koštunica is not the only Serbian official who is against the separation: Serbia and Montenegro's President, &lt;a href="w%3ASvetozar%20Marovi%C4%87"&gt;Svetozar Marović&lt;/a&gt;, has reputedly resigned today ahead of tonight's events.

The session is set to begin at 8 p.m. local time (1800 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), and will include the presentation of a final report by &lt;a href="w%3ASlovakia"&gt;Slovakian&lt;/a&gt; diplomat František Lipka, who is the head of the referendum's commission.

<h1>Iraq rejects US probe clearing US troops of killings civilians in Ishaqi</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iraq%20rejects%20US%20probe%20clearing%20US%20troops%20of%20killings%20civilians%20in%20Ishaqi&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Adnan al-Kazimi, an advisor to the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Nouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;, said, "We have from more than one source that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIshaqi"&gt;Ishaqi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; killings were carried out under questionable circumstances. More than one child was killed. This report was not fair for the Iraqi people and the children who were killed".

The &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; military yesterday made a statement about Ishaqi allegations that U.S. troops "executed a family … and then hid the alleged crimes by directing an air strike, are absolutely false". Troops had been fired on and they returned fire and called in air support, which destroyed the house, killing one militant and "up to nine collateral deaths".

In March, the U.S. military said four people died when they attacked a house suspected of holding an al-Qaida operative. The house was destroyed by fire from the ground and air.

The &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; has video evidence that US forces may have been responsible for the deliberate killing of 11 Iraqi civilians. The videotape, from a hard-line Sunni group opposed to coalition forces, shows a number of dead adults and children at the site. Clearly gunshot wounds according to John Simpson, BBC world affairs.

Local Iraqis said there were 11 total deaths, and claimed that they were killed by U.S. troops before the house was leveled. An unidentified local said, "After they handcuffed them, they shot them dead. Later, they struck the house with their planes. They wanted to hide the evidence. Even a 6-month-old infant was killed. Even the cows were killed, too" 

Also according to &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; Police in Ishaqi say five children, four women and two men were shot in the head, and that the bodies, with hands bound, were dumped in one room before the house was blown up.

Riyadh Majid, nephew of Faez Khalaf, who was killed, said U.S. forces landed in helicopters and raided the home. Ahmed, Khalaf's brother said nine of the victims were family members who lived at the house and two were visitors.

The U.S. military said in March that the allegations were being investigated. On Friday U.S. military said it was targeting and captured an individual suspected of supporting foreign fighters of the al-Qaida in Iraq terrorist network. Gen. William Caldwell, a U.S military spokesman acknowledged there were "possibly up to nine collateral deaths". 
The 'collateral deaths' are:

</ul>
According to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; there is a widespread public perception that U.S. troops can shoot and kill with impunity and Iraqi leaders are too weak to do anything about it. Abdullah Hussein, an engineer in Baghdad, says to Reuters "Ishaqi is just another reason why we shouldn't trust the Americans", and continue "First they lied about the weapons of mass destruction, then there was the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal and now it's clear to the world they were guilty in Haditha" 

John Simpson, BBC Correspondent in Baghdad says "It's hard to find an Iraqi here who has not suffered, through his family, his friends, from the tough tactics the Americans use".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWijdan%20Michael"&gt;Wijdan Michael&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Human Rights Minister, said a fact-finding commission would be sent to Ishaqi in the next few days.

Researchers have found a giant &lt;a href="w%3Aasteroid"&gt;asteroid&lt;/a&gt; impact crater under the Wilkes Land ice sheet of &lt;a href="w%3AAntarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; and it may have been responsible for creating the conditions in which dinosaurs evolved, but may also have been the cause of a mass extinction.

"This Wilkes Land impact is much bigger than the impact that killed the dinosaurs, and probably would have caused catastrophic damage at the time," said Ohio State University Professor of geological sciences, Ralph von Fres.

"All the environmental changes that would have resulted from the impact would have created a highly caustic environment that was really hard to endure. So it makes sense that a lot of life went extinct at that time," added von Fres.

The crater is over 300 miles wide and was made about 250 million years ago by an asteroid nearly 30 miles wide. Researchers say that it may have caused an Earth-wide &lt;a href="w%3AExtinction%20Level%20Event"&gt;Extinction Level Event&lt;/a&gt; (ELE), but also may have created the conditions under which dinosaurs evolved. The species that benefited include the archosaurs, the immediate ancestors of the dinosaurs.

It is thought that nearly 96% of Earth's ocean life and at least 70% of animals on land were made extinct. The impact itself may also have caused the supercontinent &lt;a href="w%3AGondwana"&gt;Gondwana&lt;/a&gt; to break, ultimately forming &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Bush calls for ban on gay marriage</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%20calls%20for%20ban%20on%20gay%20marriage&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; used his weekly radio address to propose the country's Constitution be amended to ban same-sex marriages. 

Mr. Bush formally defined marriage as a "union between a man and a woman" and said that an amendment was needed because the presence of "activist" courts left him with no alternative. He also stated that, "Ages of experience have taught us that the commitment of a husband and a wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society." 

Democrats have accused the government of using this as a smokescreen to divert attention from more important issues. Senate Minority Leader &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; said, "Bush Republicans would rather focus on purely divisive maneuvers than real solutions that address the growing energy crisis."

The President may be able to focus attention on a subject of his choosing at a time when an energy crisis or the war in Iraq may be a distraction for his Republicans and a vote-winner for Democrats.

A recent Gallup poll showed that 59% of Americans were against validating gay marriages by law. It is possible the Republicans will use this finding to gain a political edge come election time. An amendment such as one to ban gay marriage may not pass, but some assert this will be a vote-winner for the Republicans during the mid-term polls in November.

Any such amendment would need two-thirds approval in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; (290 out of 435) and the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; (67 out of 100) as well as the approval of three-fourths of the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20state"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20state%20legislatures%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;legislatures&lt;/a&gt; (38 out of 50). Currently, the Republican Party holds 231 seats in the House and 55 seats in the Senate, and has majority control of 20 state legislatures. A similar amendment was defeated in 2004.

An &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; government volcanologist reports that &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Merapi"&gt;Mount Merapi&lt;/a&gt; spewed lava and ash many times on Saturday, renewing fears of a devastating volcanic eruption.

Government geologist Subandriyo said that Merapi's lava dome has swelled 56 feet (17 m) in the past week to a height of 330 feet (100 m), raising fears that it could collapse and release a &lt;a href="w%3Apyroclastic%20flow"&gt;pyroclastic flow&lt;/a&gt; of hot gases and rock fragments burning everything in its path. The quake is believed to contribute to the growing instability of the lava dome, scientists said.

The mountain also sent about 90 trails of molten lava down its western slope on Thursday, said geologist Tri Yani.

The announcement comes one week after a &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Java%20earthquake"&gt;6.3 magnitude earthquake&lt;/a&gt; struck the city of Yogyakarta, killing at least 6,000 people and injuring tens of thousands more. Since then, the region has experienced over one thousand aftershocks - most were weak, but some were strong enough to jolt villagers awake in the area.

Villagers in the vicinity of the mountain have started performing ancient religious rituals aimed at averting an eruption. The royally appointed guardian of the mountain, "Mbah" Maridjan, was reported to have led a silent procession of about 100 people on a march around a village near the volcano.

Eight oil workers who were kidnapped from a Bulford Dolphin oil platform off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; on Friday have been freed. One &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; and six &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;Britons&lt;/a&gt; were among those freed and were "in good health." The Movement for the Emancipation for the Niger Delta was thought to have been behind the crime, but deny any involvement or connection.

"All the hostages have been released. They are with the governor now [and are] looking very fine," said spokesman for the state of &lt;a href="w%3ABayelsa%20State"&gt;Bayelsa&lt;/a&gt; in southern Nigeria, Ekiyor Welson.

Earlier reports stated that all 8 hostages were freed, but spokespeople for the Nigerian Police later withdrew that statement and said that only 2 had been freed and talk lead to the rest of the hostages being freed. The companies that the former hostages work for have denied paying for their freedom. 

Those responsible for the kidnappings are not yet known and officials have not released the names of any of the hostages.

The &lt;a href="Britain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Crown%20Prosecution%20Service"&gt;Crown Prosecution Service&lt;/a&gt; (CPS) has said people are being sold into the sex trade in auctions held at British airports.

Nazir Afzal, the CPS director, says British airports are becoming crime hotspots and "We are now seeing 'slave auctions' being held in public places at airports where brothel keepers are bidding for women destined for prostitution."

The people being traded are said to include those of Eastern European origin. Airports mentioned included Britain's "big three": &lt;a href="Gatwick"&gt;Gatwick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow"&gt;Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Stansted%20Airport"&gt;Stansted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Brain"&gt;Tim Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGloucestershire"&gt;Gloucestershire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; chief constable in charge of an investigation called "Operation Pentameter," said there might be hundreds of foreign slaves living in Britain.

A world-scale criminal activity, police have said men or women who have visited brothels where they suspect people have been coerced into prostitution should contact the authorities in confidence.

The scandal in which British airports have become key crossing points in slave markets is expected to be discussed more fully at a CPS conference on Monday.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iran%20warns%20disruption%20of%20oil%20may%20be%20a%20consequence%20of%20U.S.%20%26quot%3Bwrong%20moves%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Ayatollah &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;, the supreme leader of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, has said that the oil flow between Iran and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; will be "at serious risk" if any "wrong move" is made against the country.

"We are committed to our ideals and national interests and if anyone threatens our national interests it will face the Iranian nations' wrath," said Khamenei during the 17th anniversary ceremony of the death of the former spiritual leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

"If the U.S. makes a wrong move against Iran, energy flow in the region will be definitely put at serious risk. You [the United States] can never maintain security for [the distribution of] energy in the region. A country with war criminal records such as the US should never again take the term human rights into its mouth. We are a peace-willing nation and our only weapon is the belief and resistance of our people," added Khamenei.

However, the U.S. has stated that it wants to resolve its issues with Iran by diplomatic means, but it may use military force, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States-Iran%20relations%23Claims%20of%20plans%20for%20use%20of%20nuclear%20weapons%20against%20Iran"&gt;including nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;, describing these as "options on the table". The U.S. has expressed a willingness to join talks with Iran along with &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, but said that it will do so only if Iran ends its uranium enrichment program. Iran has responded by expressing a willingness to hold talks over matters of "mutual concern," but rejected the call to halt enrichment.

"We shouldn't put too much emphasis on a threat of this kind. After all, Iran is also very dependent on oil revenue," said Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; also adding that the United States will "not allow Iran to drag [out]" talks on its nuclear program. 

"We really do have to have this settled over a matter of weeks, not months, but the fact is there are two paths, and we hope they're going to choose the path that is a path away from confrontation and toward a solution," added Rice.

Iran is the fourth largest producer and supplier of crude oil in the world, it is party to the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt; and it has stated that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes and that it will "not start a war."

"We will never start a war. We have no intention of going to war with any government. We have no problem with the world. We are no threat whatsoever to the world and the world knows it... The other suggestion is that Iran is seeking a nuclear bomb. This is an irrelevant and wrong statement; it is a sheer lie. We do not need a nuclear bomb. We do not have any objectives or aspirations for which we will need to use a nuclear bomb. We consider using nuclear weapons against Islamic rules," said Khamenei.

Eight people were injured in an explosion outside a shopping mall in the &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; Mediterranean port of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMersin"&gt;Mersin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Saturday.

According to Dogan News Agency, the Governor of Mersin province Huseyin Aksoy said, "The explosion was caused by a remote-controlled bomb … connected to a mobile telephone." 

As shown on private news channel CNN Turk, the injured were carried on stretchers to waiting ambulances. Damages amounted to broken windows in the immediate area.

While radical Islamic, Kurdish, and left-wing militants are active in Turkey, there has been no claim of responsibility for the attack.

The two brothers who were arrested on Friday regarding intelligence of a &lt;a href="w%3Achemical%20bomb"&gt;chemical bomb&lt;/a&gt; plot in East &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; have denied all the accusations, according to their lawyers.

In relation to the accusations of manufacturing a chemical device, Kate Roxburgh, Mohammed Abdul Kahar's lawyer, said "(Kahar) says there's absolutely not a word of truth in any of it. He says the police are not going to find anything because there is nothing to find." 

Koyair's lawyer has denied his client has been involved in a terrorist plot.

The announcement comes after the dramatic events of Friday morning, where over 250 &lt;a href="w%3Apolice"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; officers were involved in a raid on a house in the &lt;a href="w%3AForest%20Gate"&gt;Forest Gate&lt;/a&gt; area of the city. The raid took place after &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asecurity%20services"&gt;security services&lt;/a&gt; received intelligence of a "viable" chemical device within the property.

Mohammed Abdul Kahar, aged 23, and his 20 year-old brother Abul Koyair were arrested in a dawn raid on Friday under the &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorism%20Act"&gt;Terrorism Act&lt;/a&gt; after several weeks of surveillance by &lt;a href="w%3AMI5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt;. During the operation, Kahar was shot in the shoulder. 

Early reports suggested that police were responsible for the injury, from which Kahar is now recovering. However, one source claims that it was actually Abul Koyair who pulled the trigger, accidentally wounding his brother in the panic - an allegation that Koyair has denied.

The brothers, who are both &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh"&gt;Bangladeshi&lt;/a&gt; origin, are being questioned today at London's high-security &lt;a href="w%3APaddington%20Green%20Police%20Station"&gt;Paddington Green Police Station&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, police officers are still searching the house for a device, which they believe to be a conventional &lt;a href="w%3Aexplosive"&gt;explosive&lt;/a&gt; with added chemical components.

Due to the ongoing investigations, there is still a large police presence at the residence, as well as a layer of sheeting surrounding the building. Despite the small yet ever-present chance of a chemical incident, other residents of the street have not been evacuated. 

In response to safety fears, police said that "nothing suspicious was found in an initial search of the house and that neighbours are not in danger."

BBC News reported that Health Secretary &lt;a href="w%3APatricia%20Hewitt"&gt;Patricia Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; was "keeping ministers informed" about the unfolding situation but would not comment about specific points of the investigation.

Portugal's national team defeated the Luxembourgish team by 3-0 yesterday, in Portugal's last game in preparation for the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2006 World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. Two goals of Simão and another of Figo resolved the game.

In the first part of the game, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALuiz%20Felipe%20Scolari"&gt;Scolari&lt;/a&gt;, the head coach of the team, used the same "eleven" players that were used on the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A2004%20European%20Football%20Championship"&gt;Euro 2004&lt;/a&gt;. At halftime, Scolari changed &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADeco"&gt;Deco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACostinha"&gt;Costinha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APedro%20Miguel%20Pauleta"&gt;Pauleta&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AH%C3%A9lder%20Postiga"&gt;Postiga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArmando%20Teixeira"&gt;Petit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASim%C3%A3o%20Sabrosa"&gt;Simão&lt;/a&gt;.

Simão was important for the win of the Portuguese team. After a few seconds in the game, the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASL%20Benfica"&gt;Benfica&lt;/a&gt;'s player scored the first goal of the game. At the 74th minute, Simão, taking a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Apenalty%20kick"&gt;penalty kick&lt;/a&gt; as the result of a foul committed against &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALu%C3%ADs%20Figo"&gt;Figo&lt;/a&gt;, scored the second goal.

The team’s captain, Figo, scored the last goal in the 84th minute.

The next game of the Portuguese national team will be on June 11 against &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAngola%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;, already at the 2006 World Cup. In Group D, Portugal and Angola will also face the national teams of Mexico and Iran.

Australian media reports that Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; is expected to push a nuclear energy inquiry through federal cabinet this week. Meanwhile, a list of possible sites for &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20reactors"&gt;nuclear reactors&lt;/a&gt; has been leaked by the Opposition to media. The locations, listed in 1997, include Adelaide, Darwin, Perth, Lucas Heights, Goulburn, Holsworthy, and Broken Hill in New South Wales and other sites.

&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Australian"&gt;West Australian (WA)&lt;/a&gt; premier &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Carpenter"&gt;Alan Carpenter&lt;/a&gt; says the list of fourteen potential sites were a "facade to soften up Western Australians into accepting a &lt;a href="w%3ARadioactive%20waste"&gt;nuclear waste&lt;/a&gt; dump." The WA Premier said people would not only be surprised but "stunned to learn that the federal cabinet considered possible sites... without disclosing them to any state government." 

Mr Carpenter said in a media release that the document mentions a site near &lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; airport. "People should wake up to what's happening around Australia, particularly in WA," said Mr. Carpenter. "Only a few weeks ago, we had three prominent WA Liberal MPs supporting a nuclear waste dump in WA," he said. "This is all a facade in the Howard Government's push to soften up West Australians for a nuclear waste dump." 

Premier Carpenter, whose &lt;a href="w%3AALP"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; government stridently opposes &lt;a href="w%3Auranium%20mining"&gt;uranium mining&lt;/a&gt; in WA, stated his opposition to a nuclear waste dump: "I vehemently oppose the prospect of our State becoming the dumping ground for the world's nuclear waste and that is what will happen if we allow uranium mining in WA. The evidence is mounting and indisputable."

The &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australian&lt;/a&gt; Government has ruled out any possible nuclear power plant in SA. "A nuclear power plant would bankrupt our state," SA Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Rann"&gt;Mike Rann&lt;/a&gt; said. "It would not be commercially viable and would not, in my view, be acceptable to the public. Nuclear power plants need giant populations to sustain them, there is no-one coming to me from the commercial sector or the mining industry or anywhere else, suggesting a nuclear power plant."

Earlier, Foreign Affairs Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; said South Australia should build a nuclear power station to run a desalination plant. Premier Rann dismissed the idea as ridiculous and said comments by Mr Downer highlight divisions within Federal Cabinet. He said Mr Downer is at odds with the Federal Finance Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Minchin"&gt;Nick Minchin&lt;/a&gt;, who says the high costs of nuclear power would rule it out.

Mr Rann says South Australia will not allow nuclear power. "For once I'm agreeing with Nick Minchin," he said. "I think Nick Minchin is right that a nuclear power plant isn't necessary and won't happen and I think that Alexander Downer is having a bit of a lend of him." 

&lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria's&lt;/a&gt; Energy Minister Theo Theophanous said nuclear energy in Australia did not make sense when the cost and problems of waste disposal were considered. Mr Theophanous has rejected a report that found nuclear power could be competitive with conventional energy generation if it was subsided with help from a taxpayer subsidy.

A recent report found nuclear power could compete with gas or coal-fired electricity if taxpayers helped to pay for it or shouldered the risk of its production. The ANSTO report found nuclear plants could be built in the next 10 to 15 years and an Australian version would cost about $2.5 billion to establish. To make it viable, taxpayers would pay hundreds of million towards start-up costs, said the report.

But Mr Theophanous said Victoria had already had concluded the nuclear proposal did not add up. "I had my department look at this and provide a report to me more than a year ago in relation to the prospect of nuclear power," he said. "The problem is a commercial one as much as anything else. It costs roughly double the price to produce power out of nuclear energy. If you're going to pay double the price, why not put in wind farms? Why not use renewable energy, which is even cheaper than nuclear energy?" said Mr Theophanous .

The Victoria Government urges householders to reduce greenhouse emissions by reducing daily energy consumption. A new campaign identifies simple measures residents can adopt to cut power bills and greenhouse emissions, including turning the heating thermostat to no more than 20C, washing clothes in cold water and turning appliances off at the switch when they are not being used.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; has also declared his opposition to nuclear power. He said no nuclear power stations would be built in NSW as long as he is premier. Mr Iemma urged state opposition leader Peter Debnam to join him in opposing the construction of nuclear power plants in NSW. "While ever I'm premier of NSW there won't be any nuclear power plants in NSW," he told reporters.

&lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; says he "would not jeopardize the state's coal industry by supporting a nuclear power plant." Mr. Beattie has ruled out uranium mining in Queensland to protect the state's huge coal industry. He said he would not support a nuclear power plant. "The State Government would not support it," Mr. Beattie said. 

"We have the power to block them and we would block them, we would not support nuclear power. Why would we have a nuclear reactor in competition with the coal industry?" Mr. Beattie told media.

<h2>Climate change</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Conservation%20Foundation"&gt;Australian Conservation Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (ACF) chairman Don Henry says a nuclear debate must consider &lt;a href="w%3Aclimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;. "If the inquiry is just about nuclear power it will be a waste of taxpayers money because nuclear power is too dangerous, too dirty, and too slow to tackle climate change," he said. "If the inquiry is going to be fairdinkum, it needs to look at that issue: what can we do right now to tackle climate change in Australia?"

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; climate change and energy spokesperson &lt;a href="w%3ASenator%20Christine%20Milne"&gt;Senator Christine Milne&lt;/a&gt; said in a media release: "Instead of turning to nuclear power, Australia should ratify the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Protocol"&gt;Kyoto Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, invest in renewable energy, adopt a national energy efficiency target and improve public transport. "Several studies examining options to achieve deep cuts in Australian greenhouse emissions all show this goal can be achieved, cost effectively, without resorting to nuclear power." 

Greens Senator Rachel Siewert says: "The nuclear industry is engaged in a concerted effort to be given one last chance for redemption... yet every step of the nuclear fuel chain, from mining, milling, enrichment and operating reactors to waste storage, is subject to the same human error, material breakdowns, complexity and incompetence as any other area of human endeavour." said Senator Siewert. "The current inventory of nuclear waste will already present our descendents with a monstrous intergenerational headache. Allowing so much as a kilogram more of this material to be produced is simply immoral." 

The ACF say "nuclear energy is not a solution to climate change." ACF President Professor Ian Lowe says "Nuclear is too slow to provide any legitimate answer to climate change or to energy security for the developing world." The ACF report that, as an energy source globally, uranium provides less power than renewables do. "Uranium is inextricably linked to very serious environmental and health problems via nuclear weapons and radioactive waste. There is nothing ideological about opposing its use..."

<h2>Nuclear inquiry</h2>
The Australian Newspaper reports that Prime Minister Howard is preparing to appoint chief scientist Jim Peacock, a supporter of nuclear power, and other high-level nuclear industry experts to the team. The public inquiry, to be undertaken by three or four selected experts is expected to "examine the economics of nuclear energy, health, safety, environmental and proliferation issues as well as waste and storage." The taskforce will take submissions and is expected to prepare a report to Government within four or five months, with the Government's response early in 2007.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Nuclear%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Organisation"&gt;Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO)&lt;/a&gt;, Ian Smith, says "at least three" power plants would be required. Mr Howard said the ANSTO report challenged the view that the cost of nuclear power was prohibitive. Dr Smith told a Senate estimates hearing that Australia would require "multiple power stations to make the industry viable".

Federal Industry Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Macfarlane"&gt;Ian Macfarlane&lt;/a&gt; said the nuclear energy inquiry would also include consideration of &lt;a href="w%3AEnriched%20uranium"&gt;nuclear enrichment&lt;/a&gt; plants in Australia. Mr Macfarlane said he would consider a nuclear power plant in his own Toowoomba electorate. 

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; insisted he would not be deterred by the unpopularity of nuclear power.

120 soldiers of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APortuguese%20Republican%20National%20Guard"&gt;Portuguese Republican National Guard&lt;/a&gt; (GNR) landed this Sunday morning in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABaucau"&gt;Baucau&lt;/a&gt;, the second-largest city in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;, after their departure to East Timor had been delayed twice due to difficulties in arranging adequate air transportation. The soldiers were received by the Portuguese ambassador to East Timor, local representatives and hundreds of locals.

After the landing of the aircraft that transported the Portuguese soldiers at approximately 7 a.m. local time (2200 Saturday, &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), hundreds of people started to enter the runway with flags of East Timor and Portugal. In addition to the hundreds of locals that were expecting the GNR soldiers, the Portuguese ambassador, João Ramos Pinto, and other local authorities received the soldiers.

Both the population and the authorities believe that the presence of the GNR troops, many of whom have also served in Iraq, may be essential to allow the inhabitants of Dili to return to their homes.

A Portuguese military column then left at the beginning of the afternoon, from Baucau to Dili, transporting the 120 soldiers and an medical team of Portugal's National Medical Emergency Institute, INEM. Now in Dili, the Portuguese contingent's main objectives will be to provide security in the city and its suburbs, and to train Dili's police force.

The destruction of many public buildings in the last days forced a move of the Portuguese headquarters from a Dili police station to the Dili Hotel 2001, a touristy complex just outside the East Timor's capital. The hotel's gymnasium will be converted to a command post. Some of the other hotel divisions have already a infirmary, set by a INEM team, and a communications center, set by a &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APortugal%20Telecom"&gt;Portugal Telecom&lt;/a&gt; technical team, working.

An &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAntonov%20An-124"&gt;Antonov An-124&lt;/a&gt; airplane is expected to leave &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALisbon"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; next Tuesday with the rest of equipment for the Portuguese force, mainly vehicles, six &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVan"&gt;vans&lt;/a&gt; of public order, five jeeps, three pickup trucks, and six armoured vehicles, like those used in Iraq by the Republican National Guard.

Unlike the troops from New Zealand and Malaysia, who are under the direct command of the Australians, Portugal refused to put its troops under Australian command. This decision was announced by Portugal's Foreign Minister, Diogo Freitas do Amaral, during a news conference in Lisbon this Friday. Freitas do Amaral added that early that day a meeting was held between him, an Australian General, and a second unidentified person.

The Australian mission "was expressly sent from London to Lisbon to ask for clarifications" to a agreement that was signed last Thursday (June 1) in Dili, between Portugal and East Timor, reaffirming that the GNR group has its own operational command.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJos%C3%A9%20Ramos%20Horta"&gt;José Ramos Horta&lt;/a&gt; told Lusa News Agency that the soldiers of the GNR "have to start acting with autonomy and hardness" in the entire city, Dili, to reestablish the law and order. The Foreign Minister also told the Agency that he "respects" the decision of the Portuguese government to put the GNR force out of the Australian command of the international force, affirming that is essential to reach an agreement this Monday, so that the Portuguese Republican National Guard "can be operational."

Ramos Horta added that this would be the position that he will defend in a meeting this Thursday morning with the diplomats of Australia, Portugal, New Zealand and Malaysia. This meeting will define the way that the forces of the four countries will work on the country, having the troops of Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia working under a single Australian command, and the Portuguese force working in an "autonomous" way and reporting directly to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APresident%20of%20East%20Timor"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AXanana%20Gusm%C3%A3o"&gt;Xanana Gusmão&lt;/a&gt;.

The East Timorese Minister, guarded by Australian elite soldiers, and travelling in a civilian car, heard complaints about the lack of protection given by the 1.300 Australian soldiers already at the city, while saying "that is obvious that there's a arousing frustration of the population before the apparent impunity with those groups that continue to destroy".

The Portuguese military are in East Timor in response to a request of help made by the East Timor authorities to Australia, Portugal, New Zealand, and Malaysia. This is the second time that the special operations team of the GNR has been to this former Portuguese colony, after being in East Timor between February, 2000 and June, 2002.

An armed gang killed a retired &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Police%20Service"&gt;IPS&lt;/a&gt; officer and looted cash and valuables from passengers in an air-conditioned compartment of the Rajendra Nagar - Lokmanya Tilak Superfast Express near the Patna junction, an official said. The six robbers, who were armed with five guns were arrested by the Government Railway Police Karbigahiya and Mithapur localities. Superintendent of Railway Police G.P Sinha said that Anil Kumar Singh was shot when he resisted the gang's attempts to steal his belongings. 

As the news spread, railway personnel rushed Singh to a Patna Medical College hospital where he was declared dead. The GRP acted on a tip provided by one Rinku, who was among those arrested in the train itself, and took his fellow thieves into custody. Some articles, including wallets and suitcases, looted from the passengers during raids were recovered by the GRP. 

Anil Kumar Singh had retired from the police force at the rank of DIG. He was also a practicing lawyer at the Patna High Court. Mintu, the attacker who had fired at Singh was also arrested. The train was allowed to resume its journey after being stopped for a few hours at the Patna Junction.

Gunmen in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; have killed 19 &lt;a href="w%3ATurkomans%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Turkomen&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href="w%3AKurd"&gt;Kurds&lt;/a&gt; and injured one while sparing the lives of four &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Islam"&gt;Sunnis&lt;/a&gt;. The deaths came after three minibuses were ambushed at a bogus "checkpoint" in &lt;a href="w%3ADiyala%20Governorate"&gt;Diyala province&lt;/a&gt;.

A police official said the victims were taken "one by one from their cars and executed." 12 students, as young as 15, and older men were among the dead in the attack, 55 kilometres northeast of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;.

Some were shot as they tried to flee the scene. &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; news agency has released photographs that showed six of the victims were shot in the chest.

The Mayor of Qara Tappah, Serwan Shokir, said the buses were carrying commuters from his town to &lt;a href="w%3ABaqouba"&gt;Baqouba&lt;/a&gt; where the students were going to take exams.

Police questioned the Sunni &lt;a href="w%3AArab"&gt;Arabs&lt;/a&gt; who were not killed by the gunmen about the incident.

The killings in Diyala, an ethnically mixed part of Iraq, come as Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt; is working to find interior and defence ministers for the fledgling US-supported &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a%20Islam"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt;-led democracy.

On the tactics used by the terrorists, police said they had created their own checkpoint near Udhaim and had stopped the vehicles to kill the passengers.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; announced on Sunday that his government would be reversing 13 controversial road changes and alterations that were carried out to force traffic into the &lt;a href="w%3ACross%20City%20Tunnel"&gt;Cross City Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;.

The road changes were initially approved by the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority and formed part of the contract with the Cross City Motorway (who operate the tunnel).

The government wished also for the company to lower the toll from &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$3.37 to the $2.90 discounted toll that will expire at midnight Mon. Jan 5.

Cross City Motorway wanted &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$96 Million as compensation but the government's highest offer was only $30 Million. Cross City Motorway were being "greedy" said NSW Roads minister, Eric Roozendaal.

NSW Premier Morris Iemma said that his government had tried to negotiate a suitable compensation package. "We've negotiated over the last three months in good faith. We've done our best ... to reach an arrangement satisfactory to all -- to taxpayers to motorists and one which the company could live with" he said. 

Despite the government walking away from negotiations the company could still come to the government with an offer, Mr Iemma said.

"Obviously, the ball's in the company's court in relation to their response," he said. 

The Premier said it would be wise for the company to continue the reduced toll. "It is in their commercial interest to ensure that motorists have got incentives to use this road."

The NRMA, the peak motoring organisation in NSW, also believes that the toll should remain at its discounted rate. "It's now up to the Cross City Tunnel operators to also make sure motorists get a fair deal by only charging a fair toll and not raising the toll back up to that exorbitant level it was before" said NRMA president Alan Evans.

Mr Iemma said he expected there might be a lawsuit made by Cross City Motorway against his government but believes his government is in a good position to defend any claims for damages.

Cross City Motorway is expected to respond on the issue today.

A new report, titled "Global Deserts Outlook," has been released on &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Environment%20Day"&gt;World Environment Day&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Environment%20Programme"&gt;United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)&lt;/a&gt;. The report suggests that the world's deserts face dramatic changes as a result of global &lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;: high water demands, tourism and salt contamination of irrigated soils. Desert margins and mountainous areas within deserts that have been important for people, wildlife and water supplies for millennia, are under particular threat, say UNEP.

2006 is the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;' International Year of &lt;a href="w%3ADesert"&gt;Deserts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADesertification"&gt;Desertification&lt;/a&gt;. Yet deserts could become the "carbon-free power houses of the 21st century," some experts believe. They argue an area 800 by 800 km of desert, such as the &lt;a href="w%3ASahara"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt;, could capture the solar energy to generate all the world's electricity needs - and more. 

The report, prepared by experts from across the globe, flags options that may help governments and relevant bodies deliver a more sustainable future for the Earth's desert regions.

"There are many popular and sometimes misplaced views of deserts which this report either confirms or overturns. Far from being barren wastelands, they emerge as biologically, economically and culturally dynamic while being increasingly subject to the impacts and pressures of the modern world," said Shafqat Kakakhel, UNEP's Officer in Charge and Deputy Executive Director. 

"If the huge, solar-power potential of deserts can be economically harnessed the world has a future free from fossil fuels. And tourism based around desert nature can, if sensitively managed, deliver new prospects and perspectives for people in some of the poorest parts of the world," said Mr Kakakhel.

Almost one-quarter of the earth's land surface – some 33.7 million square kilometres – has been defined as "desert" in some sense. These deserts are inhabited by over 500 million people, significantly more than previously thought. In many parts of the world desert cores remain pristine, representing some of the planet's "last remaining areas of total wilderness," stated the UNEP in a news release.

Desert species are on the brink of extinction the Global Deserts Outlook reports. At risk animals include various species of &lt;a href="w%3AGazelle"&gt;Gazelle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOryx"&gt;Oryx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAddax"&gt;Addax&lt;/a&gt;, Arabian &lt;a href="w%3ATahr"&gt;Tahr&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABarbary%20sheep"&gt;Barbary sheep&lt;/a&gt; as well as one of the falconers favourite prey, the &lt;a href="w%3AHoubara%20bustard"&gt;Houbara&lt;/a&gt;. "At greatest risk are the few patches of dry woodlands associated with desert mountain habitats which may decline by up to 3.5 per cent per year," said the study.

As a result of their valuable water supplies being diverted to domestic or agricultural use, desert wetlands, fed by the large rivers crossing deserts, are probably the most threatened ecosystem. Probable impacts include those created by roads, settlement expansion and other infrastructure developments around areas of desert montane. By 2050 the report estimates that desert wilderness - those areas where there are no nearby roads - will decline from just under 60 per cent of the current total desert area to just over 30 per cent.

The pharmaceutical potential of desert plants has yet to be tapped, suggests the report. Scientists across the globe are analysing many desert plants for potential medicinal compounds - including anti-cancer and anti-malarial substances, antioxidants, as well as appetite suppressants.

<h2>Impact of climate change</h2>

The &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change"&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)&lt;/a&gt;, who advise governments and the United Nations, have reported that temperatures in deserts could rise by an average of as much as five to seven degrees by 2100. The problem, UNEP say, will almost certainly be compounded by the melting of glaciers - whose waters sustain many deserts. 

The impacts of climate change include the transformation of semi-arid rangelands into deserts, UNEP reports. They say water supplies are under threat from salinization and pollution by pesticides and herbicides, and that rising water tables beneath irrigated soils has led to more salinization of soils.

In some coastal areas ground-water supplies have been contaminated as seawater invades subsurface waters, the report shows. Large rivers that run through deserts have supported desert people for millennia, but many have been dammed, with water loss downstream having led to serious impacts on flood plains and river ecology.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s biggest charity organisations are refusing to cooperate with the &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Awelfare"&gt;welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reform rules. The federal government expects about 18,000 people a year will lose their payments for eight weeks when the new welfare-to-work regime comes into force on July 1.

Only 23 organisations have signed up to a government registry to "financially case manage" the most vulnerable unemployed, who will be left without income under tougher rules. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrotherhood%20of%20St%20Laurence"&gt;The Brotherhood of St Laurence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has told Fairfax newspapers it will not participate because it believes the welfare shake-up is unjust.

About 18,000 people a year, according to the Government, are expected to lose their benefit for infringements of job search rules. Those with dependants, and those deemed "exceptionally vulnerable," will be eligible for case management by a charity on the government register.

But the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Vincent%20de%20Paul%20Society"&gt;St Vincent de Paul Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have refused to register. The moral dilemma of whether to become an agent for a policy some believe is "unjust" may be contemplated by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASalvation%20Army"&gt;Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and others.

Charities will be paid $650 to manage each eligible unemployed person it assigns them, the Government has said. It wants charities to assess a person's "essential" expenses and notify &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentrelink"&gt;Centrelink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which would then decide whether or not to pay the bills.

Director of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnitingCare%20Australia"&gt;UnitingCare Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Lin Hatfield Dodds said she did not expect many of the 400 agencies in her network to sign up to be case managers. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMission%20Australia"&gt;Mission Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has also not registered. Sue Leppert, executive director of Anglicare Australia, said many of her member agencies would definitely not register and others were grappling with the issue.

Many Australian charities strongly oppose the policy of stripping all income from unemployed people for infringements. There is much concern that sole parents and many disabled people will be diverted from specific pensions to the Newstart Allowance. They will then be subject to stringent job search rules, potential infringements and harsh penalties.

Charities also have been alarmed that under the new policy, people can immediately lose their payment for eight weeks if they refuse a job offer, are dismissed for misconduct, or are voluntarily unemployed.

The executive director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence Tony Nicholson said the policy was unjust. "First they suffer an eight-week suspension of payment, and to add insult to injury they have to justify to some case manager their expenditure on their meagre income."

Sole parents whose youngest child has turned six, and disabled people who are assessed as capable of working 15 hours per week, will no longer be granted a pension under the Welfare to Work plan.

At the launch of a nation-wide advertising campaign for the government reform, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20Human%20Services%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Minister for Human Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Hockey"&gt;Joe Hockey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said: "the advertising campaign is part of an education process designed to encourage more people on income support to move into work." "The Howard Government is investing $3.7 billion to deliver greater employment services and other assistance, including rehabilitation, to those people required to look for work," said Minister Hockey.

A spokesman for the Minister said the Government was trying to ensure "rents will be paid and kids won't get tossed out of home" if parents failed to meet their job search obligations.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; doctors have successfully transplanted a beating heart into the chest of a 58-year old man, the first operation of its kind in the United Kingdom. 

The "trial" surgery was performed at Papworth Hospital just outside of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt; in Cambridge. The operation could be "equivalent if not superior" to the current transplanting methods, doctors said. The method has only been performed two other times, in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.

Usually hearts would be injected with &lt;a href="w%3Apotassium"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, which stopped the heart from beating, after which it would be covered with ice. This put the heart in "suspended animation" but gave doctors only a six-hour window to examine and transplant, doctors said.

"Normally the heart is in suspended animation but they still start to deteriorate," said Professor Bruce Rosengard, head of the team of doctors who operated on the man.

The new method involves connecting the heart to a machine that pumps warm, oxygen enriched blood through the heart. The heart is able to keep beating with this method. The new process allows surgeons to look more closely and longer at the heart for any signs of damage. It also allows them to find a match for whoever may need it.

"Once hearts are hooked up to the device, which takes about 20 minutes, any deterioration is fully reversed. If we look at resuscitating hearts that are currently unusable, the number of transplants could be tripled or quadrupled," added Rosengard. "The goal of this trial is to demonstrate that this is at least equivalent if not superior," he added.

The director of transplants in the United Kingdom Chris Rudge also says that doctors are working on using the same new method with different human organs.

"In the longer term it is not just hearts that can be handled by such systems but other organs too, particularly the liver," said Rudge.

The 58-year old man is doing "extremely well. At his exam one week after the operation, all his functions were absolutely normal," Rosengard said.

At least 19 more operations are planned in the U.K. and in Germany.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Scotsman"&gt;The Scotsman&lt;/a&gt;, former US intelligence officials said a secret operation to support the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20for%20the%20Restoration%20of%20Peace%20and%20Counter-Terrorism"&gt;Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism&lt;/a&gt; in war-torn &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt; appeared to involve both the CIA and US military. The officials spoke under condition of anonymity.

The warlord factions that &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Mogadishu"&gt;drove the US and UN troops out of Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt; in October 1993 led to the withdrawal of American forces from Somalia in 1994. This switch in allegiances from President Clinton's administration have so far not stopped the &lt;a href="w%3ASharia"&gt;sharia&lt;/a&gt; courts, who have gained control of the capital, &lt;a href="w%3AMogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt;.

A key objective of US policy in the &lt;a href="w%3AHorn%20of%20Africa"&gt;Horn of Africa&lt;/a&gt; region is the US fear of Somalia becoming a safe haven for &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. Somalia experts in US say, according to &lt;a href="w%3Anationmedia.com"&gt;The East African newspaper&lt;/a&gt;, that the militias linked to the sharia courts have support among Mogadishu residents. Mohamed Asser, resident, said. "The era of warlords in Somalia is over. This morning Mogadishu is under only one hand, the Islamic courts."

John Prendergast, who served on the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20National%20Security%20Council"&gt;National Security Council staff&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Clinton administration&lt;/a&gt; and now tracks Somalia for the think-tank &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Crisis%20Group"&gt;International Crisis Group&lt;/a&gt; said that three alliance leaders recently told him that they were receiving funds from the &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;. "Our assessment is between $100,000 and $150,000 per month," Prendergast said.

Giving money to warlord factions would violate the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;’ arms embargo against Somalia. The United Nations, which is administering the embargo, is investigating how the warlord alliance came to receive a shipment of weapons. Prendergast believes this policy has resulted in an backlash: "By circumventing the new government and going straight to individual warlords, the US is perpetuating and even deepening Somalia's fundamental problems, and compromising long-term efforts to combat extremism."

The armed militias behind the Islamic courts also are said to receive funds from unnamed sources.

Michael Zorick, former Somalia political officer in the US embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; argues that US support of the Somali Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism had increased support for Islamists. According to Zorick, the United States should give more support to the Somali government and push for peace. The analyst's advice went against the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;, which recently had the regional expert reassigned to &lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;. 

William Bellamy, US ambassador to Kenya, a country that shares a northern border with Somalia, was willing only to confirm American diplomatic support for the warlords in Somalia. "Lost in the diplomacy and politics is the fact that the US is reaching out in many ways to help improve the lives of ordinary Somalis," Mr Bellamy said. This includes $84 million food aid and many years of peace initiatives. The CIA declined to comment and US government officials refused to discuss any secret US involvement in Somalia, strategically placed in the Horn of Africa.

The Somali government, the Transitional Central Government in city of &lt;a href="w%3ABaidoa"&gt;Baidoa&lt;/a&gt;, a bystander to the recent events, is the 14th of such authorities in Somalia since the overthrow of dictator &lt;a href="w%3ASiad%20Barre"&gt;Mohamed Siad Barre&lt;/a&gt; in 1991. The government is currently seeking talks with the Islamists groups with a view to establishing peace for the country.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Mercury%20News"&gt;The Mercury News&lt;/a&gt; the Bush administration has deployed about 1,500 US troops in the tiny nation of &lt;a href="w%3ADjibouti"&gt;Djibouti&lt;/a&gt;, on Somalia's northern border. That seems to be a part of a US regional strategy if the warlords lose on battlefield.

On June 5, gunmen, who had posed as police officers, raided a bus station in central &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; and captured 50 people. Attackers raided bus stations and seized travellers and local vendors. This happened a day after 21 people were dragged off buses and killed in Diyala province. 

Of the 50 people, there are two Syrians and one is an Interior Ministry official. The gunmen rounded up people from the area including people from the many travel agencies that populate the area. The people were then herded into cars and taken away. 

"They took all the workers from the company and nearby shops," says Haidar Mohammed Eleibi, who works for the Swan Transportation Co. in the Salihiya business district. Most of the buses at the station were headed to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Garcia"&gt;Alan Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, the former president of &lt;a href="w%3APeru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; in 1985-1990, has once again won the &lt;a href="w%3APeruvian%20national%20election%2C%202006"&gt;presidential election of Peru&lt;/a&gt; in a runoff against candidate &lt;a href="w%3AOllanta%20Humala"&gt;Ollanta Humala&lt;/a&gt;. Garcia received the majority of the votes in Lima and most of Peru's urban areas, while Humala received most of the votes from the rural areas. 

Alan Garcia's first presidential term ended in economic disaster and hyper-inflation and resulted in the popular support for the election of President Fujimori. After his disastrous first term, very few would have considered Garcia's comeback to be possible. 

Many in Peru did not like Ollanta Humala's relationship with Venezuelan president &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; whom they felt was interfering with Peruvian affairs. Garcia and Chavez have had a clash of words many times before this election and many saw a vote for Garcia as a vote against Humala and Chavez.

Humala accepted his defeat and saluted Garcia and his party. This statement was, however, rejected by Humala's spokeswoman.

Gunmen forced their way into a building used by Palestinian Television in Khan Younis today. Approximately 15 gunmen fired toward the sky as they stormed the building shouting, "You are collaborators. You are biased. You are dirty people" the staff reported.

The armed men then discharged their weapons wildly into cameras, computers and other equipment leaving one employee of the transmission centre to say, "The whole place is ruined." After wreaking havoc for several minutes and beating up a cameraman, the vandals left.

Palestine TV stopped broadcasting for 30 minutes in protest at the attack. 

According to Palestinian President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the opposition &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; party, the &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; government has until midday (0900 GMT) on Tuesday to agree with a manifesto that touches on an issue at the heart of Palestinian politics. The script indirectly recognises Israel as it calls for a Palestinian state to exist beside Israel. 

Hamas came to power in the January 2006 elections, overcoming the incumbent Fatah parliament. The party denied being involved in the attack on the television station.

Abbas has threatened a July referendum on the manifesto if parliament does not accept the treatise by the specified time.

US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; is pushing for a national ban on gay marriage, as the US Senate opened a debate on a constitutional amendment to prohibit &lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;. "Changing the definition of marriage would undermine the structure of the family," said Bush, who raised the issue at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. 

"The &lt;a href="w%3ADefense_of_Marriage_Act"&gt;Defense of Marriage Act&lt;/a&gt; declares that no state is required to accept another state's definition of marriage. If that act is overturned by the courts, then marriage recognized in one city or state may have to be recognized as marriages everywhere else," said the President.

Bush criticized judges who overturned state laws. State legislatures "are being thwarted by activist judges who are overturning the expressed will of their people... Marriage is the most fundamental institution of civilization, and it should not be redefined by activist judges," he said. The "cornerstone of a healthy society" is traditional marriage, Bush declared, and the issue should be returned - "back where it belongs: in the hands of the American people."

At the White House, Bush told supporters of the amendment that he's "proud to stand" with them. His comments come as the U.S. Senate starts three days of debate on the measure. All Senate Democrats, except Ben Nelson of Nebraska, oppose the ban.

Whilst many in the Senate do support Bush's amendments, in the final throes of an election cycle, few are prepared to support the bill. "A vote for this amendment is a vote for bigotry pure and simple," said Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, where the state Supreme Court legalized gay marriages in 2003.

"Marriage between one man and one woman does a better job protecting children better than any other institution humankind has devised," said Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. "As such, marriage as an institution should be protected, not redefined."

Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who says he believes marriage is the union of a man and a woman, said he nonetheless would vote against the amendment on a test vote Wednesday.

"The reason for this debate is to divide our society, to pit one against another," Reid said in remarks prepared for delivery on the Senate floor. "This is another one of the president's efforts to frighten, to distort, to distract, and to confuse America. It is this administration's way of avoiding the tough, real problems that American citizens are confronted with each and every day."

Bush administration officials say Iran should be given time to consider a package of incentives aimed at halting the country's nuclear enrichment and reprocessing activities.

Tehran will need some time to mull over the offer, and the first response may not be the last word, says White House spokesman Tony Snow.

"I would caution against leaping to conclusions, until the leadership in Iran has actually had an opportunity to look over the packages of incentives and disincentives offered by the EU-3 with the support of the United States," he said.

The plan was drafted by the three European nations that have been negotiating the nuclear issue with &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; - with the backing of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. Details of the package have not been formally released.

During a session with reporters, Snow downplayed comments made over the weekend by Ayatollah &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;. Iran's supreme leader said the flow of Iranian oil would be disrupted if the United States makes - what he called - a wrong move.

The White House spokesman predicted there would be a number of statements coming out of Iran before Tehran gives its final answer. He said, at the moment, the White House is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but hopeful.

"It is easy to make comments into a vacuum, and my sense is that, again, the Iranians are going to realize this is a serious offer, and it is an offer that offers great promise for them," Snow said.

European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana is to formally present the package to the Iranian government in Tehran, perhaps as early as Tuesday.

Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged Iran to give careful consideration to the plan, but indicated Tehran would not have an indefinite amount of time to respond.

Iranian officials have indicated they plan to study the document. But, they stress, have no plans to suspend uranium enrichment, which is a key condition that has been attached to the deal.

Tehran says uranium will be processed for use in power plants. But the United States and Europe say they are concerned Iran's civilian nuclear power program is really a cover for the development of nuclear weapons.

In &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; one of the most important watercolours to be put up for sale in half a century has been snapped up for 5.8 million at &lt;a href="w%3AChristie%27s"&gt;Christie's&lt;/a&gt; (actual selling price: £5,832,000 including excess). 

In "The Blue Rigi: Lake of Lucerne, Sunrise" the telephone bidder bought a softly glowing yellow sunrise in which &lt;a href="w%3AJMW%20Turner"&gt;JMW Turner&lt;/a&gt; trapped a moment of cause and effect - gun, dog and the flight of ducks.

"In a technique of almost unimaginable subtlety Turner expresses his lifelong preoccupation with the effects of light, shade and atmosphere," said Noel Annesley, honorary chairman of Christie's, who personally took the gavel for the auction.

The painting has two sister paintings also from &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;: The Red Rigi and The Dark Rigi. "Turner had never made any drawings like this before and never made any like them again," said John Ruskin, the 19th century art critic, when he saw the works. 

In 1842 the painting was bought by its first owner Elhanan Bicknell for 80 &lt;a href="w%3Aguinea"&gt;guinea&lt;/a&gt;s and was in the property of its latest owners since 1942. The auction house has said they plan to keep the identity of the newest buyer, who paid slightly more than 80 guineas, secret.

In 2000 &lt;a href="w%3ARosetti"&gt;Rosetti&lt;/a&gt;'s Pandora was the last most expensive watercolour ever sold in Britain - it went for £2.6m, less than half the price of The Blue Rigi.

In Monday night &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; action, the &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Pirates"&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/a&gt; won a victory over the &lt;a href="w%3AColorado%20Rockies"&gt;Colorado Rockies&lt;/a&gt; in Denver, 5-2. The Pirates up 3-1 by the 6th inning and strong pitching throughout helped hold off the Rockies.

&lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Snell"&gt;Ian Snell&lt;/a&gt; pitched 6 1/3 innings for the Pirates, and recorded a career and season high 10 strikeouts, giving up only 2 runs, 6 hits, and a single walk. In the first three innings, Snell threw 29 of 35 pitches for strikes. The win was his 6th of the season. Snell's previous career high in strikeouts was nine, set May 3 against the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mets"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt;.

Coming off a 7-3 homestand, the Pirates hoped to turn around their dismal 4-22 road record, and break a 4-game road losing streak. A strong appearance in their first game of the 3-game series will ease many doubts.

The trial of &lt;a href="w%3ATimothy%20Selwyn"&gt;Timothy Selwyn&lt;/a&gt;, 31, for publishing &lt;a href="w%3Aseditious"&gt;seditious&lt;/a&gt; statements has begun in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;. 

The charge of publishing seditious statements refers to leaflets found in Ponsonby Road, 2 km from the Prime Minister's office in Sandringham Road, Auckland, after an axe attack on the window of the Prime Minister's electorate office, during the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20foreshore%20and%20seabed%20controversy"&gt;foreshore and seabed legislation debate&lt;/a&gt;.

Sedition is defined within New Zealand as being "speech, writing or behaviour intended to encourage rebellion or resistance against the government". Selwyn has been charged under section 81(1)(c) of the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961, which forbids any such publication which means "[t]o incite, procure, or encourage violence, lawlessness, or disorder". The New Zealand Police cite the pamphlet as being seditious.

This is the first prosecution for sedition in New Zealand for at least 75 years.

The decision to charge Selwyn has drawn considerable controversy within New Zealand, with many bloggers protesting. Blogger &lt;a href="http%3A//norightturn.blogspot.com/2006/06/step-backwards-for-freedom-of-speech.html"&gt;Idiot/Savant&lt;/a&gt;, who has &lt;a href="http%3A//norightturn.blogspot.com/2005/08/sedition-index.html"&gt;extensively researched&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http%3A//norightturn.blogspot.com/2005/08/sedition-by-example-index.html"&gt;history of sedition in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, called the law "an archaic holdover from feudalism, which should have been relegated to the dustbin of history long ago." Blogger &lt;a href="http%3A//www.holdenrepublic.org.nz/2006/06/telling-lies-for-her-majesty-freedom.html"&gt;Lewis Holden&lt;/a&gt;, stated "Allowing the state to prosecute an individual for publishing an idea is morally abhorrent and wrong. The state should not have such a power at its disposal: to do so invites abuse of our right to freedom of speech." 

At the time of the attack, &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; said "This is violent criminal behaviour and there is no place for it in a democracy...".

The Crown says to find him guilty the jury must decide if the pamphlets encouraged other New Zealanders to break the law through similar crimes, and whether Selwyn knew that is what the material set out to do.

Wellington City has dropped the speed limit of some of its streets to 30 km/h from June 6. The speed limit was changed after a student was killed in a bus lane, Willis Street.

Wellington Coroner Garry Evans suggested the changes.

Lambton Quay, central Wellington, is one of the routes affected.

"104 crashes have been reported in the past five years in the Lambton Quay area - a third of which involved pedestrians. The council hopes to reduce the number and severity of accidents. The lower speed is more appropriate for the area and better reflects the speed many drivers already travel at," says Deputy Mayor Alick Shaw. 

The mother of the student killed, Brenda Bongiovanni, said that she is relieved to hear the changes.

The new speed limit will apply from Lower Willis St to the Lambton interchange &amp; bus terminal adjacent to the Central Railway Station, and Mercer St and Bunny St, the distance is 1.3 km.

Announcing the news in &lt;a href="Bangalore"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; to an audience of 10,000 employees, the package presented is three times as large as that invested by IBM over the previous three years, said Samuel J. Palmisano. "We see India's role as central to our global enterprise," he said. 

The $6 billion investment by IBM, also known by the nickname "Big Blue," is larger than the $3.9 billion total foreign investment promised to India by Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc.

IBM is currently the largest multinational in India employing 43,000 people in 14 Indian cities. 15,000 new jobs were added last year as the company took 10,000 out of Europe. The new foreign investment is expected to create more jobs in India's thriving telecommunications industry.

Estimates put IBM's sales revenue in India at $1 billion. While the home market valuation of $15 billion is a figure expected to grow 25 per cent a year. In the first quarter of this year IBM's Indian wing grew 61 per cent compared to the year before.

"IBM is excited by the opportunities in India over the long term and we are also encouraged by the domestic opportunity that India offers," said Palmisano.

Addressing specifically IBM's plans in India the head said he wanted to automate IT services, create a "one-stop shop" for hardware information and IT goods, build a new R&amp;D centre in Delhi and forge links between IBM's consultants, developers, engineers and scientists.

"IBM is not going to miss this opportunity," said Palmisano.

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are to let Getty Images sell photos of their new baby Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt - and have asked the proceeds go to charity.

"While we celebrate the joy of the birth of our daughter, we recognize that 2 million babies born every year in the developing world die on the first day of their lives. These children can be saved, but only if governments around the world make it a priority," the couple said, in a joint statement.

It is thought the rights to the photographs will be bought for upwards $5 million and that the money will go to a charity for African children. 

Getty images will arrange a private photo shoot for the baby. "We are honored that the Jolie-Pitt family has recognized our long-term commitment to these critical issues, as well as our ability to use the power of imagery to make a difference in the lives of many," said Jonathan Klein, Getty's CEO and cofounder.

Born in a hospital in Namibia on May 27 paparazzi were immediately interested in a snapshot of the Hollywood stars' child who weighed in at 7lbs. 

The baby's mother Angelina Jolie, 30, an Oscar winning actress, is a goodwill ambassador for U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. She has two adopted children Maddox, 4, and Zahara, aged 15 months.

Former &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; detective and deputy mayor of &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt; in the state's central west told a &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20Integrity%20Commission"&gt;Police Integrity Commission&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby city of &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt; information he provided about his location on the morning a woman went missing was incorrect.

Janine Vaughan went missing at around 4 a.m. on December 7, 2001. She had left a local pub and was last seen getting into a red car. Mr Hosemans became a person of interest after Ms Vaughan's mother, Jennifer said that the only man she had heard her daughter speak about was "a guy who she had seen in Bathurst and who she described as drop-dead gorgous". 

Jennifer Vaughan later found out that the man was high-profile detective and deputy mayor Brad Hosemans. Ms Vaughan's best friend said that Mr Hosemans had walked past the clothing shop that Ms Vaughan had worked in and smiled and winked at her.

At the inquiry on Monday Mr Hosemans said he was in Bathurst on the morning of December 7, 2001. In 2002 he had told the police he was at his mother's house near &lt;a href="w%3ANewcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Newcastle&lt;/a&gt; at the time Janine Vaughan disappeared. 

Mr Hosemans told the commission he had found an &lt;a href="w%3AEFTPOS"&gt;EFTPOS&lt;/a&gt; fuel receipt that showed he might have returned from his mother's a day earlier than he initially believed. His initial statement to police was based upon a bank statement which must have been subject to "processing delays," he said.

The officer who initially handled the case, despite being on charges of indecent assault following an incident at the Bathurst Golf Club was Mr Hosemans. He was later acquitted of the Golf Club incident but police told the inquiry it was unusual for an officer who was facing such charges to be heading a missing persons case.

Ms Vaughan's case was later handled by one of NSW's highest-ranking detectives, Detective Inspector Paul Jacob. Inspector Jacob, on Monday was asked by Mark Buscombe, counsel assisting the inquiry if he had considered Mr Hosemans a suspect at the time. "Had it hit my radar, I may have taken a different course," inspector Jacob replied.

Inspector Jacob only wrote to Mr Hosemans a year after Ms Vaughan disappeared, after claims that Mr Hosemans had a relationship with her. Facing the inquiry for a second day today, Inspector Jacob said errors had been made in the handling of Ms Vaughan's case. He told the inquiry that, after a review of evidence before him, Mr Hosemans was struck off the suspect list.

The inspector was then asked about notes he made which said, "Flowers and chocolates in weeks leading up to disappearance. Brad seen. Statement-takers left out issue with Brad." Inspector Jacob said the note should have raised suspicion but he was overworked and subsequently overlooked it.

The inquiry heard Ms Vaughan had rejected Mr Hosemans prior to her disappearance. "Ms Vaughan told (a friend) that he (Mr Hosemans) was ringing her up at night, walking past the store, asking her out, but she said no," Mr Buscombe said.

The European Union's head diplomat Javier Solana has offered Iran a number of benefits to persuade the oil-rich state to drop some of its rights under Article IV.1 of the , i.e. stop an uranium enrichment program.

During the two hour meeting in the Iranian capital Solana is thought to have offered help to build Iran's nuclear generators and supply fuel for the northern Persian Gulf state's energy needs.

This main offer may have been accompanied by a number of sweeteners such as the offer of European Airbus airplanes and United States relaxation of the trade of Boeing aircraft parts with Iran.
The proposal the European emissary carried had previously been seen by Security Council powers United States, China, Britain, Russia, France and also Germany. Were Iran to reject the Solana offer the United Nations Security Council sanctions could be used to stop Iran's nuclear program.

"Larijani said Iran will study the package, clause by clause, and respond," said an unnamed official who knows Ali Larjani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator.

However there were also some "ambiguities" to resolve, said Larjani himself.

Iran has noted several times that as party to the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)&lt;/a&gt;, the country can enrich uranium for peaceful needs, such as for the production of electricity. 

But a move to enrich uranium on a larger-scale, such as a plan for 3,000 centrifuges by the end of 2006, might lead American officials to say Iran could have the potential to get a nuclear weapon within ten years.

While Iran's head of state, Ayatollah &lt;a href="Ali%20Khamenei"&gt;Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt; recently warned about the disruption of oil supplies if Iran was attacked, President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; is said to be considering the newest package on the table.

'We have two options - one is cooperation, the other is confrontation,' said the Iranian Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australian&lt;/a&gt; (WA) Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has advised against the massive Greater Gorgon liquefied natural gas project off WA's &lt;a href="w%3APilbara"&gt;Pilbara&lt;/a&gt; coast. Proponents of the projects say Gorgon is one of Australia's biggest export ventures, scheduled to provide up to 6,000 jobs and exports of up to $1.2 billion.

EPA chairman Dr Wally Cox said the Gorgon project operators (Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell), had made an effort on flora and fauna issues but in its present state, the Gorgon proposal was "unacceptable." Gorgon LNG general manager Colin Beckett said that Gorgon was a world-class gas field and that the joint venture partners were confident that the decision would be reversed.

Environment Minister Mark McGowan said there was a definite process to be followed. The Minister says he will make a final decision on the Gorgon proposal after considering the EPA report - and any subsequent report from the Appeals Convenor. The EPA recommendations on the Gorgon proposal are subject to a two-week appeals period.

The EPA's Dr Cox said that joint venture had "not been able to demonstrate that impacts from dredging, the introduction of non-indigenous species and the potential loss of fauna could be reduced to acceptable levels."

In September 2003 the WA government provided "in-principle agreement" to the Gorgon joint venturers subject to a number of conditions. Dr Cox said that the Environmental Review and Management Programme had further highlighted the terrestrial and marine conservation values of Barrow Island and the adjacent waters.

"&lt;a href="w%3AFlatback_Turtle"&gt;Flatback turtles&lt;/a&gt; in particular would be put at risk from the proposal with two of the most important nesting beaches located adjacent to the proposed LNG processing plant site and the materials off-loading facility," Dr Cox said. "There is very little science available on the life-cycle, behaviour and feeding habits of Flatback turtles and as a consequence it is not possible at this time to identify management measures that would ensure ongoing survival of this Pilbara Flatback turtle population."

Dr Cox also said that the Proponent had not been able to demonstrate that risk could be reduced to satisfactory levels in the areas of: Impacts on the marine ecosystem from dredging; The introduction of non-indigenous species; Potential loss of subterranean and short range endemic invertebrate fauna species. "As a result, the proposal in its present form cannot meet the EPA's environmental objectives and is considered environmentally unacceptable," Dr Cox said.

<h2>Government/Industry Support</h2>
Despite the EPA's decision to block the proposal, the Australian newspaper reports that WA Premier Alan Carpenter was prepared to overrule the EPA's advice: "While he stopped short of providing a guarantee the project would go ahead, Mr Carpenter said it involved "massive economic and social benefit" for the state." 

The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA), has welcomed the bi-partisan support by the Premier, and the Leader of the Opposition, Paul Omodei, to the Gorgon project. APPEA's Chief Executive, Belinda Robinson, said. "It also involves the world's first commercial carbon sequestration project. It's hard to imagine what more could be done," Ms Robinson said.

"The Gorgon project is a world class gas resource of more than 40 trillion cubic feet, and its development has the potential to deliver 6,000 jobs, $2.5 billion in annual export income, and more than $17 billion in government taxes and royalties over its 60 year life," Ms Robinson said.

The Gorgon project proposal involves a two-train, 10 million metric-ton-per-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and a domestic gas plant on Barrow Island, located off Australia's northwest coast. Home to Australia's largest operating onshore oil field for the past 40 years, the island is also a Class A nature reserve.

However, the Greens applauded the WA EPA's advice. Greens Senator Rachel Siewert said in a media release: "This is the second time the WA EPA has knocked back this proposal. The proponents should review their options to put the project on the mainland, which will ultimately be a win for the regional economy and a win for the unique environment of Barrow Island."

"This is a proposal that should always have been located on the mainland. Proposing to build something on this scale inside Australia's most precious island nature reserve was deeply flawed from the beginning," said Senator Siewert. "The island has been dubbed 'Australia's Ark' for its unique cargo of endangered species, many of them now extinct or endangered on mainland Australia. He must take strong action to look after the island."

Welnick was found dead in his home in &lt;a href="w%3AForestville%2C%20California"&gt;Forestville, California&lt;/a&gt;, on June 2, 2006. His cause of death is not being released at the family's request, says Coroner's Sgt. Will Wallman.

The 55-year-old musician began his professional career in his native &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Phoenix, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, putting together a garage band called ♡❤The Beans♡❤. The group moved to San Francisco in 1969 and changed its name to ♡❤The Tubes♡❤, eventually releasing eight albums. Welnick was picked in 1990 to succeed the late &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Mydland"&gt;Brent Mydland&lt;/a&gt; as ♡❤The Grateful Dead♡❤ keyboardist, and eventually moved on to solo projects. He was later elected to the &lt;a href="w%3ARock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt;.

Welnick is survived by his wife, Lori.

<h1>Federal Reserve chief's stagflation scare</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Federal%20Reserve%20chief%27s%20stagflation%20scare&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has told an International Monetary Conference inflation is creeping higher and will receive "particular scrutiny."

Benanke's comments, to an audience of bankers at the Willard Hotel in Washington, has tripped up stocks and bonds which fell by 199 points on US markets Monday (1.8 per cent loss).

The comments seem to have been interpreted by traders to mean there will be an interest rate rise.

A strategist at Wells Capital Management said: "Here we have some suspicion the economy may be weakening ... and a struggling stock market," "And the Fed chairman chooses [Monday] to inform everyone he has decided to get tough on inflation," says Jim Paulsen.

The panicked markets had expected no rate rise at the next Federal Reserve meeting on June 29. The United States central bank began raising interest rates two years ago - 16 consecutive rises later it stands at 5%. 

The news might also suggest the billowing crude and commodity markets have affected other parts of the economy. Excluding energy or food prices, core inflation was "at or above the upper end of the range that many economists, including myself, would consider consistent with price stability," Mr Bernanke said.

Bernanke said his core inflation canal was between 1% and 2% a year. Quarter inflation, however, was rising: 3% through six months; 2.3% over 12 months. "These are unwelcome developments," Bernanke said when he announced the figures.

Overall the economic data was "consistent with the softening in the pace of overall economic activity that seems to be under way," Bernanke said in his speech.
Stagflation is the economic problem of rising inflation and falling growth. The Federal Reserve often lower interest rates to finance the economy but in an inflationary economy interest rates might also need to rise. Such a situation might put the Fed in an uncomfortable pinch. 

Monetary policy is an incomplete science. Even so, Bernanke is old enough to remember the 1970s when the Federal Reserve declined an interest rate rise. Recession and high prices appeared to be the result.

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has launched an online &lt;a href="w%3ASpreadsheet"&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; site, in a private &lt;a href="w%3ADevelopment_stage%23Beta"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt;. 

The site will allow spreadsheets to be shared between up to 10 users, which is aimed to be useful to teams and small businesses. "Many people already organise information into spreadsheets. Where they are struggling is to share it" said the product manager, Jonathan Rochelle.

Google recently bought the online word-processor &lt;a href="w%3AWritely"&gt;Writely&lt;/a&gt;, launched a &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Calendar"&gt;calendar&lt;/a&gt; product, as well as a &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Desktop%20Search"&gt;desktop search tool&lt;/a&gt;. Many see this as them straying into &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s markets.

Google Spreadsheets uses very advanced &lt;a href="w%3AAJAX"&gt;AJAX&lt;/a&gt; (Asynchronous Javascript And Xml) and Client Side Scripting to mimic very effectively it's desktop counterparts' functions.

It is surprisingly fast, has very good formatting and advanced formula support, but best of all it has complete support for &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Excel .xls files, and very good collaboration: just enter the e-mail address and you can share easily.

&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; Election Commission passed their subcommittee report on to the office of the Attorney-General without making a recommendation. The report, which &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Nation%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt; describes as all legal documents detailing the allegations that the caretaker Prime Minister's populist &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party paid small parties to take part in the April 2 snap election.

The EC subcommittee led by Nam Yimyaem concluded in their report that Thai Rak Thai had engaged smaller parties illegally in an effort to avoid the minimum voter requirement of the constitution. The report's recommendation was that the party should be dissolved.

The EC passing the buck on the election fraud allegations follows on from scathing criticism from the country's Supreme Court President, Charnchai Likit-jittha. In a letter to the acting Senate Speaker, Charnchai rejected Speaker Suchon Chaleekrua's proposal that he nominate two new members to the Election Commission to fill present vacancies. Citing the constitutional requirement that the EC be politically neutral, Charnchai said of the three remaining commissioners they, "are not in a position to have the trust to continue with their work".

The troubles of the Election Commission may see doubt cast on the proposed date of October 15 for a rerun of the general election.

As expected by media sources, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; announced on Tuesday that he would be setting up a "Prime Ministerial taskforce" to investigate &lt;a href="w%3AUranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt; mining, processing and nuclear energy in Australia.

<h2>Timeframe and purpose</h2>
The results of the review to be undertaken by the taskforce are expected to be made public in November. The taskforce is to investigate:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Whether Australia has the capacity to increase uranium mining,
BULLET::::- Whether it would be economical for Australia to carry out uranium enrichment and reprocessing,
BULLET::::- Implications a nuclear energy industry would have on Australia's existing energy industries,
BULLET::::- The circumstances under which nuclear energy could become economically viable,
BULLET::::- How nuclear energy could decrease greenhouse gas emissions,
BULLET::::- How nuclear energy could work alongside renewable energy sources,
BULLET::::- "Next generation" nuclear technologies, which claim to resolve safety, waste and proliferation concerns,
BULLET::::- Nuclear waste and storage,
BULLET::::- Possible security implications,
BULLET::::- Health and safety issues.

</ul>
<h2>The taskforce</h2>
Mr Howard said the taskforce will be led by former &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra"&gt;Telstra&lt;/a&gt; CEO and nuclear physicist, Dr &lt;a href="w%3AZiggy%20Switkowski"&gt;Ziggy Switkowski&lt;/a&gt; and will include five other members. In a statement, Mr Howard announced two of the five additional members. One of Australia's foremost nuclear researchers, Professor George Dracoulis from the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20University"&gt;Australian National University&lt;/a&gt; and economist Professor Warwick McKibbin, a board member of the &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20Australia"&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

The Prime Minister said that he would announce the other three members today, after they confirm their availability.

Dr. Jim Peacock, Australia’s Chief Scientist, will assist the review process.

Mr Howard said that Australia should investigate the potential to capitalise on its vast uranium reserves. He said Australia had 40 percent of the world's known uranium reserves, and Australia could "increase and add value to our uranium extraction and exports".

The Prime Minister told reporters that nuclear energy is not something that will happen in the short term in Australia, but may occur in the long term. "I don’t expect to have nuclear power stations in Australia within the next two or three years," he said.

"I do think, however, that we need in an open-minded and as emotionless fashion possible, to have a serious debate about this issue." Mr Howard said.

Mr Howard said that it is "foolish" for Australia to remain solely as an exporter of uranium given the vast amounts of the mineral the country has.

The opposition has been calling on the Howard government to name possible locations for nuclear power stations since announcing that they wish to investigate the use of nuclear energy. Mr Howard told reporters that it the plants would be built by private enterprise and those calls on the government were "putting the cart before the horse".

Mr Howard said that his government expected the opposition to run a "fear campaign" on the issue and that he would not be deterred, as he believes the public's opinion on nuclear energy has shifted significantly. He said that he wanted a full and open review, examination and debate.

<h2>Criticism</h2>
During his press conference on Tuesday, Mr Howard was asked if the taskforce had been weighted to come up with a favourable report as the members announced so far were pro-nuclear. Mr Howard denied the claim saying that members had been selected who knew the subject and were "open-minded and clear headed".

Claims of a conflict of interest with &lt;a href="w%3AZiggy%20Switkowski"&gt;Ziggy Switkowski&lt;/a&gt; have begun to surface after it was revealed that he is a board member of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Nuclear%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Organisation"&gt;Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation&lt;/a&gt;, which runs Australia's only nuclear reactors in &lt;a href="w%3ALucas%20Heights%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Lucas Heights&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Howard, speaking on ABC Television defended the claims saying "He's a nuclear physicist &lt;a href="w%3AZiggy%20Switkowski"&gt;Ziggy Switkowski&lt;/a&gt;, he's a proven person in the commercial area, he's got strong public administration skills, that's a good combination for something like this".

In order to minimise the conflict of interest, Switkowski resigned from the board of ANSTO on June 7 2006.

A survey released today by the &lt;a href="w%3ARACV"&gt;RACV&lt;/a&gt; and Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce found that 20 percent of cars in &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria_%2528Australia%2529"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; have at least one worn or unroadworthy tyre.

The study looked at 1,000 cars last month and found of those 200 had at least one tyre that had worn.

Chief engineer for the RACV, Michael Case said that driving on worn tyres could increase the distance it takes a car to brake and road safety. "Increasing the braking distance can increase the chance of running into the car in front of you and having an unnecessary collision and if that collision is serious enough certainly it can cause injuries" said Mr Case.

It is widely accepted that tyres are one of the most important parts of a vehicle. As tyres are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road, they affect acceleration, braking and cornering.

As well as the safety issues associated with driving a vehicle with a worn tyre, drivers can be fined for "driving an unsafe vehicle" and fined &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$171, in addition police may "defect" the vehicle, restricting its use until repaired. Victorian law requires that tyres have a minimum tread depth of 1.6mm.

Wikinews investigated the average price of each tyre on a typical large and small Australian sedan, and SUV and found the cost to be AUD$129, AUD$105, and AUD$191 respectively.

<h1>11,000 evacuated in Indonesia as Mount Merapi threatens to erupt</h1>

The &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; government has ordered the evacuation of 11,000 people form the Magelang district as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Merapi"&gt;Mount Merapi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spews ash, lava and smoke from its dome. The dome continues to rise and scientists fear it may collapse. Smoke and ash are rising at least 2.4 miles into the sky and lava is rising at least 4 miles from the volcano's crater.

"Of course it is dangerous. But we don't know for sure whether the lava dome will collapse," said an Indonesian government volcanologist, Subandriyo.

At least 40 cars and trucks have been ordered to assist in the evacuation and take villagers to nearby schools and government buildings that have been turned into makeshift shelters.

"Since Monday we have evacuated ... more or less 2,000 people. The people that we need to evacuate are around 11,000. The lava has spread out in various directions. The lava domes are weakening," said Edi Purwanto, who is in charge of the evacuation post. 

Scientists also say that the recent earthquake on May 27 which had a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake%20magnitude"&gt;magnitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of 6.3 may have caused the volcano to become unstable and likely "shook the mountain." At least 5,800 people were killed in the quake.

"I don't think that's unreasonable. The volcano is an unstable pile of rock. It's fragile. I would be surprised if it [the quake] didn't literally shake the mountain," said an Arizona State University volcanologist who studies the volcano, Stanley Williams.

The volcano sits 280 miles to the east of Indonesia's capital of &lt;a href="Jakarta%2C%20Indonesia"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;.

Anthony James Creamer's body was found in the &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAvon%20River%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Avon River&lt;/a&gt; on June 6.

He was a sickness beneficiary and lived in Avonside Street which is located near the Avon River.

Christchurch police Detective Inspector Malcolm Johnston said that there were no suspicious circumstances relating to the death and no suspicious injuries had been identified. However, he said it was still too early to tell the exact cause of death and police could not yet rule out foul play.

"There is no apparent suspicious injuries, but we will wait for the results of the post-mortem," Johnston said.

A member of the public spotted the body tangled in weeds in the middle of the river near Locksley Avenue, in Dallington, about noon. They flagged down a police car and the officer jumped into the river and brought it on to the riverbank. 

The body was fully clothed and early suggestions were that it had not been there long.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAutopsy"&gt;autopsy&lt;/a&gt; should be completed by June 7.

&lt;a href="Alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; Gov. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Riley%20%28Alabama%29"&gt;Bob Riley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; beat back a Republican primary challenge from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoy%20Moore"&gt;Roy Moore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the former judge who tried to put up a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATen%20commandments"&gt;Ten Commandments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; monument in his courthouse. 

In the weeks leading to Alabama's gubernatorial primaries, polls showed Riley had pulled ahead of Moore, the former state chief justice who became a hero to the religious right in 2003 when he was ousted over his refusal to remove a 5,300-pound Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building.

Moore conceded in his hometown of Gadsden, telling supporters, "God's will has been done."

When 29 students attended a fake crime scene in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Lauderdale%2C%20Florida"&gt;Fort Lauderdale&lt;/a&gt; Park during a field trip set up by their teacher, Sue Messenger, they found the body of a homeless man. Police said he died of natural causes and there was nothing to indicate that foul play was involved. The students are part of a criminology class at St. Thomas Aquinas High School.

At first, some students thought the body was a "dummy". "We thought it was Ms. Messenger messing around with us," said 16-year-old Josh Rozental, who was the one that had discovered the body. "When I went over, knowing what I know about rigor mortis and postmortem lividity, it was apparent to me that actually this was a deceased individual. So the biggest thing is I wanted them to move off…. I knew there was going to be an investigation and I just wanted them to back off and for us to not to disturb anything," said Messenger.

"It was a good crash course. The first thing we thought was, 'that's a real good dummy she set up,'" said 15-year-old Juan Cantor, a student at the high school.

For 20 years Messenger has been using "paper skeletons, fake weapons, notes, shell casings, and sunglasses" that students could find to further their education. The study was in its fifth of 13 days.

"The students went up to this one area … and found a man with his back against the wall and he looked dead. They thought it was part of the skit," said Kathy Collins a Fort Lauderdale Police detective.

Police said the man was David Wayne Bodie, 45.

The 27,000-pages of documents released on Tuesday reveal that while the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Germany"&gt;West Germany&lt;/a&gt; knew the location of Nazi war criminal &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Eichmann"&gt;Adolf Eichmann&lt;/a&gt; two years before his capture, the fact was kept secret. The documents were declassified as part of the &lt;a href="w%3ANazi%20War%20Crimes%20and%20Japanese%20Imperial%20Government%20Records%20Interagency%20Working%20Group"&gt;Nazi War Criminals Disclosure Act&lt;/a&gt; of 1998.

West German Intelligence informed the US in March 1958 of the whereabouts of the senior &lt;a href="w%3AGestapo"&gt;Gestapo&lt;/a&gt; officer, who was living under the alias "Clemens" in Argentina where he had arrived seven years earlier.

It was not US policy at the time to go after Nazi criminals since they were still recruited for Cold War operations.

"It now appears that West Germany could have captured him in 1958, if it wished to," said University of Virginia historian Timothy Naftali. He also said that CIA helped West Germany at the time to suppress part of Eichmann's diary - which was in the possession of Life magazine - that would have embarrassed West German national security adviser Hans Globke, himself a former Nazi.

Eichmann was captured by Israelis in 1960 in Argentina. He was tried in Jerusalem and received the death penalty.

Mahajan was discharged from Apollo Hospital and brought to the Tughlaq Road police station in a wheelchair. He was later produced in the court. Though the police wanted a five-day custody, the court granted only two days.

Subsequently, Mahajan was taken to the police station for interrogation. He was reportedly confronted with the other accused, Sahil Zaroo, who is also in police custody till June 12.

Zaroo was arrested in Srinagar on June 3 for allegedly purchasing and supplying drugs to the 7 Safdarjung Road bungalow in the early hours of June 2. He has allegedly disclosed to the police that he bought drugs at the instance of Mr. Mahajan's personal secretary Bibek Moitra, who subsequently died. The police also questioned Mr. Mahajan's erstwhile aide, Harish Sharma, to find out if he had any role to play in destruction of evidence at the scene of crime. Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Manish Aggarwal said they were also probing the role of the three domestic help.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; has defeated a proposed constitutional amendment banning &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agay%20marriage"&gt;gay marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The bill was defeated 48 to 49 and did not receive the minimum amount of 60 votes to that would allow the bill to be taken to the full Senate. The bill fell 18 votes short of the 67 that were needed for approval. In order for the bill to become part of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;U.S. Constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , this bill would have had to be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , then be approved by the legislatures of three fourths (that is, 38) of the States.

However, Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Vitter"&gt;David Vitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;LA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who is a supporter of the bill says, "we're building votes."

"Most Americans are not yet convinced that their elected representatives or the judiciary are likely to expand decisively the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples," said &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;AZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) who opposed the bill.

"A vote for it is a vote against civil unions, against domestic partnership, against all other efforts for states to treat gays and lesbians fairly under the law," said &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Kennedy"&gt;Edward Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The bill would define marriage as between a man and a woman, and would preclude the official recognizing of same-sex marriages. The bill is expected to be taken back to the Senate in July. 

Already, 45 states have banned gay marriages.

Following its decision yesterday to bar Somali warlords and their associates from entering the country, &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; today deported a Somali businessman, citing his links to leaders engaged in the ongoing civil conflict in &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;.

Abdirashid Hussein Shire was arrested by police at a hotel in the Kenyan capital &lt;a href="w%3ANairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt; and escorted to a flight out of the country, reportedly heading for &lt;a href="w%3ADubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;. Shire is alleged to be a supporter of the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20for%20the%20Restoration%20of%20Peace%20and%20Counter-Terrorism"&gt;Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance of Somali warlords who are currently engaged in a conflict with the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Courts%20Union"&gt;Islamic Courts Union&lt;/a&gt; for control over &lt;a href="w%3AMogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Somalia. 

Yesterday, the Kenyan government barred Somali warlords or their associates from entering the country. The Kenyan foreign affairs assistant minister Moses Wetang'ula declared them "persona non-grata". 

"The government would like to reiterate its previously stated position that it will not permit its territory to be used by those who persist in destabilising Somalia and undermining our ongoing efforts to restore peace and security in that country," said the Kenyan foreign ministry in a statement released Tuesday.

Kenya has been closely involved in efforts to normalise the situation in Somalia. Kenya hosted and mediated talks between the various Somali factions for more than two years, leading to the formation of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in 2004. The Somali Cabinet was named in August 2004 at the United Nations headquarters in Nairobi. 

The Kenyan President &lt;a href="w%3AMwai%20Kibaki"&gt;Mwai Kibaki&lt;/a&gt; is also the current chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AIntergovernmental%20Authority%20on%20Development"&gt;Intergovernmental Authority on Development&lt;/a&gt;, a seven-member regional development organization in Eastern Africa. The IGAD passed a resolution in March in support of the transitional government, expressing concern over the upsurge of violence in Somalia and calling for a cessation of hostilities. The resolution also called for the lifting of a UN arms embargo to "enable IGAD and the AU deploy the Peace Support Mission to Somalia"&lt;a href="http%3A//www.igad.org/council/25thCouncil_somalia.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Many Somali leaders have homes or business interests in Kenya, whose capital Nairobi forms a regional business hub.

<h1>Scientists working to save Chesapeake Bay oyster population</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Scientists%20working%20to%20save%20Chesapeake%20Bay%20oyster%20population&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Chesapeake Bay, on the Atlantic coast, is the largest estuary in the United States. It is famous for its seafood, especially crabs and oysters. However, in the last century, the bay's oyster population has been in steady decline.

For hundreds of years, watermen of the Chesapeake Bay have made a living by harvesting oysters. In the last 50 years, the number of oysters has declined dramatically.

Tommy Leggett is an Oyster Restoration and Fisheries scientist with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental organization that works to protect the bay's resources. "Our population is down to one to three percent of historical levels. So, consequently our bay's water quality is down," Leggett said.
Graham Blake grew up on Sarah Creek, a tributary to the bay. His father and grandfather made a good living as watermen by harvesting, transplanting, fattening, and then re-harvesting oysters from the creek. 

It was an early form of oyster farming. In the 1940s and ‘50s his family could harvest 200 to 300 bushels of oysters each day. Blake says those days are long-gone.
"There is none of it like my father made his living, that is non-existent. Some are still trying to make a living on the water, oystering and crabbing and so forth,” Blake said. “They have got to do a lot of things. They can't just do it in one industry anymore."
In the late 1950s, parasites, which were introduced from foreign oysters, began to kill the Chesapeake Bay oyster population.

Graham and Tommy are now stocking the creek bed with hundreds of thousands of disease resistant young oysters. When they reach adulthood, they are transplanted to state sanctuary reefs in the bay.

"Since 2000 we have been attempting to grow about a million oysters a year as brood stock to be placed on state sanctuary reefs to help jump start rivers,” Leggett said. “To date, we have produced about five million oysters that we have transplanted onto a number of reefs in the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay." 

The project seems to demonstrate that watermen and other entrepreneurs can grow oysters in the bay using aquaculture techniques.

"We have pretty well demonstrated it, and over a number of years we have had industry people come out to the site. There have been a number of people who have scaled up and are growing more oysters than we are now,” Leggett said. “Oyster farming in the bay is just getting ready to take off."
According to Leggett, the number of commercial operations growing oysters on the bay will dramatically increase in the next several years. His primary goal is to restore the natural oyster population to what it once was, but it is a goal he says may not happen in his lifetime.

"We are just learning some of the pitfalls and the roadblocks that we are going to encounter. We try and learn from our mistakes and change the way we do things,” he said. “It will happen in time. It's not going to happen in the short term."

&lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; soccer player &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt;, 20, has been passed fit to play in the &lt;a href="w%3AFIFA"&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; World Cup soccer tournament which starts on June 9 in Germany. The £27 million &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20United"&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt; star had a scan on Wednesday that showed the 4th metatarsal he broke on Apr 29 had healed - in less than 6 weeks.

Rooney was supposedly spotted boarding a plane to Germany while the BBC claim sources close to the Football Association indicated Rooney was in England's final World Cup squad.

The news is considered a big boost to England's chances to win the World Cup. Manchester United manager &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Alex%20Ferguson"&gt;Sir Alex Ferguson&lt;/a&gt; had said the player's chances of playing were "a forlorn hope." 

The English soccer club, recently bought by American billionaire &lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Glazer"&gt;Malcolm Glazer&lt;/a&gt;, was concerned the investment would risk a worse injury if the previous toe-bone break had not healed when he started to play again. Manchester United's club doctor Todd Gill and physiotherapist Rob Swire, accompanied by a small army of Red Devils' lawyers, were said to have attended the foot scan.

The scan was considered so important to England's fortunes that Eriksson sent England's doctor to observe the event. A FIFA official was also present in the crowd at the moment of truth for Rooney's foot. The official would have been final decision-maker in case of a dispute between one of the richest soccer clubs in the world and the country that invented the game.

The Swedish manager of the English football team &lt;a href="w%3ASven-G%C3%B6ran%20Eriksson"&gt;Sven-Göran Eriksson&lt;/a&gt;, who had said Rooney would play some part in the competition, named Rooney in England's 23-man squad for Germany. 

The World Cup tournament pits soccer players from national teams against each other for a trophy. Previously graced by Pele and Maradona, England has not won the competition for 40 years.

<h1>Portuguese Republican National Guard in Dili confined to headquarters</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Portuguese%20Republican%20National%20Guard%20in%20Dili%20confined%20to%20headquarters&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APortuguese%20Republican%20National%20Guard"&gt;Portuguese Republican National Guard&lt;/a&gt; (GNR), that &lt;a href="Portuguese%20military%20land%20in%20East%20Timor"&gt;arrived last Sunday&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt;, have interrupted their patrols in the streets of Dili and are now confined to their temporary headquarters.
According to a Portuguese governmental source, the GNR force is confined to its improvised headquarters in Dili, with orders from the government not to go out into the streets, due to a diplomatic block in the negotiations with Australia about the command chain.

The decision was made after a incident during the middle of the afternoon (local time), when a Republican National Guard patrol was transporting three men to a new temporary detention center, guarded by Australian troops. The Australian soldiers refused to receive the detained men, questioning the legitimacy of the Portuguese soldiers to make arrests.

At this moment, urgent negotiations are being made in New York. Portugal is waiting for President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AXanana%20Gusm%C3%A3o"&gt;Xanana Gusmão&lt;/a&gt; and the Timorese government to clarify the action of the Portuguese force on the bilateral agreement signed between the two governments that guarantees operational autonomy to the Portuguese soldiers.

Contacted by SIC reporters, the spokesman of the Portuguese Foreign Ministry, Carneiro Jacinto, denied that the problem is the presence of the GNR in East Timor. Carneiro Jacinto told SIC that the case is being handled through diplomatic channels, including the United Nations, the government and the Timorese presidency. Carneiro Jacinto also said that it's necessary to clarify the case once and for all, so that situations "serious like this one" will not be repeated.

Ana Pessoa, East Timor's State Minister, told TSF News Agency that the idea that the Portuguese contingent's mission in Timor may be threatened makes no sense. She said all that is being discussed at this time is what mission the GNR force will assume in East Timor.

Last Friday (June 2) an Australian mission held a meeting with Portugal's Foreign Minister, Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who was sent to ask for clarification of the agreement signed the day before (June 1, Thursday) between Portugal and East Timor. The agreement gave the Portuguese Republican National Guard troops their own operational command, reporting directly to President Xanana Gusmão.

In a meeting on Monday (June 5) between Australian, Malaysian, New Zealand and Portuguese representatives, the four countries discussed the creation of a coordination structure, instead of an entirely Australian-led command, for the police forces working on the Timorese territory.

Beyond the 120 soldiers of the Portuguese Republican National Guard force, that arrived this Sunday to East Timor, there are 70 Australian and 200 Malaysian police officers in the country. A New Zealand police team also arrived yesterday from &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate their possible contributions towards policing. In addition to these police forces, the international force includes more than 2,000 Australian, New Zealand and Malaysian soldiers.

<h1>Northern Ireland parties fail to form devolution committee</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Northern%20Ireland%20parties%20fail%20to%20form%20devolution%20committee&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After three days of talks, parties in &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; have come to a stalemate over the election of a chairperson for a committee to help setup a &lt;a href="w%3Adevolved"&gt;devolved&lt;/a&gt; government in Northern Ireland. It is now up to &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20State%20for%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hain"&gt;Peter Hain&lt;/a&gt; to choose the next course of action.

The committee, known as the Preparation for Government Committee, convened Monday to begin its first task: the election of a chairperson for the committee. Its main task however is to help set a roadmap for devolved government in Northern Ireland. The committee is made up of the two republican parties (Sinn Féin and SDLP), the two unionist parties (DUP and UUP) and the non-sectarianist Alliance Party.

&lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin's&lt;/a&gt; proposal is for the chairpersonship to revolve between them and the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;. However, the DUP refused that proposal.

The DUP proposed that Speaker of the Assembly &lt;a href="w%3AEileen%20Bell"&gt;Eileen Bell&lt;/a&gt; should be the chairperson. However, Bell stated that it would inappropriate for her to take the post and refused. They also suggested the DUP MP for South Antrim William McCrea and Alliance Party leader &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Ford"&gt;David Ford&lt;/a&gt; as possible candidates.

Peter Hain called the refusal of parties to cooperate "frustrating."

Sinn Féin, &lt;a href="w%3ASDLP"&gt;SDLP&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20Party%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt; have all blamed the DUP for the failure.

"Yet again the DUP, instead of helping to remove obstacles to devolution, have shown themselves to be nothing but obstructive and lacking in any spirit of co-operation, "said Sean Farren of the SDLP.

&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Durkan"&gt;Mark Durkan&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of SDLP, has criticized both Peter Hain and the DUP and its leader, Ian Paisley on Monday.

"If the DUP is not prepared to do the business or give any substantive indication in the course of June, then the British government would be as well stopping the salaries at the end of June," said Sinn Fein's &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20McGuinness"&gt;Martin McGuinness&lt;/a&gt;.

"The practical reality is that the two biggest parties have not shown they are prepared to move forward at all." said David Ford, the leader of the Alliance Party.

"The prevarication and petty wriggling by the DUP is preventing the potential for progress and holding us all up to public ridicule." said &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Ulster Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;'s Alan McFarland.

On Monday, Ian Paisley asked for extension of the November 24 deadline fot two weeks. It was refused.

This is part of plan by &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;British Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and Irish &lt;a href="w%3AToaiseach"&gt;Toaiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; to set up a devolved government in Northern Ireland after its assembly was suspended in October 2002 over allegations of a IRA spy ring.

If a plan for devolved government is not setup by November 24, direct rule from London will continue with greater input from the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.

Counter-terrorism police has arrested two males, aged 16 and 21, in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. 

The two are accused of having connections to a &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; bomb plot in which 17 people were arrested in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%2C%20Canada"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; on June 3. The alleged plot included plans to bomb and takeover the Canadian Parliament, take Military Police officers hostage and bomb public buildings. It also included beheading Canadian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ quoted an anonymous security source as saying, "We believe that people living in the UK played a pivotal role in helping to organise this series of planned attacks. This is an example of the extremist soup we have in this country with lots of overlapping links."

"The operation did not involve armed officers," said the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Manchester%20Police"&gt;Manchester Police department&lt;/a&gt;.

Police say that the 21-year-old came from Canada and arrived at &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%20International%20Airport"&gt;Manchester Airport&lt;/a&gt; in England yesterday while walking off a plane. Police also say that he lived with some of the suspected terrorists arrested in Toronto. He is said to be of &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; descent and may have citizenship in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. 

The 16-year-old was arrested in &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Yorkshire%2C%20England"&gt;West Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; a few hours after the 21-year-old was arrested. Police say that they tracked him down via cellular phone records and documents found in Toronto.

Police say that the two males are connected and that a security alert was issued when authorities learned the 21-year-old male had left Canada.

The names of the 2 suspects have not yet been released. Police have searched at least 4 homes in &lt;a href="w%3ADewsbury"&gt;Dewsbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHanover%20Square%2C%20London"&gt;Hanover Square&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABradford"&gt;Bradford&lt;/a&gt; in England.

Five &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n workers have been kidnapped from a natural gas facility operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company in the &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;n Delta. 

A group called the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta is claiming responsibility for the attack and kidnappings and says that one kidnapper and at least six Nigerian soldiers were killed on a Nigerian military boat, when gunmen entered the facility. The group's main demand is the release of a jailed militia leader, Mujahid Dokubo-Asari.

"[The Korean workers] are in good health and have been returned to one of our bases. As long as the units holding these individuals do not come under attack, no harm will come to the prisoners. We do not kill those fortunate to be captured by our fighters," said the group.

The group also says that they "plan more attacks" on facilities and oil rigs in the near future.

"In the next few weeks our attacks will increase with the destruction of several facilities of crucial importance to the oil industry," said the group.

One of the kidnapped victims is identified as Park Chang-am. 

"I want Dad to come back so we can go fishing," said the son of Chang-am, Park Myong-il.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Auckland, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Freelance journalist &lt;a href="w%3ATimothy%20Selwyn"&gt;Tim Selwyn&lt;/a&gt; has been found guilty of &lt;a href="w%3Asedition"&gt;sedition&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first conviction for sedition in New Zealand in over 75 years.

Selwyn faced two charges of "making a seditious statement" relating to pamphlets he had left near the scene of an axe attack on the Prime Minister's electorate office in November, 2004, which had called upon like-minded New Zealanders to "engage in similar acts of civil disobedience" and to "take similar action of their own". The charges were laid under s81(1)(c) of New Zealand's Crimes Act 1961, which criminalises any statement intended to "incite... or encourage violence, lawlessness, or disorder". The offence carries a penalty of up to two year's jail. After deliberating for almost four hours, the jury convicted Selwyn of one charge, and acquitted him of the other.

Speaking after the trial, Selwyn said that the jury had "criminalised a press statement".

The trial has raised significant controversy within New Zealand, with many bloggers protesting. Blogger Idiot/Savant called the verdict "shameful" and said that it "opened the door to further prosecutions for what is effectively a political crime". 

Selwyn is currently free on bail pending sentencing next month, and is likely to appeal.

<h1>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi killed in airstrike</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Abu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi%20killed%20in%20airstrike&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The head of &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Queda%20in%20Iraq"&gt;al-Qaeda in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt;, has been killed in an air strike on a building north of &lt;a href="w%3ABaqubah"&gt;Baqubah&lt;/a&gt; city, according to the &lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;Iraqi Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANouri%20Maliki"&gt;Nouri Maliki&lt;/a&gt;. 

"Today [sic] Zarqawi has been terminated," he said Thursday, and suggested the man the United States had placed a $25 million price tag on for death or capture was located through intelligence.

"What happened today is a result of co-operation for which we have been asking from our masses and the citizens of our country," he said.

The leader of coalition forces in Iraq, General &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Casey"&gt;George Casey&lt;/a&gt; said al-Zarqawi was killed in a two-storey safehouse about 8 km north of the city in &lt;a href="w%3ADiyala"&gt;Diyala&lt;/a&gt; province.

Several aides also died with him in the Wednesday evening raid by U.S. F-16 warplanes, including his key lieutenant and spiritual adviser Sheik Abdul Rahman. Some analysts believe a US counter-terrorism unit, &lt;a href="w%3ATask_Force_145"&gt;Task Force 145&lt;/a&gt;, was involved in the attack.

Al-Zarqawi's body, recovered after two 500-pound bombs had blown through his cover, was identified through fingerprint, tattoo and scar analysis and head likeness. Al-Zarqawi, whose real name was Ahmed Fadhil Nazzal al-Khalayleh, was believed to be in his late 30s when he died of injuries while US forces gave medical aid.

The first munition exploded at 6:15pm was a GBU-12 laser-guided bomb that was shortly followed by the newer GBU-38; both carried 500lb of explosives for total cost of $40,000.

The self-proclaimed frontman for &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20Bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama Bin Laden's&lt;/a&gt; activities in Iraq, al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian national, is said to have been involved in the beheading of foreigners, hundreds of suicide attacks, and an insurgency against coalition forces after the Iraq war in 2003.

It had been reported Al-Zarqawi's most recent campaign was to create problems between &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27ite"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; groups in Iraq with ethnic killings.

For the Iraqi government the killing of the wanted murderer is what they sought but it remains unknown what effect the removal of this known figurehead of the Iraq insurgency will have on levels of violence in the country. Al-Zarqawi was not the only person to oppose the US-backed Iraqi government.

"Zarqawi didn't have a number two. I can't think of any single person who would succeed Zarqawi...In terms of effectiveness, there was no single leader in Iraq who could match his ruthlessness and his determination," was the view of Rohan Gumaratna at the Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies in Singapore.

Applause was heard as Mr Maliki, with U.S. Ambassador &lt;a href="w%3AZalmay%20Khalilzad"&gt;Zalmay Khalilzad&lt;/a&gt; and U.S. Gen. George Casey, by his side, told news reporters "al-Zarqawi was terminated." 

Sources claiming to be Al-Qaeda in Iraq later confirmed that al-Zarqawi had been killed and said that they would fight the United States and the interim Iraqi government despite his death. 

United States President George Bush spoke to journalists in the White House Rose Garden about al-Zarqawi's death. "Zarqawi's death is a severe blow to al-Qaeda. It's a victory in the global war on terror, and it is an opportunity for Iraq's new government to turn the tide of this struggle," he said.

The US military also confirmed that six people were killed in the strike, including al-Zarqawi, and his spiritual adviser &lt;a href="w%3ASheikh%20Abd-al-Rahman"&gt;Sheikh Abd-al-Rahman&lt;/a&gt; The death toll is reported at three men, three women.&lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5060468.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Some reports had said al-Zarqawi's wife and daughter died. However U.S. officials state that there is no evidence confirming the death of al-Zarqawi's wife and daughter.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Oil%20falls%20%241.19%20on%20news%20of%20al-Zarqawi%20death&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The price for a barrel of oil dropped after news broke that 's leader in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt; had been killed in a US airstrike Thursday. The death of al-Zarqawi seems to have been interpreted by the market as good news for the future supply of oil from the region.

This is against the backdrop in 2006 when the price of oil had reached a record high of $70 a barrel.

Today on the New York Mercantile Exchange light crude futures for July dropped from over $70 a barrel to a low of $69.54 before rising to $69.63 for a $1.19 loss. "There's less of a terror threat in Iraq now," said Naohiro Niimura, vice president of energy derivatives at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd, in Tokyo, who gave his reason for the fall.

Iraq lies over one-third of known oil reserves but since the Iraq war in 2003 has been unable to pump more than 2 million barrels a day - 1 million less than prior to the coalition invasion. In May exports were said to be 1.5 million bpd.

The line on a graph that plotted oil price had done a steady incline over recent years, though many factors are involved in the price of a barrel of oil so it is almost impossible to say how much the troubles in Iraq contributed to this rise. 

Iraq's exports make up the largest proportion of its Gross Domestic Product and a significant proportion of world supply. Investors were said to have been worried about developing in the country citing lack of security and legal protection.

Al-Zarqawi, known for videotaped beheadings, suicide bombing campaigns against coalition forces and civilians and reportedly some attacks on oil infrastructure inside Iraq, had claimed responsibility for bombing three hotels in Amman, Jordan. It was hoped the death of Osama bin Laden's operative in Iraq would remove a man who had opposed the US-backed Shiite-led state and western influence in the wider-region. 

The Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's recent appointment of new security and home affairs ministers also may have affected the oil market. Director general of marketing and economics at the Iraqi oil ministry said both pieces of news together were "a positive indicator for security," said Shamkhi Faraj. 

Other voices sounded a note of caution against the optimism: "The situation in Iraq has now become so chaotic, that it transcends the death of one man, influential as al-Zarqawi was," said Edward Meir.

The analyst at Man Financial believes the threat to the Iraqi oil industry is political as well as physical.

"Yes, al Qaeda attacked oil installations but they were not the only actors and they were not the main actors," he said. "There is also a new factor -- political parties that are using threats against oil to gain leverage."

In an announcement about oil, Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih of the Iraqi government said it hoped to produce 4.3 million bpd in four years.

Nigeria

Five South Korean workers have been kidnapped from a natural gas facility in the Nigerian Delta. The company is operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company.
A group called the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta is claiming responsibility for the attack and kidnappings and says that one kidnapper and at least six Nigerian soldiers were killed on a Nigerian military boat, when gunmen entered the facility. The group's main demand is the release of a jailed militia leader, Mujahid Dokubo-Asari.

Freelance journalist Tim Selwyn has been found guilty of sedition. This is the first conviction for sedition in New Zealand in over 75 years.
Selwyn faced two charges of "making a seditious statement" relating to pamphlets he had left near the scene of an axe attack on the Prime Minister's electorate office in November, 2004, which had called upon like-minded New Zealanders to "engage in similar acts of civil disobediance" and to "take similar action of their own".

<h1>International forces in Dili reach agreement</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=International%20forces%20in%20Dili%20reach%20agreement&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The international forces in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; have reached an agreement about the coordination of the military and police forces in the field. Representatives of the four countries reached the agreement during an urgent meeting after an incident between Australian and Portuguese soldiers yesterday.

In the agreement reached between &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; and the Timorese government, operational autonomy is given to the international forces, which will operate in cooperation and coordination with each other.

The agreement also stated that in an initial phase &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt; will be divided into sectors, and each area will be under the control of an international force. Outside of its area of responsibility, the military or police force will only be able to operate if other international forces request their actions. Also was agreed that the police forces will assume total control of the city after the military forces leave their current occupied positions. A situation that is expected after the arrival of the remaining equipment, mainly vehicles, for the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APortuguese%20Republican%20National%20Guard"&gt;Portuguese Republican National Guard&lt;/a&gt; (GNR) and the arrival of the remaining Malaysian police officers and their equipment.

In an official notice, the Timorese Foreign Minister, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJos%C3%A9%20Ramos%20Horta"&gt;José Ramos Horta&lt;/a&gt; stated that "the objective on a long run is for the GNR to operate has a tactical intervention force in all the city of Dili".

Ramos Horta explained that "in the next days, maybe already tomorrow morning, they [the Australian, Malaysian, New Zealand and Portuguese forces] will do some coordination training, in way to assure that the four forces know exactly what each one will do". "Since some are from the Army and the others [Portuguese Republican National Guard] are a specialized police and that they never worked together, its useful to carry out some practical exercises", he added.

In another subject, Ramos Horta explained that the Australian soldiers that are in Maubisse, next to a rebel group lead by major Reinado, and in Gleno, Ermera, next to another group of "military opponents", are there "containing those elements".

"Those groups are not comparable with other people that are here in Dili and that must be disarmed", Ramos Horta said.

"The Australian presence in Maubisse and Gleno aims in containing those groups on their areas, until arrives the moment in which the President decides that is time for also mister Alfredo Reinado and the others to put down their weapons", he said. "This is not urgent because they are not causing problems to anyone", he justified.

The urgency of the resolution and clarification of the command and cooperation of the international forces was originated after an incident between Australian and Portuguese soldiers. When yesterday a Portuguese GNR patrol transported three people to a temporary detention center managed by Australian soldiers.

The detainees were arrested by a GNR Special Operations team, after being caught looting a governmental warehouse, in Balide, Dili.

The Australian soldiers then refused to receive the detained men, questioning the legitimacy of the Portuguese soldiers to make arrests. The Portuguese contingent transported the detainees to the Timorese prison services in Dili.

Five &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n natural gas plant workers who were kidnapped yesterday have been released to a member of the &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;n Senate, David Brigidi. The five ex-hostages walked into a Nigerian Government building and were in good health.

The kidnappers, who belong to the group Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, released the workers after Mujahid Dokubo-Asari pled for the release. Mujahid Dokubo-Asari is a militant who is currently in prison and the kidnappers were demanding that he be released.

"All five Korean prisoners captured by our unit in the attack on the Daewoo camp were released … at the request of Dokubo-Asari," said the group.

Shell Petroleum Development Company operated the plant in the Nigerian Delta where the hostages worked. Shell has since closed the plant after the group said yesterday that more attacks were "planned" on the facility. The plant is located in Port Harcourt and Daewoo Engineering and Construction Co. and Korea Gas Corp. were the workers employers.

Today the group again reaffirmed their earlier statement that all "oil companies in the Niger Delta are again warned to leave while they can."

<h1>New HIV drug could stop virus from spreading</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20HIV%20drug%20could%20stop%20virus%20from%20spreading&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In a small-scale trial on humans, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; scientists say they may have developed a new drug that could stop the spread of &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and "rapidly clears" the blood of the virus.

"There is a lot of interest in this product," said editor Keith Alcorn of the National Aids Manual.

The drug called PA-457, which is derived from betulinic acid and comes from by-products from paper manufacturers, is being manufactured and developed by &lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; drug manufacturer Panacos Pharmaceuticals. The drug is known as a maturation inhibitor, which is a new group of drugs. Its purpose is to break down the protective protein coating of HIV. The drug exposes the inner genetic material by making holes in the coating of the virus essentially causing it to break down and disabling its ability to be passed from one human to the next. The drug also shows that it works on strains of HIV that are resistant to other medications. The drug is also compatible with other HIV drugs.

"It's a truly novel new class of drugs, and I really support their development. If &lt;a href="w%3APA-457"&gt;PA-457&lt;/a&gt; turns out to be non-toxic, easy to use and not to select for resistance, it will find good use," said Charles Boucher who researches HIV at Utrecht university medical center in the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;.

"It stops the virus by interfering in one of the final stages in its assembly and stops it from 'budding out' from the wall of a cell," said Alcorn.

Scientists are expected to begin a larger scale test on 48 people in one month, whose drugs are no longer working; however, the drug itself is not likely to be available for wide-scale use for at least 3 years. Test subjects will be administered either a placebo or PA-457 that will be taken in combination with the medication they already take.

"This provides the basis for future studies that will be designed to provide a detailed understanding of the interaction between PA-457 and its target as well as insights into the design of new generations of maturation inhibitors," said CEO of Panacos Pharmaceuticals, Graham Allaway.

At least 80% of those suffering from the disease have shown resistance to other medications.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; announced Australia's unemployment rate for May 2006 on Thursday. The rate had dropped to 4.9 percent, the first time since 1976 that unemployment in Australia had been below five percent.

Mr Howard said 56,000 full time jobs were created in May with 38,000 of those taken up by women. He said it was a symbol of how well his government was managing the economy. "The result is a wonderful symbol of the success of the Government’s economic policies." said Mr Howard.

According to the government 1.8 million jobs have been created since it took office in March 1996.

The number of people actively seeking work also increased, a sign Mr Howard said that people are "confident of finding work."

At an interview in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Howard told reporters that he believed the unemployment rate would be driven down further when the benefits of his &lt;a href="w%3AWorkchoices"&gt;Workchoices&lt;/a&gt; industrial relations reforms begin to show. "I believe, as some of the effects of the workplace relations changes work their way through, then the unemployment rate, particularly in small business, will go down even further," he said.

Mr Howard denied that Workchoices had any affect on the figures for May saying that it was too early to tell. "I am not going to make that claim. It’s only May’s figures and the changes only came in March. I think it is too early to make that claim" Mr Howard told reporters.

Following the announcement, &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; MP Wilson Tuckey said that the rise in the number of jobs could not have happened without the government's industrial relations reforms. "We wouldn't have achieved these outcomes, particularly in employer hiring, without the changes we've made," 

"When employers have confidence in their hiring arrangements as the Workchoices gives them, they're going to go out and hire more people" said Mr Tuckey.

Stephen Smith, workplace spokesperson for the opposition attacked Mr Tuckey's claims, stating that all the government's new industrial relations legislation has achieved is reduced wages. "The suggestion that somehow we've got these employment and unemployment figures as a result of 30 days of John Howard slashing wages is a complete nonsense," he said.

"It's great that we've got a 30-year low in unemployment but that's a result of 15 years of continuous economic growth and a resources boom." said Mr Smith.

According to a government document, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; federal government has detained 26 Australian citizens in immigration detention centres over the past ten years. In its count, the document does not include high-profile cases involving &lt;a href="w%3ACornelia%20Rau"&gt;Cornelia Rau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVivian%20Solon"&gt;Vivian Solon&lt;/a&gt; and "Mr. T", for which the government has already accepted liability.

Responding to a question on notice from &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; MP Steve Georganus, &lt;a href="w%3APhillip%20Ruddock"&gt;Phillip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt;, former Australian immigration minister said that the commonwealth ombudsman was looking into 220 possible cases where people have been illegally detained and of those 26 had been identified as legitimate Australian citizens. "Of the 220 cases bearing the descriptor 'released not unlawful' the department has identified 26 cases involving Australian citizens" he said.

According to Mr Georganus, his question was put to the government six months ago. He received a reply from Mr Ruddock last week.

Mr Georganus said that the errors should not be occurring in a democratic country. "When you see 26 Australian citizens locked away in Australia in a democratic country in the year 2006, you lose all confidence," he said.

At least 34 people were injured when a series of explosions rocked different parts of the state of &lt;a href="w%3AAssam"&gt;Assam&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, on Thursday night. According to the police, four explosions of a very high intensity occurred in different parts of the state after 7 p.m. Those injured in the explosions are being treated at local hospitals.

Police said the first explosion occurred when militants lobbed a grenade at a crowded market in Islampur, 80 kilometres north of Guwahati, injuring 21 people. In the second incident, five passers-by were injured in another blast near the Golokganj police station close to the border with Bangladesh. The third explosion took place in the western district of Dhubri town where three people were wounded. The last explosion occurred in Nagaon, 120 kilometres east of Guwahati, injuring four people, including a policeman. 

The attacks come a day after the Central government announced dates for the third round of talks between government peace representatives and an 11-member civil society group from Assam chosen by the militant, separatist group &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Liberation%20Front%20of%20Asom"&gt;United Liberation Front of Asom&lt;/a&gt; (ULFA). The ULFA has demanded the release of five of its top leaders from prison if New Delhi wants to hold direct talks with the separatist group. Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said "We have already recommended their release to the authorities in Delhi. We want peace back in the state."

<h1>Congressional Candidate Raj Bhakta challenges Schwartz to debates</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Congressional%20Candidate%20Raj%20Bhakta%20challenges%20Schwartz%20to%20debates&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Republican candidate (R) has challenged incumbent U.S. Rep. Congresswoman (D-13) to a series of debates.
Bhakta, a former contestant on the television show , accepted an invitation to debate on 'The Daily Show' with Jon Stewart. Schwartz, however, declined - wishing to keep the debates in the district instead of on TV.
"You wonder, why wouldn't somebody want to debate their opponent?" Bhakta said. "Either, they are afraid that they are going to look worse, which I would if I were her, or, you are just so full of contempt for the voters that you figure you are above that and they will vote for you anyway."
Now, Bhakta suggests a series of 12 debates, six in Montgomery County and six in . 
"We want to get out and take questions from the voters," he said. "I have nothing to be afraid of." 
Calls to Schwartz's office were not returned before deadline.
While both candidates have said they want to debate, the specific details of where and when have yet to be ironed out.
"Anytime, anyplace, I'll debate," Bhakta said.
He even purposed one for the fourth of July.
"Her vision for America's future, on the day America was born, versus my own," he said.
"My issues, quietly clearly, are how do we deal with the big issues of the country and the big issues of the area and Northeast Philadelphia," Bhakta said, "which are rising crime, declining services, a mayor who's trying to destroy Northeast Philadelphia."
As his grassroots campaign continues, Bhakta gains confidence.
"Meeting with the people and talking with the people, you realize what makes this country great," he said. "It gives me a lot of confidence when I'm out there and talking to people because I realize how very poorly represented they people."
Bhakta wants to launch a movement to "save the Northeast." "It needs some saving," he said. 
His campaign is compiling crime statistics for the Northeast that show a "quintupling of crime." Bhakta says that over the past four years crime in "most areas" has increased fourfold. 
"That is ridiculous," he said. "It's unbelievable. A community can only hold up to that kind of attack for so long. Take a ride down Schwartz Street and it looks like that - four times as much crime."

<h1>Details emerge on how al-Zarqawi's location was pinned</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Details%20emerge%20on%20how%20al-Zarqawi%27s%20location%20was%20pinned&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Someone said to be an informant within &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt;'s trusted circle told Coalition forces the insurgent leader was going to have a meeting, it has emerged. This information appears to have led US F-16Cs to a safehouse in the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href="w%3AHibhid"&gt;Hibhid&lt;/a&gt;, where the Jordanian and five others, including a child, were killed on Wednesday.

"We had absolutely no doubt whatsoever that Zarqawi was in the house. There was 100 percent confirmation," Caldwell said.

The informer is said to want the insurgency to pursue a strategy within the Iraqi political process, which in the informer's view was in contrast to tactics executed by al-Zarqawi's leadership that involved ethnic killings. 

It was one of the last in a long line of breadcrumbs leading the hunt for the Iraqi government's most-wanted murderer to the doorstep of an attractive isolated house in Hibhid.

In a late-April video al-Zarqawi had been shown spraying bullets from a machine gun with a horizon in the background. This is said to have revealed the general location of al-Zarqawi, found near &lt;a href="w%3ADiyala%20Governorate"&gt;Diyala&lt;/a&gt; province, in the north east of Iraq. The ethnically mixed region had seen an upsurge in violence and over days preceding the airstrike. 

Murders had included a number of decapitated heads left in fruitboxes. Al-Zarqawi had been known for kidnapping and video beheadings of westerners in Iraq. 

Another al-Zarwaqi insider also had given vital clues to the investigators before the final tip-off. A former customs clearance officer in &lt;a href="w%3ARutba"&gt;Rutba&lt;/a&gt; identified as Ziad Khalaf al-Karbuli had named Sheikh Abu Abdul-Rahman as al-Zarqawi's spiritual advisor and gave-up contact details. 

Ziad Khalaf al-Karbuli had appeared on &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordanian&lt;/a&gt; television, May 23, to confess his links to al-Zarqawi, and to his murder of a Jordanian driver and his kidnap of two Moroccan embassy employees in 2005. The vital clue about Abu Abdul-Rahman was not broadcast.

With details from the al-Karbuli interrogation the gunsights got closer to al-Zarqawi. "Through painstaking intelligence effort, they were able to start tracking him, monitoring his movements and establishing when he was doing his link-ups with Zarqawi, " Maj. Gen. William Caldwell said of the investigators.

The US search for the Sheikh included the use of remote controlled aircraft, it was revealed.

However; it is said neither the al-Karbuli information nor the al-Zarqawi betrayer lead the Americans to press the fire button on al-Zarwaqi's two-story home. Al-Zarqawi was hard to catch because he reportedly eschewed trackable cell-phones in favour of high-tech Thuraya-made satellite phones to communicate.

The death certificate was signed by the secret informant who said both Sheikh Abu Abdul-Rahman and al-Zarqawi would be in Hibhid, Wednesday night. 

For the elusive insurgent who had previously escaped attempts to bomb him, the execution came after comparison of this source's information with tracks of the location of satellite phone users. 

The location found was beside a property with a courtyard surrounded by fields away from other buildings. It appears then the US command made the decision to strike at an address in the small town, near Baqubah.

US special forces were on the scene to photograph the dead al-Zarqawi at 6:17 p.m., two minutes after two 500lb bombs were dropped. Al-Zarqawi was said to be alive and being given medical assistance when he died of wounds sustained in the bombing.

The announcement of the killing was made Thursday by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said to viewers of Iraqi television the $25 million bounty for information leading to the death or capture of al-Zarqawi would be "honored."

&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;'s second in command, &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;, has released a new videotape. The Arabic television network Aljazeera has aired the tape.

On the tape, al-Zawahiri said, "God bless the prophet of Islam in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, the persistent hero of Islam, the Holy Warrior &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi"&gt;Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&lt;/a&gt;." According to Aljazeera, the tape was made before the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq.

During the broadcast, al-Zawahiri talks to the general Muslim population saying, "I call upon them to reject any referendum on &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;, because Palestine is not for bargaining or bidding. Palestine was a land of Islam, and its liberation is the duty of every Muslim. I call upon Muslims everywhere to support the brothers in Palestine."

Al-Zawahiri also claims that the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; is trying to "occupy" &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and is attempting to "divide" the nation.

"The spineless Sudanese government ... is joining the United States in dividing Sudan to stay in power. In Sudan, the crusader (U.N.) &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; decided to send military experts to Darfur in preparation for its occupation and division. I call upon every Muslim and everyone who has faith in Sudan, and every fervent Muslim in &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; to confront the Zionist Crusader plot to occupy the lands of Islam," added al-Zawahiri.

Zawahiri also talks about judges in &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; who wish to make the judiciary system independent.

"In Egypt, the crusader system supports the secular system that violates the judges' integrity, cheats in elections and enforces emergency law. Oh judges, you won't obtain independence unless your country is liberated first, and our home will not be liberated unless Islamic Sharia [law] is implemented. The regime won't give you your independence because to do so would be to kill itself," said Zawahiri, who was addressing the Egyptian judges.

"I have to be frank with you. You are part of the problem. You agreed on the constitution and the secular laws imposed on the nation by arms and suppression and torture and rigged elections. I tell the Egyptian judges you will not gain independence because &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; simply and clearly do not want that, and what you see today in procedures against you is part of their promised American reform plan," added Zawahiri.

Zawahiri also talks about the aid to the Palestinian government, which has been frozen. "The Arab governments did not have the courage to even meet the Palestinians' needs for one month. Because the orders came from &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to their agents to starve the Palestinians and to isolate them," added Zawahiri.

The videotape is approximately 17 minutes long and it is unknown where Aljazeera got the tape.

A bus accident in the north of &lt;a href="w%3ATanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; located approximately 15 miles to the east of &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Kilimanjaro"&gt;Mount Kilimanjaro&lt;/a&gt; killed at least 54 people and injuring 20 after falling into the Malala river. Police say that the bus was packed with too many people and witnesses claim the bus was speeding.

"There were some (people) that were standing, plus cargo on top...It is not allowed within the law because the bus's capacity is 26 passengers," said Arusha regional commissioner, Abbas Kandoro. He also said the bus had at least 74 people on board.

"The bus was carrying 74 passengers. Fifty four people have died," added Kandoro.

A crane has been called in to assist in the rescue and police fear that more bodies will be found under the wreckage.

The people were traveling from Arusha to Mererani.

The 2006 soccer World Cup kicked off in the Allianz Arena in Munich, Friday, with hosts Germany cruising to a 4-2 win over Costa Rica.

The first match of Group A, which was full of attacking football, was a goal-fest for Jürgen Klinsmann's side, whose Miroslav Klose notched up a brace.

The highlight of the match went to German midfielder Torsten Frings for a 30-yard shot that sent the new tournament football swerving viciously past a hapless Costa Rican keeper.

The match had started brightly for the side, missing captain Michael Ballack, when on 6 minutes left-back Philipp Lahm curled in from the top-left of the penalty area. 

But the joy the home crowd had after the spectacular start was punctured 6 minutes later by Paulo Wanchope. The Costa Rican striker broke through a static German defence to pass the ball neatly by Jens Lehmann. 

Klose, who had 7 goals for the team in the 2002 Korea/Japan World Cup, tapped in a second to again give the German side the lead with a quarter of an hour gone.

During the game possession of the ball was dominated by the hosts who, while looking vulnerable on the break, looked like scoring whenever they went forward.

They scored a third, Klose's second, on 61 minutes, when the striker was first to react to a rebound from his own header, which had been saved by Jose Porras.

Wanchope kept the home team on their toes breaking the German defence for a second time but any chance of the Central American team pulling off a shock was ended when Frings' bullet hit the back off the net.

The game was played in spirit, the only yellow card going to Costa Rica's Daniel Fonseca for a first-half challenge.

A major fire destroyed a large &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; building in the city of &lt;a href="w%3AVlaardingen"&gt;Vlaardingen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; on Friday evening. Firefighters were working to put out the blaze before burning out of control and at one point causing evacuations from nearby buildings.

The fire erupted just before 8 p.m. local time (1900 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) and was controlled around 10 p.m. (2100 UTC), according to fire officials. 

The blaze was located in a large Muslim building, including a mosque on the first floor. No persons were believed to be injured in the inferno.

Authorities said they were investigating the cause of the fire but suspected the cause was &lt;a href="w%3AArson"&gt;arson&lt;/a&gt;. Police officers and fire crews were evacuating the surrounding residents. The fire department called it a "major fire" and all units were called to the scene. Also on the scene were water fire units as the building is located near a river.

Vlaardingen is located about 10 miles from the &lt;a href="w%3AHague"&gt;Hague&lt;/a&gt;.

After the murder of &lt;a href="w%3ATheo%20van%20Gogh%20%28film%20director%29"&gt;Theo van Gogh&lt;/a&gt; on November 2, 2004, many mosques in the Netherlands were set on fire.

On November 8, 2004, a bomb exploded at a Muslim school in the south of the country.

A strong defensive display and two well taken goals saw Ecuador beat Poland in the second Group A match at the soccer World Cup. 

The thousands of Polish fans who had traveled to the Veltins-Arena stadium in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, saw their team struggle to put together attacking plays.

Ecuador, whose captain and defender Ivan Hurtado was taken off injured on 67 minutes, scored a goal in the first half and one ten minutes from the end for a 2-0 victory.

The first twenty minutes was cagey with both sides unable to find form; there was not one chance on goal for the first twenty minutes.

When one did come it was Ecuador who capitalised: a throw-in from the right into the penalty area was flicked on for Carlos Tenario to nod passed the outstretched fingers of Artur Boruc into the far corner of the Polish net.

While first half-possession was equal for both sides Poland dominated the second period as Ecuador sat back on their lead, content to hit on the break.

Poland continued their early form of choosing the wrong pass and many times lost the ball in the third of the pitch nearest the opposition goal.

Ecuador scored a second ten minutes from time; in a rare attack near the Polish goal the ball was threaded by Polish defenders leaving a two on one with a stranded Boruc.

Agustin Delgardo didn't miss from ten yards.

The Polish game never got going for manager Pawel Janas until the last five minutes when they hit the horizontal and then the vertical whitework of Christian Mora's goal.

Much of the credit for the performance of Luis Suarez's Ecuador side must be put at the feet of their defenders, particularly Giovanny Espinoza and Ivan Hurtado.

He will be hoping his defensive leader recovers for the next game against Costa Rica while Poland must contend with a German side who won their first game of the World Cup, Friday.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20government%20to%20review%20censorship%20of%20%26quot%3Bhate%20material%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; federal government is looking at reviewing censorship laws to ensure that so-called "hate material" is adequately censored. The government claims the review is required following the approval of eight publications and a film that allegedly promoted &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;

Australia's attorney general, &lt;a href="w%3APhillip%20Ruddock"&gt;Phillip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; said he had written to censorship ministers in each state and territory informing them that he wishes to raise the matter with them in July. He said that the government did not wish for material advocating or promoting "terrorist acts" to be available in Australia.

Under Australia's censorship laws, the classification board (which is part of the &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Film%20and%20Literature%20Classification%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Office of Film and Literature Classification&lt;/a&gt; can refuse to classify a video game, book or film in certain circumstances (including incitement of crime or violence). An item that is refused classification can not be sold, hired or exhibited in Australia.

In a statement Mr Ruddock said that any censorship review had to find the right balance between freedom of expression and the incitement of violence. "I will be asking my State and Territory colleagues to consider whether current laws strike the right balance between freedom of expression and community concerns about promotion of acts of violence."

"Freedom of speech is a right all Australians would fiercely defend so it is important to consider these issues carefully," he said.

Mr Ruddock also has referred eight publications and one film to the Classification Review Board in response to community concerns about the dissemination of material that promotes terrorism.

Last year, eight publications and a film were referred to the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; for investigation after concerns they incited hatred and acts of violence. The AFP could not get sufficient to pursue a prosecution.

The classification board classified the material in December 2005 after it found that the material did not fall under refused classification provisions. The board found that the material did not promote or incite violence or crime.

In response to the classification, Mr Ruddock said "This is an important issue and further consideration of the classification of this material is warranted."

Additionally, the bill also establishes a Child Abuse Response Team within the &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma%20State%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt;. Oklahoma has now joined Florida, Louisiana, Montana, and South Carolina to have similar measures for repeat &lt;a href="w%3Achild%20molestation"&gt;child molestation&lt;/a&gt;.

Gumm, a sponsor of SB 1800, said that ensuring the safety of children is the government's greatest moral obligation. Gumm also asked "We allow the death penalty for someone who has killed a body. Why would we allow someone to escape who has killed a soul?"

One Senator argued against the bill suggesting "the healing power of forgiveness" is more important than that of the death penalty.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%27Net%20Neutrality%20Amendment%27%20fails%20in%20U.S.%20House&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Thursday, &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; turned down the "Net Neutrality Amendment" to the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunications%20Opportunity%2C%20Promotion%20and%20Enhancement%20Act%20of%202006"&gt;Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Enhancement Act&lt;/a&gt; (COPE Act) 269-152. 

The COPE Act is designed to make it easier for telecommunications companies to offer cable TV service and strengthen competition. Proponents hope it would lower the price of high-speed Internet for consumer by enabling Internet service providers to bundle phone, data, video and mobile phone services. The act is the first major telecommunications bill to come before Congress in over a decade, and it passed by 321-101 vote on Thursday.

Portions of the "Net Neutrality" amendment to the COPE Act sought to assure that communication companies who provide Internet services treated all data delivery passing through their connections equally. It specified that each broadband provider has the duty "not to block, impair, degrade, discriminate against, or interfere with the ability of any person to use a broadband connection to access, use, send, receive, or offer lawful content, applications, or services over the Internet." The amendment's passage would have prevented AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast and other broadband providers from charging content providers like Google, Yahoo, Amazon or eBay for priority access to their networks. Democrats were largely in favour of the legislation with 140 Ayes and 58 Noes, whereas only 11 Republicans voted for the measure, with 211 against.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi argued that "The imposition of additional fees for Internet content providers would unduly burden Web-based small businesses and start-ups," and that "They would also hamper communications by noncommercial users, those using religious speech, promoting civic involvement and exercising First Amendment freedoms."

The phone companies and their Congressional allies argued that the restrictions in the amendment would discourage investment in upgrading networks. Chief technology officer for &lt;a href="w%3ABellSouth"&gt;BellSouth&lt;/a&gt; William L. Smith told the ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ that telephone companies should be able to charge companies for having their content load faster than that of competitors. "If I go to the airport, I can buy a coach standby ticket or a first-class ticket," Smith said. "In the shipping business, I can get two-day air or six-day ground."

The legislation has been subject to intense lobbying by telecommunication companies on one side, and content providers on the other. The bill is due to be discussed next in the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;, where lobbying efforts from both sides are expected to intensify. The &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; said that it supports the current bill.

A &lt;a href="w%3AYemeni"&gt;Yemeni&lt;/a&gt; man linked to the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has been deported from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, only the second time that Section 72 of the Immigration Act is used to deport someone. Consent of the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt; was required and there is no right of &lt;a href="w%3Aappeal"&gt;appeal&lt;/a&gt;.

Rayed Abdullah, a United States-qualified pilot, arrived in New Zealand in February under a variation of his name.

Immigration Minister &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Cunliffe"&gt;David Cunliffe&lt;/a&gt; says “The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Government"&gt;government&lt;/a&gt; considered that the man's continued presence in New Zealand posed a threat to &lt;a href="w%3Anational%20security"&gt;national security&lt;/a&gt; because he was directly associated with persons responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001," 

"We don't have any specific information that he was a terrorist. We know that he was associated with terrorists," he said, adding that his "activities in New Zealand" warranted the deportation. Once his real identity became known, he was identified as having close connections to people involved with the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, and had been named in the 9/11 Commission Report,"

"Initially, he lived in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; where he undertook some &lt;a href="w%3AEnglish%20language"&gt;English language&lt;/a&gt; training, the stated purpose of his visit. He then shifted to &lt;a href="w%3APalmerston%20North"&gt;Palmerston North&lt;/a&gt; where he was building up his flying hours flying with an instructor – he'd previously trained as a pilot in the United States."

"With immigration officials, police arrested the man in Palmerston North on Monday, 29 May, and he was deported to &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; the next day."

"For security reasons, I cannot comment further. I am advised; however, that at no point was there any specific risk to New Zealanders during the man's time in this country."

The US Government's &lt;a href="w%3A9/11%20Commission%20Report"&gt;9/11 Commission Report&lt;/a&gt; says that Abdullah lived and trained in &lt;a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Phoenix, Arizona&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AHani%20Hanjour"&gt;Hani Hanjour&lt;/a&gt;, the Saudi Arabian believed to have piloted &lt;a href="w%3AFlight%2077"&gt;Flight 77&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;. Abdullah was a leader at the Islamic Cultural Centre in &lt;a href="w%3APhoenix"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; where, the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; says, he "reportedly gave extremist speeches at the mosque". 
The report also said another associate of Hanjour, &lt;a href="w%3AFaisal%20al%20Salmi"&gt;Faisal al Salmi&lt;/a&gt;, had flight training with Rayed Abdullah but wanted to keep his training secret.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation said al-Salmi was deceptive when he was asked if he had taken flight training at the behest of an organisation.
Section 72 of the Immigration Act 1987 provides that where the Immigration Minister certifies that the continued presence in New Zealand of a person constitutes a threat to national security, the Governor-General may, by order in council, order that person's deportation.

Just a few hours after fire crews put out a suspected arson fire, another fire hit the large Muslim building. The building has now been completely destroyed, a spokesman for the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; police said.

The building was engulfed in flames on Saturday morning. Authorities are investigating and do not rule out a possibility that it was arson.

A &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; mosque that was located in the building has been there for over 14 years and relations with visitors and the neighborhood are fine, according to police.

Both fires didn't result in any injuries but after the second fire on Saturday, the buildings has been completely destroyed and police fear the entire building could collapse.

An &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAsiana%20Airlines"&gt;Asiana Airlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAirbus"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; aircraft made an emergency landing Friday night and landed safely without its nose, radar and windows. The plane landed at the airport of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeoul"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The plane lost parts in a severe storm between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACheju"&gt;Cheju&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; island and Seoul.

Hail also destroyed the plane's cockpit windows that were made of security glass. The windows remained in place but the pilots were unable to see through the glass. The radar could have solved the problem, but was also damaged by the storm. The pilots decided to use two very small windows on both sides of the cockpit.

The plane was carrying 200 people, including 177 students of primary education schools on a school trip, a spokesman of Asiana Airlines said Saturday.

The pilots Lee Chan-go and Kim Yong-ik will be rewarded because they landed the plane safely despite all the problems.

No one was injured in the incident.

Two teenagers have been found shot to death in &lt;a href="w%3ASalford"&gt;Salford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Manchester"&gt;Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;w:UK&lt;/a&gt;. One of the victims is a 15-year old girl, the other victim is a male aged 18.

Emergency services were called to reports of a shooting on Saturday morning. They found the girl dead at the scene. The man died in an ambulance en-route to the hospital.

A Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman said officers were still trying to establish the circumstances of the shooting.

"Police were called to Orion Place in Lower Broughton, Salford, following reports that shots had been fired. Officers attended and discovered the body of a 15-year-old girl. An 18 year-old boy was also found at the scene. He was taken to a hospital by ambulance but died a short time later. The investigation is at a very early stage and inquiries are continuing," the spokeswoman said. 

The Heath Avenue area is sealed off while officers investigate.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=All%20Blacks%20defeat%20Ireland%20in%20rugby&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AIreland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; 34 points to 23 in &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AWaikato%20Stadium"&gt;Waikato Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. The Irish came close to recording its first ever win against the All Blacks, leading 16 points to eight at half time, but a late surge by the New Zealanders ensured a clean record was kept against them. The All Blacks performed the traditional Ka Mate haka as their pre-match tradition. The decision was made prior to the day of the test after members of the public complained about the cut-throat gesture in the Kapa o Pango haka, first performed at the &lt;a href="w%3ATri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt; in 2005.

Scoring quickly opened for the home side, with &lt;a href="w%3ADoug%20Howlett"&gt;Doug Howlett&lt;/a&gt; getting a &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; in the first minute of the game. &lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20McAlister"&gt;Luke McAlister&lt;/a&gt; missed the conversion. McAlister missed a penalty shot soon after. Ireland quickly responded, and &lt;a href="w%3ARonan%20O%E2%80%99Gara"&gt;Ronan O’Gara&lt;/a&gt; was able to put points on the board, and converted it to give Ireland the lead, 10 points to five, with play just past 10 minutes. O’Gara was successful with another two penalties, and Ireland went into the second half leading 16 points to eight.

In the second half, &lt;a href="w%3AMils%20Muliaina"&gt;Mils Muliaina&lt;/a&gt; was able to give the All Blacks breathing space, scoring a try in the opening exchanges of the second half. Ireland responded with a try to &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Trimble"&gt;Andrew Trimble&lt;/a&gt; that was also subsequently converted. McAlister landed two penalty goals for the All Blacks to put the team back in the game, with around 20 minutes remaining. A penalty goal to McAlister in the 71st minute put the All Blacks ahead, with just nine minutes remaining. A try to &lt;a href="w%3ATroy%20Flavell"&gt;Troy Flavell&lt;/a&gt; ensured the All Blacks kept its record against Ireland intact. It was &lt;a href="w%3ARichie%20McCaw"&gt;Richie McCaw&lt;/a&gt;'s first test as the All Black captain, coach &lt;a href="w%3AGraham%20Henry"&gt;Graham Henry&lt;/a&gt; was impressed with the win, but described the effort as rusty. The sides will contest a second test next week.

&lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="Paraguay"&gt;Paraguay&lt;/a&gt; 1-0 in a bruising encounter among the shadows of the Commerzbank Arena, Frankfurt, Saturday.

In the sunshine and heat, which reached 30 degrees Celsius, it became a physical game that saw three bookings and the referee frequently blowing his whistle.

England got the perfect start scoring after just 3 minutes from a &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Beckham"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt; freekick. Swung in from the left of the field, the ball clipped the head of Paraguayan captain &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Gamarra"&gt;Carlos Gamarra&lt;/a&gt; on its way to the net.

However; the game was not attractive for the neutral. Both sides looked nervous and no side got control of the midfield. Passes were frequently misplaced and attacks from both teams lacked cutting edge.

Paraguay lost number one goalkeeper &lt;a href="w%3AJusto%20Villa"&gt;Justo Villa&lt;/a&gt; to an injury in the sixth minute of the game. &lt;a href="w%3AAldo%20Borbadilla"&gt;Aldo Borbadilla&lt;/a&gt; replaced him.

Missing &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt;, arguably their team's most skilled player, whose recent injury though healed had ruled him out for this match, the noisy England fans in the crowd didn't have much to sing about except the victory.

England's Swedish manager &lt;a href="w%3ASven-G%C3%B6ran%20Eriksson"&gt;Sven-Göran Eriksson&lt;/a&gt;'s side had more possession but failed to score more than the one early goal. On their part, Paraguay was unable to capitalise on a number of English defensive errors to get an equaliser. 

England next face &lt;a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt; while Paraguay face the England manager's home nation, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Springboks&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; test in &lt;a href="w%3ADurban"&gt;Durban&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The Springboks intended to defend its unbeaten home record under &lt;a href="w%3AJake%20White"&gt;Jake White&lt;/a&gt;, whilst the Scottish showed good form in the &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Nations%20Championship"&gt;Six Nations&lt;/a&gt;. 

Scoring opened in the third minute, with &lt;a href="w%3APercy%20Montgomery"&gt;Percy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; landing a penalty goal to put South Africa three points in front. Scotland replied five minutes later with a penalty goal of its own by &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Paterson"&gt;Chris Paterson&lt;/a&gt; to tie the game at three points all. In the 15th minute, the Springboks team was disallowed a &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; after the referee consulted the television match official. However, in the 16th minute, &lt;a href="w%3ASchalk%20Burger"&gt;Schalk Burger&lt;/a&gt; is given a try. It was converted by Montgomery, to give the Springgboks an 11 points to three lead. A minute later &lt;a href="w%3ABreyton%20Paulse"&gt;Breyton Paulse&lt;/a&gt; touches down in the corner for another South African try, though it is not converted, Scotland now trails three points to 15. Paterson booted a penalty goal in the 25th minute to put Scotland back in the game, though Montgomery did the same in the 32nd minute. The Springboks entered the break leading 18 points to six.

Four minutes in from the break, Paterson kicked a penalty goal, putting Scotland back in the running, the score now being 18 points to nine, with over half an hour of game time remaining. However, the South Africans made a Scottish comeback all the more unlikely as &lt;a href="w%3AAndre%20Snyman"&gt;Andre Snyman&lt;/a&gt; scoring a try in the 53rd minute. Montgomery converted the try, and South Africa was now leading 25 to nine. South African took the lead to 28 points with another penalty goal in the 61st minute. Two minutes later Montgomery scored a try and although he missed the conversion, he was successful with a penalty shot six minutes later. With just over ten minutes remaining, the score was 36 points to nine in favour of the Springboks. &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Webster"&gt;Simon Webster&lt;/a&gt; made sure that Scotland finished on a high note, scoring the last try of the match, which was subsequently converted by Paterson. The final score was 36 points to 16. The nations will meet again next week.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma%20State%20University%20-%20Stillwater"&gt;Oklahoma State University&lt;/a&gt; men's golf team won its 10th NCAA title last Saturday under first year head coach &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20McGraw"&gt;Mike McGraw&lt;/a&gt;.

After tying for fourth in the &lt;a href="w%3ABig%2012%20Conference"&gt;Big 12&lt;/a&gt; Conference championship, McGraw said "The disappointment we felt after the conference championship was so deep, but these guys came back and changed their season by realizing you can't take winning for granted."

Jonathan Moore, a redshirt freshman, became the eighth individual national championship for Oklahoma State, the first since &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Howell%20III"&gt;Charles Howell III&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. Okalhoma State also swept both team and individual championships in 1978, 1987, and 2000.

The Golf Coaches Association of America based in &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Norman, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; named Mike McGraw coach of the year earlier this week for guilding Oklahoma State to five tournament wins this season.

&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; took second place while both &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWake%20Forest%20University"&gt;Wake Forest&lt;/a&gt; tied for third at the NCAA championships.

He was arrested on Wednesday in south Kashmir on charges of inciting people against the Indian state during a series of speeches in Poonch district of South Kashmir in 2001.

Shiv Sena activists barged into the venue of the press meet and shouted slogans against him for his pro-Pakistan utterances. "They are supporters of Pakistan. They say that they want independence. We will allow them to allow them to raise anti-India themes here. We will not allow them to organise a news conference till they support India," said an activist of the Shiv Sena. Arguments also broke out between the activists of Shiv Sena and supporters of Geelani. Things turned worse when the police intervened to calm it down.

Geelani, accused the police of supporting the activists of the Shiv Sena, when they tried to take him away to cool off tempers. "We were giving a news conference peacefully when supporters of Shiv Sena came in and started shouting slogans. Now the police are also supporting them," he said, as he was being escorted away by policemen.

Geelani, who supports Jammu and Kashmir joining Pakistan, is supported by most of the armed Islamist militants fighting Indian rule in the disputed region in a conflict that has killed more than 45,000 people since it began in 1989. The 77-year-old separatist has been arrested and jailed on several occasions for making statements urging people to support Kashmir's accession to Pakistan.

Normal life in the Asom continued to be disturbed for third day in a row on Saturday following the series of subversive activities engineered by the banned United Liberation Front of Asom(ULFA). In the latest incident, Police on Saturday morning sounded red alert in the Guwahati city as an explosive timer device found in front of Kamrup SP office in Panbazar.

"The recovered device was kept in a Tiffin box, which was programmed to explode at 6:15 [IST] in the evening," said police sources adding that the hand of ULFA was suspected. The passengers of Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express had a miraculous escape as a bomb planted on the tracks near Naharkatia in the Dibrugarh district detonated just before the superfast train was to pass last night, said official sources. On Friday night, at least six persons injured in the state, following five powerful blasts that was suspected to be triggered by the banned outfit.

These blasts came barely hours after a powerful bomb explosion that killed five people and injured over 15 at a busy vegetable market in the Guwahati city on Friday evening. According to police, at least six persons injured when a bomb exploded in the house of one Milan Deori in Rupaisiding- Tapoban-Tiniali area in the Tinsukia district allegedly planted by ULFA militants. Besides this the outfit reportedly blew off four Oil pipelines belonging to Assam Gas Company Limited and Oil India Limited (OIL) successively at two places in the Dibrugarh district last night.

Police source said that two blasts occurred at 10:25 IST and 25 minutes later damaged pipeline used for electricity generation at Namrup Thermal Power plant at a place under Naharkatia police station. Later two more explosions severely damaged two crude oil pipelines belonging to OIL, nearby Bhadoipanchali. In another incident, at least three army personnel injured when militants hurled grenade at an army truck at Doomdooma in Tinsukia district at around 8 p.m. IST yesterday. On Thursday, there were four separate explosions that left 34 people injured in the districts of Dhubri, Mangaldoi and Nagaon.

Two brothers who were arrested in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; last week on suspicion of being involved in terrorist activities were released without any charges by the UK police on Friday. 

Twenty year old Abul Koyair and twenty three year old Mohammed Abdul Kahar were arrested during a police raid on June 2 at a house at Lansdown Road, Forest Gate, during which Mohammed Kahar was shot in the shoulder. They were detained under the Terrorism Act 2000 on suspicion of being involved in terrorist activities. Both the men denied any such involvement. 

Police sources had earlier said that they had information that a chemical device might be found there, the &lt;a href="w%3AAssistant%20Commissioner"&gt;Assistant Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; Andy Hayman had earlier said the police had received "specific intelligence" regarding the location. Police found no such device.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Police%20Complaints%20Commission"&gt;Police Complaints Commission&lt;/a&gt; is investigating the circumstances of the shooting of Mohammed Kahar.

Lars Largerback's Swedish side failed to break a high-energy team marshalled with great confidence from midfield by the Trinidadian captain Dwight Yorke. 

Some excellent defending from Carlos Edwards and the Caribbean back four managed to keep out its European rivals for a famous first ever point in the World Cup tournament for the small island country.

Trinidad and Tobago started the game with a reserve goalkeeper after first choice Kelvin Jack was injured after warming up. But Shaka Hislop produced a string of outstanding saves, which included one 11 minutes from time when he stuck out a hand to stop Marcus Allback placing the ball over him.

The sending off of Avery John, after getting booked for a second time for a lunge, this time on Christian Wilhelmsson on 46 minutes, did not stop the Soca Warriors. In reply Leo Benhakker changed to a more attacking 4-3-2 system and threw on an extra attacker.

The West Indies team led by Yorke was competitive and hard in the tackle but Swedish pressure meant the team was in its own half of the pitch most of the game. The team had few chances on goal because its attacking plays were few; but one shot from substitute Cornell Glen clipped the crossbar to the glee of supporters.

Sweden made many goalscoring chances but its strikers must feel unfortunate that none were converted. 

Rami Shaaban in the Sweden goal did not have a save to make. A statistic that says much for the dominance of the Swedish yellow jerseys is that Sweden had eight corner kicks to Trinidad and Tobago's one.

New &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; airline &lt;a href="w%3AGo%21%20%28airline%29"&gt;go!&lt;/a&gt; started interisland passenger service on Friday, but not before starting a fare war with Hawaii's two existing interisland carriers that culminated with one of them resorting to a free giveaway of seats on go!'s opening day.

The new airline, a division of Arizona-based &lt;a href="w%3AMesa%20Air%20Group"&gt;Mesa Air Group&lt;/a&gt;, started a fare war in March when it offered an introductory fare of US $39.00 one-way, which was matched by &lt;a href="w%3AHawaiian%20Airlines"&gt;Hawaiian Airlines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAloha%20Airlines"&gt;Aloha Airlines&lt;/a&gt;. Normal interisland fares prior to that point averaged about US$79 one way.

The fare war intensified in the week leading up to go!'s startup, when go! on Wednesday announced a $19.00 one-way fare good during go!'s first month of operation. Hawaiian immediately matched the fare but not by Aloha. Thom Nulty, Aloha's vice president of marketing, initially dismissed the fare cut, saying, "Over the years, we've seen many startups come and go with goofy fares designed to steal passengers away from Hawaii's homegrown airlines."

However, Aloha on Thursday went even goofier than both go! and Hawaiian, announcing a plan, called the "Great Go Away Giveaway," to give away 1,000 vouchers for free tickets at Hawaii airports on Friday morning on a first-come-first-served basis. Eager passengers lined up at &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu%20International%20Airport"&gt;Honolulu International Airport&lt;/a&gt; as early as 7 p.m. Thursday night to snag the free tickets, and the 500 tickets allotted at Honolulu were gone by 9 a.m. Friday.

Mesa Air CEO Jonathan Ornstein quipped on the name of Aloha's promotion, "They'd like us to go away so they don't have to give away seats." He also announced that go's original $39.00 promotional fare will become permanent.

Ornstein later reported that go!'s first day of operation went smoothly. "I think the day went really flawlessly, certainly in consideration it was our first day of operations," Ornstein said.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATahlequah%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Tahlequah, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — A &lt;a href="w%3ACherokee%20Nation"&gt;Cherokee Nation&lt;/a&gt; tribunal has approved the new 1999 constitution that was passed by Cherokee voters in July 2003. Two of the three justices ruled that approval of the constitution by the &lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs"&gt;Bureau of Indian Affairs&lt;/a&gt; was not necessary and that the new constitution is effective immediately.

The constitution includes the creation of a speaker for the legislative council and would be the third in line of succession, behind the Principal Chief and Deputy Chief. The constitution also changes the name of the Judicial Appeals Tribunal to the Supreme Court and increases its size from three to five. Another provision is a two consecutive term limit for elected officials.

Principle Chief &lt;a href="w%3AChad%20%26quot%3BCorntassel%26quot%3B%20Smith"&gt;Chad Smith&lt;/a&gt; said. "This is a historic day for the Cherokee Nation ... our constitution requires that the people review our constitutional laws every 20 years, and modify when necessary. Today, the (Supreme) Court has reaffirmed the obvious, we were a government exercising inherent sovereignty before there was a United States. The greatest exercise of that sovereignty is to pass our own constitution, without interference from outsiders."

Three inmates hung themselves with nooses made from their bedsheets at the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; base in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%2C%20Cuba"&gt;Guantanamo Bay, Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. According to the U.S. Military, the time of death is not yet clear; the men were "found unresponsive and not breathing in their cells by guards." Two of the men are reported to be &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi"&gt;Saudi&lt;/a&gt;, the third being &lt;a href="w%3AYemeni"&gt;Yemeni&lt;/a&gt;. According to Admiral Harry Harris, one of the prisoners was a mid-to-high level &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaida"&gt;Al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt; operative, another belonged to a splinter group, and the other was captured in Afghanistan.

Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, General John Craddock, said the three men had left suicide notes, but Craddock refused to discuss the contents.

Base commander Navy Rear Adm. Harry Harris said the suicides were acts of "&lt;a href="w%3AAsymmetric%20warfare"&gt;asymmetrical warfare&lt;/a&gt;". According to Reuters his expressed opinion was that the suicides were an act of war, "They are smart. They are creative. They are committed. They have no regard for life, neither ours nor their own. I believe this was not an act of desperation, but an act of asymmetrical warfare waged against us," he told reporters. It must be noted however that the concerned officer has not claimed to have the educational qualification to analyse the prisoners in a psychological manner, so his authority to comment on this matter might be questionable.

Ken Roth, &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; in New York, said "These people are despairing because they are being held lawlessly". Mr Roth continued "There's no end in sight. They're not being brought before any independent judges. They're not being charged and convicted for any crime." 

&lt;a href="w%3AMoazzam%20Begg"&gt;Moazzam Begg&lt;/a&gt;, 37, who was released in 2005 after spending two years under detention at Guantanamo told the Associated Press: "We all expected something like this but were not prepared. It's just awful. I hope the Bush administration will finally see this is wrong."

Barbara Olshansky, of the &lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Constitutional%20Rights"&gt;Center for Constitutional Rights&lt;/a&gt; which represents about 300 Guantanamo Bay detainees, said "I think people [detained at Guantanamo] have this incredible level of despair that they will never get justice. Olshansky said the US government "not only failed these people but pushed them on the road to death".

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; recently asked the U.S to close down the detention centre after reports of abuse were made, including the flushing of Quraans down toilets, force-feeding of inmates, sleep deprivation and beatings of underage prisoners.

The game saw the team in orange and the team of the blue and white stripes trading attacks at a furious pace all match. The Argentines dominated the first half while in the second half it was Ivory Coast who had opponents defending.

As the excitement reached a climax, on 82 minutes the pressure of the team two goals down paid when a great attack ended with a Didier Drogba score. He struck a first time shot low past Roberto Abbondanzieri from the middle of the penalty area.
The Argentines had scored first when an in-swinging freekick delivered by Juan Riquelme was knocked-down in front of goal. Hernan Crespo pounced on the loose ball inside the six yard box to score on 25 minutes.

On 37 minutes the Argentine midfield "quarterback" Riquelme made the second goal when he split the Ivory Coast line with another well-executed pass. It had just the right strength that the runner Javier Saviola had only to stab past the oncoming keeper to score. 

Roberto Abbondanzieri had a strong shot-blocking and tackling defence in front of him, supplemented by two defence-minded midfielders. The only real sight on goal the Ivory Coast had in the first half drew out of him a point blank save from the boot of Kadar Keita.

The incredible stamina, enthusiasm and high technical skill shown by the west African team, nicknamed "the Elephants", really tested the Argentina defence. But while pressed back, Jose Pekerman's side commanded the game, having had 60 percent of the ball possession, and looked dangerous on the break.

The quick accurate passing, movement and speed of ball play led to some mistimed challenges; five cautions were awarded by the Belgium referee. This may reflect the hard, competitive spirit in which the game was played.

The evening's entertainment in Hamburg had begun with some controversy when Ivory Coast goalkeeper Jean-Jacques Tizie juggled with the ball on his line. No goal was given and in the end it did not change the result of the game for Argentina.

A new species of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahammerhead%20shark"&gt;hammerhead shark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been found in the northwest &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Ocean"&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href="South%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.

According to scientists, the species, classified as genus Sphyrna, looks much like the scalloped hammerhead, but is "genetically distinct" from the scalloped hammerhead. University of South Carolina Biology Professor Joe Quattro, who discovered the shark, describes it as "cryptic"; it is described as a rare find. This is the ninth such species of the hammerhead shark to be discovered. Scientists have named the species a 'cryptic species' because no formal name has been selected for the shark.

According to Dr. Quattro, "if South Carolina's waters are the primary nursery grounds for the cryptic species and females gather here to reproduce, these areas should be conservation priorities." Scientists say the shark only breeds off the S. Carolina coast and that it is at a risk for extinction. "Management plans are needed to ensure that these sharks are not adversely impacted so that we can learn more," added Dr. Quattro.

So far, there are only 454 other named and classified species of shark in the wild. Two other scientists, Dr. Jim Grady at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20New%20Orleans"&gt;University of New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Dr. Trey Driggers with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service"&gt;National Marine Fisheries Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , are also among the biologists to help with the discovery.

A new video posted on the internet by &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i insurgents shows the beheading of three men, whom the killers allege are members of a death squad. Insurgents say the beheadings are in retaliation for the killing of Sunnis. The Islamic militant group &lt;a href="w%3AAnsar%20al-Sunnah"&gt;Ansar al-Sunnah&lt;/a&gt; has posted the video and claimed responsibility for the killings.

"They are with a death squad group, whose mission is to capture Sunnis in quick operations on the main streets of Baghdad and its surroundings," said the group in a statement posted on its website. The statement also says that judges for the group sentenced the members of the squad to death "so justice is served and also as revenge for our sisters... and brothers who were killed and are killed every day at the hands of those apostates."

The video shows the victims held at gunpoint, they identify themselves as being part of a death squad and are then beheaded.

"Whoever insists on fighting Islam and Muslims and joins the apostasy army, we say to him, 'You will not go any further without us targeting you, God willing. And you will not drive a car without us following you. And you will remain to live in terror until we terminate you so your end becomes in hell, and what a humiliating ending it is," continued the statement.

It is not known when the video was made and the victims have not been identified.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARice%20University"&gt;Rice University&lt;/a&gt; baseball team defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oklahoma"&gt;University of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; 10-4 in the first game of the &lt;a href="w%3ANCAA"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; Super Regional.
Brian Friday and Josh Rodriguez helped push Rice to an early led with consecutive home runs in a four-run first inning.

Wayne Graham, Rice's head coach, said, "Obviously, I'm happy with the way we hit the ball. We attacked the ball real well. When we answered their runs, that was critical. We never got complacent."

Rice (54-10) and Oklahoma (44-21) will meet Sunday for the second game in the series at Rice's &lt;a href="w%3AReckling%20Park"&gt;Reckling Park&lt;/a&gt;. If Oklahoma wins, a third game will be played Monday. If Rice wins, it would send the team to the &lt;a href="w%3ACollege%20World%20Series"&gt;College World Series&lt;/a&gt; for the fifth time, the first since winning the title in 2003.

&lt;a href="w%3ABiarritz%20Olympique"&gt;Biarritz&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AStade%20Toulousain"&gt;Stade Toulousain&lt;/a&gt; to win the &lt;a href="w%3A2005-06%20Top%2014"&gt;2005-06 Top 14&lt;/a&gt; French &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; club championship. Biarritz was able to put the loss of the &lt;a href="w%3A2005-06%20Heineken%20Cup"&gt;Heineken Cup&lt;/a&gt; final to &lt;a href="w%3AMunster%20Rugby"&gt;Munster&lt;/a&gt; behind it and run 40 to 13 winners in France's domestic championship, claiming its second title in a row. The final was played at &lt;a href="w%3AStade%20de%20France"&gt;Stade de France&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASaint-Denis"&gt;Saint-Denis&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. Biarritz made it to the final by defeating &lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Perpignan"&gt;USA Perpignan&lt;/a&gt; the previous weekend, as did Toulouse with &lt;a href="w%3AStade%20Fran%C3%A7ais"&gt;Stade Français&lt;/a&gt;.

Biarritz entered halftime leading Toulouse nine points to six. With the scores close, the game had the potential to go either way in the second half. However, defending champion Biarritz took control. Biarritz wings &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Baptiste%20Gobelet"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Gobelet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASireli%20Bobo"&gt;Sireli Bobo&lt;/a&gt;, centre &lt;a href="w%3ADamien%20Traille"&gt;Damien Traille&lt;/a&gt;, hooker &lt;a href="w%3ABenoit%20August"&gt;Benoit August&lt;/a&gt; and number eight &lt;a href="w%3AImanol%20Harinordoquy"&gt;Imanol Harinordoquy&lt;/a&gt; all scored &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;trys&lt;/a&gt; for Biarritz in the second half. With &lt;a href="w%3ADimitri%20Yachvili"&gt;Dimitri Yachvili&lt;/a&gt; being successful with three conversions, as well as booting another three penalty goals, Biarrirtz stormed to victory. Toulouse was only able to put &lt;a href="w%3AGregory%20Lamboley"&gt;Gregory Lamboley&lt;/a&gt; in for their only second half try, whilst a conversion and penalty goal by &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Baptiste%20Elissalde"&gt;Jean-Baptiste Elissalde&lt;/a&gt; along with a drop-goal by &lt;a href="w%3A%20Frederic%20Michalak"&gt;Frederic Michalak&lt;/a&gt; saw the final score at 40 points to 13. Michalak left the field around the 60th minute, which may rule him out of &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;'s tests against the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africas%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Springboks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARomania%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; later this month.

<h1>Australian opposition promises to scrap workplace agreements</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; leader of the Australian opposition has promised to scrap workplace agreements introduced as part of the &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government's controversial &lt;a href="w%3AWorkchoices"&gt;Workchoices&lt;/a&gt; industrial relations reforms.

Speaking at the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; today, Mr Beazley promised that a government under his leadership would create "a land of decency and fairness". Mr Beazley said such a plan has no place for individual Australian Workplace Agreements (AWA).

"I believe AWAs are nothing more than a means to cut wages, cut conditions, undermine decency and fairness in our workplaces," he said.

"So today delegates I announce that a Beazley Labor government will abolish John Howard's Australian Workplace Agreements."

The opposition leader told his party faithful that AWAs can not be fixed. "I know AWAs can't be fixed, they can't be made good, they must be rejected," said Mr Beazley.

Mr Beazley said a government under his leadership would reward hard work and effort.

"The government I lead will be guided by one core principle - when you put in, you get back," he said.

"That's my pact with middle Australia. When Australian workers put in a good day's work they'll get job security, decent wages, decent conditions, decent protections against unfair dismissal." 

The announcement comes as the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Council%20of%20Trade%20Unions"&gt;Australian Council of Trade Unions&lt;/a&gt; (ACTU) launches its multi-million dollar advertisement campaign against the government's changes. The unions say their ads portray the stories of real Australians who have been affected by the government's industrial relations reforms.

ACTU leader Greg Combet welcomed Mr Beazley's proposal, saying they were beneficial for both the ALP and the nation as a whole.

"It means that there is a clear choice between the Liberal-National government and the Labor Party on these industrial relations issues at the next election," he said.

"More important than policy commitments, what Mr Beazley is clearly articulating are labour movement values: fairness, decency, respect for people, dignity in their workplace, the right to be represented, sharing in the economic wealth.

"These are all extremely important values that he is articulating and I think it is those values that are going to put Labor in good stead."

Mr Combet said that the ALP state conference in NSW showed the amount of support Mr Beazley has within his party, despite recent party in-fighting, leadership speculation and attempts by the government to undermine Mr Beazley's leadership.

Australian &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, John Howard accused Mr Beazley of giving in to union pressure. "It is clear from Mr Beazley’s AWA rollback plan that the Labor Party will do whatever it takes to make the unions happy, even if it is at the expense of Australian workers," he said.

Mr Howard accused Mr Beazley of planning a return to an industrial relations system that left one million Australians without work. Mr Howard also said that Mr Beazley has promised to eliminate AWAs but has failed to put forward a replacement. "Mr Beazley today proposed that Labor would abandon AWAs but did not outline any replacement for the existing arrangements," said Mr Howard.

In a statement, Mr Howard said that Mr Beazley had no plan to ensure the continued growth of the Australian economy and accused Mr Beazley and his party of failing to "take advantage of an increasingly competitive global marketplace". 

Defending his government's legislation that allows AWAs, Mr Howard said that AWAs give negotiating power to workers. "AWAs now play an integral role in the nation’s workplace relations culture, with almost one million Australian workers since 1996 enjoying the benefits of making workplace agreements on their terms, " he said

The Prime Minister also dismissed any claims that AWAs have reduced wages and satisfaction of employees. "AWAs have delivered higher wages, greater productivity and enhanced satisfaction for employees, " he said.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; 34 points to three in the first of two &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; test matches at &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra%20Stadium"&gt;Telstra Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. The game was another meeting of the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2003 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; finalists, which saw &lt;a href="w%3AJonny%20Wilkinson"&gt;Jonny Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt; land a field goal in extra time to win the &lt;a href="w%3ARugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, although the sides have played each other since then, it was the first return to Telstra. In the lead up to the game, England coach &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Robinson"&gt;Andy Robinson&lt;/a&gt; slammed the condition of the pitch of &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra%20Stadium"&gt;Telstra Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. He visited the stadium the day before the test and said he had fears that &lt;a href="w%3Ascrum"&gt;scrums&lt;/a&gt; could be affected by the condition of the pitch. Scrums played a powerful role in the sides last contest at &lt;a href="w%3ATwickenham%20Stadium"&gt;Twickenham&lt;/a&gt; last year when the English almost embarrassed the Wallabies with its impressive scrummaging. Since their last clash, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Connolly%20%28rugby%29"&gt;John Connolly&lt;/a&gt; has been appointed the head coach of Australia, and the game against England will mark his debut. With a new-look team, the Wallabies entered the game having lost eight of its previous nine matches.

England's &lt;a href="w%3AOlly%20Barkley"&gt;Olly Barkley&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the match, and just three minutes in, Australia was awarded a penalty. &lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20Mortlock"&gt;Stirling Mortlock&lt;/a&gt;'s kick is wide of the posts, and the score remains nil-all. England's scrum prospered in the first twenty minutes, and Australia missed a few oppoortunities to score &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt;. In the 18th minute, England was penalised for not releasing the ball in the tackle. Mortlock was successful with the shot at goal, and Australia moved ahead, 3 points to nil. Just after twenty minutes England looked dangerous as &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Catt"&gt;Mike Catt&lt;/a&gt; throws a long pass to speedster &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Varndell"&gt;Tom Varndell&lt;/a&gt; near their own goaline, but a stray pass to &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Voyce"&gt;Tom Voyce&lt;/a&gt; led to little. Three minutes later Australia was awarded another penalty, and England found itself a little further behind on the scoreboard when Mortlock was successful with another penalty kick. Shortly after &lt;a href="w%3AIain%20Balshaw"&gt;Iain Balshaw&lt;/a&gt; goes in for England off a Barkley kick, but being wrapped up by Australian captain &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Gregan"&gt;George Gregan&lt;/a&gt;, the television match official ruled a no try. After an unsuccessful scrum on the Australian scoreline, Barkley misses a penalty kick just left to the posts. English captain &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Sanderson"&gt;Pat Sanderson&lt;/a&gt; makes an optimistic break shortly after though a pass is intercepted. Mortlock misses a penalty goal soon after, but on the stroke of half time he kicks another penalty goal to put Australia nine points in front as the game goes sinto half time.

Barkley got England's first points a few minutes into the second half, being successful with a penalty kick, taking the game to nine to three, with Australia still in front. Though shortly after Barkley is penalised for not releasing the ball, and Mortlock kicks a penalty goal to take Australia's lead to 12 points. Australian fullback &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Latham"&gt;Chris Latham&lt;/a&gt; scores the first try of the match in the 54th minute, with Mortlock's conversion, Australias takes a convincing 19 to 3 lead over the English. Australia furthered its lead to 22 points as Mortlock lands another penalty goal, with under 15 minutes remaining in the game, an English comeback seemed unlikely. Australia sealed the victory when &lt;a href="w%3AClyde%20Rathbone"&gt;Clyde Rathbone&lt;/a&gt; makes a break up field and passes to &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Gerrard"&gt;Mark Gerrard&lt;/a&gt; who regathers his own kick to score a try. Mortlock converts Gerrad's try, and Australia lead 29 points to three with around seven minutes remaining in the game. On debut, &lt;a href="w%3ARodney%20Blake"&gt;Rodney Blake&lt;/a&gt; charges over to score another try for the Wallabies and although Mortlock misses the conversion, Australia won 34 to three.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; justice minister, &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Ellison"&gt;Chris Ellison&lt;/a&gt; has said that the Australian federal &lt;a href="w%3ACabinet_of_Australia"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; did not consider security issues when it decided to setup an inquiry into &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20energy"&gt;nuclear power&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking to the Nine Network, Senator Ellison said when considering energy, security concerns are not an issue. "When you look at sources of energy you don't look at any potential terrorist threat," he said.

The justice minister said that cabinet discussed measures for protecting crucial infrastructure but denies that a nuclear power station is any more of a target than the electricity grid or rail system.

Senator Ellison said that restricting the country's use on nuclear power because of the threat of &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt; was giving in to terrorists. "Energy sources are very important for the future of any community and I think we're not about to be stymied or restricted in that approach because of any threat of terrorism,"

"I mean, we're going to continue living in the way we do. Once we change that, the terrorists win," he said.

Leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; says that the failure to consider security implications associated with nuclear power generation is "daft".

Senator Brown accused the government of failing to consider the possibility of nuclear material becoming available to terrorists. "It's daft to say the least and it's really pig-ignorant of the dangers of nuclear material coming into the hands of terrorists," he said.

Senator Brown said he is concerned that the move encourages &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, a country that he claims to have a terrorist problem to build nuclear reactors. "The Government doesn't understand that their paving the way for nuclear enrichment or reactors in Australia encourages Indonesia, which has plans for up to 12 nuclear reactors and which the Government knows has real problems with terrorism."

The Greens leader said that there is a possibility a nuclear reactor could become a terrorist target. "It does make the threat of terrorists getting nuclear materials or targeting a reactor real, and it must be a consideration for any inquiry," he said.

The opposition has also raised concerns about security risks associated with nuclear energy. Stephen Smith said, "We don't think that the economics are there for nuclear power stations in Australia, let alone the national security risks that go with that and the waste disposal risks that go with that."

&lt;span style="speak: none;display:none;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in his career won the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20British%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;British Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3ASilverstone%20Circuit"&gt;Silverstone Circuit&lt;/a&gt;. 

Alonso was in the lead for the most of the race. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; started third, but finished before &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20Raikkonen"&gt;Kimi Raikkonen&lt;/a&gt;. Alonso teammate &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisicella&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; on the second pit stop and finished on the back of Raikkonen.

Bad luck for &lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Button"&gt;Jenson Button&lt;/a&gt;, ruefull race for English fans.

The attacking midfielder, who plays for English club side Chelsea, dazzled in the Zentralstadion; almost as bright as the sunlight which had split half the field into dark shadow by the end of the match.

The shadows the Serbia and Montenegro team chased in the game were that of the Flying Dutchman. The goal Robben scored, enough to win the game for his side, was tucked away in a one-on-one with Dragoslav Jervic after he had out-sprinted the defence to reach a through ball.
In the second half Marco Van Basten's team seemed to suffer with the heat as opposition got more offensive play; but a goal for Serbia and Montenegro did not look likely.

Serbia and Montenegro gave up 60 percent of the ball possession to the Netherlands, which also restricted the Balkan's team to just four shots on target.

And with its accurate passes, skill and pace the team, known as the "Orange men" for the colour of their kit, still threatened. In the second half Robin Van Persie's free kick was driven low across the goal and missed the far post, as well as Holland's forwards, by centimeters.

The match was decided by a single goal partly because it was tightly contested in midfield; of the six yellow cards issued by German referee Markus Merk, they all went to defenders and midfield players.

Robben's individual display, which included a moment when he evaded two opposition players only for his shot to be blocked, earned him the man of the match award from Fifa's technical study group. He was the bright spark that exposed Serbia and Montenegro's lack of pace in defence. 

Ilija Petkovic's team did not create enough goal-scoring chances and might think to beat Ivory Coast and Argentina, the two other teams in Group C, they need to work on the attack game.
