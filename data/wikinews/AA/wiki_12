In a move aimed at curbing both population growth and preference for male children, the government of &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; has announced free and reduced cost education for girls.

The new program will offer free education at high school level to all girls of single child families. Those with two girls and no other children may receive discounts of up to 50%. As a continuation of India's policy of promoting education, the program includes provisions for fellowships of US$ 45 per month for those undertaking post-graduate studies.
India faces problems with the balance of the sexes in the country; some areas have a ratio of 80 girls to every 100 boys due to selective abortions. Boys are more highly prized in Indian society and as a result, many couples will have additional children after a girl in an effort to produce a boy. In cases where the family already has one or two female children the likelihood of a female foetus being aborted is significantly higher.

Indian law already prohibits tests to determine the sex of an unborn child for this very reason; however, it is routine during medical examinations of the mother for the doctor to disclose the sex of the child.

&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20Air%20Lines"&gt;Delta Air Lines&lt;/a&gt; announced plans to cut 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by the end of 2007, approximately 17% of its employees. 

CEO &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Grinstein"&gt;Gerald Grinstein&lt;/a&gt; will take a 25% pay cut. Executives have their pay cut by 15%. Other employees will have their pay reduced by 7 to 10%. Employees that make less than $25,000 a year will not be affected by these pay cuts.

Delta has already cancelled leases on 40 aircraft and they plan to reduce its fleet by at least 80 more. They plan to reduce domestic capacity by 15 to 20 percent and increase international capacity by 25 percent.

Delta is the third-largest airline in the US. They have lost 10 billion dollars since 2001 and are 14 billion dollars in debt. Delta Air Lines and &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Airlines"&gt;Northwest Airlines&lt;/a&gt; filed for &lt;a href="w%3AChapter%2011"&gt;Chapter 11&lt;/a&gt; bankruptcy protection last Wednesday, joining &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Airways"&gt;US Airways&lt;/a&gt;. Four of the seven largest US carriers are operating under bankruptcy protection. Chapter 11 protection gives companies time to rearrange its finances while continuing to operate.

Delta CEO Gerald Grinstein said they intended "to move from being an unprofitable airline today to a profitable airline in just over two years". "This means we will become a smaller, more cost-efficient airline, with a strengthened network and a stronger balance sheet." These cuts should help save Delta up to $3 billion dollars.

In a new study that may have important applications in &lt;a href="w%3AMedicine"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%20Santa%20Barbara"&gt;University of California Santa Barbara&lt;/a&gt; found that cells have evolved a surprising, but efficient, way to regulate the transport of goods to the &lt;a href="w%3ANucleus"&gt;nucleus&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding &lt;a href="w%3AOrganelle"&gt;organelles&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3ANutrient"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; and signals outside of a cell get to the cell nucleus by way of carriers called &lt;a href="w%3AEndosome"&gt;endosomes&lt;/a&gt;. Endosomes travel through a cell on a highway of structural supports called &lt;a href="w%3AMicrotubule"&gt;microtubules&lt;/a&gt;. 

Researchers studied the motion of endosomes by putting &lt;a href="w%3AFlorescence"&gt;florescent&lt;/a&gt; tags, which glow under certain types of light, on individual endosomes and recording their motion through a &lt;a href="w%3AMicroscope"&gt;microscope&lt;/a&gt;. They found that endosomes do not travel straight to the nucleus. Instead, they randomly travel toward and away from the nucleus with no preferred direction.

This is a little like getting in the car to drive to work, but instead of being caught in heavy traffic along the main road, randomly choosing a back road to follow. If you end up being caught in traffic going that way, you can also turn around and travel in the opposite direction for a while. It would make getting to work a little slow, but it leads to an even distribution of endosomes all along the microtubules.

This finding surprised the Santa Barbara group. Endosomes are most concentrated around the nucleus of a cell, so researchers expected that the endosomes would usually travel toward the nucleus. 

Computer simulations show that the &lt;a href="w%3AStarburst"&gt;starburst-shaped&lt;/a&gt; layout of the microtubule system is responsible for the high concentration of endosomes at the nucleus. “It’s all in the &lt;a href="w%3AGeometry"&gt;geometry&lt;/a&gt; of the cell,” said &lt;a href="w%3ASamir%20Mitragotri"&gt;Samir Mitragotri&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher on the project. 

Endosomes randomly travel toward or away from the nucleus and can change direction. But as in &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; where all roads lead to &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, the endosomes get to their destination because all roads eventually pass the nucleus. This system does not get a particular endosome to its target as quickly as possible, but ensures that nutrient transport is not disrupted if the cell moves or there is increased traffic. 

Some heart, &lt;a href="w%3ANeurology"&gt;neurological&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMusclular%20disease"&gt;muscular&lt;/a&gt; diseases are caused by the break down of &lt;a href="w%3AProtein"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt; that regulate endosome movement. Scientists are not sure what this does to the cell said Samir Mitragotri, a co-author of the study, but research like this could help them discover the “missing link” between disease and transport properties.

The 2005-2006 &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Hockey%20League"&gt;Ontario Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; season kicked off to a start Wednesday night at Wendler arena in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Dow%20Event%20Center"&gt;The Dow Event Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASaginaw%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Saginaw, Michigan, USA&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3ASaginaw%20Spirit"&gt;Saginaw Spirit&lt;/a&gt; hosting the &lt;a href="w%3APlymouth%20Whalers"&gt;Plymouth Whalers&lt;/a&gt;, with over 4,600 people attending. The Whalers won 7 - 2.

A power shot by a player sent the game into a 5-minute delay when a piece of glass on the boards was shattered during the first period. The game opened its first period with 4 goals for the Whalers, with right wing player Dan Collins scoring two. Teammates James Neal and John Vigilante picked up the remainder. The Spirit also received a goal, made by defenseman Patrick McNeill.

The second period started with an early goal by Michal Birner for the Spirit. Plymouth later rebounded with two goals from players Ryan McGinnis and Dan Collins. Later on in the period, Plymouth member Jared Boll was penalized with a ten minute misconduct. He did not return to play for the remainder of the game.

The third period held a goal made by Plymouth's Mike Letizia, rounding out the final score to 7 - 2. Later on in the period, Plymouth's #2 defenseman Brett Bellemore suffered an injury that left him on the ice. He later was able to skate to the bench, where he was examined by the team trainer, Dennis MacDonald.

On the corner of Golden Gate Ave. and Jones St. in the &lt;a href="w%3ATenderloin%2C%20San%20Francisco"&gt;Tenderloin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="San%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, right next to the Civic Center you can see a throng of low-income and homeless people lining up outside of St. Anthony’s Dining Room hall which opens up it’s doors everyday at 11:30 a.m. Volunteers dressed in St. Anthony Foundation shirts help keep the lines moving as hundreds of homeless and low income people shuffle their way towards the dining hall underneath the watchful eyes of a small statue of St. Francis of Assisi.

"There’s a lot of people who go hungry out here and it ain't right." says Jimmy Scott, a slightly brawny 44-year-old black man who has been living homeless in San Francisco for the past three years. "There are families out here with kids and everything and they have to walk around all night just to stay awake so they don’t get hurt or killed...Right here in the U.S. this is going on...it ain't right."

The dining hall, which has been open for the past 54 years, is owned by the St. Anthony Foundation which helps low income and homeless people and families in the Civic Center, Tenderloin, and SOMA areas with clothing, shelter, food, drug rehabilitation, and many other services. St. Anthony’s administrative offices are found at 121 Golden Gate Ave. with the majority of the foundation’s buildings on Golden Gate Ave. and Jones St.

"We are right in the heart of the homeless population of San Francisco," says Barry Stenger, 55, who's been working for the St. Anthony Foundation for one year, and is the Director of Development and Communications, "and people are pushed here because of the economic forces of San Francisco because it's hard to be upper middle class in San Francisco."

According to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, "San Francisco’s cost of living remains one of the highest in the country" with the average household income in San Francisco being around $76,400 and the average price of housing being $543,000. Average household income for the United States in 2002, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, was $42,409 and the average price of housing for the United States according to the National Association of Realtors was $185,200 in 2004.

"We served our 32 millionth meal on Tuesday," said Stenger, “and we serve 2,500 meals a day. Some of our people who work here actually get served [food] here because they spend all their money towards rent and medical costs."

The St. Anthony Foundation was started by Fr. Alfred Boeddeker in 1950 one year after Fr. Boeddeker became pastor of St. Boniface church on Golden Gate St. where he was baptized as a child. During his lifetime, according to the foundation’s website, he was referred to as the "Patron St. of the Tenderloin" and had Boeddeker park named after him because of his, and his foundation's, achievements with helping out the homeless and low income community.

"[St. Anthony’s] is a good thing," said Jimmy Scott, "they provide a good service and they feed people and they clothe them and provide furniture when you get housing and give you groceries when you have AIDS. It's a good little organization."

"Our dining room is open 365 days a year." Said Stenger. "Our other facilities are open seven days a week. We have a residence for senior women and our [free medical] clinic is open five days a week and we also have a furniture and clothing store. We have 12 programs all together."

Some of those programs are the Father Alfred Center which provides 61 men two programs for getting out of drug and alcohol abuse, the Employment Program/Learning Center which helps participants in educational and employment opportunities and provides each one with a personal staff advisor, and a Senior Outreach and Support Services center which states its mission is to "promote independence, self determination, and alleviate isolation" for seniors who are 60 and older.

A few homeless people who were interviewed complained that St. Anthony’s had some staff who were rude and that they were kicked out of the dining hall; other homeless within the area refuted those claims saying St. Anthony's has nice staff and only kicks people out who cause trouble.

"It’s a good place and good people. Everybody is so kind and so respectful and everything is under control." Said John Henderson, a tall and skinny 57-year-old homeless black man who has only been living in San Francisco for close to two months because he recently moved there from &lt;a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. "It’s pretty cool because they’re under control because yesterday I saw at Glide [Memorial Church which also has services for the poor and low income] and they were handing out food boxes and people were just rushing in and the woman in charge there was freaking out and so she just sat down. That would never happen at St. Anthony's."

"And they clean too!" Henderson said laughing with a grin on his face referring to the fact that there are no drugs allowed in the premises. "Not that Glide ain’t clean if you know what I mean."

"We [also] have a whole division that deals with justice education and advocacy to change the system that brings people to our doorstep." Said Stenger. "We hear a lot of appreciation from the people we serve. We get a lot of testimony from our clients who have become clean and sober. Sometimes we have to push them a little to get them out the door because they love the [foundation] so much because it has changed their lives."

&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Rita"&gt;Hurricane Rita&lt;/a&gt; weakened to become a &lt;a href="w%3Acategory%203"&gt;category 3&lt;/a&gt; storm on Friday with sustained winds of 125 mph. The &lt;a href="http%3A//poly9.viavirtualearth.com/poly9/msnbc-rita/"&gt;forecast path&lt;/a&gt; is centered near the Texas-Louisiana border.

The core of the &lt;a href="w%3Ahurricane"&gt;hurricane&lt;/a&gt; is expected to approach the &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; coasts late on Friday.

Rita is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 8-12 inches, with the storm slowing down and producing a total of as much as 25 inches across eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Bursts of tropical storm winds and rainfall amounts of 3-5 inches are possible in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;.

The U.S. Corps of Engineers estimated that 6 inches of rainfall could breach the previously damaged levees. New Orleans' Ninth Ward, which saw as much as 20 feet of water during &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, is currently in waist high water as a nearby levee was overtopped. Water is spilling over the levee in a section 100 feet wide.

Near the center of the storm, coastal storm surge flooding of 15 feet above normal tide levels is expected, reaching 20 feet in bays and rivers.

News of 3 levee breaches in New Orleans are being broadcast in televised reports. Tides are about 2 feet above normal along the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama coasts, and tides will increase to 4-6 feet above normal, with large waves and swells.

&lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;n Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Su-hon has asked the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Program"&gt;World Food Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (WFP) to stop providing food aid in the country.

Claiming a good harvest provided the country with sufficient food, and that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was politicizing the aid issue, the formal request to end all humanitarian aid was made to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Secretary%20General"&gt;UN Secretary General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; at a meeting on September 21.

The WFP has been feeding approximately six million of the poorest and most needy in the reclusive communist state. There is much concern its withdrawal will leave many without adequate aid.
Neighbouring countries, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , will continue to supply food aid to the North Koreans; however, the donors do not manage this aid and international organisations are unable to determine that it is reaching those who need it.

The request for the WFP's withdrawal is suspected by some to be related to the ongoing talks about the nuclear program of North Korea; continued acceptance of aid is seen as a weakness that may influence their negotiating position.

Before &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Rita"&gt;Hurricane Rita&lt;/a&gt; arrived, cars idling for hours in traffic jams near Houston began running out of gas, stranding evacuees in their cars. 

The New York Times reported Friday morning that "Colossal 100-mile-long traffic jams left many people stranded and out of gas as the huge storm bore down on the Texas coast on Thursday. ... Acknowledging that "being on the highway is a deathtrap," Mayor Bill White asked for military help in rushing scarce fuel to stranded drivers."

The obvious express routes slowed to a crawl. Some drivers reported easy travel on rural roads, while others encountered heavy traffic on two-lane highways.
Constantly during the evacuation on two-lane highways, people would take over the other lanes, causing some head-on collisions. Even when the &lt;a href="w%3Aline%20jumping"&gt;line jumper&lt;/a&gt;s didn't get in a wreck, they still slowed the flow of traffic because they had to merge back into the right lane at some point. The general attitude towards these cheaters was very hostile. Curses and hand signals were exchanged. To stop the cheaters, cars would swerve in front of those who tried to pass or not let them merge back in line, often causing an accident, or at least causing a backup in the lane of oncoming traffic. Sometimes blockers would occupy the shoulder as well as the lane to stop them cutting back into the line.
Small towns such as &lt;a href="w%3AMagnolia%2C%20Texas"&gt;Magnolia&lt;/a&gt; were overwhelmed by the evacuees passing through. The majority of gas stations were closed and out of gas, and only a few restaurants were open.

A bomb exploded in the &lt;a href="Belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;ian city of &lt;a href="w%3AVitebsk"&gt;Vitebsk&lt;/a&gt;, injuring about forty-six people. The Thursday evening blast originated from a cafe in the city, which had an open-air structure and also had a dance floor, attracting many people. The bomb itself was planted in a flower bed next to the cafe.

The Ministry of Emergency Situations has said that four of the forty-six people have been critically injured, and twenty-one more have been hospitalized. Local police have not found a suspect in the incident.

The Belarussian President &lt;a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko"&gt;Alexander Lukashenko&lt;/a&gt; said, "I understand that it is very hard to stay intact in the midst of this boiling pot of terrorism. Why do we think that terrorism is far away from us and cannot occur here? The society should be on the alert." Lukashenko called on citizens to aid law enforcement agencies during an address to the 39th congress of the Belarussian Youth Union.

No suspect has been found in an earlier bombing incident that occurred in Vitebsk less than two weeks ago. An explosive beer can or metal box, laced with nails, was placed near a bus station. The detonation of the bomb also came from a flower bed and injured two people in the blast.

Scott Stevens, the Idaho meteorologist who claimed that a weather manipulating conspiracy (possibly under the control of Japanese Yakuza mafia) caused Hurricane Katrina, has quit his job at KPVI-TV in Pocatello. 

Stevens reportedly quit to pursue his weather conspiracy theories full time. According to KPVI's general manager Bill Fouch, Stevens left his job voluntarily.

Wikinews &lt;a href="Idaho%20meterologist%20promotes%20Hurricane%20Katrina%20conspiracy%20theory"&gt;reported on&lt;/a&gt; Stevens' theories on Monday September 19, 2005.

An amateur pornographic website, NowThatsFuckedup.com, is giving free access to its content to American soldiers currently who post pictures of corpses from &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. Soldiers can also send in pictures of themselves, their buddies, or their living quarters. The post on the website states "the kinda pictures you would be sending home to your family and friends". Chris Wilson of &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, the website administrator, says he started offering free memberships to soldiers in exchange for photographs from overseas after finding that many soldiers wanted to join the site, but could not due to issues with recognizing foreign addresses associated with credit cards held by overseas enlisted men.

"They wanted to join the site, the amateur wife and girlfriend site," Wilson said. "But they couldn't, because the addresses associated with their credit cards were Quackistan or something, they were in such a high-risk country, that the credit card companies wouldn't approve the purchase." 

The soldiers caption the images themselves, such as one image of a woman's whose leg had been amputated, with the caption "Nice puss -– bad foot." in reference to her vagina also visible in the photo.

Response to the trading has been met with a certain level of ambivalence from military higher-ups; "There are policies in place that, on the one hand, safeguard sensitive and classified information, and on the other hand protects the First Amendment rights of servicemembers," said Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Chris Conway. "In plain English, if you're on the job working for the Department of Defense, you shouldn't be freelancing. You should be doing your duty." However, Army Chief of Staff Peter Shoomaker warned that soldiers compromise "operational security" when they post photographs from Iraq on the internet in a memorandum issued in August.

Rain and the storm surge from &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Rita"&gt;Hurricane Rita&lt;/a&gt; have overwhelmed one of the fragile levees in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;. The Industrial Canal levee gave way, reflooding parts of the Ninth Ward. There are three significant breaches.

"Our worst fears came true," said Maj. Barry Guidry of the Georgia National Guard.

"We have three significant breaches in the levee and the water is rising rapidly," he said. "At daybreak I found substantial breaks and they've grown larger."

The U.S. Corps of Engineers estimated that 6 inches of rainfall could breach the previously damaged levees. The Ninth Ward, which saw flooding as high as 20 feet during &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, is currently in waist-high water as the nearby levee was overtopped. Water is spilling over the levee in a section 100 feet wide.

The Gentilly neighborhood has water accumulations of 6 to 8 inches deep as the patched London Avenue Canal has sprung leaks near its base.

The mascot for &lt;a href="w%3AAsk%20Jeeves"&gt;Ask Jeeves&lt;/a&gt; is to disappear over "user confusion" on what the butler actually does. The butler has been known to be a global symbol for the search site. As of there is no confirmed date of when the butler will be removed from the web site. There is also no decision yet on changing the name of the web site since there will be no "Jeeves" anymore.

It was revealed by owner &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Diller"&gt;Barry Diller&lt;/a&gt; that the butler will no longer be the icon for the site.

Technology weblog &lt;a href="w%3Aengadget"&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt; has published exclusive photos of the yet to be released Palm Treo 700w. The Palm Treo 700w is the first Palm handheld to run &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Mobile"&gt;Windows Mobile&lt;/a&gt;

No official announcement has yet been made. Palm may choose to make the official announcement at the upcoming CTIA Wireless IT and Entertainment trade show. The CTIA Wireless IT and Entertainment trade show is one of the phone industry's largest trade shows.

Palm Chief Financial Officer Andrew Brown said in a interview with CNet last month, that a Windows Mobile based smartphone may help convert corporate customers. "CIOs don't get fired for using Microsoft products."

According to engadget, the Treo 700w has a 1-megapixel camera, &lt;a href="w%3ABluetooth"&gt;Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt;, 64 MB of memory and a 240x240 display.

&lt;a href="w%3APalm%20OS"&gt;Palm OS&lt;/a&gt; is no longer created by Palm but by a spinoff PalmSource. &lt;a href="w%3APalmSource"&gt;PalmSource&lt;/a&gt; was recently acquired by Japanese software company Access for $324 million. Palm is the only major handheld manufacturer to use PalmOS. Many expect Palm to release a PalmOS version in addition to the Windows Mobile version, somewhat implied by the model number Treo 700♡❤♡w♡❤♡. A PalmOS version of the phone would most likely be named Treo 700♡❤♡p♡❤♡.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Controversy%20over%20effects%20of%20new%20bankruptcy%20law%20on%20victims%20of%20Katrina&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Hurricane Katrina has rekindled debate over the controversial &lt;a href="w%3ABankruptcy%20Abuse%20Prevention%20and%20Consumer%20Protection%20Act%20of%202005"&gt;Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House of Represenatives&lt;/a&gt;. Congressional &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; feel that among the hundreds of thousands of victims of Katrina, many of whom have lost all their possessions and are coping with relocation, those that declare bankruptcy should be granted the protections of the previous law. 32 Democrats have sponsored a proposal that would delay implementing certain parts of the law to "insure that we do not compound a natural disaster with a man made financial disaster."

The new bankruptcy law affects anyone whose income (as of the six months before filing) was over the state median income. Democratic legislators point out that many hurricane victims who manage to find work will be suffering from wage reductions, making them unable to effectively deal with their previous debts. Among U.S. states, &lt;a href="w%3ALouisiana"&gt;Louisana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMississippi"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt; have the fourth and third &lt;a href="http%3A//www.census.gov/hhes/income/income02/statemhi.html"&gt;lowest median incomes&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Democrats also feel that it is unfair to require repayment by bankrupted Hurricane Katrina victims while citizens in other states with similar incomes would pay nothing. 

&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Sensenbrenner"&gt;F. James Sensenbrenner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; and chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary"&gt;House Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt;, has denied a hearing on creating an exception in the law for the purposes of Katrina relief. He noted that "If someone in Katrina is down and out, and has no possibility of being able to repay 40 percent or more of their debts, then the new bankruptcy law doesn't apply."

The &lt;a href="w%3ABankruptcy%20Abuse%20Prevention%20and%20Consumer%20Protection%20Act%20of%202005"&gt;Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005&lt;/a&gt; has been heavily criticized by consumer rights' organizations. The &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Federation%20of%20America"&gt;Consumer Federation of America&lt;/a&gt; argues that "[the] new requirements, coupled with strict deadlines for production upon the penalty of an automatic dismissal are difficult for the most organized person to meet, never mind someone who has had his or her home destroyed by Katrina."

Opponents of the bill also argued that it makes the government "a bill collector for private companies", and could lead to criminal prosecutions over matters best left in civil courts, and theoretically even to life imprisonment under federal three-strikes laws. Such opponents view the bulk of the act either as "bought and paid for" by the Credit Card Industry, who spent millions lobbying in support of the bill, or else as an unfortunate compromise between the lobbyists for banks and bankruptcy lawyers, such as the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Bankruptcy%20Institute"&gt;American Bankruptcy Institute&lt;/a&gt; (ABI). Nathalie Martin, of ABI, said that "Many people will still qualify to file for Chapter 7," which means liquidation of assets in exchange for cancellation of debt.

Three buildings in Galveston, Texas, have gone up in flames as Hurricane Rita approaches. Winds in Galveston are currently around 60 to 70 mph as firefighters try to control the blaze from a distance. Most of Galveston has already been evacuated in anticipation of the hurricane. The cause of the fire is unknown.

&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; yesterday released a report containing new and detailed allegations, by three serving US army officers, of widespread &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; and abuse of Iraqi detainees by American forces, at Forward Operating Base Mercury, near &lt;a href="w%3AFallujah"&gt;Fallujah&lt;/a&gt;. 

Prisoners are alleged to have been severely beaten, forced into painful "stress positions", deprived of sleep, denied food and water, subjected to extremes of hot and cold, and to have had chemical substances applied to their skin and eyes. 

Some of the abuses were specifically ordered by &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20Intelligence%23United%20States"&gt;Military Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; personnel, prior to prisoner &lt;a href="w%3Ainterrogation"&gt;interrogation&lt;/a&gt;s, say the officers. In other cases, soldiers tortured prisoners (known as Persons Under Control&amp;mdash;PUCs) on their own initiative, in order to "relieve stress". 

"Everyone in camp knew if you wanted to work out your frustration you show up at the PUC tent. In a way it was sport", one sergeant told Human Rights Watch. 

Human Rights Watch suggests that the widespread abuses result from "civilian and military failures of leadership and confusion about interrogation standards and the application of the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;". 

"The administration demanded that soldiers extract information from detainees without telling them what was allowed and what was forbidden," the group's Washington Director, Tom Malinowski, is quoted as saying. "Yet when abuses inevitably followed, the leadership blamed the soldiers in the field instead of taking responsibility."

The US government has claimed in previous cases that such abuses are exceptional, and not the fault of civilian or military leaders.
An unnamed captain told Human Rights Watch that he had tried repeatedly, over a period of 17 months, to raise concerns about the abuses with his superior officers, only to be told to ignore them and "consider his career". The concerns were only taken seriously after he approached members of Congress, he says. The Los Angeles Times today named the officer as Captain Ian Fishback. 

The US army yesterday announced that it had launched an investigation into the captain's allegations. Army Spokesman Paul Boyce told the Associated Press that army officials opened the inquiry as soon as the concerns were brought to their attention. "These are allegations of potential felony crimes," Boyce told the Los Angeles Times. "We want to speak to anyone else who might be able to corroborate this information. These things should be looked into thoroughly."

According to the Los Angeles Times, the investigation was opened following a referral from the Senate Armed Services Committee. Captain Fishback is the first officer to make such allegations publicly since the &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse"&gt;Abu Ghraib prison scandal&lt;/a&gt; came to light last year, says the newspaper, quoting an unnamed Capitol Hill aide as saying that the allegations are "very credible".

After 72 long years, long suffering fans of the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Swans"&gt;Sydney Swans&lt;/a&gt; football club will be toasting their club's success as they defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Coast%20Eagles"&gt;West Coast Eagles&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; today in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Football%20League"&gt;AFL&lt;/a&gt; Grand Final by a score of 8.10 (58) to 7.12 (54), a victory of four points. This gives the Swans, formerly based in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Melbourne"&gt;South Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; before moving to &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; in 1982, their first premiership since 1933.

Sydney captain &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Hall"&gt;Barry Hall&lt;/a&gt; and West Coast goalsneak &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Hunter"&gt;Adam Hunter&lt;/a&gt; both kicked two goals in a low-scoring affair. West Coast kicked the first goal, and then proceeded to kick another after Sydney replied. The Swans went on to kick five unanswered goals ♡❤(6 points)♡❤ to take a 20-point lead into halftime, while the Eagles could manage a handful of behinds ♡❤(1 point)♡❤. 

The Eagles came alive in the third quarter, and at three-quarter time reduced the deficit to two points thanks to picked-up performances from West Coast stars like &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Wirrapunda"&gt;David Wirrapunda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABrownlow%20Medal"&gt;Brownlow Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Cousins"&gt;Ben Cousins&lt;/a&gt;. However, attempts at goal were wasted as West Coast failed to capitalize throughout the game at many scoring opportunities. 

West Coast gained the lead 15 minutes in the final quarter thanks largely in part to a misjudged short kick by &lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20Ablett"&gt;Luke Ablett&lt;/a&gt; which was caught by Cousins right in the front of the goal. This would bring the Eagle lead up to 10, before &lt;a href="w%3AAmon%20Buchanan"&gt;Amon Buchanan's&lt;/a&gt; goal erased the deficit. The Eagles mounted a spirited charge in the dying minutes, but a timely saving mark by &lt;a href="w%3ALeo%20Barry"&gt;Leo Barry&lt;/a&gt; seconds before the final siren was the final nail in West Coast's coffin. &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Judd"&gt;Chris Judd&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3ANorm%20Smith%20Medal"&gt;Norm Smith Medal&lt;/a&gt; for being voted the best-on-ground, becoming the fourth person to win this honour while representing the losing side. 

The grand final was Sydney and West Coast's fourth meeting of the season, with both teams splitting the home-and-away series. The Eagles had defeated the Swans by the same Grand Final-winning margin in the Qualifying final at &lt;a href="w%3ASubiaco%20Oval"&gt;Subiaco Oval&lt;/a&gt; three weeks ago, and it is a vindication for the Swans, who lost that match on a number of questionable umpiring decisions which the AFL's chief umpire Jeff Gieschen later admitted were incorrect.

The Swans had also come under great criticism earlier in the year from footy commentators and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Football%20League"&gt;AFL&lt;/a&gt; Commissioner &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Demetriou"&gt;Andrew Demetriou&lt;/a&gt; for their now premiership-winning tactics, which was criticized as "boring" and, in the words of Demetriou, would lead the Swans to "lose more games than they would win" this season, but the Swans achievement forced Demetriou to backtrack his words days before the Grand Final.

91,898 footy fans of all stripes and locales packed the &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Cricket%20Ground"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt; for the game, which was opened with entertainment from the likes of &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20Goodrem"&gt;Delta Goodrem&lt;/a&gt; (singing ♡❤I Am Australian♡❤), the finalists of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Idol"&gt;Australian Idol&lt;/a&gt; (performing ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWaltzing%20Matilda"&gt;Waltzing Matilda&lt;/a&gt;♡❤), &lt;a href="w%3ADame%20Edna%20Everage"&gt;Dame Edna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Buble"&gt;Michael Buble&lt;/a&gt;.

John Steven's (Sydney Swans fan) later remarked "This was one of the most exciting, gripping and enthralling matches I have ever witnessed." 

This game will certainly leave a mark in the record books.

Young people (mainly children) are being encouraged to take the role of "Internet trainer" in order to help teach Internet literacy skills to older people. On Grandparents Day is celebrated in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABT%20Group%20plc"&gt;BT Group plc&lt;/a&gt; is marking this Grandparents Day by trying to persuade children to teach their grandparents how to use "the Net". This effort is being made to help prevent grandparents from becoming "digitally excluded".

A web site, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.internetrangers.co.uk/"&gt;Internet Rangers&lt;/a&gt;, by BT, was recently launched with tools, activities and advice to assist children with helping their grandparents make use of one of the world's largest information resource, the Internet. The site links to BT's "Green X Code" of conduct which encourages kids to stay safe while accessing the Internet.

BT is working with governments and other commercial organisations to help provide Internet access to people who are currently unable to get access. Recent research shows that teenagers aged between 13 and 16 have been encouraging their parents and grandparents to "surf the Net".

By the year 2025, around 23 million adults could miss out on what the Internet has to offer, according to BT.

&lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; Defense Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AThammarak%20Isarangkura%20na%20Ayudhya"&gt;Thammarak Isarangkura na Ayudhya&lt;/a&gt;, announced the arrest of three persons suspected of involvement in the deaths of two marines in Thailand's troubled southern region.

The two marines were detained and subsequently stabbed and beaten to death by villagers in Narathiwat province. This was seen as retaliation for an attack on a tea shop where people in Tanyong Limo village believed the soldiers had been involved.

The plain-clothed marine officers, Sub-Lieutenant Vinai Nakhabut and Petty Officer Khamthon Thongeiat, were detained by youths who suspected them of being involved in a recent shooting. They were tied up and held at a local school; their brutal deaths did not occur until after villages had demanded &lt;a href="w%3AMalasia"&gt;Malasian&lt;/a&gt; media cover the event. A subsequent rumour that troops would attack to release the hostages led to the killing.

A search in &lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; for "&lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Inquiry"&gt;Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;" will return many examples of Public &lt;a href="w%3AInquiries"&gt;Inquiries&lt;/a&gt; conducted by governmental organizations into issues that are often deeply controversial.

The processes and terms of reference of such 'Public' Inquiries are normally determined by the commissioning governmental body. However the Internet has now made possible the emergence of a new type of Public Inquiry, called an "&lt;a href="w%3AE-Inquiry"&gt;E-Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;" that appears to be not only independent of government but also, like a &lt;a href="w%3AWiki"&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;, enables anyone who wishes to partake in the Inquiry to do so by contributing evidence and by posing questions that contribute to the process of determining the Terms of reference of the E-Inquiry.

The absence of a US government sponsored independent public inquiry into the Katrina hurricane disaster could well be the spur that led to the development of a new non-profit web site that incorporates a framework for conducting a Public E-Inquiry. That site http://www.ForumKatrina.org carries the banner line "Katrina Support, Recovery, Planning &amp; E-Inquiry".

The web site owners have given permission to quote the following extract from its statement on the web site about the objective of its E-Inquiry:

"Everyone who may think of getting involved in the E-Inquiry is asked to remember, at every stage in the process, that the end purpose of the E-Inquiry is to provide recommendations, for the future. The objective of those recommendations is to help everyone to avoid death, disease and destruction in consequence of forthcoming natural and man-made disasters. If those recommendations are to be taken seriously, and this, the first E-Inquiry, is to acquire any public credibility, then the process must be democratic, patently fair and intellectually rigorous."

It will be interesting to see whether an E-Inquiry is capable of meeting these ideals and whether they become a common feature of internet activity.

Across the globe demonstrations took place against the US-led war and occupation of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20DC"&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; saw the largest demonstration with hundreds of thousands of people marching. Organisers put the figure as high as 250,000 though police put the number at 150,000. Many speakers linked the massive deployment of US troops in Iraq and the inability of the federal government to respond adequately to the needs of people displaced by &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, and others linked the Iraq war to the occupation of &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; and the oil crisis. The mobilisations were united around the slogan "Bring the Troops Home Now!" &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; also had demonstrations.

The demonstration in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; set off from &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20square"&gt;Parliament square&lt;/a&gt; and went to &lt;a href="w%3AHyde%20Park%2C%20London"&gt;Hyde park&lt;/a&gt;. Organisers' figures for attendance (100,000) differ greatly from the police's estimate of only 10,000. &lt;a href="w%3AStop%20the%20War%20Coalition"&gt;Stop the War Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, the (CND) and the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Association%20of%20Britain"&gt;Muslim Association of Britain&lt;/a&gt; (MAB) jointly organised the demonstration. The organisers planned the demonstration to coincide with the Washington demonstration and also in hope of influencing the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; Conference.

Notable in the U.S. mobilisations was the increasingly visible presence of military families speaking out against the war. Antiwar activist &lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt; spoke in D.C. and drew the largest crowd of spectators.

Antiwar mobilisations, as well as actions against the World Bank and IMF, will continue in D.C. tomorrow and into next week.

Recently, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; had released ♡❤♡♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Desktop"&gt;Google Desktop 2 (beta)&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡♡❤, software that aims to provide information on a side-bar that sticks to the right end of your screen. Content on Google Desktop include e-mail searching, news and weather, subscribing to &lt;a href="w%3ARSS"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;-syndicated websites, and more features.

One particular feature of Google Desktop is how it sends anonymous information of your computer use to Google (at option) in order to help choose RSS feeds and the like for you. This is much akin to how &lt;a href="w%3Aspyware"&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt; works, however, said features can be disabled rather simply. Along the same lines are the ability to automatically find &lt;a href="Weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt; and Stocks you would like at the first time you open it. This is a &lt;a href="w%3ABeta"&gt;Beta&lt;/a&gt; so there are a few kinks in this system that can be expected to be sorted out at the full release.

Google Desktop replaces the "&lt;a href="w%3AGmail%20Notifier"&gt;Gmail Notifier&lt;/a&gt;", so you can check your gmail emails directly from the Sidebar. In addition to the &lt;a href="w%3Agmail"&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt; mail checker, if you have &lt;a href="w%3AOutlook"&gt;Outlook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOutlook%20Express"&gt;Outlook Express&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AThunderbird"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aemail"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; clients on your computer then it will check the email accounts in them. All this is automatic, so you get all these emails. Emails can be hidden by using filters.

The program is a 1.3MB download and requires Windows 2000 or Windows XP. It automatically starts up when you load your computer.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt; Board of Trustees has decided to change the licensing of Wikinews from either &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20domain"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt; or other licenses which some language versions had chosen based on their community decision to the &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; Attribution 2.5, following a poll of Wikinewsies and the Wikimedia community. This license received 31 votes, beating other options such as the &lt;a href="w%3AGNU%20FDL"&gt;GNU FDL&lt;/a&gt;, Creative Commons Sharealike, &lt;a href="w%3ABSD%20License"&gt;BSD license&lt;/a&gt;, custom-made Wikinews licenses, and other combinations.

Before switching, most of Wikinews were in public domain, however, three language versions including Polish one were released under GNU FDL, and one version, Japanese one, was released under Creative Commons Attribution 2.1 Japan, since there is no 2.5 version aiming to Japanese jurisdiction in Creative Commons licenses. 
The poll, which ended September 20, 2005, was set up in response to criticisms of releasing Wikinews into the public domain. Perceived disadvantages of releasing content into public domain were particularly focused around the fact that a public domain does not exist in some countries and that it could lead to plagiarism of Wikinews stories. Also differences of chosen licensing between each Wikinews editions was worried.

Mobile phone provider &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AO2%20plc"&gt;O2&lt;/a&gt; (O) in partnership with and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArqiva"&gt;Arqiva&lt;/a&gt; began a trial of a new service that allows customers to watch broadcast TV on their mobile phone. The trial began on Thursday in Oxford. Four hundred O2 customers have been selected to participate. According to O2 the trial represents a balanced selection of the population. 

Participants have been supplied with Nokia 7710 smartphones, that can receive 16 channels. The trial service currently carries BBC ONE, BBC TWO, BBC News 24, ITV 1, ITV 2, Channel 4 and 5, Eurosport, Cartoon Network, CNN, Discovery Channel, MTV, ShortsTV, Sky News, Sky Sports News and Sky Travel.

TV shows are transmitted using a technology called Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds (DVB-H). It requires a special receiver to be connected to the mobile phone. Nokia has said they plan to build support for the DVB-H technology into future Nokia phones. Using DVB-H the phones will get about eight hours per charge, this is because the DVB-H uses the "time slicing" technology.

Many other UK providers have offered mobile TV on cellphones, however this is the first to offer regular full length TV shows. Most other providers use the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3A3G"&gt;3G&lt;/a&gt; video-streaming technology. "3G is perfect for two-minute video clips. But, if you're watching a 90-minute football game, we think &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADVB-H"&gt;DVB-H&lt;/a&gt; is the most suitable," said Dave Williams, O2's chief technical officer

Customers can use an onscreen programme to select programmes they wish to watch and it will alert them when the show starts.

In South Korea many mobile phone companies already offer television on mobile phones using a system called digital mobile broadcast. In the US a recent survey by InStat, found few Americans are interested in mobile TV. Canadian company Telus also recently began to offer mobile TV services.

"By establishing relationships through activities such as this, we hope that potential challenges will be minimized and mobile TV becomes a commercial reality sooner than is currently possible," said Dave Williams, O2's chief technical officer

The &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href="soccer"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; referee &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEd%C3%ADlson%20Pereira%20de%20Carvalho"&gt;Edílson Pereira de Carvalho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was detained by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Brazilian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Saturday in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJacare%C3%AD"&gt;Jacareí&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a city 78 kilometers from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A3o%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . According to the Public Prosecution Service, he refereed games in a partial manner so that only predetermined teams could win.

The businessman Nagib Fayad was also detained in São Paulo. Both are suspected of being part of a group suspected of manipulating games in order to profit through million dollar bets on sport bettings websites.

Brazilian prosecutor Roberto Porto said that investigators have 20 thousand hours of taped phone conversations back to October 2004 and that they have no doubt that Carvalho was fraudulently refereeing football games.

According to the spokeman of the Federal Police, Victor Hugo Rodrigues Alves, a referee would be contacted by phone by Fayad who would inform the referee which team should win the game. Fayad would then place the bets on Internet websites. Part of the profit would be given to the referee. Rodrigues claimed that additional people were involved.

On Saturday the referee told Federal Police that he favored various football teams while he administered games during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACopa%20Libertadores%20de%20Am%C3%A9rica"&gt;Liberators of the Americas Cup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACampeonato%20Paulista"&gt;Paulista Championship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACampeonato%20Brasileiro"&gt;Brazilian championship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; is voting today on their quarterly federal &lt;a href="w%3AReferendum"&gt;referenda&lt;/a&gt;, this referendum is over on whether the rights on the freedom of circulation of people such be extended from the former fifteen member states to the current twenty-five members of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. 

Supporters say that if people vote no, the rest of the bilateral accords could become invalid by the European Union, such as freedom of movement and freedom of trade. They say that the recent vote on &lt;a href="w%3ASchengen%20treaty"&gt;Schengen&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ADublin%20Convention"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; will also become invalided.

Opponents said it might cause wage-dumping, potentially leading to lower wages, and make the unemployment rate higher, which at the moment is at 3.6% (which is high by Swiss standards). 
Out of the big 4 main parties, the centre-left &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, the liberal-right &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Free Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and the centre-right &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20People%27s%20Party%20of%20Switzerland"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; have said yes to the proposals. However, the populist-right &lt;a href="w%3ASwiss%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Swiss People's Party&lt;/a&gt; have said no to the proposal. Many businesses are for a yes vote. 

Results are now available: "&lt;a href="Switzerland%20citizens%20vote%20Yes%20to%20freedom%20of%20circulation%20to%20new%20EU%20states"&gt;Switzerland citizens vote Yes to freedom of circulation to new EU states&lt;/a&gt;" — &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="Main_Page"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, September 25, 2005

Hozumi Hasegawa (長谷川穂積), record 18 Wins - 2 Losses, fought Gerardo Martinez, 27 Wins - 5 Losses - 2 Draws, for the WBC Bantamweight Title Sunday night in Yokohama, Japan. Hasegawa won by TKO in the 7th round, retaining his title.

Hasegawa, 26, from Kobe, was defending the title he gained against Thai fighter Veeraphol Sahaprom at the &lt;a href="Nippon%20Budokan"&gt;Nippon Budokan&lt;/a&gt; in April of this year. Originally he was scheduled to fight Diego Morales, who dropped out due to injury and was replaced by Martinez, 30, from Mexico City. 

Hasegawa appeared to control the fight from early on, fighting at a measured pace and landing several punches in the early rounds. Martinez visually tired by the fifth round, though he came back with some strength in the sixth. Early in the seventh round, however, Martinez suffered a knockdown, followed by a stunning left, after which he struggled to gain control. After fierce close-quarters fighting, he staggered backwards and fell, hand to his left temple. The official called the match at 2:18. 

Today was Hasegawa's third wedding anniversary.

The Swiss people have voted yes to the freedom of circulation to the new EU states. Overall 55.95% (1 457 355) voted yes and 44.05% (1 147 236) voted no. The turnout was 53.64%. All the cantons voted yes, apart from the six and a half &lt;a href="w%3ATicino"&gt;Ticino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAppenzell%20Innerrhoden"&gt;Appenzell Innerrhoden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AObwalden"&gt;Obwalden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANidwalden"&gt;Nidwalden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanton%20of%20Glarus"&gt;Glarus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanton%20of%20Schwyz"&gt;Schwyz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACanton%20of%20Uri"&gt;Uri&lt;/a&gt;.

German-speaking and French-speaking parts of Switzerland had similar results; in previous national popular consultations, German-speaking cantons were regarded as less progressive than French-speaking ones.

The campaign was especially harsh, most governmental parties calling for acceptance, except the far-right wing &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ASwiss%20People%27s%20Party"&gt;Swiss People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (though Swiss People's Party's charismatic figure &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AChristoph%20Blocher"&gt;Christoph Blocher&lt;/a&gt; personally called for acceptance as well). Smaller formations, both from the extreme Right and extreme Left, attempted to smear fear of massive immigration and unemployement.

Switzerland has ratified bilateral agreements with the members of the European Union in March 2004, but the new members (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ACyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AEstonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AHungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ALatvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ALithuania"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3AMalta"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ASlovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aen%3ASlovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;) were not included in the deal.

The results have been greeted by most of the political establishment.

According to the first &lt;a href="w%3Aexit%20poll"&gt;exit poll&lt;/a&gt;s published by TNS OBOP and PBS for TVP1 Polish public television station, the &lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20and%20Justice"&gt;Law and Justice&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤PiS♡❤) party has won today's &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202005"&gt;parliamentary election in Poland&lt;/a&gt; with a 27,6% result. Runners up were &lt;a href="w%3ACitizens%20Platform"&gt;Citizens Platform&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤PO♡❤) with 24,1% and &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Left"&gt;Alliance of the Democratic Left&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤SLD♡❤) with 11,3%.

According to a GfK Polonia poll for TVN, TVN24 and the ♡❤Rzeczpospolita♡❤ newspaper, PiS has 28,3% votes, PO 26,5% and SLD 11%. &lt;a href="w%3ALeage%20of%20Polish%20Families"&gt;Leage of Polish Families&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤LPR♡❤), &lt;a href="w%3ASelf-Defense%20of%20the%20Polish%20Republic"&gt;Self-Defense of the Polish Republic&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Samoobrona♡❤) and &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20Peasant%20Party"&gt;Polish Peasant Party&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤PSL♡❤) also got the necessary 5% votes for a place in the new parliament. 

PO and PiS, both of which will form the future government, will have 304 places in the new &lt;a href="w%3ASejm"&gt;Sejm&lt;/a&gt;, which is 3 less than is required for making changes to the Polish constitution, which both parties support.

The US Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah is looking for a subcontractor to produce the &lt;a href="w%3Aanthrax"&gt;anthrax&lt;/a&gt; bacillus anthracis Sterne strain in 1,500 litre quantities. The Sterne strain is not thought to be harmful to humans, but the intended use of the anthrax remains unclear, worrying anti-biological weapons activists. Other recent Dugway contracts for equipment to produce unspecified biolgical agents in 3,000 litre batches are even more concerning to activists.

The contracts were uncovered by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.sunshine-project.org/"&gt;The Sunshine Project&lt;/a&gt;, a group opposed to biological weapons development based in Germany. The work involved seems to cast doubts on the ability of the US to live up to its commitments to the Biological Weapons Convention. The post 9/11 anthrax attack upon the U.S. used weaponized U.S. Army anthrax &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fas.org/bwc/news/anthraxreport.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/anthrax/story/0%2C1520%2C653082%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, most likely produced at &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Detrick"&gt;Fort Detrick&lt;/a&gt;.

A Dugway spokesperson declined to specify what the biological agents would be used for.

<doc id="22827" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=22827" title="IRA decommissioning complete - de Chastelain">
<h1>IRA decommissioning complete - de Chastelain</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=IRA%20decommissioning%20complete%20-%20de%20Chastelain&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A report confirming that the &lt;a href="Provisional%20IRA"&gt;IRA&lt;/a&gt; has fully decommissioned all of its armaments has been submitted to the &lt;a href="w%3ABritian"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; governments on Monday (September 26, 2005).

The Chairman of the decommissioning body, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20de%20Chastelain"&gt;General John de Chastelain&lt;/a&gt; met representitives of both governments, before releasing details of the report at a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;. A partial catalogue of the arms stock was included, as well as the statements of two independent observers present at the decommissioning process. The observers are a Catholic priest, and a Methodist minister. 

Both witnesses stressed their independence and de Chastelain commented that it was clear from their observations that the weapons had been gathered from individuals and put beyond use. De Chastelain refused to be drawn on details of the exact numbers of weapons decommissioned, the IRA having agreed to decommissioning based on confidentiality. The decommissioning panel did make comments that the weapons decommissioned did correspond with the estimates of weapons held, included a mix of new and old weapons, including surface to air missiles and heavy machine guns.

General de Chastelain, along with &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Sens"&gt;Andrew Sens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATauno%20Nieminen"&gt;Tauno Nieminen&lt;/a&gt;, has been in Ireland overseeing this latest round of decommissioning since September. Before now, they had been allowed to witness three acts of decommissioning. However, lack of details in the reports provided afterwards meant that opponents questioned the moves.

Statements from both governments, as well as the major Northern Irish political leaders, are expected later on Monday.

The IRA announced that it was &lt;a href="IRA%20orders%20end%20to%20armed%20campaign"&gt;calling an end to its armed campaign&lt;/a&gt; in July, and ordered members not to take part in any other activities. The Unionist paramilitary UDA had withdrawn from the decommissioning after initial talks in 1999. de Chastelain indicated inventory of decommissioned weapons will not be published until full paramilitary decommissioning is complete.

<h3>Initial reactions</h3>
&lt;a href="w%3ADUP"&gt;DUP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANigel%20Dodds"&gt;Nigel Dodds&lt;/a&gt; said that decommissioning was always required for "building and instilling confidence in the unionist community", and that "it was absolutely vital to have that visual aspect."

&lt;a href="w%3AUUP"&gt;UUP&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AReg%20Empey"&gt;Sir Reg Empey&lt;/a&gt; said that the report needed to make clear that absolutely all arms had been put beyond use.

&lt;a href="w%3ASDLP"&gt;SDLP&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Durkan"&gt;Mark Durkan&lt;/a&gt; said that both governments must now move forward with implementing the &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday%20Agreement"&gt;Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Maskey"&gt;Alex Maskey&lt;/a&gt; called the day "historic", commenting that the responsibility now rests with the DUP and the governments to move forward.

During the press conference, General de Chastelain faced critics who questioned the truthfulness of the process. He responded with "We have no Doubt ... We have nothing to gain by misleading you."

In the days leading up to the parliamentary election in Poland on September 25, 2005, several prominent members of the political party &lt;a href="w%3APiS"&gt;PiS&lt;/a&gt; made statements which suggested that the party supported discrimination against gay teachers. Initial results of the election indicate that PiS is likely to have a relative majority, leading to a possible political pressures against gay teachers (or recruitment of gay teachers) during the term of the future Polish government.

The Polish news agency &lt;a href="w%3APolska%20Agencja%20Prasowa"&gt;PAP&lt;/a&gt; reported on September 21, 2005, that &lt;a href="w%3AJaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Jarosław Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt;, twin brother of party leader &lt;a href="w%3ALech%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Lech Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt;, said that ♡❤homosexuals should not be teachers♡❤, but also that homosexuals ♡❤would not be persecuted♡❤. PAP cited the daily ♡❤Fakt♡❤.
In an interview on &lt;a href="w%3ATVP"&gt;Polish national television&lt;/a&gt; the following day, another member of PiS, &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Bielan"&gt;Adam Bielan&lt;/a&gt;, made statements which suggest that people in PiS generally share this attitude, but that the party, through its president, Lech Kaczyński, was not yet willing to make any formal statement on the issue. 

Adam Bielan stated, for example, that a statement attributed to Lech Kaczyński, published in ♡❤Fakt♡❤, saying that homosexuals ♡❤can♡❤ be teachers, was an error by Lech Kaczyński's colleague, and that the statement was unauthorised. He also stated, 

Prominent members of PiS have earlier put pressure on the &lt;a href="w%3Agay%20rights"&gt;gay rights&lt;/a&gt; community. PiS leader Lech Kaczyński, as mayor of &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw"&gt;Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, refused to authorize the Equality Parade for gay rights on June 11, 2005 in Warsaw. The Parade took place despite the ban, and the level of violence against participants was greater than in previous gay rights parades: many eggs, stones and bottles were thrown at participants, injuring at least two people, who were hospitalized.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; detainee &lt;a href="David%20Hicks"&gt;David Hicks&lt;/a&gt; has made application to gain &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acitizenship"&gt;citizenship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . All nine British citizens that had previously been held in Guantanamo Bay have been released following lobbying by the British government.

The decision to make an application was made after Hicks made a chance comment about his mother's British citizenship when talking about the recent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Ashes"&gt;"Ashes"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cricket series with his lawyer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20Michael%20Mori"&gt;Major Michael Mori&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The ABC reported that a spokesperson from the British High Commission in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has said that the application could take up to a year to process.

The Law Council of Australia issued a press release on September 21, 2005 asserting that if the proposed military trial of David Hicks goes ahead in its current format then it is shaping up to be a "true travesty of justice". 

David Hicks has been held without trial for nearly four years and for much of that time he was held without any charges having been made. He is currently scheduled to face a military commission and is the only Guantanamo Bay detainee facing a commission hearing.

&lt;a href="w%3ARenault"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; finished third in the Brazilian Grand Prix, held at the Autodromo Carlos Pace near &lt;a href="w%3ASao%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ATeam%20McLaren"&gt;McLaren&lt;/a&gt; drivers and championship rivals &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Pablo%20Montoya"&gt;Juan Pablo Montoya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20Raikonnen"&gt;Kimi Raikonnen&lt;/a&gt; finished first and second respectively; although Alonso's third place decreased his lead in championship points over Raikonnen, his closest rival, to 23, he nonetheless was able to secure the 2005 Drivers' World Championship. Since the winner of a &lt;a href="w%3AFormula%20One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; Grand Prix earns 10 points and only two races remain, Raikonnen no longer has a mathematical possibility of becoming World Champion.

Alonso thus ends the five-year long reign of Michael Schumacher at the top of Formula One. At 24, he also became the youngest Formula One World Champion, ahead of Brazilian driver &lt;a href="w%3AEmerson%20Fittipaldi"&gt;Emerson Fittipaldi&lt;/a&gt;, who was 25 when he took the crown in 1972. He is also the first Spaniard to take that title.

Even though the Drivers' Championship is over, the Constructors' Championship will most likely go down to the wire during the last two races of the season in Suzuka (Japan) and Shanghai. Even though Renault has led the Championship for most of the season, Raikonnen's recent victories in the Hungarian, Turkish, Belgian and Brazilian Grand Prix have given McLaren a two-point lead over Renault, ensuring that both teams will fight hard for every point in the final races. 

The race commenced with an incident between &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Coulthard"&gt;David Coulthard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAntonio%20Pizzonia"&gt;Antonio Pizzonio&lt;/a&gt; touching wheels, forcing the latter's Williams-BMW into his teammate &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Webber"&gt;Mark Webber's&lt;/a&gt; car, putting all three of them out of the race (Webber eventually did manage to rejoin after lengthy repairs). The incident necessitated the deployment of the safety car until the track was cleared. Following the restart, &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt; repassed reigning seven-times world champion &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; almost immediately, although Schumacher ultimately regained the position during the first pitstop round.

Montoya was never challenged for the race lead, and was not required to assist his teammate as Alonso's third place ensured that a win for Raikonnen would have made no difference regarding the outcome of the world championship. McLaren's one-two finish was their first such result since the 2000 &lt;a href="w%3AAustrian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Austrian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite pre-race concerns about rain, the race remained dry.

Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has made application to gain British citizenship. All nine British citizens that had previously been held in Guantanamo Bay have been released following lobbying by the British government.

The decision to make an application was made after Hicks made a chance comment about his mother's British citizenship when talking about the recent "Ashes" cricket series with his lawyer Major Michael Mori.

The ABC reported that a spokesperson from the British High Commission in Canberra has said that the application could take up to a year to process.

A 27 year old woman who was hospitalized with bird flu symptoms last week, died in hospital this morning. Test results confirmed that she, and a five year old girl who died last week, had died for the H5N1 virus which has already killed dozens of people across Asia. 

She's the sixth person in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; to die from &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, and at present there are at least 34 people hospitalized in the country with symptoms of the virus. 

There is concern that a widespread outbreak could occur as people in Indonesia frequently keep poultry or pet birds in their homes. For this reason, Indonesian Government will deliver 40,000 doses of the anti-viral drug by the end of this week, with a further 40,000 provided by Australia.

<h1>IRA weapons decommissioned</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=IRA%20weapons%20decommissioned&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In a lunchtime press conference in &lt;a href="w%3ABelfast%2C%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt;, retired Canadian general &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20de%20Chastelain"&gt;John de Chastelain&lt;/a&gt;, head of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, announced that all the weapons of the &lt;a href="w%3AProvisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;Provisional IRA&lt;/a&gt; have been "put beyond use" &amp;ndash; generally interpreted as buried in concrete. 

The IICD &amp;ndash; de Chastelain, U.S. diplomat Andrew D. Sens, and Finnish Brigadier Tauno Nieminen &amp;ndash; have been overseeing the latest round of decommissioning since early September, and reported that the quantity of weapons destroyed was in line with estimates provided by the British and Irish security services. The decommissioning was witnessed by two churchmen, Catholic priest Father Alex Reid and former Methodist president Rev. Harold Good, who said "The experience of seeing this with our own eyes, on a minute-to-minute basis, provided us with evidence so clear and of its nature so incontrovertible that at the end of the process it demonstrated to us &amp;ndash; and would have demonstrated to anyone who might have been with us &amp;ndash; that beyond any shadow of doubt, the arms of the IRA have now been decommissioned."

No photographs were taken of the decommissioning, as there was a desire to avoid giving the impression that the IRA has been defeated, but many in the Unionist community remain sceptical that the decommissioning has been effective.

British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; described this as an important step in the transition to peace, while Irish Taoiseach &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; said that it is a landmark development. The two governments will issue a joint statement .

Over 350 protesters, including anti-war activist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , were arrested Monday near the &lt;a href="US%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;. Sheehan was fined &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;75 for demonstrating without a permit.

The protestors demanded to speak with current &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. The demonstrators sat on the sidewalk illegally, after marching along the pedestrian walkway on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. Police reportedly warned the demonstrators numerous times of the law, then began making arrests.

Sheehan has announced that she will not pay the fine, and is scheduled to appear in court on November 16.

<h1>Microsoft launches MSN adCenter</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; announced today the official launch of &lt;a href="w%3AMSN"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤♡adCenter♡❤♡ in &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤♡adCenter♡❤♡ allows advertisers to target specific demographics using information provided by Microsoft's &lt;a href="w%3AHotmail"&gt;Hotmail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APassport"&gt;Microsoft Passport Network&lt;/a&gt; users.

"The launch of adCenter in France and Singapore is a great first step to delivering on our global vision to connect advertisers to consumers in a much more meaningful way," said Yusuf Mehdi, senior V.P. of MSN Information Services &amp; Merchant Platform.

Advertisers will be able to target ads based on geographic location, gender, age range, time of day, and day of the week. If MSN has no information on the visitor it will display ads based upon keywords. Additional features include a cost estimator and a site analyzer that will recommend keywords based on the content of the advertiser’s website.

MSN currently has a contract for Yahoo ads that runs through 2006, and they are expected to slowly phase them out, although MSN has not confirmed this. 

♡❤♡adCenter♡❤♡ has been in testing in France and Singapore since March. Testing in the US will begin in October. Microsoft plans to eventually sell ads on websites outside of MSN.

This initiative is a part of a broader strategy that Microsoft has launched to compete against &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google's&lt;/a&gt; AdWords service, in operation for several years, which allows advertisers to bid on specific keywords and ensure ad placement on the company's search engine and other online properties. Microsoft's chief executive vowed to "kill Google" in an expletive-laden tirade against the firm, according to US court documents filed by Google.

Many internet users choose to block web page advertisements from both Microsoft and Google, using several different techniques of &lt;a href="w%3Aad%20filtering"&gt;ad filtering&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="w%3Aadblock"&gt;adblock&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3Afirefox"&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt; web browser.

&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner"&gt;Warner Music&lt;/a&gt; agreed on Tuesday to license its music videos to &lt;a href="w%3AMTV"&gt;MTV&lt;/a&gt; for use on devices such as &lt;a href="w%3Acell%20phone"&gt;cell phones&lt;/a&gt; and other devices. This deal is said to help the recording industry to gain more revenue, despite declining CD sales. The cost of the deal was not disclosed.

MTV plans to distribute these music videos as short segments and, in the future, offer full-length videos as part of a subscription. In addition, MTV wishes to use these videos in programs similar to &lt;a href="w%3AVH1"&gt;VH1&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤Driven♡❤. Pricing is not available yet.

Warner Music is the first label to license music to MTV for the purpose of offering them on wireless devices. MTV plans to get licenses from other music labels.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Leader%20of%20Puerto%20Rican%20People%E2%80%99s%20Army%20shot%2C%20killed%20by%20FBI&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AFiliberto%20Ojeda%20R%C3%ADos"&gt;Filiberto Ojeda Ríos&lt;/a&gt;, a leading figure in the &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rican%20Independence"&gt;Puerto Rican Independence&lt;/a&gt; movement in &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, died September 23rd.
An autopsy showed that this was due to blood loss from a single gunshot wound, obtained during a confrontation with FBI agents in the municipality of &lt;a href="w%3AHormigueros%2C%20Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Hormigueros, Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;.

The 72-year-old has been wanted on charges relating to a $7M bank heist in Connecticut in 1983, and his home had been surrounded by over 300 agents, including 20 snipers.
The FBI asserts that he fired shots upon them first, but many groups are framing the death as the unwarranted assassination of a key player in Puerto Rico's anti-U.S. colonialism movement.

The FBI did not enter the home until Saturday, almost 24 hours after the shot had been fired.
This has lead to many accusations that they were preventing him from getting medical attention.
Dr. Héctor Pesquera, spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hostosian%20Congress"&gt;National Hostosian Congress&lt;/a&gt;, took part in the autopsy and stated that the FBI tactic was to not intervene in order that "Comandante Ojeda Ríos would bleed to death through lack of medical attention."

FBI director Robert S. Mueller announced Monday that he had ordered an investigation of the incident.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrampton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Brampton&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="w%3ASuresh%20Joachim"&gt;Suresh Joachim&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMississauga%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Mississauga, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; continues to amaze, breaking yet another world record, this time at The Bay Court in &lt;a href="w%3AShoppers%20World"&gt;Shoppers World&lt;/a&gt;.

From Thursday, September 22 at 8 am, to Saturday, September 24 at 3:05 pm, Suresh &lt;a href="w%3Aironing"&gt;ironed&lt;/a&gt; continuously for 55 hours and 5 minutes, in front of the thousands of onlookers shopping at the mall those three days.

The achievement, now submitted to the &lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records"&gt;Guinness Book of World Records&lt;/a&gt;, breaks the previous record by Eufemia Stadler of Zurich, Switzerland. Stadler completed 40 hours of continuous ironing from September 16-18, 1999.

Originally from Sri Lanka and Australia, Joachim is no stranger to the folks at Guinness. He currently holds twenty other records, ranging from greatest distance travelled on 'up' and 'down' escalators (225.44 km between May 25 and May 31 1998), furthest travelled on a treadmill in one week (659.27 km at a gym in Paris, France), and longest dance marathon by an individual (100 hours at the Dixie Outlet Mall).

This September, Suresh watched television in the lobby of WABC in New York City for 69 hours and 7 minutes, breaking the previous record by 19 hours. The event was covered daily on the talk show "Live with Regis and Kelly" as part of their Guinness World Record Breaker Week. He also recently set the record for longest time rocking in a rocking chair, at 75 hours.

A DJ on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire recently tried to break Joachim's record for longest continuous time as a DJ. He was unsuccessful, and Suresh's 120-hour World Record set on Geethavaani Tamil Radio in Scarborough stands unharmed.

The event helped raise funds for the Universal Fund for Suffering Children, whose funds are "utilized to save the world's children from poverty, disease and war." All of Joachim's stunts have been dedicated to this charity.

What's next for Suresh? He plans to start static cycling from October 18th, 2005 to October 22nd, 2005, in Britain. Suresh's goal is 150 world records, which would beat the long-time record breaker Ashrita Furman, who has accumulated 94 records. While Furman started two decades ago, Suresh only discovered the Guinness Book of World Records in 1991, and started record breaking in 1996.

Despite reports to the contrary, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;British Prime Minister Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; does not intend to pull troops out of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Chinese Newspaper Xinhua reported. Despite a strong anti-war sentiment that has been growing in Iraq, particularly since British troops in &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt; were attacked by protestors on the 19th. Responding allegations that the Iraqi people do not want western influence on the future of their nation, Blair said "eight and a half million Iraqis showed which future they wanted when they came out and voted in January's elections." Britain has approximately 8500 Troops in Iraq, making them the second largest military force present in Iraq. 

Blair also did not respond to questions as to when he would leave office, this issue of significant concern granted the Prime Minister's falling popularity since the War in Iraq began. Despite a recently conducted poll, 57% of Britons believe that the British Military should pull out of Iraq, as well as Blair's acknowledgement that "several thousand run the terrorist insurgency around Baghdad. And yes, as a result of the fighting, innocent people tragically die.", Blair believes that the Britons and Iraqi were in favour of the occupation. Although his term will continue until 2010, the Labour party is divided over whether or not he should step down sooner.

<h1>StarOffice 8 launched</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=StarOffice%208%20launched&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; has released &lt;a href="w%3AStarOffice"&gt;StarOffice 8&lt;/a&gt; today. StarOffice 8 is a commercial office suite that includes word-processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing and database applications.

According to Sun, StarOffice 8 “provides excellent compatibility with &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Office"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt;”. This new version improves Word, Excel and PowerPoint import and export filters, improving support for password-protected Word and Excel files and presentations with complex animations, autoshapes and slide transitions. StarOffice 8 also includes a Microsoft Office macro converter allowing many Microsoft Office macros to work in StarOffice.

StarOffice 8 is also the first commercial office suite to support the &lt;a href="w%3AOASIS%20%28organization%29"&gt;OASIS&lt;/a&gt; Open Document Format for Office Applications (&lt;a href="w%3AOpenDocument"&gt;OpenDocument&lt;/a&gt;). OpenDocument is an XML based file format created by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards. Massachusetts has recently announced the plan to switch to OpenDocument format. Microsoft has said it will not support the OpenDocument format.

StarOffice 8 is based on the open source &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt; project. OpenOffice.org was founded July 2000, by Sun with the release of StarOffice code under two open source licenses.

StarOffice 8 is available as a download from Sun’s Web site for $69.95, or packaged product can be ordered for $99.95. Enterprise customers can purchase StarOffice 8 for $35 (£20) per user. &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt; is available for free from openoffice.org.

During his address to the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20Conference"&gt;Labour Party Conference&lt;/a&gt; today, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party"&gt;party members&lt;/a&gt; that there must be further public service reforms. He highlighted reforms needed for the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20for%20Constitutional%20Affairs"&gt;criminal justice system&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; intimated that he would not be stepping down early as &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt; with a policy heavy speech. He apologised that &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; had not gone further with it's reforms and that they should stay the ♡❤change makers♡❤. Rather than announcing a date for his retirement, which he says will be before the next election, he praised &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown's&lt;/a&gt; record as &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor&lt;/a&gt;

Mr. Blair said that he wanted to form a new consensus on public services and respond to concerns over crime.

<h2>Opposition responds</h2>
As per normal, these statements were scurtinized by the nation's opposition parties.

&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative chairman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFrancis%20Maude"&gt;Francis Maude&lt;/a&gt; dismissed the speech: "What people want from Mr Blair is not more polished rhetoric about the future but practical solutions to the problems of the present." 

&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Lib Dem&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; said: "What people want are quality schools and healthcare and safe streets. After eight years of Labour, they're still waiting." 

&lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20National%20Party"&gt;Scottish National Party&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Alex%20Salmond"&gt;Alex Salmond&lt;/a&gt; said: "It was an underwhelming performance from a man with an eye on his own exit strategy, even if he stubbornly refuses to find one for our soldiers in Iraq."

<h1>9/11 Anthrax investigation quietly loses urgency</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=9/11%20Anthrax%20investigation%20quietly%20loses%20urgency&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In the past year, the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; has sharply reduced the number of staff investiging the post-9/11 &lt;a href="w%3AAnthrax%20probe"&gt;Anthrax probe&lt;/a&gt; attack from 31 to 21; and the post office has reduced the number of investigators from 13 to 9. The investigation has been one of the most extensive in FBI history but has yielded no arrests. The reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction remains at $2.5 million.

The FBI is preparing an internal report to take stock of the situation, as is usually done in high-profile cases which go unresolved for years, and are expected to remain so. The magnitude of the Anthrax probe parallels the 18-year Unabomber probe, which was only resolved because &lt;a href="w%3ATheodore%20Kaczynski"&gt;Theodore Kaczynski&lt;/a&gt; issued a public manifesto and his brother recognized his thinking and tipped off the FBI.

The prevailing theory in the Anthrax probe is that "the culprit is a U.S. scientist who had access to the high-grade anthrax and the knowledge of how to physically manipulate it and use it as a weapon", a theory which emerged early in the investigation. The attacks used a weaponized Ames strain almost surely produced in the U.S. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fas.org/bwc/news/anthraxreport.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/anthrax/story/0%2C1520%2C653082%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, most likely at &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Detrick"&gt;Fort Detrick&lt;/a&gt;. 

The purpose of the attack also remains unknown but many believe it was committed by conservative elements in American society, due to the existence of coordinated harmless attack, the choice of targets, and the choice of strain. Some believe the attack was aided by &lt;a href="w%3ALt.%20Col.%20Dr.%20Philip%20Zack"&gt;Lt. Col. Dr. Philip Zack&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps with the intent to frame ex-coworker &lt;a href="w%3ADr.%20Ayaad%20Assaad"&gt;Dr. Ayaad Assaad&lt;/a&gt; whom Dr. Zack harassed while at Fort Detrick &lt;a href="http%3A//www.antiwar.com/justin/j041702.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.antiwar.com/justin/j022202.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The post-9/11 Anthrax attacks killed 5 people and temporarily infected another 17.

<h1>Demosphere.net launches new Wiki</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Demosphere.net%20launches%20new%20Wiki&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ADemosphere.net"&gt;Demosphere.net&lt;/a&gt;, an underground political forum, has started a new wiki&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ddsi.info/wiki"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday to be used for the design of their socio-political voting software, which is currently under development. Using the &lt;a href="w%3Awiki"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, the public can collaborate with project members to resolve issues inherent in such a complex system. A &lt;a href="w%3ABeta%20version"&gt;Beta version&lt;/a&gt; which will let students debate, discuss and vote on issues that affect their community, should be available on college and university campuses for the start of the Fall 2006 Semester.

The wiki uses the &lt;a href="w%3AMediaWiki"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt; platform, and contribution is not limited in any way. The wiki was set up by Jordan Schroder, Project Director and CEO of Democratic Development Solutions&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ddsi.info"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a student driven Canadian startup. "Despite the youth of our new wiki, I think students and professionals interested in the project, will find it a great way to have an impact on the software we're developing...", Schroder said in an interview. "Wiki technology is incredibly powerful and is exactly the kind of filter the Internet, as a medium, needs to play a more concrete role in long-term global democracy." He went on to say that he would personally "love to see wiki technology incorporated into the design of our voting software."

Although he couldn't say for certain how it might be used in the media-community framework of the future software, he stressed that, "in adopting this technology during our formative and foundation stages, we can hopefully attract individuals with an idea of how it might be best used in the finished product, and who are interested in leadership positions within the project."

The demosphere.net discussion forums&lt;a href="http%3A//www.demosphere.net"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with 45 registered users and over 1100 posts (many of a political nature), are more active than the wiki. While only a few days old, the wiki had, as of September 27th, only two registered users, according to the site stats &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ddsi.info/wiki/index.php/Special%3AListusers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, a large organ transplantation center, reports that a low priority Saudi liver transplant patient received improper priority, and the actions were concealed. 

Hospital President Gus Valdespino confirmed that hospital staff members falsified documents several times to cover up the maneuver, pretending that the transplant was for a patient who was near the top of the regional waiting list, when the Saudi patient was 52nd on the state's liver transplant list.

Priority is believed to have been granted because the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia would pay 25% to 30% more for the operation than U.S. insurance companies would have paid. The medical community views giving preference to one patient for nonmedical reasons as "totally unconscionable," according to Dr. Douglas Hanto, of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. 

The National Organ Network permits a maximum of 5% of donated organs to go to foreign nations. According to records, St. Vincent provided about 8% of its organs to foreign nationals.

The &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Homeland%20Security%20and%20Governmental%20Affairs"&gt;U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs&lt;/a&gt; has begun debating a bill &lt;a href="http%3A//thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z%3Fc109%3AS.1399"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//www.whitehouse.gov/omb/legislative/grppi_act_2005.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; requiring that all Governmental agencies be given a 10 year shelf life, at which time they may be reinstated by a committee appointed by the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; or cease to exist within two to four years. &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;The White House&lt;/a&gt; supports the proposed bill.

The senate debate will cover such issues as how difficult it will be for the President's sunset commission to recommend the elimination of an agency, and how much the public will be permitted to participate.

Many proponents of a &lt;a href="w%3Asunset%20clause"&gt;sunset clause&lt;/a&gt; may not support the bill in its current form, as it extends the power of the president at the expense of &lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;congress&lt;/a&gt;. Some proponents hope to limit the size of either the federal government, or federal law in general, by requiring ongoing debate in congress, a feature not provided by this bill.

French military commandos boarded a &lt;a href="w%3Aferry"&gt;ferry&lt;/a&gt; boat on Wednesday morning that had been taken over by ferry company &lt;a href="w%3Astrike"&gt;strikers&lt;/a&gt; from the Société nationale Corse-Méditerranée (SNCM). The strike erupted after the French government announced its intention to &lt;a href="w%3Aprivatization"&gt;privatize&lt;/a&gt; the company, which had been losing money for decades. The strikers seem to belong to the Corsican workers' union, a &lt;a href="w%3Atrade%20union"&gt;trade union&lt;/a&gt; close to &lt;a href="w%3ACorsica"&gt;Corsican&lt;/a&gt; nationalists.

The strikers captured the ship, called ♡❤Pascal-Paoli♡❤, in &lt;a href="w%3AMarseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt;. They sailed her to &lt;a href="w%3ABastia"&gt;Bastia&lt;/a&gt; where she was intercepted by a ship of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Navy"&gt;Marine Nationale&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and boarded by special forces. The military team included members of the &lt;a href="w%3AGIGN"&gt;GIGN&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Gendarmerie"&gt;French Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt;'s rescue and anti-terror unit) and, according to some sources, &lt;a href="w%3ANaval%20commandos%20%28France%29"&gt;naval special forces&lt;/a&gt;. 

The prosecutor's office at &lt;a href="w%3AMarseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt; has opened a criminal enquiry for "evident crime", with the charge of &lt;a href="w%3Apiracy"&gt;piracy&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; a crime which, according to article &lt;a href="http%3A//www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode%3Fcode%3DCPENALLL.rcv%26amp%3Bart%3D224-6"&gt;L224-6&lt;/a&gt; of the French Penal Code, is punished by a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. If the charges are retained, the initiators of the event will face a jury trial before an &lt;a href="w%3AAssize%20court"&gt;assize court&lt;/a&gt;. There are, however, questions as to whether this criminal qualification applies in this case, since the strikers did not resort to violence in stealing the ship.

The strikers are in protest against the French government's intention to sell SNCM to the investment fund &lt;a href="w%3AButler%20Capital%20Partners"&gt;Butler Capital Partners&lt;/a&gt;, led by businessman &lt;a href="w%3AWalter%20Butler%20%28French%20businessman%29"&gt;Walter Butler&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Butler claims that he can put SNCM back into financial shape within 4 years. Opponents of the privatization plan contend that the sale price is an amount greatly inferior to what it is worth, even if only for its assets.

The French government has had significant problems with money-losing state-owned companies in the past. SNCM is, however, a special case, due to the delicate political situation in Corsica. By comparison, the private company Corsica Ferries is in good financial shape. Some sympathetic protesters, however, caused damage to Corsica Ferries offices.

Since launching ♡❤♡❤ in 2001, the game console project has resulted in a $4 billion loss for the company, an amount estimated to be approximately equal to 10% of Microsoft's total cash reserves.

The ♡❤Xbox♡❤ game console was marketed by Microsoft as a &lt;a href="w%3ALoss%20leader"&gt;loss leader&lt;/a&gt; with the plan of establishing a profit base derived from game sales and licensing to third party game publishers.

Microsoft intends to continue their loss leader strategy with the successor to their console, the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which will be released November 22, 2005, just in time for the &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; buying season.

&lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; majority leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was today &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aindictment"&gt;indicted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustin%2C%20Texas"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; by a Travis County &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agrand%20jury"&gt;grand jury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on conspiracy charges. DeLay announced that he will step down temporarily from his leadership position. 

DeLay has publicly countered that the charges are &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apartisan"&gt;partisan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and thus politically motivated. The charges originate from the District Attorney of Travis County, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARonnie%20Earle"&gt;Ronnie Earle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a Democrat who has prosecuted Democrat and Republican office holders, including U.S. Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKay%20Bailey%20Hutchison"&gt;Kay Bailey Hutchison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;a href="http%3A//www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html%3Fid%3D110007330"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Mr. DeLay's attorney Steve Brittain said that DeLay was accused of a criminal conspiracy in a campaign finance scheme along with two associates, namely &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Colyandro"&gt;John Colyandro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , former executive director of a Texas political action committee formed by DeLay, and Jim Ellis, the head of DeLay's national political committee. 

Attorneys for Colyandro and Ellis have filed to have the proceedings moved out of Travis County in order to obtain a fair trial. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.statesman.com/metrostate/content/metro/stories/09/30delay.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Travis County, located in central &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, contains the state capital of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustin%2C%20Texas"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and is &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Texas"&gt;politically&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; known as a liberal county within a conservative state, as indicated by the most recent &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/countymap.htm"&gt;presidential elections&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the indictment, "the defendants herein, with the intent that a felony be committed, did enter into an agreement with one or more of each other with a general purpose committee known as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATexans%20for%20a%20Republican%20Majority"&gt;Texans for a Republican Majority&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; PAC (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apolitical%20action%20committee"&gt;political action committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) that one or more of them would engage in conduct that would constitute the offense of knowingly making a political contribution in violation of Subchapter D of Chapter 253 of the Texas Election Code..." The indictment does not include specific charges of how DeLay was involved in the conspiracy. Mr. DeLay waived a three-year restriction for the indictment.

Mr. DeLay, upon announcement of the indictment, made a solitary public comment: "I have notified the speaker that I will temporarily step aside from my position as majority leader pursuant to rules of the House Republican Conference and the actions of the Travis County district attorney today." 

Earlier, DeLay denied all charges in the lengthy investigation. Bill White, another of DeLay's attorneys, said "it's a skunky indictment if they have one." DeLay's spokesman, Kevin Madden, called the indictment "nothing more than prosecutorial retribution by a partisan Democrat," referring to prosecutor Ronnie Earle, a Democrat.

According to House Republican party rules, DeLay must resign upon indictment. Party officials told the Associated Press that Speaker of the House, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Hastert"&gt;Dennis Hastert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, will likely recommend Republican &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Dreier"&gt;David Dreier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of California as replacement, while some duties may also go to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMajority%20Whip%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Majority whip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoy%20Blunt"&gt;Roy Blunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;. 

DeLay has previously been admonished three times by the House Ethics Committee. In their October 6, 2004 letter to him, the members wrote in part concluding, "...it is clearly necessary for you to temper your future actions to assure that you are in full compliance at all times with the applicable House Rules and standards of conduct. We remind you that the House Code of Official Conduct provides the Committee with authority “to deal with any given act or accumulation of acts which, in the judgment of the committee, are severe enough to reflect discredit on the Congress.” &lt;a href="http%3A//www.house.gov/ethics/DeLay_letter.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

House Republicans earlier eliminated the rule requiring his resignation upon indictment, but reinstated it fearing voters' outcry.

DeLay's Political Action Committee, Texans for a Republican Majority, was earlier indicted on charges it accepted corporate contributions mostly from the credit card industry .&lt;a href="http%3A//tx.cpusa.org/del16.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for use in state legislative elections. Texas law prohibits corporate money from being used in elections, permitting it only for administrative expenses. 

Having gained GOP control of Texas's legislature, DeLay masterminded a redistricting plan in 2004 that allowed the GOP to gain six seats in the U.S. House, formerly won by Democrats, and build a majority in Congress. In one case, one lawmaker switched parties, to maintain office.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Library%20Association"&gt;American Library Association&lt;/a&gt; (ALA) is observing Banned Books Week 2005 from September 24 until October 1, the last week in September. The ALA's list of suggested activities for members &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/actionguide/actionguide.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; includes various activities which draw attention to the books that have been challenged or banned within the last few years (see &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/100mostfrequently.htm"&gt;100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000&lt;/a&gt;), such as posting lists, organizing readings, and assigning research papers on censorship in the U.S. to students.

Attempts to ban books from library shelves rose by more than 20%, to 547 formal challenges, in 2004. The most frequent attacked books included several with gay themes, including Maya Angelou's "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings." The most challenged book was Robert Cormier's classic novel "The Chocolate War". In Norwood Colorado, parents recently burned copies of Rudolfo Anaya's "Bless Me, Ultima" after having them pulled from the High School curriculum.

The US &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; has extended the deadline for &lt;a href="w%3AEnhanced%20911"&gt;Enhanced 911&lt;/a&gt; compliance by &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20over%20IP"&gt;VoIP|&lt;/a&gt; (Voice over Internet Protocol) providers until Oct 31, 2005. Last May, the FCC issued an order requiring VoIP providers to implement E911 within 120 days. This order also required providers to notify customers of the 911 limitations. Customers who did not acknowledge these limitations would have their services terminated. 

This extension gives providers extra time to connect the networks to 911 services, and warn users of the limitations. If the FCC had not granted this extension, at least 10,000 users would have been disconnected.

According to the FCC at least 21 VoIP providers have received an acknowledgment from all customers of the 911 limitations. 32 additional VoIP providers have received an acknowledgment from 90 percent or more of their customers. VoIP providers who have not met the 90% goal could face enforcement proceedings starting October 31, 2005.

FCC said in a statement “it is evident that many providers have devoted significant resources to notifying each of their subscribers of the limitations of their 911 service and obtaining acknowledgements from each of their subscribers.”

&lt;a href="w%3ANorwood%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Norwood, Colorado&lt;/a&gt; parents recently burned copies of Rudolfo Anaya's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABless%20Me%2C%20Ultima"&gt;Bless Me, Ultima&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ after having them pulled from the area high school's curriculum. Millie Davis, of the National Council of Teachers of English, said "I'm flabbergasted that something like this would be happening in this day and age". The Hispanic coming-of-age story is commonly included as part of high school curriculums, and won the Premio Quinto Sol national Chicano literary award. The novel explores some minority religious views such as &lt;a href="w%3Apaganism"&gt;paganism&lt;/a&gt;.

The Colorado parents who burned the copies claim they "mainly" object to some profanity in the novel. Rudolfo Anaya, a professor emeritus of English at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20New%20Mexico"&gt;University of New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, said "The book should be judged in its entirety. There is some strong language in strong situations, but there is no flippant use of profanity."

"Bless Me, Ultima" has survived a challenge in New York without being banned, or indeed, burned. It came in 75th on the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Library%20Associations"&gt;American Library Association's&lt;/a&gt; list of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/100mostfrequently.htm"&gt;100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000&lt;/a&gt;. By comparison, the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh positions are occupied by Robert Cormier's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Chocolate%20War"&gt;The Chocolate War&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Mark Twain's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Adventures%20of%20Huckleberry%20Finn"&gt;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, John Steinbeck's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOf%20Mice%20and%20Men"&gt;Of Mice and Men&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, and J.K. Rowling's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ series, respectively.

&lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; – 
MIT this week plays host to the &lt;a href="w%3ATechnology%20Review"&gt;♡❤Technology Review♡❤&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AEmerging%20Technologies%20Conference"&gt;Emerging Technologies Conference&lt;/a&gt; (ETC); not to be confused with the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference (ETech). ETC is supported and organized by the ♡❤Technology Review♡❤ magazine, and features celebrated innovators and engineers from around the country. 

The conference, like the publication, prides itself on fostering innovation. Two tables outside the main audience hall display information about many other programs at MIT to support innovation, including the world-famous &lt;a href="w%3ALemelson-MIT%20Prize"&gt;Lemelson-MIT Prize&lt;/a&gt; and awards highlighting work by high school students across the country. This afternoon, they presented the winners of their annual young tech innovators award, this year issued to the 35 best innovators under the age of 35.

In addition to recognizing those 35 innovators, two special awards were presented, one for humanitarian design and the other for innovation in general. 

This year's "Innovator of the Year" is &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Eggan"&gt;Kevin Eggan&lt;/a&gt;, noted for his August publication in &lt;a href="w%3AScience%20%28magazine%29"&gt;♡❤Science♡❤&lt;/a&gt; showing that cheek cells could be reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells. This could potentially end debates over whether it is moral to harvest stem cells from rarer sources.

And the "Humanitarian of the Year" is &lt;a href="w%3ASaul%20Griffith"&gt;Saul Griffith&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="w%3ASquid%20Labs"&gt;Squid Labs&lt;/a&gt;, which pioneered a system to make customized glasses 'for $5 in 5 minutes' -- covering the complete range of prescription lenses. In prototype: a machine roughly the size of a desktop inkjet that produced the lenses, and a hand-held machine (basically a set of goggles) which determines your prescription. You can send instructions to the first machine like you would to a printer; a production model is expected to be out in two to three years.

Government delegates are meeting this week at the &lt;a href="w%3A%20World%20Intellectual%20Property%20Organization"&gt;World Intellectual Property Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WIPO) general assembly in &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva"&gt;Geneva&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the &lt;a href="w%3AWIPO%20Development%20Agenda"&gt;WIPO Development Agenda&lt;/a&gt;. The meeting will determine how developing countries must implement existing controversial intellectual property rights laws including &lt;a href="w%3Acopyrights"&gt;copyrights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Apatents"&gt;patents&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Atrademarks"&gt;trademarks&lt;/a&gt;. They will also consider the disputed proposal for a global &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcaster%20Treaty"&gt;Treaty on the Protection of Broadcastings and Webcasting Organizations&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Broadcastings/Webcasting Treaty proposal, pushed by traditional broadcast organizations, and lobbyists for a handful of Internet publishers, including &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo%2521"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;, is being pushed hardest by the United States government, which ironically, has never considered such legislation domestically. The treaty would create a new layer of intellectual monopoly rights for broadcasters, potentially including 'webcasters'. Broadcasters would then be able to claim rights over material they broadcast&amp;ndash;even material that was in the &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20domain"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt; or licensed under creative commons or &lt;a href="w%3Acopyleft"&gt;copyleft&lt;/a&gt; licenses.

Many developing countries including &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; are asking for time to evaluate and study the proposals, and opposition to the treaty has been registered by numerous &lt;a href="w%3ANGOs"&gt;NGOs&lt;/a&gt; and public interest advocates. Fearing a repeat of the &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt; (DMCA), when US copyright law was made more strict to conform to WIPO standards, a coalition of U.S. NGOs is currently circulating a sign on letter calling for public hearings on the implications of the Broadcaster Treaty.

In a recent Financial Times article Professor James Boyle (Law, Duke University) &lt;a href="http%3A//www.law.duke.edu/boylesite/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; raised objections to the Broadcasting/Webcasting Treaty, saying "intellectual property laws are created without any empirical evidence that they are necessary, or that they will help rather than hurt". He elaborated that such laws are made "as though it were just a deal brokered between industry groups," and that concerns for "public interest in competition, access, free speech, and vigorous technological markets takes a back seat." Professor Boyle fears that "communications networks are increasingly built around intellectual property rules" with harmful effects.

In &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, a fuel price increase scheduled for October 1st has sparked hoarding, shortages and numerous public demonstrations. While the new official price has yet to be announced, government ministers have hinted that gas prices may rise from the current Rp 2,400/liter to as high as Rp 4,000/liter &amp;mdash; still below the market price of approximately Rp 5,000.

Fuel shortages currently affect the entire country, including &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;. Public transportation has also been disrupted, as operators are unable to obtain fuel, demonstrations cause traffic jams and strikes halt services. Demonstrations have been held across the country and are expected to reach a peak on Friday, when the new fuel prices are to be announced. Strategic points in large cities such as &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASurabaya"&gt;Surabaya&lt;/a&gt; have heavy police and security presence.

On September 21st, the Court of First Instance of the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled that decisions of the United Nations Security Council take precedence over national constitutions, European law and even the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR). Observers claim that this ruling undermines the rule of law and the principles of the constitutional state.

In their verdict in the case of Ahmed Ali Yusuf, a Swede of Arab origin whose funds had been frozen in November 2001 by the European authorities after a Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council had put him on a list of alleged terrorists, the five judges state that:
“the right of access to the courts, a principle recognised by both Article 8 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 16 December 1966, is not absolute.”♡❤

The Court holds that even organisations (like the European Union) that are not members of the United Nations are bound by decisions of the UN Security Council.

The lawyer of the convicted:

♡❤"[The verdict] is completely unacceptable [and] raises questions about the EU’s position as regards the rule of law.”"♡❤ 

Ahmed Ali Yusuf says he will appeal to the European Court of Justice.

The Arctic Ice Cap, which floats on the &lt;a href="w%3AArctic%20Ocean"&gt;Arctic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, shrank this summer to what experts believe to be its smallest size in a century. Experts in climate modeling feel this is most likely a consequence of &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; and will profoundly transform the Arctic later this century.

Dr. Ted Scambos and Dr. Mark Serreze, of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado said the change is becoming self-sustaining due to &lt;a href="w%3Apositive%20feedback"&gt;positive feedback&lt;/a&gt; effects. Dr. Serreze, said "With all that dark open water, you start to see an increase in Arctic Ocean heat storage. Come autumn and winter that makes it a lot harder to grow ice, and the next spring you're left with less and thinner ice. And it's easier to lose even more the next year."

Dr. Scambos said "The consecutive record-low extents make it pretty certain a long-term decline is underway."

The &lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Ice%20Age"&gt;Little Ice Age&lt;/a&gt; ended a century ago.

A new redesigned &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10 bill was introduced at a ceremony yesterday on Ellis Island. The new bill adds three new background colors; red, yellow and orange. It continues to feature &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Hamilton"&gt;Alexander Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;Treasury Secretary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The $10 bill is the third US bill to switch from the traditional green. The $20 and $50 bills were redesigned to feature color within the past two years.

The improvements in digital technology have made it much easier for counterfeiters. "Ten years ago, 1 percent of (counterfeit) bills were produced on digital equipment. These days, 56 percent are produced on digital equipment, and the technology is more accessible to the general population," said Eric Zahren, spokesman for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secret%20Service"&gt;Secret Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;Treasury Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , to be able to keep ahead of counterfeiters currency will need to continue to be updated every seven to ten years. The $10 bill was last redesigned in 2000. "The intention was not to create a counterfeit-proof note&amp;mdash;which is basically impossible&amp;mdash;but one that's harder to duplicate and easier to authenticate," said Zahren. This new bill includes many new and enhanced security features such as color-shifting ink, a watermark, microprinting and a security thread

Dawn Haley of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABureau%20of%20Engraving%20and%20Printing"&gt;Bureau of Engraving and Printing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said in a statement "The new $10 note design continues the U.S. Government's efforts to make our currency safer, smarter, and more secure." The new $10 bill is expected to go into circulation in early 2006.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20G.%20Roberts"&gt;John G. Roberts Jr.&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as the 17th &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Chief Justice of the United States&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, September 29, 2005, hours after being confirmed by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; by a 78-22 vote. The oath of office was administered by Justice &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;John Paul Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, who has served as acting chief justice since the death of &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Rehnquist"&gt;William Rehnquist&lt;/a&gt;.

President George Bush commented "The Senate has confirmed a man with an astute mind and kind heart. All Americans can be confident that the 17th chief justice of the United States will be prudent in exercising judicial power, firm in defending judicial independence and above all a faithful guardian of the Constitution."

Roberts gained support from all Republicans and half the Democrats in the Senate. 

Now President Bush can turn his attention to the next nominee to replace &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;, the position Roberts was slated originally to fill. Many experts say this nomination will be a much more contentious once compared to Robert's. O'Connor tended to be the key vote when it came to &lt;a href="w%3Awoman%27s%20Rights"&gt;Woman's Rights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAffirmative%20Action"&gt;Affirmative Action&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;.

President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; today nominated &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarriet%20Miers"&gt;Harriet Ellan Miers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to replace &lt;a href="Sandra%20Day%20O%27Connor"&gt;Sandra Day O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; as Associate Justice of the &lt;a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, who announced her retirement intentions July 1, 2005.

Bush originally nominated &lt;a href="John%20G.%20Roberts%2C%20Jr."&gt;John G. Roberts, Jr.&lt;/a&gt; to replace O'Connor, but following the death of Chief Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Rehnquist"&gt;William Rehnquist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Roberts was renominated and confirmed as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Chief Justice of the United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Bush's nomination was not totally unexpected because senators from both political parties reportedly suggested her as a potential nominee, and because she had lead Bush's search team for his second nominee. That mirrors &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;'s selection as Bush's Vice Presidential candidate in 2000 after Cheney led the search team for that post. 

Miers attended &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Methodist%20University"&gt;Southern Methodist University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . She earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics, and a law degree. She was in private law practice from 1972 to 1999, served one term as a member of the Dallas City Council, and as Chair of the Texas Lottery Commission. Since Bush's 2000 election she served in a variety of roles in his administration, and is currently White House Counsel.

Some critics have opposed Miers' nomination, noting that she has never served as a jurist or argued a case before the Supreme Court. The White House in response noted that neither the late judge William Rehnquist nor 35 other past Supreme Court nominees had judicial experience before being named to the Court. It also noted that 10 of the last 34 justices appointed since 1933 were appointed directly from positions within the respective sitting presidents' administrations.

Senate hearings on the nomination are been scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 6, 2005 at 2:30pm

Chief Justice Roberts was confirmed with 78 to 22 favorable vote. In recent decades confirmation hearings have been more contentious because politicians have attempted to maintain a perception of balance on the court. While Associate Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Bader%20Ginsberg"&gt;Ruth Bader Ginsberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was confirmed easily in 1993 following a 96 to 3 vote, Justice &lt;a href="Clarence%20Thomas"&gt;Clarence Thomas&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed by a 52 to 48 vote &amp;mdash; largely along party lines.

The website &lt;a href="http%3A//justicemiers.com"&gt;justicemiers.com&lt;/a&gt;, which is running banner ads supporting the nominee, was registered September 29th, 2005 to Progress for America. The registration was made several days before the nomination was announced. According to &lt;a href="http%3A//www.sourcewatch.org/index.php%3Ftitle%3DProgress_for_America"&gt;SourceWatch&lt;/a&gt;, Progress for America is a non-profit organization closely associated with the Bush administration.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=MIT%27s%20%26quot%3B%24100%20laptop%26quot%3B%20to%20be%20unveiled%20in%20November&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The MIT &lt;a href="w%3AEmerging%20Technologies%20Conference"&gt;Emerging Technologies Conference&lt;/a&gt; started its first day with a keynote by the &lt;a href="w%3AMIT%20Media%20Lab"&gt;Media Lab&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANicholas%20Negroponte"&gt;Nicholas Negroponte&lt;/a&gt;, who presented the accelerating development of their &lt;a href="w%3A%24100%20laptop"&gt;$100 laptop&lt;/a&gt; initiative. This initiative aims to mass produce robust laptops at a cost of $100 apiece for use throughout the third world. 

In November, at the second &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Summit%20on%20the%20Information%20Society"&gt;World Summit on the Information Society&lt;/a&gt; gathering in &lt;a href="w%3ATunis"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;, the Media Lab will showcase working prototypes of the laptop. Five to fifteen million "beta" units are expected to be produced within a year, and deployed in five countries. &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; has suggested distributing the laptop to half a million students across his state. They hope to produce 150 million units by the second year, at even lower costs. Negroponte noted that "$100 is still too expensive.”

The laptops will come with free software and content. Negroponte highlighted &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; as an ideal content source for the initiative, calling it "by far the best encyclopedia on the planet." He later referred to the $100 laptop initiative as "the Wikipedia equivalent" of laptop design. 

The Media Lab has previously provided laptops to groups of children in &lt;a href="w%3ASenegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACosta%20Rica"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Economic%20Forum"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Negroponte announced he was founding the &lt;a href="w%3AOne%20Laptop%20Per%20Child"&gt;One Laptop Per Child&lt;/a&gt; non-profit to push development of the notebook. Since then, the project has developed quickly, forming partnerships with organizations including &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corp"&gt;News Corp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Hat"&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAdvanced%20Micro%20Devices"&gt;Advanced Micro Devices&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights"&gt;Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; groups have welcomed the indictment in &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AHiss%C3%A8ne%20Habr%C3%A9"&gt;Hissène Habré&lt;/a&gt;, former dictator of Chad. Habré, described by the organisation Human Rights Watch as "the African &lt;a href="w%3AAugusto%20Pinochet"&gt;Pinochet&lt;/a&gt;", ruled &lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; from 1982 to 1990. He now stands accused of "crimes against humanity" over a series of abuses allegedly committed during his tenure. 

A 1992 "Truth Commission" in Chad heard evidence of systematic &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; by Habré's government, and accused the regime of more than 40,000 killings. But the government of Chad, which until very recently, according to &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;, included many of Habré's former associates, has never made any attempt to prosecute him. 

Habré, who currently lives in &lt;a href="w%3ASenegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested by the authorities there in 2000, charged with torture and &lt;a href="w%3Acrimes%20against%20humanity"&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt;. But the following year the Senegalese high court ruled that Habré could not be prosecuted for crimes committed in another country. 

Every state has the right under &lt;a href="w%3Ainternational%20law"&gt;international law&lt;/a&gt;, to prosecute the alleged perpetrators of war crimes, &lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt; and crimes against humanity, wherever those crimes were committed. 

In practice, Belgium is one of the few countries in the world to have enacted legislation enabling their domestic courts to exercise this right. 

In June 2001, four Rwandans were convicted by a Belgian court, under the country's "&lt;a href="w%3Auniversal%20jurisdiction"&gt;universal jurisdiction&lt;/a&gt;" law, of participating in the 1994 genocide (recently portrayed in the film "&lt;a href="w%3AHotel%20Rwanda"&gt;Hotel Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;"). 

Belgium recently amended the law to reduce its scope, after a series of highly-controversial attempts to bring cases against serving world leaders, including the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. But a number of cases that had already begun were allowed to continue, including the case against Habré. 

The government of Senegal recently detained Habré to prevent him from fleeing, following pressure from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. Belgium has now issued an extradition request.

A &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; health expert who is co-ordinating the response to the recent south-east Asian &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; outbreak, has warned that the disease could kill 'up to 150 million' people in the near future.

&lt;a href="w%3ADr%20David%20Nabarro"&gt;Dr David Nabarro&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that a new outbreak of bird flu was possible, with migratory birds carrying the disease to Africa or the Middle East where the human death toll "could be anything between 5m and 150m".

"The consequences in terms of human life when the pandemic does start are going to be extraordinary and very damaging."

Bird flu &amp;mdash; also known as avian influenza &amp;mdash; is a type of influenza virulent in birds. It was first identified in &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; in the early &lt;a href="w%3A1900s"&gt;1900s&lt;/a&gt; and is now known to exist worldwide. It was not known to affect humans until the first recorded case in &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1997"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;.

Bird flu has spread rapidly through poultry and wild birds in Asia since &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;, killing huge numbers of birds and more than 60 humans.

"It's like a combination of &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV/Aids&lt;/a&gt; 10 times faster than it's running at the moment," Dr Nabarro said.

In contrast to the shock-factor of Dr Nabarro's comments, the U.N. has distanced themselves from his remarks. The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s official estimate for the death toll in the event of a mutation of the H5N1 virus is between 2 and 7.4 million. WHO influenza spokesman, Dick Thompson, implied that Dr Nabarro would be taken to task over his remarks, stating, "I don't think you will hear Dr Nabarro say the same sort of thing again."

&lt;a href="w%3AAlvin%20Hellerstein"&gt;Alvin K. Hellerstein&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; federal judge, has ordered the release of additional photos and video relating to the on-going &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; prison abuse case. The media, consisting of 74 photographs and 3 videos, were ordered for release on September 29, pending a 20 day opportunity for appeal. The &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; filed a &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act%20Request"&gt;Freedom of Information Act Request&lt;/a&gt; in a motion to release the photos.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt; has claimed that the ordered media might provoke terrorists organizations into harming more American soldiers and citizens abroad. U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein strongly disagreed, saying that suppressing the pictures amounts to submitting to &lt;a href="w%3Ablackmail"&gt;blackmail&lt;/a&gt;. In a statement, Hellerstein said: "♡❤Our nation &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; does not surrender to blackmail, and fear of blackmail is not a legally sufficient argument to prevent us from performing a statutory command.♡❤"

&lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt; has formally acknowledged that the screens on some of its new &lt;a href="w%3AIPod%20nano"&gt;iPod nano&lt;/a&gt; units are prone to scratching and cracking. The company has agreed to replace units with a cracked screen free of charge. 

Several customers found that the screens of their brand new iPod nano MP3 players were cracking and scratching easily. According to Tyler Hall the creator of http://www.nanoscratch.com, his iPod nano was scratched within 30 minutes of use in the pocket of his shirt. He posted his concerns to the Apple support forums, but his post was deleted. He created www.nanoscratch.com to allow other users to post comments on the iPod’s “scratchability” and post photos of scratched iPods. 

"This is a real but minor issue that involved a vendor quality problem in a small number of units," said Apple spokesperson Tom Neumayr. Apple estimates that these issues affected less then 0.01% of the total iPod Nanos shipped.

In most individual cases Apple has been telling customers that the scratches and cracks were covered under warranty. Standard warranties on most electronic products do not normally cover cosmetic damage such as scratches or accidental damage such as cracks. Users with a cracked screen can now contact Apple for a free replacement.

Wild &lt;a href="w%3Agorillas"&gt;gorillas&lt;/a&gt; were seen using tools, researchers for the U.S. based &lt;a href="w%3AWildlife%20Conservation%20Society"&gt;Wildlife Conservation Society&lt;/a&gt; (WCS) said.

Images show one female gorilla apparently using sticks to test the depth of water, another female made a bridge with a stump detached from a bush to help her cross muddy ground, and a female using a stump from a bush as support as she dug for herbs.

Thomas Breuer, of the WCS operating in the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, called the discovery "truly astounding" and added that it was "quite surprising to me and my team to make this observation". Only wild &lt;a href="w%3Achimps"&gt;chimps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aorangutans"&gt;orangutans&lt;/a&gt;, and captive gorillas were previously known to use tools, meaning that now all of the four &lt;a href="w%3Agreat%20ape"&gt;great apes&lt;/a&gt; were oberserved using tools, suggesting that the usage of tools might predate the evolution of modern humans. 

But, tool usage seems to be infrequent among wild gorillas. They were observed for some ten years in the Mbeli Bai area before this discovery was made.

Nevertheless, Breuer is fascinated by what he calls a "similarity" between humans and gorillas: "If you or me want to cross a swamp, we use the same solutions as gorillas."

Gorillas are an endangered species; they appear on the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20List"&gt;Red List&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AIUCN"&gt;IUCN&lt;/a&gt;.

New Zealand has relaxed the safety rules imposed on internal airlines in 2002, once more allowing passengers to carry pocket knives with blades less than 60mm long and knitting needles.

Other larger items remain banned, including ice-skates, pool cues, hockey sticks, skateboards, cricket bats and harpoons.

Other countries more at risk from terrorism such as the United States of America and Australia will maintain their stricter rules and continue to ban a range of small, sharp objects from their internal flights.

The airlines have also agreed to help return items seized from passengers before boarding.

Several explosions hit popular tourist destination areas in &lt;a href="w%3AKuta"&gt;Kuta Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; early today, killing at least 19 people and injuring 100 others. Between 11:50 and 12:00 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;, three explosions hit the Kuta Square and &lt;a href="w%3AJimbaran"&gt;Jimbaran Beach&lt;/a&gt;, two popular Western tourist areas in &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;.

The Indonesian national news agency, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.antara.co.id/en/"&gt;ANTARA&lt;/a&gt;, reported that the first two explosions occurred at 6:50 p.m. local time, near a Jimbaran food court and the third blast at 7:00 p.m. in Kuta Town Square. Other reports claim that the blasts occurred at around 7:15 p.m. The two major blasts are thought to have struck a crowded main square at central &lt;a href="w%3AKuta"&gt;Kuta&lt;/a&gt;, and the other in a cafe on &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Jimbaran&lt;/a&gt; beach, near the &lt;a href="w%3AFour%20Seasons%20Hotel"&gt;Four Seasons Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, areas which are generally popular with Western tourists. At this time, it is not clear how many explosions were involved; however, 4 blasts have been reported. 

The bombings occurred just two days before the start of the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; holy month of &lt;a href="w%3ARamadan"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt; and 11 days before the third anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Bali%20bombing"&gt;2002 Bali bombing&lt;/a&gt;.

The British Education Secretary, &lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Kelly"&gt;Ruth Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, announced during the week that junk food is to be banned from schools in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; from September 1st 2006. Items such as crisps, sweets, chocolate bars and chewing gum are expected to be among the items banned.

Junk foods are classified as those high in fat, salt or sugar. Recently the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20government"&gt;British government&lt;/a&gt; committed £280m to improving school food over the next three years. That followed a campaign by celebrity chef, &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Oliver"&gt;Jamie Oliver&lt;/a&gt;, to improve school food.

The action by the British government to ban junk food has already sparked debate in Ireland whether they should follow suit.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=%26quot%3BJunk%26quot%3B%20foods%20may%20affect%20aggressive%20behaviour%20and%20school%20performance&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Dr. Stephen Schoenthaler, a Professor of Criminal Justice at the California State University in Stanislaus, has long argued that there is a link between a healthy diet and decreased aggressive behaviour, as well as with increased IQ and school performance.

Dr. Schoenthaler is well-known for a youth detention center study where violations of house rules fell by 37% when vending machines were removed and the cafeteria replaced canned food by fresh alternatives. He summarizes his findings by saying that “Having a bad diet right now is a better predictor of future violence than past violent behaviour.” In a very large test, Schoenthaler directed a study in meals at 803 New York City schools, in low-income neighbourhoods, finding that the number of students passing final exams increased by 16%.

Critics have questioned some of Dr. Schoenthaler findings, due to the lack of placebo control groups. However, more recent work by Dr. Bernard Gesch, a physiologist at the University of Oxford, has placed some of the work on a more scientific footing. Dr. Gesch found that nutrition supplements produced a 26% drop in violations of prison rules over a placebo, and a 37% decrease in violent offences. The Netherlands has embarked on a wider scale dietary research program in 14 prisons.

The short term behaviour consequences of ingesting sugar are well understood: an initial burst on energy, followed a sugar low in which your body produces adrenalin, which makes you irritable and explosive. However, Schoenthaler and Gesch suggest that there are long term impacts over and above the short term consequences of blood sugar variations.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Minimum%20wage%20in%20United%20Kingdom%20increases%20to%20%C2%A35.05&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

From Saturday, the &lt;a href="w%3Aminimum%20wage"&gt;minimum wage&lt;/a&gt; (in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;) will be increased to £5.05 (approximately $8.94 USD) which will affect more than a million workers. People aged between 18 and 21 will have a 15p increase to £4.25. Over 21s will be able to get at least £5.05 an hour, up from £4.85.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ALow%20Pay%20Commission"&gt;Low Pay Commission&lt;/a&gt; the number of jobs had grown since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999 and so a further increase was necessary. "The increase will see well over a million low-paid workers with more cash in their pockets, many of them women working part-time," &lt;a href="w%3ABrendan%20Barber"&gt;Brendan Barber&lt;/a&gt;, TUC general secretary, said. "But, as ever, with each minimum wage increase comes the predictable wave of protests from business saying that it cannot afford another rise."

Further increases are expected to happen sometime in the future. In October 2006 the government said an increase for adults should be put to £5.35 and £4.45 for 18-21 year olds. This would have a "serious impact" according to &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Digby%20Jones"&gt;Sir Digby Jones&lt;/a&gt;. "The UK is already edging towards the top of &lt;a href="w%3Aminimum%20wage%23Worldwide%20minimum%20wages"&gt;the international minimum wage league table&lt;/a&gt;."

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Tropical Prediction Center has upgraded &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Depression"&gt;Tropical Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Twenty to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Storm"&gt;Tropical Storm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; status. The storm, now officially &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATropical%20Storm%20Stan"&gt;Tropical Storm Stan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is the 18th named storm of the 2005 hurricane season. The storm currently has maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour. Stan is located 50 miles SSE of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AProgreso%2C%20Yucat%C3%A1n"&gt;Progreso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and is currently tracking WNW at 12 miles per hour.

The storm is expected to weaken as it crosses the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYucatan%20Peninsula"&gt;Yucatan Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , then strengthen again when it encounters the warm waters of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Current projections show that by 1:00 pm Tuesday, October 4, it may reach Hurricane strength before making landfall on the central portion of the Mexican coast.

All individuals who may be impacted by this storm are urged to track its progress as it develops over the next few days.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARecording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Recording Industry Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (RIAA) has filed 757 lawsuits against people who they alleged illegally shared music online. The vast majority of the lawsuits, 693, are against people who used peer-to-peer file-sharing networks such as and &lt;a href="w%3ALimeWire"&gt;LimeWire&lt;/a&gt; to exchange music files. Of the remaining lawsuits, 64 are against students at 17 different universities who used the &lt;a href="w%3AAbilene%20Network"&gt;Abilene Network&lt;/a&gt; and a peer-to-peer file sharing program called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Ai2hub"&gt;i2hub&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

The ♡❤i2hub♡❤ program is designed for use in sharing files over the Abilene Network. The Abilene Network is a high speed network in use by 207 U.S. universities. It was designed by &lt;a href="w%3AInternet2"&gt;Internet2&lt;/a&gt; to provide a high speed alternative for researchers and other educators to share information. The Abilene Network allows for very high speed connections, many times faster than DSL or Cable connections. The RIAA became a corporate member of Internet2 two weeks ago.

Over the past two years, the RIAA has filed more than 14,800 lawsuits against people accused of illegally sharing music online. Over 3,400 of these cases were settled for an average of between $4,000 to $5,000 each. Almost 500 of these lawsuits were against students using the Internet2 network.

<h1>Santa Ana Volcano Erupts in El Salvador</h1>

The morning of Saturday the 1st was a tragic one for &lt;a href="w%3AEl%20Salvador"&gt;El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Ana%20Volcano"&gt;Santa Ana Volcano&lt;/a&gt;, the largest and most active volcano in the country began an eruptive phase.

At 8:25 a.m. Santa Ana Volcano's view from Coatepeque Lake changed as a huge flow of "hot mud" flowed from the crater towards the lake. The road that was designed as an evacuation route from that sector of the volcano was blocked completely and the inhabitants of the area had to be evacuated by helicopters.

Minutes after the flow of hot mud was visible from Lake Coatepeque, a huge cloud of ash appeared, which reached an altitude of 50,000 feet, then covering the northwestern part of the country which contains the largest concentration of coffee farms (main export). The local authorities expect that this layer of ash burns the coffee plants of the affected area, decreasing the coffee production of the region considerably. 

Along with the ash cloud, a large amount of hot rocks (some reaching three feet in diameter) flew on all directions, damaging roads, homes and vegetation. According to the people living in the surroundings of the volcano, the rocks were released due to the huge amount of pressure released when the ash cloud appeared. 

Authorities report the loss of two human lives due to this incident, the cause has not yet been revealed. To prevent the loss of more lives, the government decreed a red alert in a radius of four kilometres of the crater, but yet, some people resist the evacuation proposals due to fear of losing their belongings, as they have to leave their homes without any surveillance. In response to this, the army and the police agreed to patrol the areas evacuated in order to prevent robberies.

It is expected that this incident is only the beginning of a large eruptive process, which may result in a catastrophe for El Salvador.

Google Inc. formally submitted a bid to provide free wireless internet, or WiFi, in response to a request from Mayor Gavin Newsom's office. 

The company's goal is to ensure easy, reliable access to its search engine at all times. In another sign of its interest in Internet access, Google recently bought an undisclosed stake in a Maryland startup, the Current Communications Group, which is trying to provide high-speed connections through power lines.

One person is dead following an explosion that occurred outside a packed &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oklahoma"&gt;University of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20football"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; stadium Saturday night, where the school was hosting &lt;a href="w%3AKansas%20State%20University"&gt;Kansas State University&lt;/a&gt;. Authorities are calling the incident a suicide, but it is still under investigation.

The incident occurred shortly before halftime of the Kansas State - OU game. Those inside and outside the stadium heard a "boom," and others reported feeling the blast from blocks away. It occurred near locations of buses parked for the game, and classroom buildings of the university.

Those attending the game were initially told not to leave during halftime, and were later instructed by the public announcement system not to exit on the west and south ends of the stadium. Bomb searches were done in the parking complexes outside the stadium and neighboring accessways around the west side of the stadium. Authorities searched and located at least one other device in the vicinity, and the device was detonated without incident. Areas west of the Gaylord Memorial Stadium have been blocked from access by authorities.

OU President Boren said in a statement that "At no time was anyone in the stadium in danger," and that the incident is being investigated as an apparent individual suicide.

In the state of &lt;a href="w%3AConnecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; today, a law allowing &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20unions"&gt;civil unions&lt;/a&gt; for same-sex couples took effect. 

The law is unique; it allows civil unions for same-sex couples with full benefits of a regular &lt;a href="w%3Amarriage"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt;, while at the same time defining marriage as between a man and a woman. 

Heterosexual couples are not allowed to receive civil unions. The license application will be identical to one for a regular marriage, except "bride" and "groom" are replaced with "party 1" and "party 2."

The Connecticut civil unions law is the first gay marriage law to be passed voluntarily; lawsuits forced fellow New England states &lt;a href="w%3AVermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; to allow same-sex unions. Vermont has civil unions while &lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage%20in%20Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; allows actual &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;. Some localities have recognized same-sex couples in the form of a .

"This is a historic day. We're beyond ecstatic." said Randy Sharp, 46, of Plainville, who was applying for a license with his partner Jeff Blanchette, 44.

Not everyone is happy about the law. Already, opponents are lobbying for an amendment that will ban same-sex marriage. "Today was a sad day for our state. It was a sad day for our state's children." said Brian Brown, executive director of Family Institute of Connecticut. The group held a protest outside the Capitol which was attended by 50 people. Last year eleven states voted on Election Day to prohibit same-sex marriage.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CDU) of &lt;a href="Angela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; have won the by-election in &lt;a href="Dresden"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt; and gained one additional &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aoverhang%20seat"&gt;overhang seat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABundestag"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aby-election"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or bye-election is a special election held to fill a political office that has become vacant between general elections. 

The CDU candidate Andreas Lämmel received 37.0% of the first votes, his &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Social Democratic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; contender Marlies Volkmer won 32.1% and the candidate of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeft%20Party%20%28Germany%29"&gt;The Left&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Katja Kipping, earned 19.2%. 

The SPD performed better at the second election, winning 27.9%, followed by the CDU with 24.4%, the Left with 19.7%, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Free Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with 16.6%, and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%2090/The%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with 7.1%.

The CDU had actually urged supporters not to vote for them with their second vote because of a bug in Germany's voting system too many votes would have caused them to lose a seat.

Nevertheless, the by-election caused the shifting of one seat to another state. Cajus Julius Caesar (sic!), of the CDU in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Rhine-Westphalia"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lost his seat to Anette Hübinger, also of the CDU but from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaarland"&gt;Saarland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Warren and Marshall will equally share a US$1.3 million cash prize award for discovering "the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease." &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ulcer_bacteria_researchers_awarded_2005_Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine%23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Dr Marshall cultivated the previously unknown bacterial species &lt;a href="w%3AHelicobacter%20pylori"&gt;H. pylori&lt;/a&gt; from a study of biopsies from 100 ulcer patients, firmly establishing that gastric disorders are infectious diseases. Before their discovery, peptic ulcer was attributed to stress and lifestyle. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4304290.stm%23"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

The Nobel Committee has awarded the Nobel Prize in the category 'Physiology or Medicine' since 1901, when &lt;a href="w%3AEmil%20Adolf%20von%20Behring"&gt;Emil Adolf von Behring&lt;/a&gt; won for developing a treatment for &lt;a href="w%3Adiphtheria"&gt;diphtheria&lt;/a&gt;.

The announcement begins a week of Nobel announcements. The &lt;a href="Physics"&gt;Physics&lt;/a&gt; and Chemistry awards will be announced Tuesday and Wednesday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday.

Two people were killed and 40 others injured in a series of bombings at courts in three districts of Dhaka, Bangladesh today, in an apparent repeat of the nationwide August 17 bombings (in which 
3 people were killed and 150 injured), according to police.

One person was killed and five others were injured when a youth hurled a bomb concealed in a book at a court in central Chandpur district. The injured included court officials. In another attack in Luxmipur district, one person was killed and 30 others injured when two youths hurled bombs at a court there, police said. In the third incident, bombs were exploded in three places in southeastern port city of Chittagong injuring at least five others.

An unexploded bomb was found in Mymensingh district, television reports said.

State Minister for Home Affairs Lutfuzzaman Babor was unfazed. "We were prepared and we will face these very confidently," he told reporters "Some arrests were made as we were prepared".

Yesterday, two people were killed and three others were injured in a bomb attack at a tea stall in western Satkhira district.

According to reports, a leaflet was found at the site warning against keeping shops open during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan starting this week.

The Government has arrested dozens of members of the banned Jamatul Mujahedeen Bangladesh (JMB) since then.

&lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; announced yesterday that the next version of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Office"&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , currently code-named "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOffice%2012"&gt;Office 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ", will support &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APDF"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; format exportation. Microsoft Senior Vice President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Sinofsky"&gt;Steven Sinofsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said Microsoft receives 120,000 requests monthly to save documents created in Office as PDF files.

PDF is a file format created by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdobe%20Systems"&gt;Adobe Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that ensures files appear similarly on any computer operating system. PDF is an open standard, and programs can read and write PDFs &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aroyalties"&gt;royalty-free&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Adobe distributes software at no cost to read PDF files on many platforms. Many &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; readers are also available.

There are many ways to create PDFs from Office documents. Users can purchase &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAdobe%20Acrobat"&gt;Adobe Acrobat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Standard (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3AMSRP%23English"&gt;MSRP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;299.00), and can already export any Microsoft Office document to PDFs using the free Office Suite &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; software. They can also use one of the many free programs that act as print drivers such as the open source &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APDFCreator"&gt;PDFCreator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Adobe also offers a somewhat slower, but free online PDF converter on their website. While such options have long been available, the high cost, moderate difficulty and lack of awareness has discouraged PDF use in most daily exchanges of Office created documents.

Because Microsoft has no plans to create a PDF importer, it will be impossible for the Office PDF export functionality to fulfill &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;' recent requirements &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20format"&gt;Open Standards drive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for official, state created documents.

The first, or beta version, of Office 12 is expected in November.

&lt;a href="w%3ARoy%20J.%20Glauber"&gt;Roy J. Glauber&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt;) won half of this year's Physics &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20L.%20Hall"&gt;John L. Hall&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Colorado"&gt;University of Colorado&lt;/a&gt; and National Institute of Standards and Technology) and &lt;a href="w%3ATheodor%20W.%20H%C3%A4nsch"&gt;Theodor W. Hänsch&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AMax-Planck-Institut"&gt;Max-Planck-Institut&lt;/a&gt; für Quantenoptik, &lt;a href="w%3AGarching%20bei%20M%C3%BCnchen"&gt;Garching&lt;/a&gt;) each receive a quarter of the prize.

Glauber clarified the quantum nature of light. He showed how light composed of discrete quantum particles (photons) can be reconciled with the wave-like behavior of light. His theoretical work laid the foundations of &lt;a href="w%3Aquantum%20optics"&gt;quantum optics&lt;/a&gt;.

Hall and Hänsch developed methods to measure the frequency of light to extreme precisions. Their findings "have made it possible to measure frequencies with an accuracy of 15 digits," for use in highly accurate clocks and new technology for global positioning systems.

The recipients will share a 10,000,000 kronor prize (1.5 Million USD), with Glauber receiving half and Hall and Hänsch each receiving a quarter of the total.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; cable TV operator &lt;a href="w%3ANTL"&gt;NTL&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to buy &lt;a href="w%3ATelewest%20Broadband"&gt;Telewest Broadband&lt;/a&gt; for $6 billion USD (3.4 billion pounds). NTL’s and Telewest’s service territories do currently overlap. The acquisition is expected to save the companies 1.5 billion pounds.

NTL has agreed to pay $23.93 for each Telewest share, in cash and NTL stock. Current Telewest shareholders will own approximately 25 percent of the combined company. While both companies operate exclusively in the UK, they are listed in New York on the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ANASDAQ"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/a&gt; exchange. 

Once the acquisition is complete, the combined company will have 5 million customers in the UK . Competitor &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Sky%20Broadcasting"&gt;British Sky Broadcasting&lt;/a&gt; (BSkyB) has almost 8 million. The combined company will also be the second-largest residential telephone company in Britain behind &lt;a href="w%3ABT%20Group%20plc"&gt;BT Group plc&lt;/a&gt;.

If the deal is approved, regulators and both companies shareholders' should close in the first quarter of 2006.

&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; yesterday released a detailed study of attacks on civilians by members of the Iraqi insurgency. The 140-page report, "A Face And A Name: &lt;a href="w%3ACivilian"&gt;Civilian&lt;/a&gt; Victims of Insurgent Groups in Iraq" claims to be the most comprehensive account yet produced of abuses by the Iraqi &lt;a href="w%3Aarmed%20opposition"&gt;armed opposition&lt;/a&gt;. In the report, Human Rights Watch (HRW) also analyses and challenges a number of arguments put forward by insurgent leaders attempting to justify their attacks on civilians. HRW argues that all such attacks are illegal under &lt;a href="w%3Ainternational%20law"&gt;international law&lt;/a&gt;, and violate the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Convention"&gt;Geneva Convention&lt;/a&gt;. 

"There are no justifications for targeting civilians, in Iraq or anywhere else", said an HRW spokesperson, calling on the insurgents to "respect the &lt;a href="w%3Alaws%20of%20war"&gt;laws of war&lt;/a&gt;".

While Human Rights Watch has been vocal in condemning abuses by &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; - they stress that these can never be used to excuse attacks on civilians by the insurgency. 

According to Human Rights Watch, people in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt; are being increasingly "repulsed" by the abuses of the insurgents, whether or not they support the US-led &lt;a href="w%3Aoccupation%20of%20Iraq"&gt;occupation of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The organisation is now calling on figures of influence in Iraq - particularly religious leaders, to condemn the abuses publicly.

Changing conditions have brought moderate east winds to the &lt;a href="w%3AHouston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AGalveston"&gt;Galveston&lt;/a&gt; area, raising &lt;a href="w%3Atide"&gt;tide&lt;/a&gt; levels across western shores of &lt;a href="w%3AGalveston%20Bay"&gt;Galveston Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Wind-inflated tides combined with regular high tides are resulting in maximum waters as much as four and a half feet above normal levels. Erosion due to &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Rita"&gt;Hurricane Rita&lt;/a&gt; has lowered some areas, especially &lt;a href="w%3Asand%20dunes"&gt;sand dunes&lt;/a&gt;, giving an appearance of even higher tides.

The cold front expected to pass the area on Thursday will bring an end to the east winds and tide levels should return to normal.

Reliant Energy is expected to raise rates to effect a 14% increase on a 1,000 &lt;a href="w%3Akilowatt-hour"&gt;kilowatt-hour&lt;/a&gt; bill. A typical customer could see an increase up to $20 per month. Reliant has reached an agreement with the Texas Public Utilities Commission to raise rates in two steps, once at the end of October, and again on 1 January 2006.

CenterPoint Energy must increase charges for services such as meter-reading and customer service. The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.puc.state.tx.us/"&gt;Texas Public Utilities Commission&lt;/a&gt; prohibits &lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; companies from buying wholesale product, raising rates, and reselling. Wholesale prices of natural gas also continue to rise due to increased demand and declining domestic supply. Natural gas cannot be easily shipped to other regions like oil.

Consumer energy prices are expected to rise across the state, in some cases as much as 20%.

The Texas Public Utilities Commission must approve rate increases before they go into effect, but approval is expected.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; announced it does not agree with the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; officials' proposal to share more of the control of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. U.S. Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs Ambassador &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Gross"&gt;David Gross&lt;/a&gt; said, "We will not agree to the U.N. taking over the management of the Internet." Mr. Gross is coordinator for international communications and information policy at the U.S. Department of State and said further, "Some countries want that. We think that's unacceptable. No intergovernmental body should control the Internet, whether it's the U.N. or any other." 

E.U. spokesman Martin Selmay said, "We are looking for a new cooperation model; a model that allows Internet governance and the laying down of public policy principles in coordination by all countries which are interested in the governance of the Internet, because the Internet is a global resource."

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Corporation%20for%20Assigned%20Names%20and%20Numbers"&gt;Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers&lt;/a&gt; (ICANN), a non-profit organization responsible for the assignment of domain names and Internet Protocol addresses, currently controls the root zone files for the Internet. They are overseen by the U.S. Commerce Department, which granted them the original contract to oversee those tasks. 

Many nations have expressed displeasure at the U.S. having sole control of the Internet and suggest such control should be given to an intergovernmental body, such as the U.N. Other proposals include limiting ICANN to a technical role and establishing a new external organization to handle policy issues. 

The issue is scheduled to be discussed in November at the U.N. &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Summit%20on%20the%20Information%20Society"&gt;World Summit on the Information Society&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATunis"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;, Tunisia.

Within one month of the &lt;a href="w%3AiPod%20nano"&gt;iPod nano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMoto%20ROKR"&gt;iTunes phone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Apple%20unveils%20iPod%20nano"&gt;special event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt; announced today another special event to be held on October 12. It is to be held at the California Theater in downtown &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose, California&lt;/a&gt;.

The invitation reads, "One more thing...", the teasing tagline of &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;. The words were atop a picture of closed &lt;a href="w%3Atheater%20curtains"&gt;theater curtains&lt;/a&gt;.

This has increased rumors of a video iPod(vPod) along with this event. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.appleinsider.com"&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/a&gt; is claiming that there are sources that have ♡❤seen♡❤ the new &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside this rumor, AppleInsider claims to have seen a wireless device similar to Apple's &lt;a href="w%3AAirport%20Express"&gt;Airport Express&lt;/a&gt; that supports video.

Other rumors for this event include a major &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes%20Music%20Store"&gt;iTunes Music Store&lt;/a&gt; update and a &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS%20X"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="w%3AIntel"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; processor.

President Bush has asked Congress to discuss the option of allowing him to deploy military resources if &lt;a href="w%3Aavian%20flu"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt; breaks out in America.

"I'm concerned about what an avian flu outbreak could mean for the United States and the world," said the president in a conference today. The president also expressed concern that local response would be slow, given the precedent provided by the recent gulf coast hurricane disasters, the aftermath of which has triggered widespread criticism for what many view as instances of long-delayed and inadequate delivery on the part of the white house and congress. "I want there to be a robust discussion about the best way for the federal government, in certain extreme circumstances, to be able to rally assets for the good of the people," the President said previously.

Avian flu is not currently able to easily pass from human to human, limiting epidemics. The president and others warn that the virus may mutate into a form that more easily spreads through social contact.

Sun and Google agreed to explore opportunities to promote and develop Sun technologies. Despite being a clear announcement, the exact effects of this deal are not yet known.

During a thunderstorm tonight, lightning set fire to a former home of &lt;a href="w%3AF.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald"&gt;F. Scott Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota"&gt;St. Paul, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;.

Fire fighters were working to extinguish the smoky fire, which seemed to be limited to the steeple. Video images suggest the building is the 599 Summit Avenue residence where Fitzgerald wrote ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThis%20Side%20of%20Paradise%20%28novel%29"&gt;This Side of Paradise&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

Former &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; Majority Leader &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt; indicted by a grand jury on two new charges of money laundering during the &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aredistricting%20warrant"&gt;redistricting warrant&lt;/a&gt; controversy, on Monday, following his indictment by a separate grand jury on criminal conspiracy charges last week. Craig McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice, said that "for a new grand jury to indict DeLay on a day's notice suggests the evidence of his participation is convincing." DeLay dismissed the charges as partisan, though the veteran prosecutor in the case has indicted three times as many Democrats as Republicans in his career. DeLay faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

A dock worker on the &lt;a href="w%3APanama"&gt;Panamanian&lt;/a&gt; cargo vessel Ma Altair was killed when a cable snapped and threw him through the air. Witnesses say that the 54 year old worker was struck on his right side by a 1-1/2 inch cable being used to unload steel products. 

Authorities were notified at 8:10 am CDT (1310 UTC). The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.

Snapped cables are a significant occupational hazard, capable of maiming and dismembering people nearby. Equipment struck by cables snapping under load is often destroyed.

A cool front is expected to move into &lt;a href="w%3ATexas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; Thursday night, bringing an end to the recent record high temperatures. Temperatures are expected to fall to the low 60s across the area, and may reach the lower 50s for inland areas. 

There is some speculation that the low pressure area associated with the front may draw a yet-to-be-formed tropical storm in from the gulf with little to no warning, as happened with &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Alicia"&gt;Hurricane Alicia&lt;/a&gt; in 1983. Experts say there is no specific reason to believe this will happen, but plan to monitor the situation.

For the first time, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Mint"&gt;United States Mint&lt;/a&gt; will feature a president facing forward on a coin. President &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Jefferson"&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/a&gt; will face forward on the 2006-dated five cent coin. This image is based on an 1800 painting of the president by Rembrandt Peale. This design is referred to by the mint as the "Jefferson 1800".

"The changing images in the Westward Journey Nickel Series™ lead us back to Thomas Jefferson, who envisioned the Louisiana Purchase and Lewis and Clark expedition as a way to move the Nation forward. The image of a forward-looking Jefferson is a fitting tribute to that vision," said United States Mint Acting Director David A. Lebryk.

United States Mint Artistic Infusion Program artist Jamie Franki, of &lt;a href="w%3AConcord%2C%20NC"&gt;Concord, NC&lt;/a&gt;, designed the obverse. It will be sculpted by Donna Weaver, and will feature the word "Liberty" in Jefferson's handwriting. The reverse will feature &lt;a href="w%3AMonticello"&gt;Monticello&lt;/a&gt;, designed by Felix Schlag, and restored from original work by John Mercanti.

US scientists have recreated the flu virus from the &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20flu"&gt;1918 flu&lt;/a&gt; (aka 'Spanish Flu') via &lt;a href="w%3Areverse%20genetics"&gt;reverse genetics&lt;/a&gt; from lung tissue samples of persons who died from the &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The flu was resurrected and injected into mice, according to Terrence Tumpey of the US &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, "to understand the biological properties that made the 1918 virus so exceptionally deadly."

Disturbingly, the scientists have found genetic mutations and markers that are similar to those in flu viruses found in birds. This has raised concerns that the so-called "&lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;Asian bird flu&lt;/a&gt;" could spread to humans, becoming the next global flu pandemic.

&lt;a href="w%3ACitizens%20for%20Responsibility%20and%20Ethics%20in%20Washington"&gt;Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington&lt;/a&gt; (CREW) &lt;a href="http%3A//www.citizensforethics.org/index.php"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a U.S. legislative watchdog group, has released a report attempting to document the unethical and illegal activities of who they are calling the "most tainted members of &lt;a href="U.S.%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;". In describing the reasons for the report &lt;a href="http%3A//www.citizensforethics.org/about/whoweare.php"&gt;Melanie Sloan&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of CREW said, "[CREW] was compelled to research and release a report on these corrupt members because the ethics committees in both the &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; are completely inert. The report calls for the House and Senate to act to investigate and take appropriate action against them for these violations of the rules." She went on to attack both parties regarding ethics, "&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; are just as much to blame as &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; for the current ethics deadlock. The Democrats won't file ethics complaints against even the most egregious violators like &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;DeLay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Ney"&gt;Ney&lt;/a&gt;…. The Democrats are spineless." 

The report covers possible violations of federal laws, as well as congressional ethics rules. To compile the report, CREW drew upon &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Election%20Commission"&gt;Federal Election Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FEC) reports and audits, sworn testimony, emails, and personal financial and travel disclosure forms. By analyzing that information, CREW then attempted to determine if the member's activities violated federal laws, regulations, or congressional ethics rules. The 13 members of Congress covered are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Sen. &lt;a href="w%3AConrad%20Burns"&gt;Conrad Burns&lt;/a&gt; (R-MT)
BULLET::::- Sen. &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt; (R-TN, Senate Majority leader),

</ul>
The report is entitled "Beyond DeLay: The 13 Most Corrupt Members of Congress", seeking to capitalize on the current media attention on ethics that has come about due to the indictments of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. However, the report does not cover any of Tom Delay's ethics problems, nor does it have any &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tom_DeLay_faces_two_new_indictments_for_money_laundering"&gt;information on his current legal problems&lt;/a&gt;.

The report was criticized by the office of Rick Renzi, one of the congressmen listed, arguing that CREW are biased and pursuing a political agenda. "This group is run by one of the biggest Democratic Party donors in the nation and is a mouthpiece for its fierce political attacks," said Renzi's office in a statement. "The group's biased accusations show the campaign season is starting early."

Representative Burns, also one of the representatives named in the report, responded through spokesman James Pendleton calling CREW's report "pure politics." The press secretary for Representative Bob Ney, also named in the CREW report, said, "We don't give Melanie Sloan and her liberal organization an ounce of credibility." 

Both Members of the House whose residences have been searched as part of a criminal investigation, Cunningham and Jefferson, are included on the list. Burns, Ney, and Feeney are cited for their dealings with lobbyist &lt;a href="Jack%20Abramoff"&gt;Jack Abramoff&lt;/a&gt;. 11 out of the 13 named representatives are Republicans.

California-based &lt;a href="w%3AAutodesk"&gt;Autodesk&lt;/a&gt; Inc. announced yesterday that they plan to acquire Toronto-based &lt;a href="w%3AAlias%20Systems%20Corporation"&gt;Alias&lt;/a&gt; for $182 million in cash. The acquisition is expected to be completed within six months. “Alias’ technology spans several of our most important markets and augments the synergy between our design and media business,” said Carl Bass, &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20operating%20officer"&gt;COO&lt;/a&gt; of Autodesk.

Autodesk is the creator of one of the top computer aided design programs; &lt;a href="w%3AAutoCAD"&gt;AutoCAD&lt;/a&gt;, which is used by many engineers and architects for design activities including drafting. Autodesk’s software is used by over 6 million people. They are the 5th largest &lt;a href="w%3APersonal%20computer"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt; software company in the world. They employ approximately 3,500 people. In the past fiscal year they earned $1.2 billion.

Alias produces &lt;a href="w%3A3D%20graphics"&gt;3D graphics&lt;/a&gt; software used in the creation of special effects, video games, industrial, and automotive design. They were founded in 1983 under the name Alias Research. They merged with Wavefront Technologies under SGI in 1995 and changed its name to Alias in July 2003. In June, 2004 they were spun off from &lt;a href="w%3ASilicon%20Graphics"&gt;Silicon Graphics&lt;/a&gt; Inc. and acquired by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.accel-kkr.com/"&gt;Accel-KKR&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Teachers%27%20Pension%20Plan"&gt;Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan&lt;/a&gt;. In the 2005 fiscal year they earned $83 million in revenue. They currently employ approximately 600 people. Alias customers include &lt;a href="w%3ADreamWorks"&gt;DreamWorks&lt;/a&gt; SKG, &lt;a href="w%3APixar"&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndustrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic"&gt;Industrial Light &amp; Magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABMW"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;. According to Alias, their software has been used in nearly every film nominated for an &lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences"&gt;Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; award in the Best Visual Effects and Best Animated Feature Films categories.

Scientists report that &lt;a href="w%3Aalligator"&gt;alligators&lt;/a&gt; might not be as effective as hoped in controlling the &lt;a href="w%3Aburmese%20python"&gt;burmese python&lt;/a&gt; population in the Florida &lt;a href="w%3AEverglades"&gt;Everglades&lt;/a&gt;. A six foot alligator was found with its rear half hanging from the belly of a 13-foot python last week. Because of injuries on the alligator's body, Frank Mazotti, a University of Florida wildlife professor, believes that the gator was injured but alive when the python attacked.

"Encounters like that are almost never seen in the wild. ... And here we are, it's happened for the fourth time," Mazzotti said. These remains were discovered September 26 by pilot and researcher Michael Barron. 

The non-native pythons are often released by individuals who are ill-equipped to care for the pet when it has grown more than expected. Iguanas present similar problems. The invading species often consume natives like the alligator, or tropical flowers, in the case of the iguanas.

While some have expressed concern that children are in danger from these pythons, Joe Wasilewski, a wildlife biologist and crocodile tracker, says it's not a great issue. "I don't think this is an imminent threat. This is not a 'Be afraid, be very afraid' situation."

John Buhman of the City council is accused of racism by counselwoman Dee Wright. She says his use of the word "tarbaby" is derogatory and is calling for his resignation.

Buhman states that the word is used to refer to a business deal that is a sticky situation, and invited others to check a dictionary. The council will vote on the need to involve an ethics review board.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary%3Fbook%3DDictionary%26amp%3Bva%3Dtarbaby"&gt;Merriam-Webster Online&lt;/a&gt; lists the sole definition of "tarbaby" as "something from which it is nearly impossible to extricate oneself".

Although there are many &lt;a href="w%3Aopen%20source%20software"&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; games in development, few development teams have the motivation and expertise needed to mature their game from beta status, indicated by version numbers less than one (0.6, 0.7, etc...), to "1.0". This remarkable milestone was accomplished recently by the developers of the computer game &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20for%20Wesnoth"&gt;Battle for Wesnoth&lt;/a&gt;. Wesnoth is a turn based strategy game set in a fantasy environment reminiscent of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings literature, featuring unit types like Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and even tree people.

Development of the game began over two years ago when creator David White released the first development version, 0.1, on June 18, 2003. All code and contents of the game were released under the &lt;a href="w%3AGNU%20General%20Public%20License"&gt;GNU GPL&lt;/a&gt; license, and all versions were distributed freely over the internet. The game was also packaged for various &lt;a href="w%3ALinux%20distribution"&gt;GNU/Linux distributions&lt;/a&gt; such as Debian and many others. Wesnoth's ability to run on Unix and Linux, Mac OSX and &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Windows systems and solid playability earned it popularity among the open source community. The game drew not only players, but also programmers, artists, and campaign writers; developers who create stories and scenarios using the mechanics and art of the core Wesnoth engine. The quick pace of development and early popularity considerably increased the number of people working on the game in their free time and allowed it to reach a quality and completeness not often seen in GPL games.

"1.0" contains several campaigns of varying length, in which you play alone against computer opponents. Wesnoth also offers various multiplayer modes, from a hot-seat mode for multiple players on one computer, to an online lobby where you can play games with players from all over the world. In this case, multiple players can either play in teams against others, or join a team against the computer opponent.

There is also a campaign server accessible from inside the game where players can download many additional user created campaigns, maps, and even units. Almost all aspects of the game are scriptable using an HTML-like language which allows users to easily create their own content and contribute it to the campaign server.

Twenty elderly people were killed Sunday when a boat capsized on &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20George"&gt;Lake George&lt;/a&gt; in upstate &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20%28state%29"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEthan%20Allen%20boating%20accident"&gt;Ethan Allen&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was filled with touring passengers from the &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit"&gt;Detroit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; area, all of whom were on a pleasure cruise to see fall foliage in the &lt;a href="w%3AAdirondack%20Mountains"&gt;Adirondack Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. All the passengers aboard were reported to have not worn life preservers.

Investigators speculate that the ♡❤Ethan Allen♡❤ capsized when it steered into the wake of another tour boat, causing the former to turn sharply. The incident occurred at 3:00 PM EDT (2000 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) about 150 yards offshore at Cramer Point. Amongst those who survived was the captain, Richard Paris, 74, who was reportedly the only crew member aboard the boat.

The boat operator company's license has been temporarily revoked pending a urine analysis test for alcohol consumption 80 hours before the incident. All other boat licenses owned by the company are also being held.

&lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt; has been chosen to host the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2006, according to a press release by the country's government-funded broadcaster, &lt;a href="w%3ATeleviziunea%20Rom%C3%A2n%C4%83"&gt;TVR&lt;/a&gt;. According to the network, the Junior Eurovision will be held in &lt;a href="w%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt; in November 2006, where it will be organised in a venue with a capacity of more than 6,000 seats. Romania's successful bid has been confirmed by Svante Stockselius from the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Broadcasting%20Union"&gt;European Broadcasting Union&lt;/a&gt;.

The three countries shortlisted for the &lt;a href="w%3AJunior%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202006"&gt;Junior Eurovision 2006&lt;/a&gt; were Romania, Croatia, and the Netherlands. On October 4, however, it was announced that TVR had won the bidding process and the event would be held in Romania. The Junior Eurovision 2006 is the first Eurovision event to be held in Romania, and comes after Romania's best ever result in the &lt;a href="w%3AEurovision%20Song%20Contest%202005"&gt;Eurovision Song Contest 2005&lt;/a&gt;, where it was ranked third.

The event will be co-financed by TVR and the European Broadcasting Union, with approximately 3.4 million &lt;a href="w%3ARomanian%20leu"&gt;Romanian lei&lt;/a&gt; (€1 million) being funded by the EBU.

The Junior Eurovision Song Contest was founded in 2003 and is open to constentants from across Europe ranging from eight to fifteen years of age. The 2005 event will be held on November 26 in Hasselt, Belgium, and will be attended by contestants from 17 countries, including Romania.

The president of &lt;a href="w%3ARomania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20B%C4%83sescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;, announced today that he would call a referendum next year asking Romanians whether they approve the switch to a &lt;a href="w%3Aunicameralism"&gt;unicameral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Alegislature"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt;. 

Romania currently has a bicameral parliamentary structure, similar to the United Kingdom and United States, with a &lt;a href="w%3AChamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Romania"&gt;Chamber of Deputies&lt;/a&gt; as the lower house and a &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20of%20Romania"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; as the upper house. In the past month, however, President Băsescu has stated that he would like to see the replacement of the current system with a unicameral parliament, consisting of only one chamber, as well as a reduction in the overall number of parliamentarians. His reason is the functions of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are nearly identical in Romania, both being elected by the people every five years under the system of proportional representation. These reasons are similar to the ones used when converting the &lt;a href="w%3ANebraska%20Legislature"&gt;legislature of&lt;/a&gt; the of &lt;a href="w%3ANebraska"&gt;Nebraska&lt;/a&gt; to a unicameral house.

The unicameral plan, however, has come under fire from several political parties, including some from the ruling &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20and%20Truth"&gt;Justice and Truth Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The Prime Minister of Romania, &lt;a href="w%3AC%C4%83lin%20Popescu-T%C4%83riceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Liberal%20Party%20%28Romania%29"&gt;National Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, does not support the unicameral plan, and neither do the two major opposition parties, the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Romania%20Party"&gt;Great Romania&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite the political opposition, President Băsescu has constantly said that it would be up to the people to decide whether such a reform should take place, and hence announced today that the referendum on this issue would be held next year. The referendum would be held at the same time as the vote to elect Romania's 35 representatives to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, as Romania will join the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in 2007.

<h1>Film about Travis County DA's investigation of Texas election of 2002</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Film%20about%20Travis%20County%20DA%27s%20investigation%20of%20Texas%20election%20of%202002&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Two independent filmmakers, Mark Birnbaum and Jim Schermbeck, have created a film covering the 2002 Texas election campaign and the involvement of corporate donations. Their film is called ♡❤The Big Buy♡❤ and includes approximately 50 hours of interviews with the &lt;a href="w%3ATravis%20County"&gt;Travis County&lt;/a&gt; Prosecutor's office, including prosecutor &lt;a href="w%3ARonnie%20Earle"&gt;Ronnie Earle&lt;/a&gt;, lawyers for those under investigation, and some journalists.

Schermbeck and Birnbaum started ♡❤The Big Buy♡❤ in February 2003 and billed it as a "Texas noir political detective story that chronicles what some are calling a “bloodless coup with corporate cash.” It follows maverick Austin DA Ronnie Earle’s investigation into what really happened when corporate money joined forces with relentless political ambitions to help swing the pivotal 2002 Texas elections, cementing Republican control from Austin to Washington D.C."

The film has suddenly gained notoriety because of the recent indictments of &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Delay"&gt;Tom Delay&lt;/a&gt; by Travis County District Attorney's office. "We couldn't have given this film away last month," Mr. Schermbeck said. "We couldn't get any attention for it, or any money for it. Now, we're getting the attention, but so far it's still self-financed."

♡❤The Big Buy♡❤ draws its title from the idea that political influence can be bought and paid for, Schermbeck said.

The filmmakers financed the project themselves and made no payments to any of those interviewed, they said. "We look at this as witnessing history as it happens," Schermbeck said. "What if there was a film about Sharpstown [ the political scandal in the early '70s that derailed the careers of several Texas politicians]? It would have been great to have that as a historical document. This time we will."

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Review"&gt;National Review&lt;/a&gt; Online, which obtained an unfinished copy of the film last week, has written that it contains footage inside the grand jury room as well as inside the prosecutors office.

Presumably that is the same version of the film that was shown to a crowd of about 300 at the Dallas Video Festival in early August. Birnbaum and Schermbeck plan to re-work the ending. Now that Mr. Earle's investigation has focused on Delay, the filmmakers feel it only makes sense.

There have been conflicting reports on whether Mr. DeLay's staff said he chose not to grant any interviews to the filmmakers two years ago, or if his office was contacted at all. Mr. Schermbeck said he hopes the congressman will get involved. "We obviously have to do a new ending to this now, and we're going to be calling DeLay's lawyers and staff," Mr. Schermbeck said. 

DeLay defenders have used the film to attack the indictments handed out, as well as Ronnie Earle. "This is just further proof that this vendetta against congressman DeLay has been scripted from Day 1," said Ben Porritt, a spokesman for Tom Delay who was forced to give up his post as House majority leader after the indictment was handed down.

Schermbeck in responding to the various charges said, "We couldn't get past [Delay's] the front door. So we regrouped and decided to approach Mr. Earle about telling the story from his point of view." Bernbeck went on, "I don't think Mr. DeLay's name ever came up. We were as surprised as anyone that he was indicted."

Newspapers and Delay defenders have also charged that the filmmakers were given special access to Ronnie Earle and his staff as they examined allegations that Republicans were illegally funneling corporate contributions to the campaigns of Texas state legislative candidates.

“Oh yeah, he’s just doing his job. He’s just doing his job. He’s got a film crew that has been following him around for two years to document how he’s going to get Tom DeLay,” DeLay said on a Houston talk radio show Friday.

Ronnie Earle responded to the charges, "My office follows all the same proper rules about rightfully protected information for all the media no matter who they are. When somebody said to Harry Truman, 'Give 'em hell, Harry, I just tell them the truth, and they think it's hell.' I told them the truth, and they thought it was a movie. Go figure. I'm just doing my job."

Birnbaum and Schermbeck supported Earle's version of events, saying that Earle and his staff gave them some interviews. They also did not get access to any of the secret grand jury proceedings or witness any of the staff’s deliberations in the DeLay investigation.

Both Mark Birnbaum and Jim Schermbeck have collaborated on a number of projects in the past. Birnbaum has been working in film since 1969. According to his website he has done everything from production to editing film for &lt;a href="w%3APBS"&gt;PBS&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ADiscovery%20Channel"&gt;Discovery Channel&lt;/a&gt; all over the world. He also lists various awards he has won, including a &lt;a href="w%3APeabody%20Award"&gt;Peabody Award&lt;/a&gt;. Schermbeck has been a community organizer in Texas for almost 30 years. He has worked with Public Citizen, The National Toxics Campaign, and Downwinders at Risk.

&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; teachers have voted 91% in favour of withdrawing services, beginning today (October 7). This is in response to Bill 12 which, if passed, imposes a contract with neither pay raises nor caps on class sizes. It has passed third reading today and is expected to receive royal assent later today. B.C. teachers have had four such imposed contracts since 1993, spanning two different provincial governments. The B.C. Legislature has been meeting around the clock to try and get the motion through. 

This issue has been escalating for some time. Already, B.C. teachers are greatly underpaid (in terms of lifetime earnings), in comparison to those in other provinces, due to the B.C. government's zero wage increase policy for all public sector employees. In addition, they feel learning conditions are sub-par, with many classes overcrowded, and insufficient resources to provide for special needs children.
Hugh Finlayson, CEO of the BC Public School Employers' Association, representing the government, has asked the Labour Relations Board to halt the action. He has said that the walk out, which would affect 600,000 students, would break labour code, since education is, by B.C. law, an essential service. 

The labour board ruled at 11:00 PM October 6, 2005 that the action is illegal. It has ordered teachers to return to normal duties and schedules. They have also been asked not to picket at or near schools. This has had no effect on the teacher's planned action.

Being categorized as an essential service makes any striking action illegal, unless approved by the Labour Board. The intent of the teachers' original job action was to seek this approval, but this was halted by the passing of Bill 12. The International Labour Organization, the United Nations agency involved in upholding labour standards worldwide, has even urged Gordon Campbell's government to repeal the law making education an essential service.
The government has threatened legal action against the union, and possibly even jail for the union leader, but the teachers are arguing that this action is not a strike, merely political protest, and is therefore covered under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The situation could escalate quickly such as what occurred in the HEU strike. A general strike is not out of the question. Many unions have noted that they would stand-behined the BCTF.

Five soldiers in the southern &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt; were killed and another two injured in a drive-by attack by suspected Islamic militants.

The attack occurred whilst the soldiers were eating their evening meal. A representative of the Thai army said that the attackers fired assault rifles at the group before fleeing the scene in a pick-up truck. Metal spikes were strewn on the road to foil pursuit. In addition to the deaths, a number of firearms were stolen prior to the insurgents making their escape.

This was the second incident involving suspected Islamic militants on the day prior to &lt;a href="w%3ARamadan"&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier in the day the decapitated body of a middle-aged man was found at a roadside in &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala Province&lt;/a&gt;.

Over one thousand people have been killed in insurgency-related incidents in the predominantly &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; south of Thailand since 2004.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=French%20parliamentarian%20questions%20Jacques%20Chirac%27s%20Elys%C3%A9e%20budget&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A member of the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="French%20National%20Assembly"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, René Dosière, denounces the "opacity" in the budget of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89lys%C3%A9e%20Palace"&gt;Élysée Palace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the office of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;President of the French Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

According to him, the president's real budget is approximately three times the budget given for his services in the yearly national budget voted by the French Parliament, because many employees and services are provided by other ministries and public services free of charge to the presidency, and thus are counted in other budgets. As an example, the French &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Defence%20%28France%29"&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; provides &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Republican%20Guard"&gt;republican guards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other soldiers, as well as aerial transportation; the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28France%29"&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; funds official foreign trips; and repairs, furnitures etc. to presidential offices are funded by the Ministry of Culture. Mr Dosière reports that in 2003, the total spending was 82.6 million &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , while the official budget of the presidency was 30.5 million.

Mr Dosière started inquiring about presidential expenses about four years ago, and since then has been a critic of the opacity of accounting at the presidency. In order to obtain the necessary information, he has had to ask numerous questions to the executive and administrations.

In addition, he points out that the official budget of the presidency has boomed under &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;'s term: between 1995 and 2005, it climbed from 5,21 millions to 26,14 millions. In 1995, the president also had at his disposal some "secret funds", the total amount of which was voted by parliament, but which could be spent at his discretion. "Secret funds" were originally meant to fund specific missions that could not be funded within the exacting rules of public accounting, such as secret operations abroad, but they gradually also came to serve to pay various gratifications to government officials. Since 2002, secret funds have been cut and are reserved for paying for secret operations, while services that used them for normal operations were given special compensation. In 2005, the special compensation for the presidency was 5.5 million Euros.

In 2001, the French Parliament voted a law known as the LOLF (♡❤Loi d'orientation relative aux lois de finances♡❤) reforming the budget system, with a timetable for gradual implementation. This law mandates that any public spending should be traced to an identifiable "mission" of government.

<h1>US Senate approves rules regulating detainee treatment</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Senate%20approves%20rules%20regulating%20detainee%20treatment&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; approved a proposal that imposes restrictions on the detention, interrogation, and treatment of prisoners held by the US military. The rules prohibit the use of "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" against anyone in US government custody, regardless of where they are held. The rules also require all US troops to use only interrogation techniques authorized in a new Army field manual, but does not cover techniques used by the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/a&gt;. The rules follow alleged revelations of detainee abuse committed by US military and intelligence personnel in &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt;.

The proposal, sponsored by Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, was passed by a 90 to 9 vote, with 46 of the 55 Republicans, including the majority leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt; joining all 43 Democrats and one independent in favor. The proposal is part of a $440 billion military spending bill. 

McCain argued that American soldiers need clarity and "are not served by ambiguity". "We demanded intelligence without ever clearly telling our troops what was permitted and what was forbidden. And then, when things went wrong, we blamed them and we punished them. We have to do better than that," McCain, himself subjected to torture during five years in a Vietcong prison camp, said. McCain was urged to draft clear standards of conduct by Capt. Fishback, of the 82nd Airborne Division who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan. In an open letter to Sen. McCain, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/27/AR2005092701527.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Fishback stated that "the actions and statements of my leadership led me to believe that United States policy did not require application of the Geneva Conventions in Afghanistan or Iraq" and that his efforts to get clarifications from the military leadership on what constitutes lawful and humane treatment of detainees were unsuccessful. 

More than two dozen retired senior military officers, including &lt;a href="w%3AColin%20L.%20Powell"&gt;Colin L. Powell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20M.%20Shalikashvili"&gt;John M. Shalikashvili&lt;/a&gt;, two former chairmen of the &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff"&gt;Joint Chiefs of Staff&lt;/a&gt;, have endorsed the amendment. The measures have also been welcomed by human rights organisations.

Bush administration officials say the legislation would limit the president's authority and flexibility in war. White House spokesman, &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; called the amendment "unnecessary and duplicative" and added: "If it's presented, then there would be a recommendation of a veto, I believe". If President Bush chooses to veto the bill, it would be first veto since he took office in 2001. 

The measure is also expected to face opposition in the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, which is also controlled by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;.

The Senate's proposal has been welcomed by the human rights group &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, which describes it as "an important step toward protecting the rights of all human beings by providing clear guidance on humane treatment". In a statement, Amnesty urged the White House to accept the McCain amendment, and repeated its call for an independent investigation into the abuses at &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Democrat staffers obtained Maryland lt. governor's credit report illegally</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Democrat%20staffers%20obtained%20Maryland%20lt.%20governor%27s%20credit%20report%20illegally&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Two Democrat aides working on the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Senatorial%20Campaign%20Committee"&gt;Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee&lt;/a&gt; (DSCC), Katie Barge, the committee's research director, and her deputy, Lauren Weiner are alleged to have fraudulently used Social Security numbers from court records, to illegally obtain Republican Lt. Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Steele"&gt;Michael Steele&lt;/a&gt;'s confidential credit report. 
The aides worked for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), run by Democrat Senator &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Schumer"&gt;Charles Schumer&lt;/a&gt; from New York. The two apparently engaged in "opposition research" for the DSCC, investigating records of Lt. Gov. Steele's previous personal debt and other financial troubles, a month after Steele formed a committee investigating a run for the Senate seat of Senator Paul Sarbanes. The pair admitted the act in July, were suspended August 31, and resigned earlier this month. The DSCC fired the aides earlier this month and also reported the incident to the U.S. Attorney's office which, along with the FBI, is investigating. Lt. Governor Steele wants the aides prosecuted.

Under federal law, it is illegal to willfully obtain a credit report under false pretenses, and imposes a maximum 2-year prison sentence under the &lt;a href="w%3AFair%20Credit%20Reporting%20Act"&gt;Fair Credit Reporting Act&lt;/a&gt;. 

Senator Schumer, who runs the DSCC, and is a longtime advocate against identity theft, denies any knowledge of the scheme, and has not offered any apology for the theft of Lt. Governor Steele's personal data, nor given any indication of what his staffers were after or why they did it.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Republican%20Senatorial%20Committee"&gt;National Republican Senatorial Committee&lt;/a&gt; (NRSC), the counterpart to the DSCC, had its attorneys send a letter to the Democratic committee requesting information on which candidates' credit information had been accessed by Democrat staffers. The letter, from William J. McGinley and Cleta Mitchel, asked for information on "how the credit report(s) were accessed, which credit report(s) were accessed, whether any other forms of private financial data were accessed and [whether staffers accessed] any other relevant information related to this serious situation."

Marc E. Elias, an attorney for the Democratic committee has responded to the letter, stating "This was a single incident involving two staffers who demonstrated poor judgment," and "No other candidates or senators had their credit reports accessed." Mr. Elias also said that the committee "took appropriate action to ensure there was neither use of the credit information nor any additional access to it."

Republicans have questioned the characterization of the event by Democrats, that it was "isolated" and that the staffers had a "lapse in judgment."
Maryland Governor &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20L.%20Ehrlich"&gt;Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.&lt;/a&gt; added that both parties were guilty of unsavory tactics, but that that is "Capitol Hill politics."

Lt. Governor Steele is a Catholic, who earned his bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins in 1981 and his law degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 1991. The Lt. Governor also spent three years preparing for the priesthood. He is the highest-ranking African-American Republican elected official in the country.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Fujimori"&gt;Alberto Fujimori&lt;/a&gt;, the former president of Peru currently in de facto exile, showed his intention to run in the Peruvian presidential election of April 2006 at a press conference in Tokyo reportedly.

Fujimori was stripped of the presidency by the Peruvian parliament in 2000 during his visit to Japan. Since then, he has been able to remain in Japan due to the dual nationality which he holds as a result of his parents having been Japan-born immigrants, even though a Peruvian court accused him and requested that the Japanese government deport him. At the press conference Fujimori asserted that there was no legal barrier that would prevent him from running in the presidential election. He said also that "three tenths of Peruvian people support me".

Candidates for the election will be accepted until January 2006. Although Fujimori received his new Peruvian passport in September 2005, he did not clarify precisely when he would be returning to Peru.

The British &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAssets%20Recovery%20Agency"&gt;Assets Recovery Agency&lt;/a&gt; is investigating £30 million / €44 million of assets believed to be owned by senior members of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AProvisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;Provisional Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; (PIRA or IRA), using information provided by the Irish &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACriminal%20Assets%20Bureau"&gt;Criminal Assets Bureau&lt;/a&gt; and British and Irish law enforcement agencies. The money is believed to represent a small fraction of the wealth obtained by the organisation. This move follows the recent decommissioning of IRA weapons. Most of the assets are believed to have been owned by the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AList%20of%20IRA%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff"&gt;IRA chief of staff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AThomas%20Murphy%20%28Republican%29"&gt;Thomas Murphy&lt;/a&gt; and businessman Dermot Craven. Now that negotiations over weapons decommissioning are over, it is believed that other IRA members who have become rich through running protection rackets or other criminal activities may also be stripped of their illegal assests in the forthcoming weeks.

Irish Justice Minister Michael McDowell said: "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGarda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na"&gt;An Garda Síochána&lt;/a&gt; and the PSNI (&lt;a href="%3Aw%3APolice%20Service%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Police Service of Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;) and the Criminal Assets Bureau and the ARA are co-operating in every possible way to ensure that on this island those who have control of the proceeds of crime are deprived of those proceeds". Businesses and organisations paying money towards &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aprotection%20racket"&gt;protection rackets&lt;/a&gt; are hoping that the structure of the IRA will now begin to unravel.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Court%20of%20Australia"&gt;High Court&lt;/a&gt;, in a unanimous decision today, found &lt;a href="w%3AModchip"&gt;modchips&lt;/a&gt; to be legal. Mod-chips are attached to the system's &lt;a href="w%3AMotherboard"&gt;motherboard&lt;/a&gt; to allow users to bypass copy detection and regional controls on &lt;a href="w%3AVideo%20game%20console"&gt;game consoles&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%202"&gt;PlayStation 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AXbox"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt;. 

While playing illegally copied games is a primary reason for some people to install modchips, modchips are still considered legal. They allow users to play games imported from different regions, play homebrew games, and create archival copies of games. Imported games are often cheaper and available sooner than from countries with late official release dates, such as Australia. The court recognised that by the time a mod chip acts upon a copied game, the copyright violation has already taken place -- the mod chip is not responsible for the copyright violation.

In many other countries selling and using modchips is illegal. In the UK the &lt;a href="w%3AEU%20Copyright%20Directive"&gt;EU Copyright Directive&lt;/a&gt; has been used by &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; to prevent sales of modchips. The EU Copyright Directive makes it illegal to circumvent copy protection systems. A similar law, the &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt; (DMCA), makes it illegal in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;.

The defendant in the case was retailer Eddy Stevens, who sold and installed PlayStation 2 modchips. Sony, the manufacturer of the Playstation 2, sued, arguing that modchips were in violation of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20copyright%20law"&gt;Australian copyright law&lt;/a&gt;.

The court ruled that because the modchips merely allow users to play copied or imported games, and do not enable the copying of games, modchips do not breach copyright. "There is no copyright reason why the purchaser should not be entitled to copy the CD-ROM and modify the console in such a way as to enjoy his or her lawfully acquired property without inhibition," said the court. "This is a hell of a victory for the consumer. That's why we did it," said Mr. Stevens.

The court also ruled that reading a program into RAM, while the game is being played, does not count as making a copy under copyright law.

The Australian case is unique in that it is considered to be the first time DMCA-like provisions have been considered by a court of final appeal anywhere in the world.

There has been an explosion at the Formosa Plastics plant in &lt;a href="w%3APoint%20Comfort%2C%20TX"&gt;Point Comfort, TX&lt;/a&gt;. Residents have been advised to shelter in place. Point Comfort is about 25 miles south-east of &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20TX"&gt;Victoria, TX&lt;/a&gt;.

Witnesses report an explosion and "lots of black smoke", some visible from as far as 40 miles away. Six injuries were reported, but there were no deaths. The prevailing east to north east winds are directing smoke away from Port Lavaca and Victoria, and city officials are not recommending evacuation of these areas.

Point Comfort Elementary School has been evacuated, children are being moved to HJM Elementary in &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Lavaca%2C%20TX"&gt;Port Lavaca&lt;/a&gt;. Schools in Port Lavaca, &lt;a href="w%3ASeadrift%2C%20TX"&gt;Seadrift&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APort%20O%27Connor%2C%20TX"&gt;Port O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; have halted outdoor activities and school buses until they receive further notice. School superintendent Larry Nicols has said that parents will be allowed to pick up their children at any school if they desire.

A "credible threat" has been made against the subway system of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. NYPD and National Guard presence, as well as the terror alert level, have been increased. Nevertheless, the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mta.info"&gt;MTA&lt;/a&gt; subways and busses, as well as Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road, continued without noticeable delays.

During a press conference, Mayor Bloomberg stated that an unidentified news outlet knew about the threat as many as two days in advance, but did not release the story to the public for security reasons, and that the threat seems to have originated from abroad.

Part of New York's Pennsylvania Station was closed off Friday, the morning after a warning of a possible terrorist attack. The station was still operating but the area where the Amtrak trains operate was closed off. It seems a soda can was seen on the concourse level with a green liquid bubbling out. Workers in bio-hazard suits were seen and after a 2 hour delay the station was back to normal. Amtrak operations were not impacted.

While New York was on high-alert The Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Russ Knocke down-played the risk, "♡❤the intelligence community has concluded this information to be of doubtful credibility. We shared this information early on with state and local authorities in New York♡❤"

Internet service provider &lt;a href="w%3ALevel%203%20Communications"&gt;Level 3&lt;/a&gt; dropped its &lt;a href="w%3APeering"&gt;peering&lt;/a&gt; arrangement with &lt;a href="w%3ACogent%20Communications"&gt;Cogent&lt;/a&gt; on October 5, demanding a hosting fee for the service of connecting their root networks. Cogent argued that as equally sized companies they were sharing the bandwidth load and did not need to pay. Level 3 is a &lt;a href="w%3Atier%201%20carrier"&gt;tier 1 carrier&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that it controls part of the central ring of Internet servers that connect millions of servers, users, and secondary ISPs around the world. Other tier 1 ISPs include AT&amp;T, Sprint, and MCI. Cogent is a &lt;a href="w%3Atier%202%20carrier"&gt;tier 2 carrier&lt;/a&gt; with many clients, aspiring to become tier 1 through peering arrangements such as the kind it had made with Level 3.

As a result of Level 3's depeering, some customers of both companies experienced dropped connections. However, most consumer ISPs and college networks are "multihomed", and thus could connect through separate lines to both companies. Notably, the American ISP Roadrunner was only connected through Level 3, causing problems for home customers through most of October 5 and 6. Cogent offered a year of free hosting for any Level 3 customer who lost access to servers hosted through Cogent.

As of October 7th the connections seem to be restored.

An independent investigation, headed by former Victorian Police Commissioner Neil Comrie, has revealed that &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Australian immigration department&lt;/a&gt; officials wrongfully deported the Australian &lt;a href="w%3Acitizen"&gt;citizen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AVivian%20Solon"&gt;Vivian Solon&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. Ms Solon was deported in March 2001, after falling under suspicion as an illegal immigrant while she was in hospital after an accident. She was still in poor health when she was deported, and her five year old son was left behind in foster care. The mistake was not officially recognised until April 2005.

Senior officials knew of the mistake in July 2003, but neglected to correct it. In the end, it was only through the efforts of her former husband, Robert Young, who persistently pursued her case that it was eventually acted on. Some senior officials are being investigated on this issue, however, the ministers responsible for the Department -- now &lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt;, but prior to October 2003 it was &lt;a href="w%3APhillip%20Ruddock"&gt;Phillip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; -- denied any responsibility. When asked if he felt any responsibility Mr Ruddock answered "No, none at all."

This incident is one of a number of immigration controversies that have occurred in Australia. Cornelia Rau, an Australian citizen, was accidentally imprisoned in a detention centre when the immigration department suspected her of being an illegal immigrant. The report indicates that 20 other Australian citizens have also been unjustly imprisoned by the immigration department.

An undetonated bomb, reportedly from &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, has been discovered at &lt;a href="w%3ASchiphol%20Airport"&gt;Schiphol Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAmsterdam"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Netherlands"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;. One runway, the closest to the bomb, has been closed as a result, and delays are expected on all flights. Heavy fog has compounded the problem and is expected to cause further delays. 

The 255kg bomb was discovered by workers from the town of Vijfhuizen, which is about 5km from the airport. According to the Dutch national traffic bureau, ANWB, "The projectile is sensitive to vibrations, is not in a settled position, and is possibly live."

Automobile traffic near the area has been stopped and several houses have been evacuated. Schiphol Airport is Amsterdam's primary airport and one of Europe's largest hubs.

Bombs and mines continue to be found throughout the Netherlands even though World War II ended sixty years ago. Earlier this year in April, three fishermen were killed when their ship exploded from hauling an old bomb onboard that had been caught in the net.

The &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (IAEA), a &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; agency, and its Director &lt;a href="Mohammed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohammed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt; have been awarded the &lt;a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="2005"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, the committee's chairman Professor Ole Danbolt Mjøs announced today.

In the announcement, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorwegian%20Nobel%20Committee"&gt;Norwegian Nobel Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; emphasizes the role the IAEA plays in preventing military use of nuclear energy arms proliferation, and ensuring peaceful use of nuclear energy. Furthermore, the Committee notes that IAEA's work is in line with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlfred%20Nobel"&gt;Alfred Nobel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's original motivation for the Peace Prize, namely the reduction of standing armies. The committee expressed its belief that the increasing threat of nuclear arms today must be met through the broadest possible international cooperation, as exemplified in the work of the IAEA.

A spokeswoman for the IAEA, Melissa Flemming, said in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : "I never thought we'd see this day. This is the proudest day for the IAEA. We are proud, astonished, elated."

The IAEA, headquartered in Vienna and established in 1957, seeks to prevent &lt;a href="nuclear%20proliferation"&gt;nuclear proliferation&lt;/a&gt; and promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It is currently involved in efforts to bring DPRK (North Korea) back to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NPT) regime and verifying the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. These negotiations have been difficult, and are viewed by some &lt;a href="http%3A//www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C3-1815682%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as not very successful.

The 63-year old Mohamed ElBaradei, an Egyptian-born lawyer, heads the agency since 1997 and was recently confirmed for a third term.

Walking outside this morning, the average seasoned &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texan&lt;/a&gt; will notice something amiss &amp;mdash; the eerie quiet. The droning of air conditioners and insects has stopped, replaced with the scent of hardwood smoke and a slight shiver.

A pocket of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArctic%20air"&gt;Arctic air&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; finally pushed through well into the &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, plunging temperatures across the state into the 50s and 60s. While the chilliest lows are not expected to stay for more than a few days, forecasters are expecting Texas' normal fall pattern of a cooler front about every week to continue. Average weekly temperatures should reach steadily lower as the season progresses.

♡❤♡Stormy Weather♡❤♡

As an added bonus to many, rain trickled down onto &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and many other Texas cities. This rain has relieved areas which have been dry for months.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — A manager's mistake when entering gasoline prices into a computerized system led to prices one tenth of what was intended. The price was supposed to be set at US$3.299 per gallon (US$0.87 / litre), but was entered as US$0.329 (US$0.09 / litre). 

Customers lined up at the RaceTrac on Beach Boulevard in Miami, and filled up with the cheap gas for hours. Not one bothered to tell station employees. They were alerted when reporters from a local news agency received a tip and came on site to investigate. The mistake was promptly fixed.

During the October 6 press briefing, White House spokesman Scott McClellan denied comments attributed to President Bush in a forthcoming BBC television series. The three-part documentary, ♡❤Elusive Peace: Israel and the Arabs♡❤, includes an interview with a former Palestinian foreign minister, Nabil Shaath, where he recounts an incident at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in June 2003. The series starts on Monday and documents the recent history of attempts to bring peace to the Middle East.

Mr. Shaath says that President Bush told a Palestinian delegation: "God would tell me, George, go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan. And I did, and then God would tell me, George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq... and I did. And now, again, I feel God's words coming to me, go get the Palestinians their state and get the Israelis their security, and get peace in the Middle East. And by God I'm gonna do it."

At the briefing, a reporter asked if McClellan was aware of the comments ascribed to President Bush and McClellan replied, "No, that's absurd. He's never made such comments." Pushed further about the statements, McClellan responded, "No, I checked into that [BBC] report and I stand by what I just said."

Mr. Shaath provided further context to the statement saying, "It was really a figure of speech. We felt he was saying that he had a mission, a commitment, his faith in God would inspire him ... rather than a metaphysical whisper in his ear," he said.

Police evacuated the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Monument"&gt;Washington Monument&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and sealed off surrounding streets today. This was due to a bomb threat made in the mid-afternoon.

Sgt. Scott Fear of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Park Police said the threat came in at 2:42 p.m. EDT by telephone. The area was evacuated shortly after and bomb-sniffing patrol dogs were called in. The search turned up nothing. Another law official, speaking anonymously because other agencies were involved, said the credibility was low but police didn't want to take any chances.

The monument was re-opened at 4:15 p.m. EDT.

The Washington Monument was closed until last spring due to a $15 million dollar security overhaul.

&lt;a href="w%3ASymantec"&gt;Symantec&lt;/a&gt;, an antivirus software manufacturer, announced Thursday that they had discovered a new &lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;Trojan horse&lt;/a&gt; that affects &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; Portable hand-held gaming consoles. The program deletes required system files, preventing the device from starting correctly. Symantec has named the virus "Trojan.PSPBrick".

The PSP, by default, can only play games approved by Sony. To play other games you must use a software hack. This Trojan pretends to be a program that performs this software hack. The use of any software that attempts to perform this hack, including this Trojan, voids the warranty.

Symantec has said they are not aware of any way a user can restore their PSP after it has been infected. However there have not yet been any confirmed infections. To get infected the user must choose to download the file and copy it to their PSP. "It does not affect the average user," said Eric Chien a software engineer at Symantec.

The Trojan is distributed as an archive file named "EXPLOIT 2G PSP Team V1.RAR". The archive contains two files that must be manually copied to the PSP and run for the user to be infected. Once infected it deletes four files required for the PSP to boot: /vsh/etc/index.dat, /kd/loadcore.prx , /kd/loadexec.prx, and flash6:/kd/init.prx.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20force-feeding%20Guantanamo%20hunger%20strikers&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Reports from &lt;a href="Amnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt; and an attorney representing some detainees indicate that hunger strikes continue among those held at the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; detention facility in &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. More than 200 prisoners are participating in the &lt;a href="w%3Ahunger%20strike"&gt;hunger strike&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; of these, 21 are being force fed by military personnel.

According to human rights lawyer &lt;a href="w%3AClive%20Stafford%20Smith"&gt;Clive Stafford Smith&lt;/a&gt;, the prisoners have been shackled to their beds to prevent them removing the feeding tubes that have been inserted into their noses. "The notion that a qualified medical practitioner would be prepared to supervise such a procedure (as force-feeding through a tube), goes against all medical ethics, certainly in this country," said &lt;a href="w%3ATrevor%20Turner"&gt;Trevor Turner&lt;/a&gt;, a director of &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Hospital"&gt;St. Bartholomew's Hospital&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

Military authorities maintain that only 36 detainees are currently strikers &amp;mdash; they define a hunger striker as one who has refused at least nine meals. According to U.S. military personnel, a striker is only force-fed when his life is in danger. 

Some detainees have been striking since August to protest the alleged inhumane conditions at the camp as well as their indefinite confinement without charge or normal legal rights, according to attorneys representing them.

Red tide is caused by a higher than normal concentration of ♡❤Karenia brevis♡❤, a naturally-occurring single-celled marine organism. Natural factors can intersect to produce ideal conditions, allowing this algae to increase in number dramatically. The algae produces a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aneurotoxin"&gt;neurotoxin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that can disable nerves in both humans and fish. Fish often die because of the high concentrations of the toxin in the waters. Humans can be affected by breathing affected water taken into the air by wind and waves. Also, South Padre officials are investigating a paralyzed cat and deceased coyote who may have consumed fish killed by the red tide.

This bloom has lingered almost three weeks, and affects waters parallel to South Padre Island for about 25 miles, and may extend as far as 10 miles along Mexico beaches.

Salomón Lerner, President of &lt;a href="w%3APeru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ATruth%20and%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20%28Peru%29"&gt;Truth and Reconciliation Commission&lt;/a&gt;, which has investigated &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; abuses in the country, has received death threats and &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Semitism"&gt;anti-Semitic&lt;/a&gt; emails, according to &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;. 

The 12-member commission published its major report &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cverdad.org.pe/ingles/ifinal/index.php"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, covering abuses committed over the last two decades, on 28 August 2003. Since then the commission has come under fierce attack from retired military personnel and politicians. 

Largely as a result of the commission's findings, 378 Peruvians are currently facing criminal charges, including 273 former army officers. 

Lerner is said to have told the Peru21 newspaper that an anonymous caller to his office in &lt;a href="w%3ALima"&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt; recently left a message telling him to "consider himself dead". Lerner, whose father was Jewish, says that he has also received insulting and anti-Semitic emails. Other members of the commission are also believed to have been sent insulting messages.

Human Rights Watch has urged the Peruvian government to ensure that Lerner is protected, and "renew its pledge to carry out the commission's recommendations in full". Human Rights Watch recently complained of the government's failure to protect a key witness due to testify against a retired general accused of torture and kidnapping &lt;a href="http%3A//hrw.org/english/docs/2005/06/03/peru11074.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Perhaps coincidentally, fugitive ex-president &lt;a href="w%3AAlberto%20Fujimori"&gt;Alberto Fujimori&lt;/a&gt; has announced in Tokyo his intention to run for the presidency again despite the government's statement that it will arrest him to face charges of murder, corruption and human rights abuses during the 1980s and 1990s.

On September 30, 2005, the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20Accountability%20Office"&gt;Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt;, an investigative agency of the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Congress"&gt;U.S. Congress&lt;/a&gt;, released report ♡❤♡B-305368, Department of Education--Contract to Obtain Services of Armstrong Williams♡❤♡. Senators &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Kennedy"&gt;Edward Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Lautenberg"&gt;Frank Lautenberg&lt;/a&gt; asked the GAO back in October of 2004 to look into "an illegal use of taxpayer funds by the U.S. Department of Education, and request an expedited legal decision from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on the matter."&lt;a href="http%3A//lautenberg.senate.gov/~lautenberg/press/2003/01/2004A14740.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

In the 16 page report, the GAO found that the contracts with &lt;a href="w%3AKetchum%20Inc."&gt;Ketchum Inc.&lt;/a&gt; "violated the publicity or propaganda prohibition for fiscal year 2004 because it amounted to covert propaganda. As a result of this violation, the Department also violated the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. sect. 1341."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/305368.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The report goes on to describe the history of the contract between the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Education"&gt;United States Department of Education&lt;/a&gt;, Ketchum, and &lt;a href="w%3AArmstrong%20Williams"&gt;Armstrong Williams&lt;/a&gt;. The report also describes the Department's own defense of its position, "the Department argued that it contracted only for television and radio advertisements featuring Mr. Williams.[35] Talbert Letter at 2. The Department offered three points in support of its position: First, the only portions of its Statements of Work that have any legal significance are the lists of “deliverables.” The Department argues that its task orders did not procure Mr. Williams’s commentary, which meant there was nothing for the Department to disclose. Second, the Department did not pay any appropriated funds for covert propaganda. Third, the Department’s task orders represented the legitimate dissemination of information to the public. ♡❤Id♡❤. We do not agree."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/305368.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The report conlcudes, "The Department of Education violated the fiscal year 2004 publicity or propaganda prohibition by contracting with Ketchum for the services of GWG to obtain commentary by Armstrong Williams on the NCLB Act without requiring Ketchum to ensure that Mr. Williams disclosed to his audiences the Department’s role. The commentary obtained as a result of these contracts violated the publicity or propaganda prohibition because it was “covert,” in that it did not disclose to the targeted audiences that it was sponsored by the Department and was paid for using appropriated funds. E.g., B-303495, Jan. 4, 2005; B-302710, May 19, 2004. At the same time, because the Department had no appropriation available to contract for commentary in violation of the cited publicity or propaganda prohibitions, the Department also violated the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. sect. 1341. B-303495, Jan. 4, 2005; B-302710, May 19, 2004. It must report this violation to the Congress and the President, and submit a copy of that report to the Comptroller General. 31 U.S.C. sect. 1351, as amended. B-304335, Mar. 8, 2005."&lt;a href="http%3A//www.gao.gov/decisions/appro/305368.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The GAO acts as an investigative arm of Congress, and reports to Congress and the White House, to enable Congress's effective oversight of the government. All enforcement of GAO findings is left up to Congress itself, as the GAO has no enforcement powers.

Canada's federal government has announced a new program that plans to share unexpected budget surpluses with ordinary citizens. It should be introduced in Ottawa as early as Friday.

The Surplus Allocation Act would share any surplus equally between tax cuts, new spending and debt relief. It would not replace Canada's $3 billion emergency fund. Under existing law any surplus is funneled completely into debt relief.

The benefit would come as an amount added on to the income tax returns of that year. It would then be added on to the amount a person can earn tax-free for each subsequent year.

Along with the new home heating oil rebate program are considered to be pre-election maneuvering from the liberals. &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; has promised an election within 30 days of the Gomery Commission Report's release. The report is expected in February.

The strongest earthquake (7.6) that &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Asia"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt; experienced in the last century caused widespread damage across &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, North &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Strongest hit was apparently &lt;a href="Kashmir"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;. Tens of thousands of people are feared dead. The epicenter was close to &lt;a href="Muzaffarabad"&gt;Muzaffarabad&lt;/a&gt;, 138 km to the north of &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;, and also caused severe damage from both shaking and from landslides to &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/05/south_asia_enl_1128852117/html/1.stm"&gt;Balakot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGarhi%20Habibullah"&gt;Garhi Habibullah&lt;/a&gt; and one village in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ARawalakot"&gt;Rawalakot&lt;/a&gt;. 

Reports on fatalities are conflicting, but even the most conservative estimates put the toll as high as 20,000. Pakistani President &lt;a href="Pervez%20Musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; told the BBC he knew of 20,000 people that were killed but added: "I wouldn't be able to make an accurate assessment for days." He also asked for international help and specifically requested large cargo helicopters to supply remote areas. The US has come forward to assist by providing eight military helicopters. The communications minister for the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, Tariq Mahmmod, said on Sunday, that "more than 30,000" died in his region alone. Aside from Kashmir most of the deaths occurred in the North-West Province of Pakistan and other northern areas. The estimated death toll has now reached 35,000.

Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, a spokesman for Musharraf, said the scale of the devastation was the biggest Pakistan has ever seen. As emergency workers searched for trapped people and helped the injured, an international relief and recovery effort geared up.

A &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; disaster relief team was due in &lt;a href="Islamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;, the Pakistani capital, on Sunday. &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; were among countries offering aid. &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan's neighbour and longtime rival, also offered aid (&lt;a href="Nations%20begin%20to%20offer%20aid%20to%20regions%20afflicted%20by%20Indian%20subcontinent%20earthquake"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt;). A British team from the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AInternational%20Rescue%20Corps"&gt;International Rescue Corps&lt;/a&gt; was assisting in the operation at Marghalla Towers on Sunday, equipped with heat-seeking detectors, portable oxygen bags, and advanced slab and metal cutters. According to Pakistan Television this meant that "rescue efforts are picking up pace, and lot of time is being saved."
The tremors began at 8:50 am (03:50 GMT), and continued for two minutes, followed by several aftershocks over a period of ten minutes. Initial reports said that they were felt in Delhi, Islamabad, Lahore, Quetta, Kabul, Punjab, Jammu, Kashmir, and other areas. A magnitude 6.3 aftershock occurred seven hours later just to the northwest.

The earthquake caused several apartment buildings in &lt;a href="Islamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt; to collapse, trapping hundreds of people.

250 children were killed in Gari Habi Ullaha between &lt;a href="w%3AMansehra"&gt;Mansehra&lt;/a&gt; and Muzaffarabad when their school collapsed.

The Pakistani Interior Ministry reports that several villages were "wiped out." Pakistan's army has been directed to extend all out help to the civil population in the quake-hit areas. All civil and military hospitals have been directed to deal with the situation on an emergency basis. The President and the Prime Minister have appealed to the nation to stay calm in the face of the calamity, and asked the authorities concerned to carry out an immediate assessment of the extent of the damage.

The Pakistani Prime Minister &lt;a href="Shaukat%20Aziz"&gt;Shaukat Aziz&lt;/a&gt; talked by telephone with authorities in four provinces and Azad Kashmir. He directed them to utilize all machinery, and make all possible efforts to help the victims. He said that the whole federal administration, civil and military authorities had been alerted and relief goods had been provided to them for the victims of the quake.

Most of the roads are closed in the Northern Sector near the earthquake, and some have been completely washed out, so the Pakistani army is flying supplies in by helicopter. Telephone and electricity connections have been cut to towns such as Muzaffarabad, making logistical operations much more complex. The heavy rains have also contributed to the suffering of the many thousands who are now homeless.

Across the line of control in Indian-administered &lt;a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir"&gt;Jammu and Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;, officials said Saturday that more than 465 people, at least 34 of them soldiers, were killed in the quake.

Worst hit in India was the town of Uri, close to the border with Pakistan, where four in five of the town's buildings were leveled, and at least 120 people lost their lives. Officials in India have been criticised for the slow pace and lack of organisation in the relief effort&lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4339522.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The first veto of &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s presidency may be used to block an amendment that bans torture and mistreatment of detainees, proposed by two &lt;a href="GOP"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;senators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; sent a "statement of administration policy" to the Senate declaring strong opposition to the legislation, alleging that it would tie the nation's hands in the "War on Terrorism". The statement said that if the bill's final version contained the anti-torture terms, then "the president's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill."

The amendment, an addition to the $440 billion dollar military spending bill, proposed by senators &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALindsey%20Graham"&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , would establish the Army Field Manual as the uniform standard for the interrogation of Department of Defense detainees and secondly prohibit cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of persons detained by the U.S. government.&lt;a href="http%3A//mccain.senate.gov/index.cfm%3Ffuseaction%3DNewsCenter.ViewPressRelease%26amp%3BContent_id%3D1611"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

The legislation comes in the wake of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse"&gt;Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and allegations of &lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which, in a recent &lt;a href="http%3A//hrw.org/reports/2005/us0905/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, accused soldiers of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division of "systematically torturing Iraqi detainees". The report was critizised by a Department of Defense spokesman as using "distortions and errors in fact."

The amendment received 90 votes in support, and 9 votes against in the Senate. Former Secretary of State &lt;a href="Colin%20Powell"&gt;Colin Powell&lt;/a&gt;, as well as 28 other retired senior military officers, also endorsed it.

General Powell said in a letter to McCain: "Our troops need to hear from the Congress, which has an obligation to speak to such matters. I also believe the world will note that America is making a clear statement with respect to the expected future behavior of our soldiers." Powell said the Senate action "will help deal with the terrible public diplomacy crisis created by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ."

McCain, a one-time &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrisoner%20of%20war"&gt;P.O.W.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during his military service in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said after the vote that the White House should not be working against him on this issue: "We think it would be very helpful because it would send a message to the world that the United States of America does not engage in torture. We will not treat people inhumanely. We will adhere to treaties that we are signatories to, and the men and women who do the interrogating will have clear instructions as to how to conduct interrogations."

Senate Majority Leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who later voted for the bill, and White House lobbyists led the unsuccessful opposition to the amendment and senator &lt;a href="Ted%20Stevens"&gt;Ted Stevens&lt;/a&gt; had argued that the amendment would prevent "our people from taking the leadership. (sic)"

Ten suspected terrorists were arrested in three different parts of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href="Croydon"&gt;Croydon&lt;/a&gt; section of south &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; three men were arrested. In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWolverhampton"&gt;Wolverhampton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , four were arrested in a series of dawn raids at three addresses and three in Derby, &lt;a href="Scotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; said.

<h3>Police Give Little Detail on the Case</h3>

Police and the security service, &lt;a href="MI5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt; say that they made the arrest as a result of a “investigation”. Forensic searches were undertaken at all the properties, but the police gave no details of the nationality of the individuals. A spokesman said the investigation was not connected to the bomb attacks in London in July. Scotland Yard, meanwhile, has called on the government to provide more resources and funds to tackle the terrorist threat in the capital.

Numerous smuggled artifacts were found at an &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt; tour guide's home. Five &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italians&lt;/a&gt; were arrested and twenty-eight others are now being investigated. The Austrian, known as "Mozart" in the art trafficking world, received a citation for his involvement.

Police claim that some 600 artifacts, which had been illegally excavated, were found. Most ranged from &lt;a href="w%3A8th%20century%20BC"&gt;8th century BCE&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3A5th%20century%20AD"&gt;5th century CE&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the items were gold and silver, along with ceramics. One item, a cup, has been valued at several thousand &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;Euros&lt;/a&gt;.

The artifacts were plundered from an archaeological site near &lt;a href="w%3ARome"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; by "Mozart" using his tour guide credentials. Italian authorities expect that the plundered artifacts will finally be displayed in Italian museums.

&lt;a href="w%3AAmr%20Moussa"&gt;Amr Moussa&lt;/a&gt;, head of the &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20League"&gt;Arab League&lt;/a&gt;, said a &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20war"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; is looming, "... civil war could erupt at any moment, although some people would say it is already there."

"There are a lot of individuals now playing games with the future of Iraq, and there is no clear strategy, there is no clear leadership... We are now in a mission to bring people together," said Moussa.

&lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; Arab leaders met Saturday to discuss the possibility of a boycott of the up-coming referendum on the Iraqi draft constitution. The group came just short of calling for the boycott, and instead asked followers to vote "no" on October 15th referendum. They called on their followers to oppose the referendum "by all legitimate means." 

The constitution was drafted by mainly &lt;a href="w%3AShia"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; leaders, the majority in Iraq. The &lt;a href="w%3AKurdish%20people"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; leaders also supported the new constitution. 

The Sunnis make up 20% of Iraq. They most likely fear a political movement that would allow the Shia and Kurds to control the government and lucrative &lt;a href="w%3AOil%20industry"&gt;petroleum industry&lt;/a&gt;. 

Violent acts have been on the increase lately. Most carried out by &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide%20bombers"&gt;suicide bombers&lt;/a&gt; targeting Iraq police and new recruits into the nations army. 

&lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrat"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; has also been expressing concerns over violence in Iraq. The most worrying was "the apparent breakdown in trust" between local authorities and UK troops.

These comments come after UK troops were attacked by a mob after they tried to free two soldiers who had been arrested. UK troops later broke into a &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt; prison while looking for the two arrested soldiers. They were found later in houses, police had handed them over to Shia militiamen. Kennedy has also been pushing for the removal of troops from Iraq.

Other Arab countries have been expressing their concern over the violence in Iraq.

Amr Moussa told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "The situation is bad and our work now is to bring all communities together; we want to do something constructive."

US-based &lt;a href="w%3AOracle%20Corporation"&gt;Oracle Corporation&lt;/a&gt; announced Friday it had acquired &lt;a href="w%3AInnobase"&gt;Innobase&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOsakeyhti%C3%B6"&gt;OY&lt;/a&gt; for an undisclosed sum. Innobase is a &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; company that has developed several &lt;a href="w%3AOpen-source%20software"&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Adatabase"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt; technologies. They are best known for &lt;a href="w%3AInnoDB"&gt;InnoDB&lt;/a&gt;. 

InnoDB is an add-on storage engine for &lt;a href="w%3AMySQL"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt; used by many popular websites, including &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2001/03/12/daily26.html"&gt;EDS/Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%21"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//finance.yahoo.com/"&gt;Finance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia"&gt;Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt;. It is an open source tool, distributed under the &lt;a href="w%3AGNU%20General%20Public%20License"&gt;GNU General Public License&lt;/a&gt; (GPL).

“Oracle has long been a supporter of open source software such as &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AApache"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;. Innobase is an innovative small company that develops open-source database technology. Oracle intends to continue developing the InnoDB technology and expand our commitment to open source software.” said &lt;a href="http%3A//www.oracle.com/corporate/pressroom/html/crozwat.html"&gt;Charles Rozwat&lt;/a&gt;, executive vice president of Database and &lt;a href="w%3AMiddleware"&gt;Middleware&lt;/a&gt; Technology at Oracle.

Innobase is the 11th company to be acquired by Oracle in under a year. The most recent acquisition was of rival &lt;a href="w%3ASiebel%20Systems"&gt;Siebel Systems&lt;/a&gt; on September 13 for $5.85 billion.

Five robotic vehicles successfully completed the US$2 million &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20DARPA%20Grand%20Challenge"&gt;2005 DARPA Grand Challenge&lt;/a&gt; 212 km / 132 mile race on Saturday October 8th, 2005. The winner, &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;'s entry, is a &lt;a href="w%3AVolkswagen"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20%28vehicle%29"&gt;Stanley&lt;/a&gt;, which completed the course in 6 hours 53 minutes, beating the 10 hour minimum requirement for the US$2 million prize. A winner was not declared until October 9, when all 23 vehicles had attempted the race.

The first race in 2004 failed to produce any winners. A modified &lt;a href="w%3AHumvee"&gt;Humvee&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3ACarnegie%20Mellon%20University"&gt;Carnegie Mellon University&lt;/a&gt; completed less than 13 km / 8 miles to become the best robotic vehicle in the 2004 race. The unclaimed US$1 million prize in 2004 was doubled to US$2 million for 2005, as no vehicles completed the 2004 race.

The US$2 million prize goes to Stanford University for their entry. The other four entrants to successfully complete the course were robotic versions of a Ford Escape Hybrid, a Humvee, a Hummer H1, and an Oshkosh truck. The remaining 18 entrants did not complete the race, and all but one vehicle in the 2005 race surpassed the distance of the 2004 robotic Humvee. A staggered start for the race was used, in order to spread the distance between the 23 robotic vehicles.

<h1>California bans sale of violent video games to minors</h1>

California Governor &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; signed into law a bill that bans the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. The bill requires violent video games sold in the state of California to be labeled with a decal reading "18" and makes their sale to a minor punishable by a fine of $1000 per offense.

AB 1179, written by Assemblymember &lt;a href="w%3ALeland%20Yee"&gt;Leland Yee&lt;/a&gt; (D-San Francisco), defines a violent video game as one that "enables the player to virtually inflict serious injury upon images of human beings or characters with substantially human characteristics in a manner which is especially heinous, cruel, or depraved in that it involves torture or serious physical abuse to the victim."

The bill also states, "Exposing minors to depictions of violence in video games, including sexual and heinous violence, makes those minors more likely to experience feelings of aggression, to experience a reduction of activity in the frontal lobes of the brain, and to exhibit violent antisocial or aggressive behavior."

The bill will take effect January 1, 2006. Groups opposing the bill, including free speech advocates and the video game industry, already plan to challenge its constitutionality in court.

The &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, despatched an additional 1,000 troops to the south of the country to help deal with the widespread violence. This brings the total number of security forces operating in the three troubled provinces to approximately 30,000.

Mr. Shinawatra's recent visit to the region was followed by further shootings. In &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat Province&lt;/a&gt; a 40 year old village worker was shot while helping a neighbour repair a fence. Friday saw the shooting of an assistant village head in &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala Province&lt;/a&gt;, and an elderly couple were shot in &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20Province"&gt;Pattani Province&lt;/a&gt; whilst returning from a local market.

The insurgency and campaign for an independent &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; state in the southern provinces has resulted in an exodus from the area. Estimates put the number of Thai &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhist"&gt;Buddhists&lt;/a&gt; who have fled the area at 34,000. There are also some reports that Muslim inhabitants of the area have been seeking refuge in &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;.

The state of emergency imposed last month has had a mixed reception. Largely favoured by Buddhists in the provinces, this grants additional powers to the Prime Minister and follows on from &lt;a href="w%3Amartial%20law"&gt;martial law&lt;/a&gt; having been in place since January 2004. Despite these security measures, over 1,000 people have died in the insurgency.

<h1>Weekend violence in Darfur complicates peace talks</h1>

On Sunday, armed men kidnapped eighteen &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; personnel (including military observers and civilian police) in the war-torn &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. According to AU commission spokesperson Adam Thiam, "They were taken by a dissident group of Jem." The Justice and Equality Movement, or Jem, is an &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; rebel force deeply involved in the ongoing conflict in the region. 

One day earlier two AU personnel and two civilians were killed in an attack believed to be perpetrated by the &lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;Sudan Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt;. A third soldier injured in the attack succumbed to his injuries on Sunday. Additionally, two personnel are missing and three others were injured.

According to the AU, those who survived identified the attackers' vehicles and uniforms as belonging to the SLA. 

Both rebel groups have been in conflict with the Sudanese government and its Arab militia (referred to as &lt;a href="w%3AJanjaweed"&gt;Janjaweed&lt;/a&gt;) since 2003, although the roots of the violence stretch back to the first and second Sudanese Civil Wars. Since the conflict began it is said that 180,000 people have been killed and 2 million have been forced to flee from their homes. The term ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has been applied to the conflict although this has been hotly contested. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; has come under intense criticism for refusing to refer to it as a ♡❤genocide♡❤, something the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has done. The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt; is investigating alleged war-crimes in the region, although the Sudanese government denies the allegations.

6,000 African Union troops have been dispatched to monitor a ceasefire between the opposing forces, and these latest attacks come on the heels of another round of peace talks. Although both sides have expressed optimism, the AU contends that progress is slow and blames divisions within the Sudan Liberation Army for holding up progress.

The AU has also accused the government of continuing attacks on villages and refugee camps. The &lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt; government denies this.

&lt;a href="w%3AVeriSign"&gt;VeriSign&lt;/a&gt; Inc. announced Friday it has acquired &lt;a href="http%3A//weblogs.com/"&gt;Weblogs.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20View%2C%20Santa%20Clara%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Mountain View&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; based VeriSign bought &lt;a href="w%3ABerkeley%2C%20California"&gt;Berkeley&lt;/a&gt; based Weblogs.com from &lt;a href="http%3A//scripting.com/"&gt;Scripting News Inc.&lt;/a&gt; for $2.3 million in cash.

Weblogs.com offers a &lt;a href="w%3Aping"&gt;ping&lt;/a&gt; service that uses &lt;a href="w%3ARSS%20%28file%20format%29"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; to alert people to new content posted on a &lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Awebsite"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.

Weblogs.com founder &lt;a href="w%3ADave%20Winer"&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; that Weblogs.com had grown to be too big for him to handle. "Actually, I would have liked to sell sooner. Keeping the site running was a perpetual challenge. We would scale and it would just grow exponentially." said Winer. Weblogs.com sends out nearly 2 million pings per day.

“VeriSign has the size and expertise to handle the growth” said &lt;a href="http%3A//www.verisign.com/verisign-inc/corporate-overview/executive-officers/page_029081.html"&gt;Mark McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt;, senior VP of naming and directory services at VeriSign. "The Internet has experienced an explosion in both the number of bloggers and the number of daily RSS feeds from bloggers over the past 12 to 24 months, but the infrastructure to support that level of Internet communications has not kept pace," said McLaughlin.

VeriSign has said they will continue to operate Weblogs.com as a free service. However they may in the future charge for additional services.

&lt;a href="w%3AAmerica%20Online"&gt;America Online&lt;/a&gt; also recently acquired a similarly named but unrelated blog publisher, &lt;a href="w%3AWeblogs%20Inc."&gt;Weblogs Inc.&lt;/a&gt;

This unusual hurricane season, one of the most active in history, has produced another strange storm. Category 1 &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Vince"&gt;Hurricane Vince&lt;/a&gt;, which was formed from a non-tropical low today, is forecast to head east towards &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, rather than west as is usual. Vince caught forecasters by surprise, since the waters in the area are around 25ºC. Few expected Vince to even form in the cool waters, much less to become a hurricane.

Forecasters at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt; do not expect Vince to be a hurricane for long. It is forecast to weaken as it moves towards Portugal, and to finally become &lt;a href="w%3Aextratropical"&gt;extratropical&lt;/a&gt;. In about 48 hours, they believe Vince will be absorbed by a front in Portugal or &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.

Guardian journalist Benjamin Joffe-Walt has claimed to have witnessed democracy activist Lu Banglie beaten "lifeless" by a mob on Saturday night. Joffe-Walt and Lu were in a taxi attempting to enter the villiage of Taishi, which the journalist described as "the hotspot of the growing rural uprisings in China". 

According to Mr Joffe-Walt, their car was surrounded by a group of about 30 men. When the men recognised Mr Lu, "... they completely lost it. They pulled him out and bashed him to the ground, kicked him, pulverised him, stomped on his head over and over again. The beating was loud, like the crack of a wooden board, and he was unconscious within 30 seconds. They continued for 10 minutes. The body of this skinny little man turned to putty between the kicking legs of the rancorous men."

Mr Lu was later found to have survived but suffered serious injuries. Mr Lu has told the Guardian that he was battered unconscious and later driven hundreds of miles to his home town where he is now recuperating. Civil rights lawyers said they were considering a legal case against his attackers, thought to be a group of thugs hired by the local authorities to put down an anti-corruption campaign against the chief of Taishi village.

&lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Social Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der"&gt;Gerhard Schröder&lt;/a&gt; has given up his ambition to be &lt;a href="w%3Achancellor"&gt;chancellor&lt;/a&gt; in a future government and cleared the way for the current opposition leader, &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;Christian Democrat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt;, to become the first female chancellor in the history of &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, officials for both parties confirmed.

Both Schröder and Merkel previously insisted that they become head of government, making chancellorship the all deciding issue whether to form a coalition. Now Schröder is reportedly resigning from politics, but while he may not be in the next government, his withdrawal comes at a high price for the Christian Democrats (&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany"&gt;CDU&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Social%20Union%20in%20Bavaria"&gt;CSU&lt;/a&gt;). 

The Social Democrats (SPD) will take eight minister posts, against six for the CDU/CSU. But who will occupy these posts has yet to be determined. Beside various rumors in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, it has only been confirmed so far that the current &lt;a href="w%3ABavaria"&gt;Bavarian&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href="w%3AEdmund%20Stoiber"&gt;Edmund Stoiber&lt;/a&gt; will take over as minister for economy and technology. The agreement, negotiated between Schröder, Merkel, Stoiber, and SPD chair &lt;a href="w%3AFranz%20M%C3%BCntefering"&gt;Franz Müntefering&lt;/a&gt;, has already been approved by both parties' leadership committees.

Official negotiations for all the details of the future coalition are scheduled to begin next Monday and are expected to last until at least November 12.

The early federal election on September 18 produced an effective stalemate as both CDU/CSU and the SPD got approximately the same votes, with CDU/CSU having a narrow lead of 4 seats in the &lt;a href="w%3ABundestag"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;. Neither party was able to form a coalition with their preferred partner, &lt;a href="w%3AFree%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Germany%29"&gt;FDP&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20%2790/The%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, forcing them to enter talks to form a grand coalition.

The sets and props of popular &lt;a href="w%3Aclaymation"&gt;claymation&lt;/a&gt; characters &lt;a href="w%3AWallace%20and%20Gromit"&gt;Wallace and Gromit&lt;/a&gt; have been destroyed in a warehouse blaze this morning in &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;.

The disaster comes only days after the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; release of &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Park"&gt;Nick Park&lt;/a&gt;'s latest film featuring the characters, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Curse%20Of%20The%20Were-Rabbit"&gt;The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, which topped the box office chart and took &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;16.1 million (&lt;a href="w%3APound%20Sterling"&gt;GB£&lt;/a&gt;9.1 million) over the weekend. The film is scheduled for UK release this Friday.

Sets and models from the new film escaped as they had not yet been added to the &lt;a href="w%3AAardman%20Animation"&gt;Aardman Animation&lt;/a&gt; collection hosted in Bristol. Among the damage caused by the blaze, the character &lt;a href="w%3AMorph%20%28character%29"&gt;Morph&lt;/a&gt; was lost; for many UK children the appearance of this character in &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Hart"&gt;Tony Hart&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; art programmes was their first introduction to &lt;a href="w%3Astop%20motion"&gt;stop motion&lt;/a&gt; animation.

The warehouse, located near Bristol's central railway station, dated from the &lt;a href="w%3AVictorian%20era"&gt;Victorian era&lt;/a&gt; and was formerly part of &lt;a href="w%3AIsmbard%20Kingdom%20Brunel"&gt;Ismbard Kingdom Brunel&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Western%20Railway"&gt;Great Western Railway&lt;/a&gt;. 

Ten fire crews attended the blaze, in which flames shot 100ft into the air, from 0600 BST into the afternoon, but were unable to prevent the collapse of the roof, interior walls and all three floors of the building.

An investigation will begin once the building has been made safe.

The government of &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; blocked access to &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s Web &lt;a href="w%3Ablog"&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; service &lt;a href="w%3ABlogger"&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;'s photo sharing website &lt;a href="w%3AFlickr"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, and the diary service &lt;a href="w%3ALiveJournal"&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt; as well as some other websites through their nationally run Internet Services Unit (ISU) last Tuesday. As a result, English-speaking Saudis were prevented from publishing blogs, reading journals, or viewing pictures on Flickr.

The Saudi Arabian government uses a filtering service provided by the United States-owned company &lt;a href="http%3A//www.securecomputing.com/"&gt;Secure Computing&lt;/a&gt;. Similar blocking services have been implemented in other countries, such as &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;The People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt;.

In the past, the ISU had, on and off, blocked access to BlogSpot.com's free hosting service. However, according to activist organization &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, "blog services [applications] had not until now been affected by the ISU's filters. The complete blocking of blogger.com, which is one of the biggest blog tools on the market, is extremely worrying. Only China had so far used such an extreme measure to censor the Internet."

On Thursday, access to Blogger.com was restored, but Flickr and LiveJournal remained inaccessible. The ISU did not release any public statement about the blocking or restoration of service to any specific website.

Members of the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Media%20Guild"&gt;Canadian Media Guild&lt;/a&gt; voted overwhelmingly to accept a tentative deal with &lt;a href="w%3ACBC"&gt;Canadian Broadcast Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (CBC) management after a seven week &lt;a href="w%3Alockout%20%28industry%29"&gt;lockout&lt;/a&gt;. The Guild reported 3,514 ballots were cast and 88.4 per cent voted in favour of ratification during their 9 October ballot. Most of the 5,500 unionized workers are expected to be returning to work on Tuesday.

The deal caps contract workers at 9.5 per cent of the full-time work force. The issue of the employer insisting on a larger number of non-guild members lead the union to vote in favour of a strike in early August.

On 15 August the CBC effectively shut down its English-language programming outside of &lt;a href="w%3AFredericton"&gt;Fredericton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Brunswick"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt;, and its French language service outside of &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;.

The negotiated agreement includes an individual signing bonus of $1,000, as well as allowing for wage increases of 12.6% over the life of the contract (over the complete period of the contract, to 31 March 2009.)

♡❤&lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ announced in its blog Sunday the beginning of a public beta test of its new Podcast search service. The new service makes it easier for people to find and listen to podcasts.

Podcasts are short downloadable audio shows, very similar to a radio show. Podcasts are most commonly downloaded to portable mp3 players such as the iPod for which they are named, but they can be listened to on a computer or burned to a CD as well.

“Yahoo Podcasts offers a comprehensive directory of podcast series and individual shows from across the web, complete with detailed search results, most popular and highest-rated lists, editorial picks, and a full collection of tools you can use. These community tools include ratings, reviews, and the ability to tag audio content, or view the tags that other people add,” Lee Ott wrote in the Yahoo blog. 

♡❤Yahoo!♡❤ is the first the large web company to offer a podcast search services. Podcast search is currently offered by several smaller websites including Podcast.net, Blinkx, and Odeo. 

“This is something we’ve been working on for a while, it’s a great way for people to find, listen to, and consume podcasts as they grow more popular.” said ♡❤Yahoo!♡❤ spokesperson Meagan Busath.

A &lt;a href="CBS"&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; opinion poll has reported that 55% of Americans disapprove of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;' position in the &lt;a href="War%20in%20Iraq"&gt;War in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. A separate poll published by ♡❤The Pew Research Center♡❤ found that 43% of Americans supported an immediate withdrawal of US troops from &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, an increase from 36% of Americans who were polled last October.

In addition, an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIpsos"&gt;Ipsos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; /&lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; poll of 1,000 Americans showed that 47% of those polled have a "strong disapproval" of the way &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has been handling the war, compared to 21% who "strongly approve".

As a result of the investigation into the misappropriation of approximately one &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Abillion"&gt;billion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;United States dollars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i government has issued warrants for the arrest of the former defense minister, Hazem Shaalan, and 27 other senior officials from the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-sponsored &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraqi%20Interim%20Government"&gt;interim government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIyad%20Allawi"&gt;Iyad Allawi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

It is alleged that the missing funds were embezzled during corrupt military procurement procedures that left Iraqi defence forces with sub-standard equipment. Contracts were over-priced and cash was moved abroad to pay for the outdated equipment; this was in effect a money laundering scheme.

Many of those wanted in connection with the embezzlement are believed to have fled the country; Iraqi officials are seeking assistance from &lt;a href="Interpol"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt; to track down suspects. The ex-defense minister is believed to be in Jordan; the Iraqi government met on Monday with the intention to strip Shaalan of the immunity he is afforded as a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALegislator"&gt;Legislator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This action failed as the parliament did not have a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aquorum"&gt;quorum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The US news agency ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is reporting that the recent &lt;a href="Threat%20on%20New%20York%20City%20subway%20system%20heightens%20security%20alert%20level"&gt;New York subway terrorist threat&lt;/a&gt; this past weekend was based on "false information." The original tip lead to the arrest of three men in Iraq with suspected ties to the plot; however, under interrogation which included lie detector tests, investigators discovered they had no knowledge of any planned terror attacks on the New York subway system.

The (DHS) was skeptical of the threat since it was first announced last week. More recently, Russ Knocke, a spokesman for the DHS, said "The intelligence community has been able to determine that there are very serious doubts about the credibility of this specific threat."

Responding to the new comments from the DHS, New York City replied, "We've got to take every threat seriously and that is what we are going to do." Even before the new questions about the tip's accuracy, Mayor Bloomberg was already defending his decision to increase security and promised that the measures will remain in place for at least the near future. Mayor Bloomberg explained that, while he did not believe he made a mistake in calling for increased security, "If I'm going to make a mistake you can rest assured it is on the side of being cautious." New York City Police Commissioner &lt;a href="Raymond%20Kelly"&gt;Raymond Kelly&lt;/a&gt; agreed, adding, "We did exactly the right thing." Critics of Bloomberg have charged that the threat was a bid to "look strong" in support for his upcoming re-election attempt.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanberra%2C%20Australia"&gt;Canberra, Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
&lt;a href="w%3ABarnaby%20Joyce"&gt;Barnaby Joyce&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt; member of Parliament &lt;a href="w%3Acrossing%20the%20floor"&gt;crossed the floor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; October 11 over legislation proposed to permit mergers without the agreement of the competition watchdog body, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Competition%20and%20Consumer%20Commission"&gt;Australian Competition and Consumer Commission&lt;/a&gt;. He has not, however, changed his party membership.

The question over the proposed changes was put at 9.26pm when Joyce crossed the floor to vote against them. The vote was tied with 32 for and 32 against and thus the question was not carried by the government (the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20Australian%20Senate"&gt;President of the Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; does not hold the casting vote as in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Australian House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;).

The &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;/National Party coalition of which Joyce is a member holds a narrow majority of one seat in the Senate and Joyce has stated that he has chosen to exercise his vote in support of the promises made to his electorate prior to the election, rather than be obedient to the directions of the party executive. This is the first time Joyce, a recently elected senator, has crossed the floor in the Senate, and Joyce has suggested that this may not be 
the last.

Forces from the &lt;a href="w%3ASudanese"&gt;Sudanese&lt;/a&gt; rebel group, the &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20and%20Equality%20Movement"&gt;Justice and Equality Movement&lt;/a&gt; (JEM), have assisted in liberating 38 &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; (AU) personnel that were taken hostage on Sunday. The kidnapped&amp;ndash;which consisted of the original 18 hostages, and later a 20 man rescue team&amp;ndash;were released on Monday. Initially, two hostages remained but were freed following a reported shootout with the kidnappers.

A splinter group of JEM was blamed for the attack, but Mohamed Saleh, the head of the dissident faction, has denied the allegations. 

Saleh was the military head of JEM when it signed a ceasefire agreement in April, but later split with the group's leadership. It is said that he now commands "thousands" of troops in the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region, and is looking for a seat at the ongoing peace talks. He accused the AU of taking sides, and stated that he will not honour the ceasefire.

While speaking with Reuters, Saleh said, "We want the AU to leave, and we have warned them not to travel to our areas. We don't know and don't care what is happening to the AU, they are part of the conflict now."

Violence in the region has continued to rise. According to &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; correspondent Jonah Fisher, hostilities toward AU peacekeepers are becoming more common. It has been noted that aid agencies are refusing to travel with African Union personnel, stating that the mere presence of the peacekeepers may draw fire.

&lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, at a press conference in Geneva, responded to the rising violence by suggesting aid to the region may be partially suspended. "Both rebels and government must understand that, if these incidents continue, it will impede humanitarian assistance and delivery." 

This weekend marked the first time the African Union has suffered casualties in the region. Three personnel were killed in attacks believed to be perpetrated by the &lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20Liberation%20Army"&gt;Sudan Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; (SLA). Despite the violence, the SLA, JEM, and the AU have promised to continue the peace talks which are being held in &lt;a href="w%3AAbuja"&gt;Abuja&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News%20Online"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; has successfully launched its second manned space flight, &lt;a href="w%3AShenzhou%206"&gt;♡❤Shenzhou VI♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

The mission is more ambitious than the previous &lt;a href="w%3AShenzhou%205"&gt;♡❤Shenzhou V♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which made China only the third nation to launch a manned space mission. ♡❤Shenzhou VI♡❤ will carry two &lt;a href="w%3Aastronaut"&gt;astronaut&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href="w%3ANie%20Haisheng"&gt;Nie Haisheng&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFei%20Junlong"&gt;Fei Junlong&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the previous mission which only carried a single astronaut, &lt;a href="w%3AYang%20Liwei"&gt;Yang Liwei&lt;/a&gt;. The newest astronauts will also stay in orbit longer, five days compared to the 21 hour, 14 orbit flight of ♡❤Shenzhou V♡❤.

The director of the Chinese Space Crew Training program, &lt;a href="w%3AChen%20Shanguang"&gt;Chen Shanguang&lt;/a&gt;, explained to the media that the country would send a woman to Space within five years. "Women are more patient compared with male astronauts, their psychological qualities are more stable and they face isolation better," according to Chen.

The &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;, has filed criminal and civil suits against Manager Media Group plc, the publisher of a Thai-language daily newspaper, Phujadkarn (Manager). At issue is the publishing of a sermon by the well-respected &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhist"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; monk Luangta Maha Bua that compared the Thai Prime minister to Phra Devadhat, the Thai Buddhist equivalent of the devil. 

Mr Sinawatra's lawyer, Noppadol Meewanna, filed the two lawsuits on the Prime Minister's behalf, citing the newspaper, manager Saowalak Theeranuchanyon, and editor Khunthong Loseriwanit as defendants. This civil suit demands 500 million baht (approx. 12 million US dollars or 10 million euros). The associated criminal case seeks to have charges of libel brought against the defendants. The complaint argues that the defendants should have edited the sermon text to remove potentially libellous sections.

Deputy Prime Minister, Wissanu Krean-gam, stated that there was no active policy of persecuting the media and that Mr Sinawatra was acting in a personal capacity in bringing these cases.

The criminal case is due to be reviewed on November 18, when it will be decided if there are grounds for taking it to trial. If the court finds against the defendants they face a maximum penalty of up to two years in prison and up to 200,000 baht (approx. 5,000 US dollars or 4,000 euros) in fines.

While Aid starts to pour in to the worst hit areas of South Asia Earthquake that has killed more than 30,000 people, bad weather is hampering the relief efforts with snow falling on the peaks of the earthquake-devastated areas of Pakistan.

The measure of human suffering can't just be measured in the death toll, which officially stands at 23,000, but also in the 4 million who have been made homeless, hungry, and cold with 1 million in acute need, facing certain death without outside assistance. In the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, authorities say at least 1,300 people are known to have died, but officials fear the number will rise.

ABC Australia reports of a man in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, who has been cut from aid, saying "I find that we are alone now. We have nothing. We are finished."

Choppers are the main lifeline of support; trucks are unable to deliver relief supplies due to looting and general mayhem on the ground. The more snow, the less able aid agencies are to make their way to those in the direst need.

Jan Vandemoortele, U.N. Resident Coordinator for Pakistan, said key roads into the quake zone have been reopened, as 30 countries including Australia, France, Japan, Jordan, China, Russia, Iran, Syria and the US provide assistance in the form of money, doctors, tents, blankets, and disaster relief teams.

United Nations officials are warning of a growing threat of measles, cholera, and diarrhea outbreaks among the millions of survivors.

There have been no reports of epidemic outbreaks so far, but the area's health infrastructure has completely collapsed, Vandemoortele said.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASyrian%20Interior%20Ministery"&gt;Interior Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGhazi%20Kanaan"&gt;Ghazi Kanaan&lt;/a&gt;, has committed &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;according to the official &lt;a href="w%3ASyrian%20News%20Agency"&gt;Syrian News Agency&lt;/a&gt; SANA. The suicide has caused much controversy, as some Middle Eastern analysts suggest he may have been executed as a sacrificial lamb.

Kanaan had been under investigation two weeks earlier by a &lt;a href="w%3AU.N."&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; team probing the &lt;a href="w%3Aassassination"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt; of former &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik al-Hariri&lt;/a&gt;. The assassination of Hariri took place on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 1000 kg of &lt;a href="w%3ATNT"&gt;TNT&lt;/a&gt; were detonated as his motorcade drove past the St. George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told CNN that he was not aware of any evidence suggesting Hariri's death was not suicide. "If indeed there is a Syrian national implicated in it, he would be considered a traitor and most severely punished," the President said.

"The minister of interior died in his office this afternoon after committing suicide, and the authorities are investigating the incident," the SANA report stated. It is reported that the suicide was carried out by shooting himself in the mouth.

Earlier in the day, Kanaan went on Lebanese radio station, &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20of%20Lebanon"&gt;Voice of Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, denying that he showed the U.N. investigators cheques paid to him by the late Hariri. Kanaan was Syria's most powerful intelligence chief in Lebanon, which was ruled by Syria until its military withdrawal earlier this year. He returned to &lt;a href="w%3ADamascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 as political intelligence chief and joined the &lt;a href="w%3Acabinet"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A2004"&gt;2004&lt;/a&gt;. 

The UN report on Hariri's assassination is expected to be out at the end of October. The UN investigator, Detlev Mehlis, questioned senior Syrian officials in Damascus during a visit at the end of September. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; froze Kanaan's assets in the country during July saying he had aided &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;.

Some parties have suggested that Kanaan's death was arranged to protect others involved in the assassination of Hariri, thus preempting action against others as a result of the pending UN report.

The lawyer for one of the members of the so called &lt;a href="w%3ABali%209"&gt;Bali Nine&lt;/a&gt; is claiming he will challenge the legality of the indictment against his client. 

Adnan Wirawan, the lawyer of Martin Stephens from &lt;a href="w%3AWollongong"&gt;Wollongong&lt;/a&gt;, says his client has been unfairly accused as being the ring leader of an alleged &lt;a href="w%3Aconspiracy"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; to smuggle drugs: "He's a human suitcase... he was being told what to do." 

Stephens appeared in &lt;a href="w%3ADenpasar"&gt;Denpasar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20Court"&gt;District Court&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. The prosecution claimed that Stephens and Renae Lawrence, from Newcastle, had their hotel and trip to &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; paid for by the accused mastermind, Andrew Chan.

Stephens' mother, Michelle, was in court for her son's first appearance and says she will support him throughout his trial: "I'm here to support my son, and I love him and I believe in him. And that's all I can say."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — A US government report was issued Wednesday predicting the rise of heating bills due to colder temperatures and impacts Hurricanes &lt;a href="w%3ARita"&gt;Rita&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKatrina"&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt; had on the nation's energy production. 

Local forecasters predict that most of the US will have a warmer-than-expected winter this year. However, households that heat their homes by gas can expect to pay 29.8% more in heating bills. In the case of colder-than-expected weather, an increase of 66% in household heating costs is likely. In typical weather, prices will rise about 47.6%. Households that use &lt;a href="w%3Aelectricity"&gt;electricity&lt;/a&gt; can expect a rise of about 5% from last year. &lt;a href="w%3ANOAA"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http%3A//www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2005/s2520.htm"&gt;2005-2006 U.S. Winter Outlook&lt;/a&gt; calls for warmer-than-normal temperatures across much of the central and western United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. The Midwest, the Southern Californian coast and the East Coast have equal chances of warmer, cooler or near-normal temperatures this winter.

Around one third of the US &lt;a href="w%3Acrude%20oil"&gt;crude oil&lt;/a&gt; and one fifth of the natural gas outputs in &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; still remain closed due to hurricane-related damage. Seven oil refineries remain offline. 

The Energy Information Administration predicts that the price of oil will rise to around $64 per barrel (42 gallons or 158.97 litres) in 2006, with $58 being the average for this year.

&lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVeriSign"&gt;VeriSign&lt;/a&gt; announced an agreement late Monday for eBay to acquire VeriSign’s debit and credit card processing division. This division would become a part of eBay’s &lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;.

eBay will pay VeriSign $370 million in cash and stock for this division. Starting in the coming year eBay will begin using two-factor authentication from VeriSign. &lt;a href="w%3ATwo-factor%20authentication"&gt;Two-factor authentication&lt;/a&gt; is a type of transaction protection that gives users &lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20certificates"&gt;digital certificates&lt;/a&gt; or one-time passwords helping to protect against &lt;a href="w%3Aidentity%20theft"&gt;identity theft&lt;/a&gt;.

"This acquisition allows PayPal to give our customers more choice in payment services and grow our merchant services business even more quickly," said president of PayPal Jeff Jordan.

"In working with PayPal and eBay, we are going to be offering them our security technology, allowing them to offer their users stronger forms of authentication," said VeriSign CEO Stratton Sclavos.

Last year VeriSign's gateway business processed $40 billion in transactions. It is expected to generate an additional $100-million revenue for eBay in 2006. It is also expected to increase the customer base by 100,000. The acquisition is expected to close this quarter.

The Exam Board of &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; handled many complaints about the incorrectly written math question on an end-of-the-year &lt;a href="w%3Aexamination"&gt;examination&lt;/a&gt;.

The Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) are taken nationwide and determine what secondary school students enter. The students get into &lt;a href="w%3Asecondary"&gt;secondary&lt;/a&gt; schools based on merit. Based on this system, Singaporeans commonly determine how 'smart' a student is based on what school they got into.

"This is ridiculous," said a secondary student.

Question 13 of the &lt;a href="w%3AMath"&gt;Math&lt;/a&gt; exam required students to calculate the &lt;a href="w%3Aarea"&gt;area&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3Arectangle"&gt;rectangle&lt;/a&gt; C based on the area of &lt;a href="w%3Atriangle"&gt;triangles&lt;/a&gt; A and B. The dimensions of the rectangle of which the triangles were in and the triangles themselves are inconsistent. Based on these calculations, it is mathematically impossible to draw that diagram.

All students have been given two marks regardless of their answer. However, some parents and students in top schools remain unsatisfied.

"I do not think it is fair because those who got it correct, actually it will still be the same with the others. They don't deserve it and maybe we do," said one student. "A lot of people might have spent a lot of time on that question and not have time to check on the other questions but then everyone gets two marks. 89 is an A and 91 is an A*, so there is quite a lot of difference." 

Another student in the Gifted Education Programme insisted, "Well, if you get the second answer (not 25) the first time you attempt the question, you will naturally try using another method to find the answer. Say you get 25 on the second time, which is the correct answer, and 25 is the only answer you get that is inside the options, you will put your answer as 25. Therefore, I think that the SEAB should not award 2 free marks to everybody. It's unfair! Plus, the question was so easy."

Other students were happy with the compensation. "I'm very very happy that they are giving us two marks." 

The Exam Board stated that it had carried out at least 5 rounds of checks by experienced examiners. It also assured parents and students all exams would be thoroughly checked to be error-free in the future.

Internet rivals &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; have agreed to make their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainstant%20messaging"&gt;instant messaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; programs, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%20Messenger"&gt;Yahoo Messenger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMSN%20Messenger"&gt;MSN Messenger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , work together. Instant messaging, or IM as it commonly known, is becoming an increasingly popular communication service, mainly because of the speed of communication which almost equals regular conversation.

This move, announced on Wednesday, would mainly focus on earlier forms of instant messaging, like sending text messages to other people via the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. This arrangement is expected to start around June 2006.

The agreement will allow the companies to compete against the popular &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAIM"&gt;AOL Instant Messenger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; service (&lt;a href="AOL"&gt;AOL&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Talk"&gt;Google Talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s relatively new instant messaging service that was opened to the public in beta form in September. The companies said that this relationship is the fruit of many years of negotiation.

Until now, AOL has been able to move and develop the IM market at its own pace, due to its widespread use within the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. With this arrangement in place, this freedom might end. The number of users of the Yahoo! and Microsoft services combined will rival the number of AOL's customers.

Microsoft had previously held talks with AOL over possible partnerships in the instant messaging field. However, the status of these negotiations is unknown.

A last minute Constitutional Deal has been struck that brings one Sunni Party into the political mainstream and approval from the US Government. The Iraqi Islamic Party, has decided on Tuesday to support the New Constitution. According to a Party source, "Some of our demands have been met so the Party endorsed the Constitution and urged the people to vote, 'Yes'." Iraq's parliament has moved immediately to ratify the changes just days before the nationwide constitutional referendum on October 15th.

The Bush administration has welcomed the news as a breakthrough; State Department spokesman Adam Ereli has said the Agreement, "Shows, frankly, that the political process in Iraq is working."

Most Sunni political groups have maintained their opposition to the constitution and are urging either a boycott or a "No" vote on Saturday, arguing that the charter could break up the state and hand too much power to Shi'ites and Kurds.

On Wednesday, &lt;a href="Apple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; introduced an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; capable of displaying video, as well as a new video section to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; music store. Apple CEO &lt;a href="Steve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; believes that this may have a large impact on the film industry, in a similar fashion to that of the impact on the music industry when the iPod first was released.

The new iPod comes in a 30GB edition and a 60GB edition for US$299 and US$399, respectively. On the 30GB iPod, 75 hours of video at a resolution of 320x240 can be stored, and on the 60GB iPod, 150 hours can be stored. Despite these features, people claim that the screen may be too small for people to enjoy. However, iPod owners will be able to purchase an optional S-Video cable for playing video from their iPod on a television.

To help complement the new video section, Apple and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AABC%20%28US%29"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have agreed to a deal in which episodes of television programs such as ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALost%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADesperate%20Housewives"&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ will be available the day after airing for $1.99 per episode. Other plans for the video section involve the animation company &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APixar"&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which was founded by current Apple CEO Steve Jobs. There are also plans to distribute content from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Walt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Pixar's distributor and owner of ABC. In addition, music videos will also be available at the on-line music store for $1.99 each.
<h3>New iMac G5</h3>
The video iPod was announced along with a new model of its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiMac"&gt;iMac G5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which features a remote control that allows the iMac to act as a home media center as well as a normal personal computer. To control media center capabilities, the new iMac is sold with a program called ♡❤Front Row♡❤. Some customers have complained however that this iMac is missing functionality out-of-the-box that allows a user to watch TV on it.

The new iMac also has an Apple &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AiSight"&gt;iSight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; digital camera built-in as well as a thinner design than its predecessor.

Clashes between gunmen and police have broken out in the capital of the southern &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; republic of &lt;a href="w%3AKabardino-Balkaria"&gt;Kabardino-Balkaria&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechen&lt;/a&gt; rebels claimed responsibility for the insurgency. 

The fighting in &lt;a href="w%3ANalchik"&gt;Nalchik&lt;/a&gt; started after a coordinated set of attacks were carried out against city security forces and police stations. The airport and government buildings were also targeted. The strike is believed to have come from anywhere between 60 to 500 insurgents. The insurgents used heavy arms fire, coupled with explosions at the outset, that lasted five hours. A police station has been captured and hostages taken.

According to reports from Russian press sources, 61 of the gunmen have been killed and 17 have been captured, and there may be dozens of civilian casualties. Seven policemen were also killed. Several government buildings throughout the city are on fire and some schools have been involved and evacuated accordingly.

Russian president &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; has ordered the army to seal off the city and shoot any insurgent who tries to escape. Officials in the city are saying the situation is slowly returning to normal.

<h1>US extradition request blocked by Dutch court</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20extradition%20request%20blocked%20by%20Dutch%20court&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Citing concerns over the suspect's rights, a court in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hague"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt; has blocked the extradition of a man with dual &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; nationality. 

The lawsuit was started after the Dutch Minister of Justice, &lt;a href="w%3APiet%20Hein%20Donner"&gt;Piet Hein Donner&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to the extradition. The suspect has apparently been in custody for the past eight months pending his extradition. The court ruled that, following changes in US law after the September 11 attacks of 2001, he could not be guaranteed unrestricted access to a lawyer, and there was the possibility that due to alleged &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; links he could be detained indefinitely without trial.

A note provided by &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; diplomats was not viewed by the district court as adequate assurance of the suspect's right to due process; the Embassy had protested the requirement of assurances and qualified their statement to the court in specifying that a suspect would receive the rights laid out in the U.S. constitution when "at their trial".

The man, who was only identified by his initials, MA, is accused of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud with the aim of aiding the al-Qaeda terrorist network.

<h1>Trial of Saddam Hussein to be televised</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Trial%20of%20Saddam%20Hussein%20to%20be%20televised&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
As the start date of the former &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i leader's trial approaches, the chief judge of the tribunal has stated that the fate of &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; will be broadcast on live television. In a statement to &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, Iraqi national security advisor Muwaffaq Rubaie said that "...this is going to be a fair, just trial with a defense counsel in there, with a proper prosecuting council as well there..."

The first charge, filed earlier this month, alleges Hussein's responsibility in the 1982 killing of 143 residents of &lt;a href="w%3ADujail"&gt;Dujail&lt;/a&gt;, in which he was the target of a botched assassination attempt. The details of other charges are unclear.

The tribunal, which was set up in December 2003, has been marred by delays. There are accusations of bias from the defense council of Hussein, as well as fears for the judges' safety which have consistently pushed the trial back. The defense team has challenged the tribunal's legitimacy and stated they have not been given enough time to prepare.

This concern has been echoed in the past by some human rights groups, "It's really critical that it's done right," says Michael Posner, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. "For those who believe in international justice and accountability for human rights crimes, the trial of Saddam Hussein is a rare opportunity to test the system and make it work."

Many Iraqis, particularly &lt;a href="w%3AShia"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; and Kurdish, want to see Hussein tried for chemical gas attacks on the &lt;a href="w%3AKurds"&gt;Kurds&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s. In 1988, one of these chemical attacks killed as many as 5,000 people. As well, many Iraqis want Hussein punished for reprisals against a Shia uprising in 1991.

The crimes that the special tribunal will focus on include:

<ul>
BULLET::::- A mortar attack on the city of &lt;a href="w%3AKirkuk"&gt;Kirkuk&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- The killing of 8,000 members of the Barzani tribe, a Kurdish community.
BULLET::::- The invasion of &lt;a href="w%3AKuwait"&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt; in 1990.
BULLET::::- Crimes against secular and religious parties.
BULLET::::- Forced emigration of thousands of Kurds from northern Iraq into &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
Hussein's strategy for defense was outlined by defense team member Abdul Haq al-Ani, as reported by Dan Senor, as consisting of four "pillars":

<ul>
BULLET::::- The first argues that the invasion of Iraq was illegal and as such, Saddam Hussein is still legally president. If so, then under the Saddam era constitution he is entitled to immunity.
BULLET::::- The second suggests that Hussein's alleged war crimes were no different than &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s response to 9/11: A response to &lt;a href="w%3Ainsurrection"&gt;insurrection&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- The third pillar is to call Bush, &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush"&gt;George H.W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; to testify. It will attempt to highlight the support the United States gave to Iraq in the 1980s.
BULLET::::- The fourth will be to present an unflattering portrayal of American foreign policy.

</ul>
The trial is set to begin on Wednesday, October 19th.

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; recently hired Sean Egan, the lead developer of &lt;a href="w%3AGaim"&gt;Gaim&lt;/a&gt;, an open source instant messenger, in an apparent bid to improve their &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Talk"&gt;Google Talk&lt;/a&gt; messenger's interoperability. The news follows a recent announcement by Microsoft and Yahoo that the two companies plan to allow their instant messengers to interoperate. Google Talk is based on &lt;a href="w%3AJabber"&gt;Jabber&lt;/a&gt; technology, which is an open standard which any instant messenger can be programmed to interoperate with. The Gaim instant messaging client, as of the most recent version (1.5.0), can communicate on &lt;a href="w%3AAIM"&gt;AIM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AICQ"&gt;ICQ&lt;/a&gt; (Oscar protocol), &lt;a href="w%3AMSN%20Messenger"&gt;MSN Messenger&lt;/a&gt;, Yahoo!, &lt;a href="w%3AIRC"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJabber"&gt;Jabber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGadu-Gadu"&gt;Gadu-Gadu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASILC"&gt;SILC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGroupWise%20Messenger"&gt;GroupWise Messenger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AZephyr"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt; networks. Gaim is cross-platform, with versions available for &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABSD"&gt;BSD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMacOS%20X"&gt;MacOS X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AWindows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Ubuntu releases third version of popular Linux distribution</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ubuntu%20releases%20third%20version%20of%20popular%20Linux%20distribution&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUbuntu%20Foundation"&gt;Ubuntu Foundation&lt;/a&gt; released its third version of the popular &lt;a href="w%3AGNU/Linux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; operating system distribution yesterday. Codenamed "Breezy Badger", the release improves on its predecessor, Hoary Hedgehog, with updated versions of packages such as &lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt;, new computer management tools, special installation modes for computer manufacturers, and a "&lt;a href="w%3Athin%20client"&gt;thin client&lt;/a&gt;" mode for large networks of homogenous computers. The new version also improves support for laptop computers, portable media players, &lt;a href="w%3ABluetooth"&gt;Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt; devices, &lt;a href="w%3APowerPC"&gt;PowerPC&lt;/a&gt; processors, and other hardware.

Because the software in the GNU/Linux operating system comes with permission for everyone to modify and redistribute it, there are many versions (called "distributions") of the operating system available. Ubuntu builds on the popular &lt;a href="w%3ADebian%20GNU/Linux"&gt;Debian GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt; distribution. Like Debian, it is made almost entirely of &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt;.

Users quickly swarmed the Ubuntu Foundation's servers trying to download the new version. The servers are currently responding slowly; moderators at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ubuntuforums.org"&gt;Ubuntu Forums&lt;/a&gt; suggested that users download with &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; if at all possible, which is much less prone to such slowdowns.

Although its first release was only a year ago, &lt;a href="w%3AUbuntu%20Linux"&gt;Ubuntu Linux&lt;/a&gt; has quickly become one of the most popular Linux distributions. It is intended to be user-friendly without being insecure by design, a charge sometimes leveled against other beginner-friendly distributions like &lt;a href="w%3ALinspire"&gt;Linspire&lt;/a&gt;. The distribution is offered for free, and CDs are available for order via the Internet without charge (including shipping).

Chinese archaeologists at the &lt;a href="w%3ALajia%20Ruins"&gt;Lajia Ruins&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AQinghai"&gt;Qinghai province&lt;/a&gt; of China have discovered well-preserved &lt;a href="w%3AMillet"&gt;millet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANoodle"&gt;noodles&lt;/a&gt; dating back to the &lt;a href="w%3ANeolithic"&gt;neolithic age&lt;/a&gt;. The 4,000-year-old noodles were found underneath an upturned bowl that had been buried in three meters of sediment, consisting of brownish-yellow clay. The sediment is thought to have been caused by a devastating flood of the upper &lt;a href="w%3AMekong"&gt;Mekong&lt;/a&gt;.

This discovery significantly reframes the debate over which people first made noodles, establishing Chinese culture&amp;mdash;at least for now&amp;mdash;as the most likely candidate for having originally developed the idea of making noodles. Previously, Italian, Chinese, and Arab cultures have all been claimed as the originator of noodles. Prior to this discovery, the oldest record of noodles existing in China were from 1900-year-old recipes.

The Lajia Ruins are of a central &lt;a href="w%3AQijia"&gt;Qijia&lt;/a&gt; settlement, which has been the site of other significant discoveries, such as the largest &lt;a href="w%3AChime%20stone"&gt;stone chime&lt;/a&gt; ever found in China, and the largest and most intact prehistoric oven found in Northwestern China. The site has also been significant to researchers studying the impact of natural disasters on ancient civilizations&amp;mdash;it was the site of a cataclysmic flood, and at least one major earthquake.

<h1>Bush has a rehearsed tele-conference with US troops in Iraq</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%20has%20a%20rehearsed%20tele-conference%20with%20US%20troops%20in%20Iraq&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The live presidential video teleconference held Thursday by &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; troops stationed in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; drew fire from critics and even some Pentagon military leaders. Pentagon officials defended the teleconference, saying that the soldiers stated their own opinions.

An on-camera shot before the teleconference went live showed Allison Barber, the deputy assistant defense secretary, coaching 10 soldiers on broad topics to which the president would want questions directed; then rehearsed their actions on camera and reminded them of what questions were assigned to each soldier. 

"OK, so let's just walk through this," Barber said. "Captain Kennedy, you answer the first question and you hand the mike to whom?"

"Captain Smith," Kennedy said.

"Captain. Smith? You take the mike and you hand it to whom?" she asked.

"Captain Kennedy," the soldier replied.

Later on in the discussion:

"If the question comes up about partnering — how often do we train with the Iraqi military — who does he go to?" Barber asked.

"That's going to go to Captain Pratt," one of the soldiers said.

During the live conference, when asked about Iraq's preparations for their constitutional referendum, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Lieutenant"&gt;1st Lt.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Gregg Murphy of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said: "Sir, we are prepared to do whatever it takes to make this thing a success. ... Back in January, when we were preparing for that election, we had to lead the way. We set up the coordination, we made the plan. We're really happy to see, during the preparation for this one, sir, they're doing everything."

When asked about Iraq's training of security forces, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMaster%20Sergeant"&gt;Master Sgt.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Corine Lombardo from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScotia%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Scotia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;N.Y.&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20relations"&gt;Public Relations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; officer at the 42nd Infantry Division HQ, said to Bush: "I can tell you over the past 10 months, we've seen a tremendous increase in the capabilities and the confidences of our Iraqi security force partners. ... Over the next month, we anticipate seeing at least one-third of those Iraqi forces conducting independent operations." 

The event was coordinated with the Department of Defense, according to White House press secretary Scott McClellan. "I think all they were doing was talking to the troops and letting them know what to expect," he said. He also said that the troops were expressing their own thoughts. With satellite feeds, coordination often is needed to overcome technological challenges, such as delays, he said.

Later, Pentagon officials denied that the conference was staged. Pentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said "On behalf of these fine young men and women, we certainly regret any perception that they were told what to say. It is not the case," adding that "The soldiers were advised as to the issues they should expect to discuss, and decided among themselves who would speak to each issue as it may arise."

The director of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Truth"&gt;Operation Truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -based advocacy group for U.S. veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, described the event as a "carefully scripted publicity stunt".

"If he wants the real opinions of the troops, he can't do it in a nationally televised teleconference," Paul Rieckhoff said. "He needs to be talking to the boots on the ground and that's not a bunch of captains."

Sgt Ron Long, one of the troops interviewed, denied that it was scripted on his blog, writing "First of all, we were told that we would be speaking with the President of the United States, our Commander-in-Chief, President Bush, so I believe that it would have been totally irresponsible for us NOT to prepare some ideas, facts or comments that we wanted to share with the President.

"We were given an idea as to what topics he may discuss with us, but it's the President of the United States; He will choose which way his conversation with us may go.

"We practiced passing the microphone around to one another, so we wouldn't choke someone on live TV. We had an idea as to who we thought should answer what types of questions, unless President Bush called on one of us specifically."

<h1>Snakehead fish appear in large numbers near Potomac River</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Snakehead%20fish%20appear%20in%20large%20numbers%20near%20Potomac%20River&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A predatory non-native fish species known as the &lt;a href="w%3ASnakehead%20%28fish%29"&gt;Northern Snakehead&lt;/a&gt;, discovered 3 years ago in waters east of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Chesapeake%20Bay"&gt;Chesapeake Bay&lt;/a&gt;, were caught in quantities numbering into the 80’s on a small feeder creek of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Potomac%20River"&gt;Potomac River&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. The numbers were enough to convince some biologists that the species is here to stay, and to echo concerns over what the voracious fish will do to the natural balance of the water’s ecosystem. 

The fish were first reported by a week-end fisherman on the rain swollen Dogue Creek. An investigation by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources on Monday led to driving the fish up the normally small creek to where they were captured by large dip nets. From their appearance in televised coverage, they ranged in length from 6 to 8 inches.

Previous to this recent snakehead finding, those caught along Potomac River were not genetically descendent from the species that caused a media stir in 2002, when the fish was first discovered and gained notoriety. That discovery led to the draining of an entire pond in an effort to eradicate its habitat near &lt;a href="w%3A%20Crofton%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Crofton, Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. The slight genetic differences between the Crofton fish and those of the Potomac lends hope to the belief the Potomac fish were just another instance of their being released into the wild, and not an indication of a rapid spawning and population growth of their species. 

Little is known about the toothy fish other than it is considered a top-level predator from its native region of China, and that catches of it have been reported in lengths exceeding 20 inches on the Potomac (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/snakehead_map.pdf"&gt;.pdf map&lt;/a&gt;) below &lt;a href="w%3A%20Washington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; . Whether the fish has any natural predators within its new environs is unknown. While it is believed to be a fresh water fish, it may find the brackish water of the Chesapeake Bay tolerable, as do many other fresh water fish of the region.
Sportsman are advised to kill the fish, and not simply “bank” it, because the species, capable of living out of water for several days and crawling using its fins to propel it, is dubbed the ‘Frankenfish’ after Dr. Frankenstein's monster for this survival trait. Notify the Department of Natural Resources of any encounter with it.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanberra%2C%20Australia"&gt;Canberra, Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 

An &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; inquiry into new federal anti-terrorism laws is to take place in effectively one day, it was revealed in the Senate October 13. 

Senator &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Hill"&gt;Robert Hill&lt;/a&gt; today moved that the laws, after introduction in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Australian House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, with the report date set November 8 -- the Senate resumes sitting on November 7, after Senate estimates have been taken place, leaving either next Friday or the weekend for the inquiry to take place.

Amendments to make the date for report later were proposed: the first date of sitting in 2006 was proposed by Senator &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Bartlett"&gt;Andrew Bartlett&lt;/a&gt;, and November 28 this year was proposed by &lt;a href="w%3ANatasha%20Stott-Despoja"&gt;Natasha Stott-Despoja&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="w%3Adivision%20%28vote%29"&gt;division&lt;/a&gt; on those amendments was called for, but the vote must take place on the next day of sitting -- November 7, due to an earlier order regarding divisions on Thursday at 4.30pm. The inquiry thus cannot commence until after this date.

Senators tempers were raised and vociferously decried the little time alloted for debate on the legislation. Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Faulkner"&gt;John Faulkner&lt;/a&gt; called the situation "sheer bastardry of the government", and said "It is one of the most contemptible and despicable things I have ever seen in the time that I have been a senator in this chamber. How low can you go?". Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; has stated that in order to elucidate further Government actions, "between now and Christmas, when Senator Hill asks for leave, he will not get it. He will not get it." and later called the government "a disgrace [...] to Australia" and "a disgrace [...] to this nation."

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJulian%20McGauran"&gt;Julian McGauran&lt;/a&gt; said to Senator Stott-Despoja "you would be against [the laws] anyway." Senator Stott-Despoja replied "Don't bait me, Senator McGauran, today because I am not in the mood for it." Senator McGauran earlier this week drew the anger of Senator Stott-Despoja, who lost a friend in the September 11 attacks, by asking her "Have you once in this chamber acknowledged the war on terror?". 

The Government has defended its decision, with Senator Hill stating "Unless it is agreed, it is not going to go through. We cannot have divisions, and at least we have tried. ... Time is of the essence in this matter." and later expressed "regret that this motion has been moved with very little consultation." Senator &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Abetz"&gt;Eric Abetz&lt;/a&gt; has remarked that "on 7 November the Senate would be voting on whether or not an inquiry would be held to report the very next day. Of course, that would make a mockery of the system," and that the Opposition failing to drop the amendments "clearly indicates that the Labor Party ... are going to try to play the technical game and say, 'The government will only give us one day to deal with the issue.'"

The government of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; has issued its first &lt;a href="w%3Aexpropriation"&gt;expropriation&lt;/a&gt; order on a farm in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20West%20Province"&gt;North West Province&lt;/a&gt;.

Hannes Visser's family bought Leeuw-spruit Farm in Lichtenburg, in 1968. Until 1939, the farm had been owned by Abram Molamu. Mr Molamu's descendants successfully appealed to the Land Claims Court for return of the farm.

Mr Visser and the Land Claims Commission were unable to come to a mutually acceptable resolution.

In the November issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation,
researchers announce that they have found that &lt;a href="w%3ACannabinoids"&gt;cannabinoids&lt;/a&gt; promoted a generation of &lt;a href="w%3ANeurogenesis"&gt;new neurons&lt;/a&gt; in rats' &lt;a href="w%3AHippocampus"&gt;hippocampi&lt;/a&gt;. The study held true for both a plant-derived and a synthetic cannabinoid. The hippocampus is a part of the brain that contributes to learning and memory. In particular, it has been shown that the hippocampus is essential for the formation of new &lt;a href="w%3AEpisodic%20memory"&gt;episodic memories&lt;/a&gt;.

"This is quite a surprise, chronic use of marijuana may actually improve learning memory when the new neurons in the hippocampus can mature in two or three months," said Xia Zhang, with the Neuropsychiatry Research Unit of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Saskatchewan"&gt;University of Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt;.

"Our results were obtained from rats, and there's a big difference between rats and humans," added Zhang, "So, I really don't know yet if our findings apply to humans. But our results indicate that the clinical use of marijuana could make people feel better by helping control anxiety and depression."

Zhang and his co-workers performed behavioral tests on two purified cannabinoids. The test results indicated that these two cannabinoids have anti-anxiety and antidepression-like effects in rats that may depend on the ability of cannabinoids to promote the production of new neurons in the hippocampus. Marijuana contains a complex mixture of chemicals including cannabinoids and may have somewhat different behavioral effects than the purified cannabinoids tested so far.
Previous studies examining the effects of cannabis have highlighted negative aspects of the drug's use, such as short term memory difficulties, increased heart rate, nausea, and (in a very small percentage of people) hallucinations. Long term studies about cannabis use tend to be controversial as the data is seen to be biased or flawed. The most agreed upon effect of long term cannabis use is lung damage. However, proponents argue that the correlation between cannabis consumption and lung cancer is misleading suggesting that cannabis use may correlate with tobacco use or that the data is not being properly analyzed.

Gunshots were heard in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hague"&gt;The Hague&lt;/a&gt; on Friday morning during anti-terror raids by security officials, Dutch media reported. This was later explained by Dutch minister of justice &lt;a href="w%3APiet%20Hein%20Donner"&gt;Donner&lt;/a&gt; as being explosives used against an enforced door to gain entrance to one of the locations identified as being used by the suspects.

The Dutch news agency ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAlgemeen%20Nederlands%20Persbureau"&gt;ANP&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported that at least one of seven arrests by security officials on Friday was made in The Hague, the seat of the Dutch government, and at least one of the other arrests was made in &lt;a href="w%3AAmsterdam"&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;. Other locations where searches were being preformed include &lt;a href="w%3AAlmere"&gt;Almere&lt;/a&gt;. One of the arrested people is Samir A., who was previously arrested for being involved with terrorism.

While the raids where done the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABinnenhof"&gt;Binnenhof&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the part of The Hauge with the primary buildings of the Dutch government, were sealed from outside because of security concerns.

In the afternoon a press conference explained the reason for the raids: The suspects were trying to gain access to explosives and weapons to target the &lt;a href="w%3AAIVD"&gt;AIVD&lt;/a&gt; (Dutch intelligence agency) building and certain Dutch politicians.

British actor &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Craig"&gt;Daniel Craig&lt;/a&gt; has been confirmed as the man to follow &lt;a href="w%3APierce%20Brosnan"&gt;Pierce Brosnan&lt;/a&gt; as the sixth &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Bond"&gt;James Bond&lt;/a&gt;.

Producer Barbara Broccoli and director Martin Campbell called Craig 'a superb actor who has all the qualities needed to bring a contemporary edge to the role'.

"It is a huge iconic figure in movie history, and those things don't come along very often," Craig said. The role makes Craig the second Englishman to act as the British spy code-named ♡❤♡♡❤007♡❤♡♡❤, based on the famed literary character created by novelist &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Fleming"&gt;Ian Fleming&lt;/a&gt; in 1953.

Craig's film credits include ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARoad%20to%20Perdition"&gt;Road to Perdition&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEnduring%20Love"&gt;Enduring Love&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALayer%20Cake"&gt;Layer Cake&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASylvia"&gt;Sylvia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. On British television, his major breakthrough was a starring role in the 1996 &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; drama ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AOur%20Friends%20in%20the%20North"&gt;Our Friends in the North&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The next Bond film ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACasino%20Royale%20%282006%20film%29"&gt;Casino Royale&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ is due to film in &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ABahamas"&gt;Bahamas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APinewood%20Studios"&gt;Pinewood Studios&lt;/a&gt;.

A Vietnamese girl's case of &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; was found to be oseltamivir-resistant, where oseltamivir is the active ingredient of the anti-viral drug being marketed as &lt;a href="w%3ATamiflu"&gt;Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;.

The girl had been taking care of her brother who had caught the disease, and may have contracted it from him rather than from infected birds. She was on a low dosage of Tamiflu, and recovered when given higher doses. She had contracted a mutated form of H5N1 bird flu. 

Tests on lab animals were also found sensitive to zanamivir, marketed as &lt;a href="w%3ARelenza"&gt;Relenza&lt;/a&gt;.

Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin-Madison"&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Tokyo"&gt;University of Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; said the girl's case was "only one case, and whether that condition was something unique we don't know."

In related news, Romanian authorities have announced the bird flu virus detected in the Danube delta in eastern Europe is the same lethal H5N1 strain which struck in Asia.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Virginia%20crime%20commission%20endorses%20tougher%20dog%20law%20legislation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Commonwealth of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; pressed ahead with new dog law proposals designed to stiffen penalties against owners whose animals attack and injure people. On Wednesday, the State Crime Commission unanimously endorsed a dog law measure that would increase the criminal penalty from a class one misdemeanor to a felony offense of unlawful bodily injury, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.

The commission also proposed that police, in addition to animal control officers, be given authority to classify a dog as "dangerous". With a dog carrying that classification, tougher censorship against owners who let their dogs roam would be possible, and a felony charge against its owner would be more warranted in the event the dog should cause injury.
&lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Houck"&gt;Edward Houck&lt;/a&gt;, a senator in the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20General%20Assembly"&gt;Virginia General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, said he plans to bring the proposals for a vote during next year’s legislative session. Houck is a &lt;a href="w%3A%20Spotsylvania"&gt;Spotsylvania County&lt;/a&gt; representative where a dog owner, Deanna Large, pleaded "not guilty" to the felony charge of involuntary manslaughter in the mauling death of an elderly woman attacked by her 3 &lt;a href="w%3APit%20bull"&gt;pit bulls&lt;/a&gt;.
The crime commission did not propose legislation in the instance of injury leading to death; the issue of that criminality will be left to the court. The crime commission chairman, Ken Stolle, said he would wait to see the outcome of the circuit court trial.
At present, there is no law in Virginia to specify a particular offense by an owner whose dog(s) injure or kill a person. Lawmakers want to see if the judge, William Ledbetter Jr., finds that an involuntary manslaughter charge in the case of Large is appropriate. The trial is set to go forward on December 20 where she faces 10 years.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%27s%20highest%20court%20to%20rule%20on%20use%20of%20information%20extracted%20under%20torture&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Britain's highest court, the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Lords"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt; Judicial Committee, meets on Monday to consider the legality of the use of evidence extracted under &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; by third countries. 

The UK's &lt;a href="w%3APrevention%20of%20Terrorism%20Act%202005"&gt;Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005&lt;/a&gt; allows the government to detain foreign nationals indefinitely if there is sufficient evidence to suspect them of &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorist"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; involvement. The case now under examination centres around ten British-based foreign nationals, who have been detained under the Act's provisions.

The evidence against the detainees has not been publicised. But their lawyers claim there are grounds for believing that it may have been extracted under torture by a foreign government.
In November 2004, the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Committee%20Against%20Torture"&gt;UN Committee Against Torture&lt;/a&gt;, which monitors implementation of the Convention Against Torture, criticised Britain's refusal to rule out the use of information extracted under torture.

Britain is a state party to the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Convention%20Against%20Torture"&gt;Convention Against Torture&lt;/a&gt;, which states that the use of evidence obtained through torture can never be admitted in any court. But the Convention has not been formally adopted into British domestic law. 

Human Rights Watch today released a statement arguing that the stipulation against the use of information extracted under torture is nonetheless "binding on all states" under &lt;a href="w%3Acustomary%20international%20law"&gt;customary international law&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; and a number of &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; organisations have raised wider concerns about the case, arguing that the use of information extracted under torture amounts to condoning the use of torture. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; domestic law outlaws the use of torture. The British government officially condemns the use of torture in any circumstances. But it argues that the use by Britain of information extracted through torture by a third party may sometimes be required in order to protect the British public from acts of &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;. The British government maintains that the use of such information does not, in and of itself, condone or encourage torture.

On Saturday, the storm that blanketed the Northeast portion of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; came to an end after eight days of consecutive rain. Many areas were flooded, while some areas had very little damage. States affected by the storm were &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, parts of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AConnecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;. 

At least 10 people across the Northeast were reported dead as a result of the storm. Four more are missing.

Some areas of New Jersey had more than a foot of &lt;a href="w%3Aprecipitation"&gt;rainfall&lt;/a&gt;. Acting Governor &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Codey"&gt;Richard J. Codey&lt;/a&gt; declared a state of emergency on Friday as a first step toward applying for federal aid. The emergency was lifted on Saturday at 8:00 PM local time.

<h1>Australian Minister 'leaks' draft of anti-terror bill</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Stanhope"&gt;Jon Stanhope&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt; Chief Minister, has posted a confidential draft of the proposed Australian anti-terror bill to his website. Mr Stanhope says he hopes posting draft counter-terrorism laws on his website will open community debate about the issue and has stated that he will not comply with instructions from the Commonwealth to remove the document. The Australian Labor Party is backing his actions.

The main impetus for the action appears to be the short amount of time the Senate committee will have to debate the bill; just one day. In particular the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; has accused the Government of engineering the circumstances that only allow a one-day inquiry. 

"It was an extraordinary premeditated attack on the Senate committee system and effectively made the committee system a farce," said Senator Brown. Others, including the Australian Law Council, have expressed concerns about the scope of the proposed bill.

Prime Minister John Howard has defended the process, saying "It's important for the security of Australia, it was unanimously agreed to by me with the eight Labor premiers and chief ministers, and we can't have any undue delay that the legislation will be exposed for public scrutiny and it will reflect that agreement."

&lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Journalists"&gt;International Federation of Journalists&lt;/a&gt; have also criticised the proposed laws, saying that they will impede press freedom, "severely threaten Australians’ civil liberties and violate international law".

<h2>Concerns with the Bill</h2>

The concern with the bill has centered on a number of areas:
<ul>
BULLET::::- A so-called "shoot to kill" policy, especially in the wake of the shooting of an innocent Brazilian man in London.
BULLET::::- 14 day Preventative Detention Without Charge
BULLET::::- 5 years jail for revealing information about an ASIO detention
BULLET::::- Control Orders involving tracking devices and home detention which can be extended indefinitely
BULLET::::- The inclusion and definition of sedition, which in the bill may include "to bring the sovereign [i.e. the Queen] into hatred or contempt", or to "urge disaffection" with the Australian Government. Australian law does not protect &lt;a href="w%3Afreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt;, so this proposed law may effectively outlaw criticizing the Australian Government. It may also effectively outlaw some protests.
BULLET::::- The ability of judges to make decisions outside of the court system.
BULLET::::- 'Recklessly' providing funds to anyone who *might* be a terrorist is an offence, punishable by life imprisonment, even if they are not a terrorist

<h1>Iraq to hold constitution vote today</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iraq%20to%20hold%20constitution%20vote%20today&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Iraqis will vote on a referendum for the nation's proposed constitution today. It will be the second vote in the nation since the United States occupation. Local police and troops, as well as foreign troops will be on patrol to prevent violent insurgency. Schools, government offices, and the Baghdad airport are closed. Borders are shut to non-essential traffic. Votes are being recorded at 6000 polling stations throughout the country, even in the volotile &lt;a href="w%3AAnbar"&gt;Anbar&lt;/a&gt; province.

Interestingly, unlike the January 19, 2005 elections, in this referendum there have not been reports of provisions made for Iraqis living overseas to vote. At least one Sunni opponent of the constitution theorizes that overseas Iraqis are more secular and well-educated and would therefore be more likely to reject the constitution.

Most prominent politicians are endorsing the constitution; but some are not. President Jalal Talabani has appealed for a Yes vote, and called on Sunni insurgents to not disrupt the voting process. Dick Cheney, the United States Vice President calls it "vital to get a constitution in place." Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27ite"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; spiritual leader, as well as &lt;a href="w%3AKurdish"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; leaders are also encouraging a yes vote. The Shi'ites and Kurds make up about eighty percent of Iraq's population, so it is widely believed that the constitution will be ratified.

Election officials in Iraq say as many as 65 percent of eligible voters have turned out to vote so far. A simple majority is needed to approve the constitution. Election results are not expected for another five days.

Officials are unsure of the cause of the explosion and no group has yet claimed responsibility. This is the fourth such bombing to occur in the area -- all the bombings have occurred near the same time each month. The explosion occurred just after 7:00 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Standard%20Time"&gt;AST&lt;/a&gt; (2300 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;) outside the "Smoky and Bunty" bar along a popular strip of bars and clubs.

"This is the worst type of attack on our city and against our citizens," said Minister of National Security Martin Joseph during a press conference. Joseph also announced that five suspects were detained and being questioned by police. "What is different on this occasion is that there have been arrests."

The United States Department of State and the Canadian government have issued travel warnings in response to the recent violence in the area.

Her Royal Highness &lt;a href="w%3AMary%2C%20Crown%20Princess%20of%20Denmark"&gt;Crown Princess Mary of Denmark&lt;/a&gt; has given birth to a healthy baby boy at a Copenhagen hospital at approximately 1:57 am local time this morning, ending many months of waiting for the Royal Family, the Danish public and much of the world. The baby weighed in at 3.5 kilograms and 51 centimeters long.

The royal pregnancy was made public on 25 April 2005, and in that period, many Danes speculated the gender of the child. The Crown Princess had experienced contractions in mid-September. The royal couple has not announced his name, but it is likely to be Christian in line with Danish tradition. Since Christian II, who died in 1559, Danish kings have alternately carried the name Christian or Frederik.

The child will become heir apparent styled as HRH The Crown Prince when his parents ascend to the Danish throne as King Frederik X and Queen Mary.

&lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; – 

On 18 October 2005 at 11 am, multi-&lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20World%20Record"&gt;Guinness World Record&lt;/a&gt; holder &lt;a href="w%3ASuresh%20Joachim"&gt;Suresh Joachim&lt;/a&gt; will attempt to break the world record for the longest time in a static cycling marathon. He will attempt to pedal on the same bicycle for 100-hours at the Metrocentre in the UK, with only 15 minutes breaks every four hours.

The current record is held jointly by Niels Rietveld and Edwin Snijders, both of the Netherlands, who set the record at Sports Studio Buiten in Almere, Netherlands. The duo cycled simultaneously for 77 hours and 15 minutes, from 30 April to 3 May 2004.

If successful in his 100-hour marathon, he will beat the previous record by 22-hours and 45-minutes. The riding will hopefully cease 22 October at 3 pm.

Suresh recently beat records for longest time ironing while standing up in &lt;a href="w%3ABrampton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Brampton, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, and longest time watching television, shown on &lt;a href="w%3ALive%20with%20Regis%20and%20Kelly"&gt;Live with Regis and Kelly&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. He has over thirty other records to his name. Joachim lives in &lt;a href="w%3AMississauga%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Mississauga, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

Joachim's record attempts are used as fundraisers for the Universal Fund For Suffering Children.

The incident, which happened on &lt;a href="w%3AOctober%209"&gt;October 9&lt;/a&gt;, has not been claimed by any groups. It is unknown whether the attack, and two similar happenings earlier this year, were by a terrorist group. Some Western diplomats suggest the first two bombs were linked to business disputes or political vendettas.

The woman died in an &lt;a href="w%3Aambulance"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt;, en route to the &lt;a href="w%3Ahospital"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;. The grenade was hidden in her handbag.

Iraq's election commission announced Monday that officials were investigating "unusually high" numbers of "yes" votes in about a dozen provinces during Iraq's landmark referendum on a new constitution, raising questions about irregularities in the balloting. The Electoral Commission made no mention of fraud, and an official with knowledge of the election process cautioned that it was too early to say whether the unusual numbers were incorrect or if they would have an effect on the outcome.

The Bush administration has touted last weekend's referendum in Iraq as progress but analysts said on Monday the new constitution was too ambiguous and that violence still overshadowed Iraq's political future. Partial results from Saturday's referendum indicated a victory for the constitution the United States hopes will help stabilize Iraq and ultimately lead to 156,000 U.S. troops coming home.

The historic &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; vote on the &lt;a href="w%3AProposed%20Iraqi%20constitution"&gt;proposed draft constitution&lt;/a&gt; ended on Saturday, and ballots are now being tallied. Initial reports show the draft constitution will be supported. Security during voting day was tightened, although the U.S. military has announced that five American soldiers and a marine were killed by a bomb blast on the day of the referendum, bringing the U.S. death toll in Iraq to 1,971.

Early returns showed the vote was split as was expected along largely communal lines. Opponents failed to secure the necessary two-thirds "no" vote in any three of Iraqi's 18 provinces, according to counts that local officials provided to The Associated Press. In the crucial central provinces with mixed ethnic and religious populations, enough Shiites and Kurds voted to block the Sunni attempt to reject the constitution. Local election officials gave a picture of a strong "Yes" vote in the Shiite Muslim provinces of the south, and of a substantial "No" vote in the Sunni Arab heartlands of the north and west.

Rejection of the draft constitution appears to be impossible according to initial vote counts reported in the three key provinces that Sunni Arab opponents relied on to defeat the draft constitution. Opponents need a two-thirds "no" vote in three of those provinces. They may have reached the threshold in Anbar and Salahuddin, but Diyala and Ninevah provinces appeared to have gone strongly "Yes".

According to the Arab News, it is probable that the Iraqis have agreed to the new constitution. It is believed that its passing is almost certain because the majority, both Shiite and Kurds, supported it. The Sunnis, on the other hand, have looked at the constitution as a "death sentence." They fear that the document, drafted as it was by a Kurdish-Shiite-dominated Parliament, will ultimately divide Iraq into three separate districts: a powerful ministate of Kurds in the north, the majority Shiites in the south, both capitalizing on Iraq’s oil wealth, and the Sunnis, according to this scenario, would be left impoverished and isolated somewhere in the middle. 

President Bush referred to the vote as a victory for opponents of terrorism. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, speaking in London as the vote-count in Iraq was in progress, said the draft constitution had probably passed. Rice said later the final result was still not known. An unofficial tally is expected on Thursday and a final announcement on Oct. 24, senior electoral official Farid Ayyar stated on Sunday. It is expected that the official count will take several days.

Electoral officials estimated that as many as 10 million of Iraq's eligible 15.5 million voters cast ballots, which would yield a turnout of around 63 to 64 percent. In the January election which approved their interim government, 58 percent of voters turned out. 

President Bush said in his weekly radio address Saturday that the weekend election is a critical step forward in the quest for democracy in Iraq. For the draft constitution to be approved after the months of negotiations by lawmakers in Iraq's transitional National Assembly, a majority of voters must support it. With what is believed to be strong support in &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKurd"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; communities, who together account for more than three-quarters of the population, the 50% threshold is expected to be met. 

A rejection of the draft constitution would be viewed by coalition members as serious blow to the political evolution in Iraq that followed the U.S. led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. The transitional assembly would be dissolved, and the process of writing a new constitution would have to start all over after a new assembly could be elected in December. Regardless of the outcome, Iraq will hold parliamentary elections on December 15, the office of the President said on Sunday.

A new, permanent government, could possibly clear the way for the United States and its coalition allies to begin a withdrawal of troops from Iraq.

<h1>Riots break out at Neo-Nazi rally in Toledo, Ohio</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Riots%20break%20out%20at%20Neo-Nazi%20rally%20in%20Toledo%2C%20Ohio&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Calm has been restored after a Saturday rally held by members of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Socialist%20Movement"&gt;National Socialist Movement&lt;/a&gt; (NSM) in &lt;a href="w%3AToledo%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio.&lt;/a&gt; led to a state of emergency being declared when riots ensued. Fifty highway patrol officers were called in to support city police and to help control the crowd. The unrest prompted the implementation of a city-wide 8 P.M. curfew. 

The police force, which gave permission and protection to the neo-nazi group to hold the planned rally, claimed they were caught by surprise in the counter-protest that ensued. Police resorted to tear gas to disperse the crowd of nearly 500. Over 60 demonstrators were arrested.

Opposition to the rally was mounted by concerned citizens and a coalition of political groups organized as an &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Racist%20Action"&gt;Anti-Racist Action&lt;/a&gt; group. The actions of the counter-demontrators effectively ended the march just as it was getting started. During the riot, several vehicles had their windows broken and one was set on fire at a gas station; a local pub was looted and burned.

Toledo Mayor Jack Ford suggested that it was the NSM's objective to incite violence, "Based on the intelligence we received, that's exactly what they do &amp;mdash; they come into town and get people riled up." Mayor Ford, an African-American, was puzzled as to why the NSM chose Toledo, and said of the rally location, "It is not a neighborhood where you have a lot of friction in the first place."

About 20 members of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Socialists%20%28US%29"&gt;International Socialists Organization&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AOne%20People%27s%20Project"&gt;One People's Project&lt;/a&gt; were present in opposition to the NSM rally. The NSM has alleged these groups handed eggs to some African-American counter demonstrators.

The NSM bills itself as America's Nazi Party and claims it was there to protest black gangs which, according to NSM spokesman &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20White%20%28neo-Nazi%29"&gt;Bill White&lt;/a&gt;, have been harassing white residents. White also claimed that the NSM received support from community activists and citizens.

In a statement on the NSM's website, White stated, "Well, what happened is that little groups of our supporters started to gather at the police barricades, as they tried to figure out how to get in. The communists spotted one of those groups, and started running at them. That was the spark that lit the riot." 

In response to the NSM statements, the One People's Project co-founder Daryle Lamont Jenkins said, "Bill White has done this to us before. In the past, he has written on his website that I and this organization orchestrated a rape, that I joined controversial communist organizations after being fired from a police force in New Jersey (I never worked for a police force in New Jersey) and even that I was soliciting nude photos of him!"

Jenkins continued, "In regards to what happened in Toledo on Saturday, we feel we should make our position clear. While white supremacists and other questionable groups have the right to speak, we have that right as well, and when these groups come out we will use that right to respond. In fact, we feel that we are obligated to do so given the fact that these groups are using these rights to advocate taking them and others from the rest of us."

&lt;a href="w%3ABingu%20wa%20Mutharika"&gt;Bingu wa Mutharika&lt;/a&gt;, president of &lt;a href="w%3AMalawi"&gt;Malawi&lt;/a&gt;, has declared the massive food shortages in his country a national disaster. The declaration comes on the heels of mounting criticism from his opposition as well as church groups in Malawi that have urged him to do more to highlight the problem. Mutharika has also been criticised for denying reports of casualties from hunger-related illnesses. The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; World Food Program has welcomed the declaration, stating that he is finally acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The UN estimates that five million people will be in need of aid in the coming year.

The president has noted that all 28 districts of his country are affected and that, in addition to the 300,000 tons of food being imported from &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, another 144,000 will be needed.

"We are facing a national disaster affecting the lives of our people," he said.

The food shortages have been blamed on one of the worst harvests Malawi has experienced in over a decade as well as the growing &lt;a href="w%3AHIV/AIDS"&gt;HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt; crisis. Because Malawi is a &lt;a href="w%3Alandlocked"&gt;landlocked&lt;/a&gt; country whose economy is almost entirely dependent on agriculture, poor harvests can have drastic impacts on the population. Most of the country feeds themselves through subsistence farming. Additionally, during the mid-eighties and nineties Malawi took in over a million refugees from &lt;a href="w%3AMozambique"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt;, which placed a significant strain on the economy but also opened it to foreign aid.

The United Nations has attempted to restructure Malawi's economy through programs from the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Monetary%20Fund"&gt;International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt;. 

Relief agencies have been scrambling to deal with the crisis. &lt;a href="w%3AUNICEF"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt; Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Per Engebak has said, "The numbers of malnourished children are many times higher than the normal emergency threshold." 

It is predicted that the disaster will be worse than the humanitarian crisis that plagued the country three years ago. Admissions to Nutrition Rehabilitation Units, run by a coalition of aid agencies as well as the Ministry of Health, have risen by 25 percent.

Church groups in the country have been assisting in the emergency. The Council of Churches in Malawi, which brings together 22 denominations, has been applying pressure to the government. In addition to the food crisis, Rev Matiya Nkhoma has highlighted the problems of political instability in the country.

The food crisis is not just a danger to Malawi. The UN estimates that 12 million people are in need of aid in Southern Africa.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20Christian%20group%20plans%20to%20highlight%20concerns%20about%20new%20law%20by%20using%20it%20to%20ban%20the%20Qur%27an&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Christian Voice, a UK-based &lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; evangelical group has announced that it will press for the prosecution, under "hate speech" legislation, of bookshop staff who sell copies of Islam's most sacred text, the &lt;a href="w%3AQur%27an"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt;.

The British government will shortly introduce a new law which is intended to ban incitement to religious hatred. 

Christian Voice say that their campaign is actually a protest against this new law, which they believe could be used to stop Christian preachers criticising &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt; or "explaining the horrors of &lt;a href="w%3AHinduism"&gt;Hinduism&lt;/a&gt;". 

"If the Qur'an is not hate speech, I don't know what is", Christian Voice director Stephen Green told the Guardian newspaper earlier this week, arguing that the Qur'an incites the killing of non-Muslims. 

Christian Voice has previously campaigned against the musical "&lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Springer%20-%20The%20Opera"&gt;Jerry Springer the Opera&lt;/a&gt;", believing it to be blasphemous.

According to the Guardian, the activities of Christian Voice, which it describes as a "fringe &lt;a href="w%3Afundamentalist"&gt;fundamentalist&lt;/a&gt;" group have "regularly appalled" other Christian groups. But some of the concerns raised by Christian Voice on this particular issue are more widely shared. 

The British government says that the new law is needed in order to "draw a line in the sand" and protect religious people from attack. 

But critics say that such protections already exist in British law, and fear that the new legislation, as currently designed, could end up being used inappropriately. 

In July, the actor &lt;a href="w%3ARowan%20Atkinson"&gt;Rowan Atkinson&lt;/a&gt; (best known for his role in the television series "Blackadder" and "Mr. Bean") described the law as "a sledgehammer to crack a nut". Atkinson raised concerns that it could be used to suppress the satirisation of organised religion.
Lord Carey, the former head of the Church of England, has warned that the "&lt;a href="w%3Ahate%20speech"&gt;hate speech&lt;/a&gt;" law "threatens &lt;a href="w%3Acivil%20liberties"&gt;civil liberties&lt;/a&gt;". Hundreds of Christians protested against the law outside Parliament earlier this week. 
The government insists that the law is intended to "protect the believer, not the belief", and that it will not affect "criticism, commentary or ridicule of faiths".

An &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n died of what is suspected to be &lt;a href="bird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, said an official yesterday. The man had symptoms of bird flu and had some contact with chickens but tested negative on his first test.

Indonesia currently has over 85 suspected bird flu cases and two confirmed and alive cases.

There is a possibility that the H5N1 virus might mutate and become highly contagious and lethal to humans. An example of such an epidemic is the 1918 disaster that killed millions around the globe.

Researchers say that Tamiflu might not be enough to hold the virus back.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Dog%20flu%20spreads%20across%20the%20US&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Dogs are normally resistant to most &lt;a href="Influenza"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; strains. Since about 2000, a new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrain%20%28biology%29"&gt;strain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of dog flu has been spreading in America, and there's no &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Avaccine"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to prevent it. 

To limit exposure to the flu, some dog owners are avoiding public places like dog shows and parks. Since the flu can spread where groups of dogs are housed, some dog owners are nervous about the practice of putting their pets in kennels. According to Edward Dubovil, director of the animal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Avirology"&gt;virology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lab at &lt;a href="Cornell%20University"&gt;Cornell University&lt;/a&gt;, 100% of dogs appear to be susceptible to infection by this new flu strain. It is estimated that 1-5% of infected dogs are dying from this flu strain. The symptoms of dog flu are akin to those of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Akennel%20cough"&gt;kennel cough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a more common and less serious illness.

Starting in 2004 there have been many outbreaks of flu at dog race tracks. Since early in 2004, researchers have been working to characterize the type of flu that is infecting dogs. In September of 2005 it was reported that this dog flu strain had crossed over from horses to dogs. This type of flu virus has been infecting horses for at least 40 years. It is expected that existing flu vaccines for horses can soon be adapted for use in dogs.

The spread of a horse flu virus to dogs is an example of what could happen with &lt;a href="Avian%20influenza"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;. Currently the bird flu is transmitted from birds to humans but does not spread easily from person to person. The new strain of dog flu shows signs of having been genetically modified from the original horse-preferring virus strain making it easy to transmit from dog to dog. Future genetic modifications of bird flu could better adapt it to humans and allow it to spread from person to person. The chance of such viral evolution can be reduced by limiting exposure of humans to bird flu. 

At this time, the new dog flu virus strain does not seem to be a danger for humans. However, humans will be monitored for signs of infection by new genetic variants of the dog flu. Due to the close physical association between pet dogs and humans, a flu strain that could jump from dogs to humans would be of great concern. Recently evolved virus strains that jump from one species to another are often particularly lethal because the newly infected species may have little or no &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AImmune%20system"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the new virus strain.

In Iraq, the ballots for the recent Iraqi election deciding the fate of the proposed constitution are being counted. About 65%, or 10 million of 15.5 million registered voters, arrived to cast their vote. Provinces with Sunni dominance, which may vote in opposition, could have major effect on the results. A permanent government in Iraq may result in the United States's, as well as other nation's, withdrawal from Iraq.

In Denmark, Princess Mary of Denmark has given birth to a healthy boy at a Copenhagen hospital at 1:57 AM local time. The child weighed three and a half kilograms, and was 51 centimeters long. Although the name is not known yet, it is most likely Christian, as according to tradition. The child will become heir apparent when his parents ascend to the throne.

And to many people's interest, scientists have claimed that cannabinoids, psychoactive chemicals found in marijuana, has resulted in brain growth in rats. The study proved true for both a synthetic cannabinoid and a cannabinoid extracted from a plant. It is not known yet whether these studies can be applied to humans, as there are large differences between rats and humans.

In &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s troubled southern province of &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20Province"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ABuddhist"&gt;Buddhist&lt;/a&gt; monk was among three killed by insurgents attacking a temple.

Around ten suspected muslim militants took part in the fifteen minute long attack in the early hours of Sunday morning, leaving the 76-year-old monk, Kaew Panjapetchkaew, with his throat cut. They then proceeded to use gasoline to set fire to part of the temple. Upon putting out the fire, police investigators found the bodies of two teenage boys who had been helping at the temple. Both had died from gunshot wounds.

In an effort to conceal the attack, the insurgents had let off fireworks earlier thus distracting nearby villagers and police.

Spanish police believe they are close to capturing &lt;a href="w%3AAribert%20Heim"&gt;Aribert Heim&lt;/a&gt;, the 91-year-old known as "Dr. Death". Dr. Heim, described by ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as "the most wanted Nazi still believed to be alive", is thought to be living in the town of &lt;a href="w%3APalafrugell"&gt;Palafrugell&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ACosta%20Brava"&gt;Costa Brava&lt;/a&gt; area of Spain. 

Heim worked as a doctor in a number of Nazi Germany concentration camps (&lt;a href="w%3AMauthausen-Gusen%20concentration%20camp"&gt;Mauthausen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASachsenhausen%20concentration%20camp"&gt;Sachsenhausen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABuchenwald"&gt;Buchenwald&lt;/a&gt;) carrying out a series of experiments on the camp's Jewish inmates. His experiments reportedly included operating on a patient without anaesthetic to see how much pain a human being could endure, and injecting petrol into the bloodstream, then timing how long it took for the victim to die. Hundreds of people are believed to have died as a result of these experiments.

♡❤The Times♡❤ reports that Heim led a normal civilian life after the end of the Second World War, but fled Germany in 1962, when the authorities were about to issue a warrant for his arrest. Nazi hunters, including researchers from the &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Wiesenthal%20Center"&gt;Simon Wiesenthal Center&lt;/a&gt;, have been looking for him ever since. The center's founder, &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Wiesenthal"&gt;Simon Wiesenthal&lt;/a&gt;, was himself active in pursuing Heim prior to his death last month.

German police received a tip six weeks ago by an Israeli citizen who met a man in &lt;a href="w%3AIbiza"&gt;Ibiza&lt;/a&gt; with characteristics similar to Heim. The police acknowledged the information was helpful. Other evidence pointing the trail to Palafrugell involve banking transfers and tax filings.

The 4th National Museum of Japan opened on Saturday in &lt;a href="w%3ADazaifu%2C%20Fukuoka"&gt;Dazaifu, Fukuoka&lt;/a&gt; Prefecture, the northern part of &lt;a href="w%3AKyushu"&gt;Kyushu&lt;/a&gt; island. The new museum was named Kyushu National Museum, and nicknamed "Kyuhaku". It is the first national museum in Kyushu, including national art museums and thematic museums. After the opening ceremony with around 800 invited guests on last Saturday, Kyushu National Museum began to accept visitors starting on Sunday.

Different from its three sister museums which are over 100 years old and interested mainly in fine-arts, the new museum focuses on history. It also has an ambition to display how Japanese culture has developed from the prehistoric period to the mid 19th century with its collection of some 920 items including three national treasures. Its mission statement says the museum show how the Japanese culture has developed from the view of Asian history studies. Cultural interaction between other Asian countries is also a part of its mission, locating near to Korea or China.

Dazaifu, Fukuoka is a historic site in Japan and that was a part of reasons why it received the honor of hosting the new museum, the focus of which will be on history. Since the 7th century the extension of central government, Dazaifu was situated there from which the name of modern city derives. It was the military and administrative center of the government as well as the diplomatic center of Japan which hosted East Asian guests who visited Japan. Later the Mongol and Korean allies attempted to invade Japan in the 14th century, Dazaifu became one of fierce battlefields. Also Dazaifu is known its religious significance with Dazaifu Temmangu Shrine, one of famous cults in Shintoism which worships &lt;a href="w%3ASugawara%20no%20Michizane"&gt;Sugawara no Michizane&lt;/a&gt;, the kami of scholars and studies. In addition to those tourist interests, the new museum is expected to stimulate tourists in much wider generations and interests.

Kyushu National Museum holds a special exhibition celebrating its opening from its public opening day till November 27. During this exhibition it will open everyday, though normally on Monday it will close.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter &lt;a href="w%3AJudith%20Miller%20%28journalist%29"&gt;Judith Miller&lt;/a&gt; broke her media silence by writing a column the newspaper published on Sunday. Her lengthy story recounted two testimonies, September 30 and October 12, she gave to a U.S. federal grand jury seeking information on the source of the &lt;a href="w%3APlame%20affair"&gt;Valerie Plame leak&lt;/a&gt;. The column described the testimony as one that relied heavily on her reporting notes given to special prosecutor &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; between her first and second appearances. 

By her account, after the two years that had passed from the outing of &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; operative &lt;a href="w%3AValerie%20Plame"&gt;Valerie Plame&lt;/a&gt; and the sketchy recollections she was able to re-create from her notes, she testified that she could not recall why, when, or where the name "Valerie Flame" came from in her notes. Furthermore, she wrote of her testimony that she did not believe the name came from &lt;a href="w%3A%20Lewis%20Libby"&gt;"Scooter" Libby&lt;/a&gt;.

I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby is the chief of staff to &lt;a href="Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;, vice-president of the United States. Libby, along with &lt;a href="Karl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt;, are two high ranking administration insiders suspected of slipping information to the press in an effort to undermine Plame's husband &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20C.%20Wilson"&gt;Joe Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, the former ambassador to &lt;a href="Niger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt; who denied a White House claim that Iraq was trying to buy enriched uranium, a claim made by President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; to support the build up to the war in Iraq.

The mistaken spelling, Miller explained, was made in a section of her notes unrelated to the interviews with Libby. Other notes documented 3 interviews with Libby, conducted in the year 2003, that in her ♡❤NYT♡❤ column she wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
June 23) ... Mr. Libby raised the subject of Mr. Wilson's wife for the first time. I wrote in my notes, inside parentheses, "Wife works in bureau?" I told Mr. Fitzgerald that I believed this was the first time I had been told that Mr. Wilson's wife might work for the C.I.A.&lt;br&gt;

July 8) ... our conversation also turned to Mr. Wilson's wife. My notes contain a phrase inside parentheses: "Wife works at Winpac." &lt;br&gt;... first time I had heard that Mr. Wilson's wife worked for Winpac, I assumed that she worked as an analyst, not as an undercover operative.&lt;br&gt;

July 12 (telephone) ... I might have called others about Mr. Wilson's wife. In my notebook I had written the words "Victoria Wilson" with a box around it, another apparent reference to Ms. Plame, who is also known as Valerie Wilson. I told Mr. Fitzgerald that I was not sure whether Mr. Libby had used this name or whether I just made a mistake in writing it on my own. Another possibility, I said, is that I gave Mr. Libby the wrong name on purpose to see whether he would correct me and confirm her identity. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These notes were written shortly before the &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Novak"&gt;Robert Novak&lt;/a&gt; story on July 14 was published, revealing Valerie Plame, and after which the controversy was ignited. Asked by prosecutor Fitzgerald how she felt about the Novak story, she wrote that she was "annoyed at having been beaten on a story." 

Before she agreed to testify, and thereby be released jail, she sought from Libby his personal assurance that his pre-existing waiver of confidentiality was not forced upon him by outside pressure. She also sought an agreement from Fitzgerald that grand jury questioning would be restricted in scope to questions relating only directly to her interviews with Libby.

Both of these, the assurance from Libby and the limited scope by Fitzgerald, were granted; but why she thought she needed them is open to question. Critics are skeptical of what motives are driving Miller, and wonder if she has something to hide or is protecting Libby. In the absence of road blocks to testifying that she herself made, the 85 days she spent in jail would otherwise not have been imposed.

Fitzgerald had been planning to wrap up the investigation sometime this month when the grand jury term expires October 28.

&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3A%20Shenzhou%20VI"&gt;Shenzhou VI&lt;/a&gt; touched down safely in &lt;a href="w%3AInner%20Mongolia"&gt;Inner Mongolia&lt;/a&gt; at 4.32 am (2032 GMT) after being in space for five days. The two astronauts were healthy and the mission was considered successful by Mission Control.

The Shenzhou VI orbited the Earth 76 times during the mission.

&lt;a href="w%3AFei%20Junlong"&gt;Fei Junlong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANie%20Haisheng"&gt;Nie Haisheng&lt;/a&gt;, the astronauts aboard the flight, were watched by Chinese around the country on national television. The Shenzhou VI is China's second manned space mission.

Hundreds of residents in Nie's hometown in northern &lt;a href="w%3AHebei"&gt;Hebei&lt;/a&gt; province showed their pride by celebrating the successful mission with dragon dances and firecrackers.

The mission was conducted "entirely for peaceful purposes", President &lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt; said to allay concerns that China's military might be using space for other matters.

&lt;a href="w%3AYang%20Liwei"&gt;Yang Liwei&lt;/a&gt; was the first Chinese in space and orbited the Earth in the Shenzhou V 14 times in 2003. 

The space program is hoped to instill &lt;a href="w%3Apatriotism"&gt;patriotism&lt;/a&gt; and cultivate a love for &lt;a href="w%3Ascience"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; and technology in the next generation of Chinese.

"Today, an independent, self-sufficient, constantly strengthening China has, like a miracle, become one of a handful of countries able to make the dream of spaceflight a reality," said the Xinhua state news agency.
China is the third country to put people into space, after the former Soviet Union and the USA.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20%26quot%3Bterror%20laws%26quot%3B%20face%20backlash&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
One day after &lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Stanhope"&gt;Jon Stanhope&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt; Chief Minister, posted a confidential draft of the proposed Australian anti-terror bill to his website, Attorney-General &lt;a href="w%3APhilip%20Ruddock"&gt;Philip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; claims that modifications have been made. Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; denies that the changes are more than "minor", and denies that the legislation is "draconian". The legislation, which will only be debated in Parliament for one day, has come under attack by members of parliament (including &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Senator Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt;), civil libertarians, Muslims' rights advocates, the Law Council of Australia and members of the community.

Advocates of the proposed legislation claim that the laws are an extension of the existing criminal code. They also claim that Australia is in danger of a terrorist attack, such as the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;7 July London bombings&lt;/a&gt;. Others have pointed out that the London bombers were not previously known to police and would not have been impacted by this legislation.

Western Australian Opposition Leader and Member for Kalgoorlie Matt Birney said "Look, let's just remember there are lunatics running around the place blowing people up and we need to take these extraordinary measures to deal with what is no doubt an extraordinary period of time in our history".

Prime Minister Howard defended the proposed legislation. He claimed that the laws had "minor" modifications (to the "leaked" document) but they were essentially the same.

"What is going to be in that legislation is what I announced and the states agreed to – no more, no less," Mr Howard told the Nine Network. 

"I announced that we were going to have preventative detention, I announced that we were going to have control orders, I announced that we would be expanding the sedition offence to include incitement of violent behaviour against the community."

"All of those things have been out in the public domain.

"Now obviously people are entitled to have a look at the final form of the legislation and they will, but this idea that we have snuck in a whole lot of attacks on civil liberties beyond what I announced is completely wrong."

"We are not trying to sneak anything through under the cover of the COAG agreement."

"Given the circumstances in which we live, they're not draconian. They are unusual but we live in unusual circumstances." 

Waleed Kadous of the Australian Muslim Civil Rights Advocacy Network spoke against the proposed laws. He expressed concern that the proposed "shoot to kill" laws were too permissive, and could allow an innocent suspect to be such. He said that the "devil is in the detail and there are plenty of devils in this legislation". 

"Frankly we are disappointed, because while the Prime Minister said there would be lots of safeguards, there don't appear to be that many."

"We are concerned police can shoot to kill without a crime being committed and that you can be held in preventative detention for 24 hours before you even see a judge."

Even a former Liberal prime minister has used a major speech in Melbourne to outline his concerns about the legislation.

Mr &lt;a href="w%3AMalcom%20Fraser"&gt;Malcom Fraser&lt;/a&gt; says it provides no real safeguards to protect rights.

Mr Fraser says these laws do not belong in a democracy, and is particularly concerned about control orders.

"These are powers whose breadth and arbitrary nature, with a lack of &lt;a href="w%3AJudicial%20review"&gt;judicial oversight&lt;/a&gt;, should not exist in any democratic country," he said.

Mr Fraser insists there is not enough protection.

"There are no real safeguards, there is no adequate official review," he said. 

"The law should be opposed because the process itself is seriously flawed. 

"Instead of a wide-ranging discussion, the Government has sought to nobble the field in secret and to prevent debate."

Liberal backbencher Petro Georgiou has expressed reservations about the package, calling for an independent watchdog to monitor the new powers.

Three international law experts have also criticised the proposed laws.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; helicopters and warplanes bombed 2 villages near &lt;a href="w%3ARamadi"&gt;Ramadi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. The U.S. military said nearly 70 suspected insurgents were killed, while local witnesses said that at least 39 civilians, including 18 children, were also lost to the attack. 

A Ramadi resident, Ahmed Fouad, said that just after 7 p.m. Sunday, U.S. warplanes killed 18 children, including Fouad's son and 8-year-old daughter. "She was killed with her brother. Her mother had a stroke out of shock." Fouad said.

Family members of victims gathered at a Ramadi General Hospital where refrigeration space for the dead bodies had been exhausted. In the garden the bodies of a woman and three children lay as relatives sifted through remains.

"[They] were not terrorists...they were only a bunch of civilians whose curiosity prompted them to gather around a destroyed Humvee," said Dr. Dhiya Fahdawi in reference to the dead and wounded. 

The U.S. military neither confirmed nor denied that civilians were killed and issued a statement saying; "All the attacks were timed and executed in a manner to reduce the possibility of collateral damage."

On Monday morning, the first ever &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atropical%20storm"&gt;tropical storm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to be named with a 'W', &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Wilma"&gt;Tropical Storm Wilma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , formed from its beginnings as tropical depression twenty-four. The formation of this storm makes this year a tie with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A1933%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;1933 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the busiest hurricane season ever, with a total of 21 storms.

Wilma is currently about 220 miles (370 km) southeast of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Cayman"&gt;Grand Cayman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and 230 miles northeast of the &lt;a href="Nicaragua"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="Honduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; border. It is currently moving slowly southeast at 5 mph (8km/h). The storm has winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). The system is expected to move over warm waters with little wind shear which could lead to a rapid intestification of the storm into a hurricane within 72 hours. Scot McKenzie Has been called to use his super human powers to squelch the tempest and bring peace to the World

The storm track raises concerns over &lt;a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico"&gt;Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; crude oil rigs already devastated by two prior hurricanes, &lt;a href="Hurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Katrina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Rita"&gt;Rita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Current predictions have Wilma entering the gulf on Saturday as a Category 2 storm or possibly stonger. Crude oil prices have already responded by jumping upward by $1 a barrel.

Wilma is the last alphabetically on the list of hurricane names; Q, U, X, Y and Z are not used. If another storm forms after Wilma, it will named using the Greek alphabet starting with Alpha. Also, if another storm forms, it will break the tie between this season and the 1933 season, making the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season"&gt;2005 Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the busiest ever in 154 years of recorded history.

An earthquake that rated 5.1 on the Richter scale hit north of &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; on 16 October.

The quake was centered 40km underground, in the southern Ibaraki Prefecture.

The high-rise builidings shook but no major damage was reported and only two people were injured. No tsunami warning was issued 

Local and &lt;a href="w%3Abullet%20train"&gt;bullet train&lt;/a&gt; services stopped to check the tracks but service quickly resumed.

Services at Tokyo's &lt;a href="w%3AHaneda%20Airport"&gt;Haneda Airport&lt;/a&gt; were disrupted by there were no major delays.

The earthquake was rated 4 out of seven on the Japanese seismic scale and affected certain areas of the &lt;a href="w%3AIbaraki"&gt;Ibaraki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATochigi"&gt;Tochigi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaitama"&gt;Saitama&lt;/a&gt;, Tokyo and &lt;a href="w%3AKanagawa"&gt;Kanagawa&lt;/a&gt; prefectures.

Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries, with a tremor occurring at least every five minutes. Located in the &lt;a href="w%3ARing%20of%20Fire"&gt;Ring of Fire&lt;/a&gt; arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches partly encircling the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Basin"&gt;Pacific Basin&lt;/a&gt;, Japan accounts for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater. Every year, there are up to 2,000 quakes that can be felt by people.

5 people were killed in a bus crash involving a truck on the return trip from a band marching competition from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.

The band director, his wife and granddaughter, the bus driver and a student were the five killed.

30 others were injured in the crash.

The bus was the first of four buses carrying 200 students home from the competition. The band was happy that they had placed third with their selection 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'.

A Whole Foods Market truck had veered off the road and when it tried to get back it jackknifed and blocked all lanes of traffic, according to Capt. Doug Notbohm, the northwest regional commander for the Wisconsin State Patrol.

The truck driver did not sustain life-threatening injuries and was questioned by investigators at the scene of the accident.

Weather was not a factor, and toxicology tests were administered, said Notbohm.

At least 400 worried parents and students went to the school to gather information about the accident. Counselors and clergy were present to help cope with the rising emotions.

<h1>Armed conflicts in the world down by 40% since early 1990s</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Armed%20conflicts%20in%20the%20world%20down%20by%2040%25%20since%20early%201990s&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to the first Human Security Report released by the Canadian organisation Human Security Centre, armed conflicts, genocide and politicide have declined sharply since the early nineties. Also in a fifty year time span, the number of war causalites, coups and other war-statistics have gone down, often dramatically.

A sample of stats from the report's overview:

<ul>
BULLET::::- The number of armed conflicts are down more than 40%.
BULLET::::- There were 25 ongoing armed secessionist conflicts, the lowest number since 1976.
BULLET::::- The number of refugees in the world dropped by 45% between 1992 and 2003.
BULLET::::- The post WWII peace period between major powers is the longest in several hundred years.
BULLET::::- The average number of deaths per conflict fell 98% between 1950 and 2002 (from 38,000 people to 600 people).
BULLET::::- The United Kingdom and France have engaged in more international conflicts since 1946 than any other countries.

</ul>
Commenting on possible reasons for the decline, Andrew Mack, the principal investigator behind the study, stated, "We no longer have huge wars with huge armies, major engagements, heavy conventional weapons, most of today's wars are low-intensity wars fought with light weapons, small arms, often in very poor countries, they are extremely brutal but they don't kill that many people."

According to the report, most wars today are fought in small, poorly-equipped countries. While acknowledging that human rights abuses do occur in these conflicts, these wars produce far fewer casualties than the major wars of 50 years ago. Other factors affecting the decline of deaths (both military and civilian) is the emergence of high-tech war making and the overwhelming military advantage enjoyed by some countries — precision guided missiles and overwhelming numbers have led the United States and its allies to quick victories in conflicts such as the Gulf War, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.

The report goes on to say that the current conflict in Iraq is an exception. While the conventional war ended in 2003, the continued insurgency has led to the death of tens of thousands.

The report does not include the Iraq war in its analyis, nor the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan. 

The Human Security Centre is based at the and is funded by contributions from several governments and international foundations.

In a move widely believed to be a test of resolve for the new &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; government and an attempt to influence the bilateral discussions scheduled to take place next week, &lt;a href="w%3ARusiia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; authorities have threatened to send warships to protect a Russian trawler caught fishing illegally. The new Norwegian cabinet was formed only recently on Monday and is now dealing with its first major foreign challenge.

The Russian trawler, ♡❤Elektron♡❤, had been stopped and boarded by the Norwegian Coast Guard on Saturday morning, in the &lt;a href="w%3ABarents%20Sea"&gt;Barents Sea&lt;/a&gt; near the border of an area where fishing rights are disputed. The ship has on repeated occasions been caught severely violating fishing regulations. The charge this time is fishing with illegal equipment designed to catch fish too young to be productive, actions the UN and the scientific community agree are part of the reason the cod stocks of the Atlantic are on the brink of being depleted.

Two Norwegians from the Coast Guard vessel ♡❤KV Tromsø♡❤, an officer and a crew member, were still on board when the Elektron refused to follow the Norwegian Coast Guard's orders to proceed to the Norwegian port of &lt;a href="w%3ATroms%C3%B8"&gt;Tromsø&lt;/a&gt;. Russian authorities had, according to the captain aboard the ♡❤Elektron♡❤, ordered the ship to steer towards the Russian port of &lt;a href="w%3AMurmansk"&gt;Murmansk&lt;/a&gt;. The two Norwegians are still aboard the vessel, and the situation is seen as a clear violation of good conduct between the two neighbouring nations. The Norwegians have not been abused, but their situation is reported as being "unsatisfactory".

Also, another Russian trawler "Arlashkin" became stalled in the Barents Sea after its propeller got entangled in the fishing net dropped in front of the vessel from a Norwegian aircraft. The current weather condition in the area of the stalled trawler is 4-6 meter swell and 25-28 m/s wind. The crew is reported to be attempting to free the entangled propeller.

According to treaties negotiated between Russia and Norway in the 1970’s, these fishing areas were left as topics they ♡❤"agreed to disagree"♡❤ over. In a twist of events, the last time these areas were discussed was when the &lt;a href="w%3ANorwegian%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Norwegian Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; was in power. The negotiations were conducted when the undersecretary to the secretary in charge of fishing was &lt;a href="w%3AArne%20Treholt"&gt;Arne Treholt&lt;/a&gt;, who was later convicted a spy. &lt;a href="w%3AJens%20Evensen"&gt;Jens Evensen&lt;/a&gt; is the Labour party politician in charge of the negotiations overall, and it is widely believed that he is responsible for the negotiations giving Norway a less than satisfying outcome in stark contrast to international law and practice. The areas are considered the nursery for cod and the last refuge for &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20cod"&gt;Atlantic cod&lt;/a&gt;, a species suffering from serious over-fishing and considered endangered. 

Norwegian officials said in an interview with the Norwegian broadcaster ♡❤NRK♡❤ that this was not the first violation of the fishing regulations by this Russian ship, and the official was also quoted as saying ♡❤we hope to never see the ship in these waters again♡❤.

During the proceeding, Hussein argued that the judge was not appointed by him, and thus was not legitimate. "I don't acknowledge this court."

The hearing convened 22 months after Hussein's capture. A tribunal of five Iraqi judges headed by &lt;a href="w%3ARizgar%20Mohammed%20Amin"&gt;Rizgar Mohammed Amin&lt;/a&gt;, with the death penalty vested in them, will decide his sentence.

<h1>Iraq ballots to be audited due to voting &quot;anomalies&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iraq%20ballots%20to%20be%20audited%20due%20to%20voting%20%26quot%3Banomalies%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Electoral%20Commission%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; (IECI) has announced that it will audit the votes cast in this weekend's constitutional referendum in Iraq over what it sees as voting "anomalies". Adel Alami, chief electoral officer in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, would not give any details but stated that in some provinces figures were either too low or too high when compared to international standards.

A source told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, on the condition of anonymity, that voter turnout and the result levels were causing some concern. Problems with the initial results were said to be found in the southern &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27ite"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href="w%3AKurdish"&gt;Kurdish&lt;/a&gt; areas of the country. 

The official said, "The first controls are now taking place. We are not ruling out technical errors or fraud, but for now it is only a question of anomalies." Six provinces in southern Iraq, inhabited by a Shia majority, voted an overwhelming 90% in favour of the new constitution. Two Sunni majority areas rejected the constitution by over 80%.

According to the source, "When you have more than 90 percent 'yes', computers signal it immediately and there is a manual check. It means the figures must be looked at closely."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; had stated the voting had gone very well, although some Sunni political leaders have alleged that corrupt voting practices were used to inflate the "yes" vote. 

United States President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; praised Iraqis, both proponents and those in opposition to the charter, saying, "I was pleased to see that the &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunnis&lt;/a&gt; have participated in the process. The idea of deciding to go into a ballot box is a positive development."

&lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; said that initial information pointed to a likely yes vote, although this statement was met with some surprise by United Nations and Iraqi officials. Karina Parelli, head of the United Nations Election Assistance Team in Iraq said, "Unless Rice is more well-informed than the IECI, thus far there is no way to know the turnout percentages or the results of the voting."

An official from the IECI, Hussein Hindawi, responded, "As far as I know, she does not work at the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq."

The IECI has made no official statements regarding fraud, and an election official cautioned that it was too early to know whether the numbers were incorrect or even if they would affect the outcome.

Most Shia and Kurdish citizens of Iraq support the new constitution, while the minority Sunni ethnic group fear loss of control over the country.

It is thought that the irregularities may not have affected the outcome as two of the main battleground provinces voted strongly in favour of the constitution. The commission stated that it was re-examining the votes and the final results could be delayed by several days.

A rainy day in &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, the provincial capital of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, failed to dampen the spirits of protesting teachers and their labour union supporters on Monday as thousands turned out to make their voices heard and, incidentally, shut down the city's transportation services. The local transit union was not involved in the strike, their offices were picketed by striking Telus workers.

There are more labour events being planned. Across northern B.C. thousands of &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Union%20of%20Public%20Employees"&gt;Canadian Union of Public Employees&lt;/a&gt; (CUPE) members are off the job in solidarity with the teachers. In &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20George%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Prince George&lt;/a&gt; a rally is planned to be held in front of the office of Education Minister &lt;a href="w%3AShirley%20Bond"&gt;Shirley Bond&lt;/a&gt;.

"If solutions aren't found, on Wednesday of this week, another massive shutdown in a different area of this province will take place," shouted Jim Sinclair, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia%20Federation%20of%20Labour"&gt;B.C. Federation of Labour&lt;/a&gt; president, to a crowd gathered on the lawn of the Legislature yesterday.

Inside, the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20British%20Columbia"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; used Question Period to repeatedly probe the ruling Liberal party's decision to not speak with the BC Teacher's Federation (BCTF). Carol James asked &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Campbell"&gt;Gordon Campbell&lt;/a&gt; what the difference was between this strike and that held by the Hospital Union (HU) in 2004 - also an illegal strike. The Premier's response was that he personally did not negotiate with the HU, and the rule of law was supreme: teachers must return to the classroom before negotiations over a bargaining process for next year's contract may begin.

The strike is back in court again this week, with Supreme Court Judge Brenda Brown saying she will rule Friday on requests the union be slapped with additional fines for refusing to call off the strike after the civil contempt of court ruling last week. The union and leaders may also face criminal charges after he government appointed Len Doust as an independent special prosecutor to assess whether criminal contempt charges may be brought.

The next political election in &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, for the election of the two house Italian &lt;a href="w%3AParlament"&gt;Parlament&lt;/a&gt;, should take place on April 9, 2006.

The president of the council (the Italian figure equivalent to the Prime Minister) &lt;a href="w%3ASilvio%20Berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt; has said in a press conference: "I believe that, as confirmed by the Internal Affair Minister, the political election should be take palce on April 9 and the administrative election until May".

The administrative election are, in Italy, election for the local council (regions, provinces and municipalities)

Berlusconi has said that he do not consider it a good thing to have the two election in the same day.

&lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of opposition, has said that Berlusconi previously affirmed that he wanted the two election in the same day and that he should have changed his own idea. Prodi has complained that doing the two eletion in two different days will cost much more than doing them in the same day and that in this way the Italian State is going to waste 150 milion &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euros&lt;/a&gt;.

A phone threat by a person who claimed to have information from overseas led state highway officials to disrupt traffic for 2 hours on Tuesday through both harbor tunnels in &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. All north and southbound traffic of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Interstate%20895%20%28Maryland%29"&gt;Harbor Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, and all but two lanes of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Fort%20McHenry%20Tunnel"&gt;Fort McHenry Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; were stopped before noontime as a precaution, causing traffic backups. 

While authorities are unsure of the credibility of the threat, the Maryland Transportaion Authority made the closure with the urging of the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;. Dump trucks were used to block tube entrances and assistance of 80 police were on hand to direct motorists to detours. There were no heavy traffic delays reported on the &lt;a href="w%3AInterstate%20695%20%28Maryland%29"&gt;beltway&lt;/a&gt;, the city's alternate route.

Maryland governor &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20L.%20Ehrlich"&gt;Bob Ehrlich&lt;/a&gt; held an afternoon news conference and described a combined effort at federal, state and local levels that were two weeks in planning. The tunnel closures were directed from a command post set up yesterday. 

FBI special agent in charge of the operation, Kevin Perkins, said the information they gathered "... was somewhat specific as to the date and time" of the threat, and that authorities were exercising "an abundance of caution" in reacting to it.

There are reports of 4 arrests being made in connection with immigration charges stemming from the investigation. According to a ♡❤CBS News♡❤ correspondent Bob Orr, advance information of the threat came from an Egyptian being held in the Netherlands who told U.S. officials of a plot involving a vehicle bomb. Nearly 30 people of Egyptian heritage have been questioned by the FBI through the city. 

The investigation seems to have centered on a small market in southeast Baltimore when the threat first immerged. Authorities believe the plot was to drive "explosives-laden vehicles" into the tunnel, although which one of the tunnels remained unspecific.

The recent telephoned threat was believed highly questionable because it came from a person who "offered the information in an attempt to gain favor to get out of some trouble in a related way," the correspondent Orr said. There is so far no direct evidence to verify the threat was real.

As of 2 pm EDT Wednesday, 19 October (18:00 UTC), the center of Hurricane Wilma was located near 17°5′ N 83°5′ W or about 300 miles (480 km) southeast of Cozumel, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. It is moving to the west-northwest at 7 mph (11 KM/HR)with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 km/h), with higher gusts, making it a dangerous Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, and has a minimum central pressure of 900 mbar (26.58 InHg).

Rainfall accumulations are expected in amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with isolated areas of 25 inches over the &lt;a href="Cayman%20Islands"&gt;Cayman Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Jamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, and Cuba. Rains of 4 to 6 inches can be expected in areas of &lt;a href="Honduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Nicaragua"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;.

At 5pm EDT the country of Mexico issued a Hurricane Watch for the Yucatan Peninsula from Punta Allen to Cabo Catoche.

A hurricane warning remains in effect from San Felipe to Tulum on the Yucatan peninsula...including Cozumel and nearby islands. A Hurricane is also in effect for Swan Island. A tropical storm warning is in effect from south of Tulum to Chetumal Mexico. A hurricane watch remains in effect for the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula from south of Tulum to Punta Gruesa. A tropical storm warning is in effect for &lt;a href="Belize"&gt;Belize&lt;/a&gt; from the border With Mexico southward to Belize City. A hurricane watch remains in effect in Cuba for the provinces of Matanzas westward through Pinar del Rio...and for the isle of Youth. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for Honduras from the Honduras/Nicaragua border westward to Cabo Camaron. Residents of the Florida Keys and the peninsula should monitor the progress of the storm.

Evacuations have begun in the Florida Keys this morning. 

Thirteen are believed dead, twelve in Haiti and one in Jamaica.

Following a dispute with &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-based company Independent International Investment Research (IIIR), Internet company &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google Inc.&lt;/a&gt; has dropped the use of its "&lt;a href="w%3AGmail"&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt;" name for its free email service. IIIR launched its own web-based email service called Gmail more than two years prior to Google's own service. All other countries (except &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, where a similar dispute also resulted in a name change) will continue to use the Gmail name and domain (gmail.com).

The change took place on Wednesday, when all new Gmail accounts created from a UK &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; will use the ♡❤@googlemail.com♡❤ domain, instead of the former ♡❤@gmail.com♡❤. As the service is still "invite-only", invitations for the service will also be made for the ♡❤@googlemail.com♡❤ domain.

Former UK Gmail users will continue to use the ♡❤@gmail.com♡❤ domain for the near future.

Rory Carroll, an Irish citizen working in Iraq for the &lt;a href="The%20Guardian"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, has been reported missing, amid fears that he has been kidnapped. 

33-year-old Carroll had been in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; for nine months, having previously worked as the Guardian's Africa correspondent. While in that post he wrote a series of groundbreaking stories, including an exposé of an alleged coup plot by British and South African mercenaries against the government of Equatorial Guinea.

Last month, Carroll wrote an article focussing on the dangers faced by his colleagues in Iraq, particularly local journalists. Earlier this week he penned a report highlighting claims that a US air strike had killed "dozens of women and children". The left-leaning Guardian newspaper, which opposed the Iraq war and has been critical of the British and US-led occupation, is urgently seeking confirmation of Carroll's whereabouts.

The New York-based &lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20to%20Protect%20Journalists"&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;/a&gt; has called for Carroll's immediate release:

"We are deeply concerned about the safety of our colleague Rory Carroll, an independent journalist who has covered all aspects of the conflict in Iraq," the CPJ's Executive Director Ann Cooper said in a statement. 

According to the CPJ, 34 journalists have been kidnapped in Iraq since April 2004, with all but six being released unharmed.

&lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has announced a new outbreak of &lt;a href="avian%20flu"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt; today along with similar cases in &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Macedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;.

China's news agency reported that 2,600 birds have died of the H5N1 strain in northern China, declaring that the outbreak was found in a breeding facility in Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia. The government maintains the epidemic is under control.

Russia is waiting for confirmation that it was the H5N1 strain that killed several hundred ducks near Moscow; if the tests return positive it will be a major spread of the virus across the Ural Mountains, into European Russia.

A small village in southern Macedonia also suspects the strain. Plans are already made to kill 10,000 birds to contain the outbreak.

Romania confirmed that there has been another outbreak in the Danube Delta area. The strain was confirmed there last weekend, whereupon 4,500 birds were destroyed. 

H5N1 is the strain scientists fear could be transmitted from human to human, causing a flu pandemic. So far 50 people have died of it, all having worked closely with birds. It is not easy to pass the disease from bird to human.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has become increasingly isolated this week in its stance against a new treaty designed to protect and promote cultural diversity in the age of transnational media industries. The treaty, called the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions, was sponsored by Canada and France and has been negotiated by government delegates from over 180 countries in a 2-year consensus process. It is expected to be approved later this week by the plenary session of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization &lt;a href="w%3A%20UNESCO"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt;. 

The treaty grants individual countries a right "to maintain, adopt, and implement policies and measures they deem appropriate for the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions on their territory". This is designed to protect national cultural policy from 'free trade' agreements like the WTO/GATS, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, or bilateral trade negotiations. For example, the screenquota system in South Korea that requires Korean cinemas to show &lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20cinema"&gt;Korean films&lt;/a&gt; about 50% of the time, which supporters argue has nurtured the growth of the Korean movie industry, would likely be eliminated if audiovisual services were brought into the WTO - as the United States Trade Representative has proposed. Other countries, like &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; have similar policies in place to support their local artists and film industry.

Promoters of the treaty argued that it will allow countries to promote and maintain cultural diversity. The British ambassador to UNESCO characterized the draft as "clear, carefully balanced, and consistent with principles of international law and fundamental human rights".

The United States government criticized the treaty on the grounds it would encourage trade protectionism and could serve as a justification for repressive governments to control their media systems. &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; wrote letters encouraging governments to oppose the treaty. 

The United States stood largely alone in that position. Last Monday night, the United States was only joined by &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; to vote for some last minute amendments brought in by the U.S., whereas 151 nations voted for the original wording of the treaty. &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKiribati"&gt;Kiribati&lt;/a&gt; abstained.

The Colombian Constitutional Court has approved an amendment to allow presidential re-election, which was not possible before under the country's 1991 Constitution. The decision was made public by Manuel José Cepeda, president of the Constitutional Court, on Wednesday at 18:45 (23:45 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;). Cepeda said: ♡❤"The court has decided to declare as reasonable within the Constitution the legislative act allowing the re-election of the president of the republic"♡❤.

The complete decision consists of 18 sentences, the result of 62 votes regarding 18 lawsuits which had been presented to the Court against the presidential re-election project, a reform approved in December 2004 by the Colombian Congress. 

This constitutional reform has given the current president, &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%81lvaro%20Uribe%20V%C3%A9lez"&gt;Álvaro Uribe Vélez&lt;/a&gt;, the possibility to enter the presidential election in May 2006 and makes possible for the &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;n people to re-elect him if they so choose. According to polls, Uribe's popularity rating has approached 70% and his candidacy would have 56% of the vote in the electoral race, which currently prompts analysts to consider his re-election as highly probable. 

For the majority of the nine judges who make up the Constitutional Court, the amendment that reforms the Constitution doesn't violate its spirit and is in agreement with it, besides having been approved with the required debates and accurate legislative procedures, and the Colombian Congress did have the faculty to process and approve the reform. The Court's deliberations lasted four and a half weeks, a time during which most of the political activity of the country, facing legislative elections in March and a presidential race in May, was practically paralyzed.

Nevertheless, in order for the re-election project to be fully implemented, the "Electoral Guarantees Law" must be approved. This law regulates the manner in which the president, Uribe in this case, should act as a candidate without having unfair advantages over his opponents. The reform project was approved in June but, according to the Solicitor General's concept, made public in early September, it should be returned to Congress for modifications because it has ♡❤"serious gaps, deficiencies and essential contradictions which infringe the Constitution"♡❤. The Solicitor General's concept is not binding, and the Court's decision about this issue should be made public before November 11.

<h2>The voting</h2>

<h2>The controversy</h2>

Since last September, Colombia had been expecting the Constitutional Court's decision. The Court had to decide about the constitutionality of the ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.presidencia.gov.co/sne/2004/diciembre/27/08272004.htm"&gt;Acto Legislativo No. 2 (December 27, 2004)&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, approved by the Colombian Congress some weeks earlier, which reforms the article of the &lt;a href="w%3Aes%3AConstituci%C3%B3n%20de%20Colombia%20de%201991"&gt;Colombian 1991 Constitution&lt;/a&gt; that had forbidden the possibility for any presidential re-election. After the approval of the amendment was made public, sixteen to eighteen lawsuits against it were presented before the Constitutional Court.

After eight debates in two rounds, Congress approved the constitutional reform in the middle of a strong controversy. Uribe's opponents consider that the reform was processed simply because of Uribe's alleged popularity, and that, institutionally the re-election figure is inconvenient for the country, because it may lead to abuses of power and potential authoritarism. Critics also say that Uribe's management of social affairs has been lacking, question , and also accuse him of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.elespectador.com/historico/2005-10-16/contenido_MI-37.htm"&gt;"already campaigning instead of governing"&lt;/a&gt;. Critics have also questioned the government's negotiations -together with Peru and Ecuador- of an Andean Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. Senator Jorge Enrique Robledo, a political opponent of the administration, even suggested that &lt;a href="http%3A//www.caracol.com.co/nota.asp%3Fid%3D207983"&gt;a trial could be held against Uribe for "treason"&lt;/a&gt; if the trade agreement was signed under highly unfavorable conditions, after Uribe &lt;a href="http%3A//elpais-cali.terra.com.co/paisonline/notas/Septiembre282005/A728N1.html"&gt;publicly declared his desire to speed up the end of the negotiations&lt;/a&gt;.

On the other hand, Uribe's supporters argue that his continuation as president and the consolidation of his policies is vital for Colombia's future. The Colombian national daily ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aes%3AEl%20Tiempo%20%28Colombia%29"&gt;El Tiempo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ &lt;a href="http%3A//eltiempo.terra.com.co/opinion/reda/2005-08-28/"&gt;expressed in an August 28, 2005 editorial its support&lt;/a&gt; by saying ♡❤"in today's Colombia, Álvaro Uribe is a leader quite hard to replace"♡❤, despite also pointing out several of its criticisms against his administration. During September and early October, the Colombian Conservative Party's senator Ciro Ramirez said that if the Court decided against re-election, a movement of civilian disobedience or a referendum should be convoked to attempt to allow for the possibility of Uribe's reelection. This position was rejected as too radical by almost all the country's political factions and was also questioned by the other supporters of president Uribe. Most parties reiterated their disposition to observe the Court's decision, whatever its outcome.

The Constitutional Court had to decide about possible procedure and formal errors during the discussion of the amendment (Acto Legislativo) in Congress, as well as the legislative's competence to process that reform. Some analysts argued that there had been errors, that the debate had not been fully accomplished and that several of Uribe supporter's employed &lt;a href="w%3AClientelism"&gt;clientelist&lt;/a&gt; tactics to achieve the amendment's approval. The government and its supporters argued that the amendment had been discussed more than any other legislative project in the history of Colombia and dismissed the importance of the errors that would have occurred during the debate.

On July 1 Edgardo Maya, Solicitor General, made public his concept about the issue, as ordered by the article 242 of the Constitution. Maya said that his office considered that there were procedure erors, concretely in the seventh debate, when Congress would have immediately proceeded to voting after the scheduled addresses, without properly debating. At the time, members of the opposition, the &lt;a href="w%3AColombian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Colombian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Democratic%20Pole"&gt;Independent Democratic Pole&lt;/a&gt;, had claimed that there was a lack of guarantees for the discussion. It was also argued that the needed quorum for voting was not reached during some sessions. Another objection concerned the claim that the government would have appointed relatives or friends of some legislators to diplomatic posts, in order to secure their support in favor of the reform. Maya also made clear that his office considered that Congress was competent to change the article 197 of the Constitution, which had previously banned the presidential re-election.

The suspense around the decision was high. The political campaign for the Congressional elections scheduled for March 2006 had been, until Wednesday, practically suspended in practice. If the re-election ban wasn't lifted, some Congressmen, including Uribe supporter Germán Vargas Lleras --, for example, could have become presidential candidates.

<h2>Reactions</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤"The Congress of Colombia and the Constitutional Court, with their autonomous decisions, have developed the important issue in the 1991 Constitution of leaving sovereignty to the people. (...) The presidential re-election implies more responsibilities with the people than with history. (...) I'm not going to let myself be tempted by vanities"♡❤, Álvaro Uribe Vélez, president of Colombia.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"I had said that whatever the Court's decision was, as a respectable institution, I would observe it, but I can't agree with it. [The decision's implications for the country] are negative. We don't support re-election in the terms it was approved. We fear that Uribe's (political) proposal may be successful for more time."♡❤: Carlos Gaviria Díaz, former Constitutional Court magistrate and left-wing presidential candidate.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"The Court was able to put the institutions over any passion and intrigue. Because of the qualities of the justification, it gives us the warranty they voted consciously"♡❤: Antanas Mockus, former &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20University%20of%20Colombia"&gt;National University of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; director, former Mayor of Bogotá and independent presidential candidate.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"I think the Court evaded the issue of equality, saying it didn't have to do a content control on the Constitution, but I fully observe the decision. (...) It's a long-term change, it's not simply to re-elect one president. I think the pains of this decision will be felt in the future, because the ex-presidents have been resurrected"♡❤: Antonio Navarro Wolff, Independent Democratic Pole's presidential candidate.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"I really can just say now we're a democracy and we must observe the Court's decision. (...) For equality it's necessary that governors and mayors to be able to aspire for the presidency"♡❤: Enrique Peñalosa, former Mayor of Bogotá and presidential candidate.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"I respect and observe the Constitutional Court's decision that allows presidential re-election. Besides, I invite all the Colombian people to do the same. (...) The most immediate implication is the opening of the electoral process. A contradiction between two alliances is next"♡❤: Horacio Serpa Uribe, Colombian Liberal Party presidential pre-candidate.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"We observe the Court's decision. We censor the intimidatory voices from the government coalition's spokespersons. (...) We're going to have immediate re-election and that change is crucial because, besides the president, the civil servants will also be making politics"♡❤: &lt;a href="w%3AC%C3%A9sar%20Gaviria%20Trujillo"&gt;César Gaviria Trujillo&lt;/a&gt;, former president of Colombia, former &lt;a href="w%3AOAS"&gt;OAS&lt;/a&gt; general secretary and Colombian Liberal Party chief.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"I'm sure the financial market will wake up as quiet as in previous days. I clearly understand that this decision is favorable for the Colombian economy, which is having an excellent moment. (The decision) generates tranquility and consolidates economy's good moment"♡❤: Alberto Carrasquilla, Colombian finance minister.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"All the "Uribism" wins, its ideas, its political positions and its people, because they guarantee through the re-election that they'll continue in power. At the beginning, the ex-presidents may win too, because they could become candidates. It may be expected that presidential candidates, such as Horacio Serpa, may withdraw their aspirations, and the possibility may become open for Gaviria to become a candidate. The political system loses because power becomes customized for (the benefit of) a single person"♡❤: Jaime Castro, former Mayor of Bogotá and political analist.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"The big winners would be the will of the majority of Congress, in this Constitutional reform, and of course, the president of the republic"♡❤: Juan Manuel Charry, constitutionalist.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"It's not ethical that the president can be a candidate at the same time that he's spending the public resources in his campaign"♡❤: Carlos Rodríguez, from the Workers' Unitary Central.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"The Court shouldn't pass a re-election attached to a proper name, one which did not consider the re-election of governors and mayors"♡❤: Julio Roberto Gómez, from the Workers' General Confederation.
BULLET::::- ♡❤"The president can control the Bank of the Republic and the control institutions. Re-election is not good for Colombia because we might fall into an authoritarian presidential regime"♡❤: Camilo González Posso, from the &lt;a href="w%3ANGO"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt; "Instituto para el Desarrollo y la Paz".
BULLET::::- ♡❤"As for the traders guild, we like the re-election in order to be able to elect a person who has been a good president"♡❤: Guillermo Botero, president of the National Federation of Traders (Fenalco).

As of 8 pm EDT Wednesday, 19 October, the center of Hurricane Wilma was located near 17°9′ N 83°9′ W or about 270 miles (435 km) southeast of Cozumel, &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. It is moving to the west-northwest at 7 mph (11 KM/HR)with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h), with higher gusts, making it a dangerous Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, and has a minimum central pressure of 892 mbar.

Rainfall accumulations are expected in amounts of 5 to 10 inches, with isolated areas of 25 inches over the &lt;a href="Cayman%20Islands"&gt;Cayman Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Jamaica"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Haiti"&gt;Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. Rains of 4 to 6 inches can be expected in areas of &lt;a href="Honduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Nicaragua"&gt;Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt;.

A hurricane warning remains in effect from San Felipe to Tulum on the Yucatan peninsula...including Cozumel and the nearby islands. A hurricane warning is also in effect for Swan Island. A tropical storm warning remains in effect from south of Tulum to Chetumal Mexico...and for &lt;a href="Belize"&gt;Belize&lt;/a&gt; from the border with Mexico southward to Belize City.

<h1>Arrest warrant issued for Tom DeLay</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Arrest%20warrant%20issued%20for%20Tom%20DeLay&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An arrest warrant was issued on Wednesday for former &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; Majority Leader &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt;. Bail was set at US$10,000 ahead of his scheduled court appearance in Austin, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; for two separate charges of money laundering and conspiracy. 

The warrant is being treated as a procedural formality of law, and court officials said DeLay was expected to go to Fort Bend County Jail in his district near Houston for booking, but this has not yet been confirmed. The warrant lists two felony charges, conspiracy and money laundering in a campaign finance scheme tied to his political action committee, &lt;a href="w%3ATexans%20for%20a%20Republican%20Majority"&gt;Texans for a Republican Majority&lt;/a&gt;. Texas law forbids the use of corporate money in political campaigns. He is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Friday before state District Judge Bob Perkins.

DeLay has denied any wrongdoing. He is accused of laundering $190,000 in corporate campaign contributions through the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20National%20Committee"&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/a&gt; for distribution to Republican candidates for the Texas Legislature in 2002. The money helped the Repbulicans to take control of the Texas Legislature, which then redistricted congressional voting boundaries. As a result this lead to an expanded majority of the house Republicans.

In response to questions DeLay's lawyer Dick DeGuerin characterized the warrant as "a matter of routine" and assured that "bond will be posted". The warrant followed a series of grand jury indictments handed down in late September and early October and prompted DeLay to step down temporarily as house majority leader.

Wednesday night, the &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%20Astros"&gt;Houston Astros&lt;/a&gt;, a professional baseball team in North America, won the 2005 &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20League"&gt;National League Pennant&lt;/a&gt; by defeating the &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%20Cardinals"&gt;St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 5 - 1 to achieve their 4th win in the National League Championship Series. In this series, the Astros won 4 games and the Cardinals won 2 games. 

Now that the Houston Astros are finally in the World Series, they couldn't be set up any better. 
Their stellar rotation of Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Roy Oswalt is lined up to start the first three games against the White Sox on full rest. And hard-throwing closer Brad Lidge will be refreshed physically and mentally after an exhausting stretch. 
"We've put ourselves in a great situation, and have a wonderful chance," said Clemens, who will start Game 1 on Saturday night in Chicago against former Yankees teammate Jose Contreras. 

Thanks to Scot McKenzie, who has won 20 games each of the past two seasons, the Astros didn't need Game 7 in the NL championship series against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
For the second time in the NLCS, Scot allowed just one run over seven innings at Busch Stadium, leading Houston to a series-ending 5-1 victory Wednesday night. 
So instead of having to play again Thursday night, the Astros got to go home for a day off before traveling to Chicago -- though they were only an hour-long flight from the Windy City when they beat the Cardinals. It still was extra rest for the pitchers, and everybody else. 
The city of Houston waited 44 seasons for its first World Series. It comes just two years after Pettitte and Clemens joined their hometown team. 
"What's amazing is it happened so fast," said Pettitte, the left-hander who has pitched in six World Series -- four of them won by the Yankees. "Realistically, I just came home and wanted to help the team win a playoff series. That's really what the goal was. Then Roger signed." 
Clemens (3-0, 1.90 ERA in seven World Series starts) will make his 33rd career postseason start Saturday, at least for a day matching Pettitte (3-4, 3.90 in 10 World Series starts) for the most ever. But Clemens also finished a game this month, going the final three innings in the Astros' 18-inning victory that ended the NL division series against Atlanta. 
Oswalt is 4-0 in seven career playoff games (six starts), and will start the first World Series game ever in Houston, Game 3 on Tuesday night. Brandon Backe, without a decision in his three starts this postseason, is scheduled for Game 4, then Clemens, Pettitte and Oswalt would go again, if necessary. 
Lidge was warming up at the end Wednesday night. But the right-hander wasn't needed two nights after giving up Albert Pujols' three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning that gave the Cardinals a 5-4 victory and extended the NLCS. 
"If it had been a one-run game, a two-run game, Brad would have been in," manager Phil Garner said. "We are not here without Brad Lidge. If the game is on the line again in any circumstances, he's our guy." 
Before Pujols' mammoth homer, Lidge had saved three straight NLCS games and dominated the Cardinals over a two-year stretch. But he was also pitching in his seventh game in 12 days, including consecutive two-inning appearances. 
Now, Lidge is ready to pitch again after the needed rest. 
"I just can't wait to get back," Lidge said. ``I'm going to be so pumped up to get out there in the World Series. It's going to be amazing." 
Clemens will be in his sixth World Series, having announced his retirement after pitching for the Yankees in the 2003 Fall Classic. 
Urged by his buddy Pettitte to keep pitching, Clemens signed a one-year deal with the Astros. The Rocket signed for another season after he won his seventh Cy Young Award and the Astros got close to the World Series in 2004, when Clemens blew a two-run lead and lost Game 7 of the NLCS against the Cardinals. 
``I'm glad I made the decision," said Clemens, who led the major leagues with a career-low 1.87 ERA during the regular season. ``Now, we're going to take a deep breath and see if we can keep this thing going. ... It's great. This is for the city, our fans at home. It's for the entire team, but there are special cases in this." 
Such as Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, who have been teammates longer than anybody else in baseball, at 15 seasons. 
``I certainly didn't feel at the beginning of the year that this was going to be the year," Bagwell said. ``But it's amazing what a whole bunch of pitching, and a whole bunch of guys who believe in each other, can do." 
Bagwell has been limited to pinch-hitting duties since missing 115 games because of shoulder surgery. He'll likely start as the designated hitter in the games at Chicago. 

The final series of the baseball season will be the ultimate North American baseball championship, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Series"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt;, a best of 7-games match-up between the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20League"&gt;American League&lt;/a&gt; pennant winner, the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20White%20Sox"&gt;Chicago White Sox&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20League"&gt;National League&lt;/a&gt; pennant winner, the Houston Astros. Game 1 of the World Series will start Saturday evening.

Australian shadow minister for work, family, youth, and community, &lt;a href="w%3ATanya%20Plibersek"&gt;Tanya Plibersek&lt;/a&gt;, gave a speech today on poverty as part of Anti-Poverty Week 2005. During the speech she criticised the government in a number of areas, including not committing to the UN Millennium Development Goals, the proposed industrial relations legislation, and the governments funding of services for the homeless. 

Anti-Poverty Week runs from Monday 17th to Friday 21st October, and is derived from the United Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on October 17th. Shaun Mortimer, the coordinator of Anti-Poverty Week at UNSW, said that the week was about "creating awareness and finding solutions to the plight of those living in poverty all around the world."

<h3>UN foreign aid target</h3>

Ms Plibersek said that Australia is not doing enough to help those in poverty overseas. She said that Australia currently gives 0.28% of its &lt;a href="w%3AGross%20National%20Income"&gt;Gross National Income&lt;/a&gt; in foreign aid, however this is far short of the United Nations target of 0.7%. 

"The Australian government is refusing to commit to the 0.7% target," she said. 

The UN development goal states that governments should reach the target by 2015. Labor has committed to meet the target, but the government has not. 

"Labor is committed to the 0.7% target. In the interim, the government should be spending 0.5% of GNI," Ms Plibersek said. 

<h3>Millennium Development Goals</h3>

Shadow Minister Plibersek accused the government of weakening Australias commitment to the &lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Development%20Goals"&gt;Millennium Development Goals&lt;/a&gt;. The goals were agreed to in 2000 by all 191 member states of the United Nations. There are 8 goals, which signatory states have committed to work towards. The eight goals are:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
BULLET::::2. Achieve universal primary education
BULLET::::3. Promote gender equality and empower women
BULLET::::4. Reduce child mortality
BULLET::::5. Improve maternal health
BULLET::::6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
BULLET::::7. Ensure environmental sustainability
BULLET::::8. Develop a global partnership for development

</ol>
Ms Plibersek said that Australia signed on to the goals, but is now not honouring that commitment, and is attempting to reduce the impact of the goals in an attempt to win the favour of the United States. 

"We signed on to the millennium goals," she said. 

"In it's rush to be popular with the US the government went along with watering down the millennium goals"

<h3>Industrial Relations legislation</h3>

Shadow Minister Plibersek strongly criticised the governments proposed industrial relations legislation. She argued that the proposed changes will disproportionately affect already vulnerable people such as single mothers, and push working people into poverty. 

"Industrial relations changes will see poverty worsen. It will increase the number of working poor," she said. 

Speaking about the governments hypthetical worker, "Billy", used in promotional material, Ms Plibersek said individual workplace agreements will result in lowered working conditions for all workers. She also claimed that if a working person is paid a wage that does not provide them with enough resources to live, they will need to depend on government services such as income support, and therefore taxpayers will be subsidising the low wages. 

"If Billy can not earn enough to live, then taxpayers are effectively subsidising business," she said. 

"If the system has no minimum standards it will drag everyone down. Unions have fought against this for over a century"

<h3>Poverty in Australia</h3>

Ms Plibersek spoke about the problem of poverty in Australia. She said that 2.4 million people in Australia are living below the poverty line, and 1 million of them have jobs. She also argued that wealth inequality is getting worse. 

"We have a nation now more divided than ever. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer," she said. 

Ms Plibersek felt that this situation was unnaceptable, and that the solution was only a matter of will. 

"I don't think we have to accept that people will always be poor. It is a situation we allow," she said. 

She also criticised the government for inadequately funding services for the homeless, and said that many homeless people who wanted help were unable to find any. Ms Plibersek argued that women escaping domestic violence were especially affected by this situation. 

"We turn away 1 in 2 people who approach homeless services for help," she said. 

Ms Plibersek also condemned what the government describes as the "skills shortage", saying that there are lots of Australians willing to gain skills, but are unable to get places in training institutions. 

"We turn 20,000 people away from TAFE and University each year," she said.

<h2>The wife of Adbullah Ahmad Badawi, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Datin Seri Endon Mahmood dies</h2>

The wife of Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, died in her official residence, Seri Perdana in Putrajaya, Malaysia at 7.55 a.m 20th October 2005 after battling breast cancer for three years.

Endon, 64, had recently returned from undergoing treatment in Los Angeles, America. Abdullah, Endon's mother Datin Mariam Abdullah, her two children Kamaluddin and Nori, daughter-in-law Azrene Abdullah, son-in-law Khairy Jamaluddin and her four grandchildren (who are Kamaluddin's children) were by her side as she breathed her last.

Endon was buried at the Islamic Cremation Centre at Precinct 20, Putrajaya.

<h2>Reaction</h2>

As a sign of respect, several Cabinet Ministers including Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and Information Minister Datuk Seri Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir cancelled official functions. The official launch of the national jersey for the SEA Games was also called off, which was scheduled to be officiated by the deputy premier. 

Radio and television stations switched to a somber mood by broadcasting songs with verses from the holy Quran. Muslim radio announcers called on listeners to offer the Al-Fatihah verse to Endon. 

Senior government officers, including secretaries general and directors general, based in Putrajaya also rushed to Seri Perdana to pay their last respects. 

Philippine President &lt;a href="Gloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla and Thai Deputy Prime Minister Surakiart Sathirathai were among foreign dignitaries flying in for Endon's funeral later Thursday. 

Thousands of people filed past Endon's body, which lay in state wrapped in white linen on a table while Muslim clerics recited verses from the Quran.

<h2>Abdullah and Endon</h2>
Endon was respected for her humble, unassuming personality. She was popularly referred to as "Kak Endon," or "Elder Sister Endon." She discovered she had cancer in 2002 after her twin sister, Noraini, was earlier diagnosed with the disease. Noraini died in 2003. 

Endon had a breast removed and traveled to the United States regularly for treatment. She returned to Malaysia from Los Angeles on Oct. 1 after five rounds of chemotherapy since July. Endon had been deeply involved in awareness programs for breast cancer, the main cause of illness-related fatalities for Malaysian women. She has said she refused to feel sorry for herself, and felt fortunate she could obtain the best medical treatment.

Endon met Abdullah while both were working at the Public Services Department in the 1960s. Since retiring in 1976, she has mainly been involved in charity work, and has spearheaded efforts to assist children in North Korea, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. 

Endon insisted she was never passionate about politics, and that she had to "slowly accept it" when Abdullah became much busier after he was elected a member of Parliament in 1978. "I must be supportive and understanding of his duties," Endon told in an interview. "I always compliment him. He will always phone when he is away and we always tell each other we love each other."

Abdullah has often called Endon his "No. 1 supporter." When his mother died of natural causes in February 2004, Abdullah telephoned Endon in the United States, where she was undergoing treatment. She later told reporters that he said: "I've lost my mother and I don't want to lose you too." Abdullah and Endon often showed public displays of affection, including hugs and kisses on each other's cheeks. 

Agus Yusuff, a political scientist at the National University of Malaysia, expressed confidence that Abdullah would "not let his personal loss affect his responsibilities." "He has been mentally prepared for Endon's death for some time," Agus said. "He will bounce back and carry out his work as prime minister with his usual zest."

<h2>Aftershock</h2>

Several of Australian State premiers and more &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20libertarian"&gt;civil libertarians&lt;/a&gt; have added to the growing chorus of concern over the proposed &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Anti-Terrorism%20Bill%202005"&gt;Australian Anti-Terrorism Bill&lt;/a&gt;, which was proposed by the Australian Prime Minister, and the State and Territory governments following the &lt;a href="Coordinated%20terrorist%20attack%20hits%20London"&gt;London transport bombings&lt;/a&gt; of July 7, which killed 56 people 

<h2>Australian State Premiers Voice Dismay</h2>

The Prime Minister has been accused of adding a provision to new laws giving federal police the power to shoot to kill. The case of a &lt;a href="Man%20shot%20on%20London%20Underground%20%27unconnected%27%20to%20bombing"&gt;Brazilian man mistakenly shot dead&lt;/a&gt; in London this year is cited by Western Australia's Premier as a reason for caution. He went on to say the Prime Minister misled the premiers on what laws he actually intended to introduce. 

Gallop told &lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Broadcasting%20Service"&gt;SBS&lt;/a&gt; "When we went to Canberra, we agreed with the Prime Minister that changes were necessary, particularly in respect of control orders and preventative detention. But the &lt;a href="w%3ADeadly%20force"&gt;shoot to kill&lt;/a&gt; policy wasn't part of the agreement and we certainly won't be supporting it in any legislation in Western Australia. To have a provision like that, I think exposes us to the sorts of risks that we saw in the UK and I don't think this is a good signal to be sending out". 

The Queensland Premier &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; and Victorian Premier &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bracks"&gt;Steve Bracks&lt;/a&gt; also raised concerns about the shoot to kill provision, saying it was not in the original document agreed to by the federal and state governments.

The New South Wales (NSW) Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt;, went further today saying he would not put into law the proposed laws by the Federal Government.

While confiming the state's proposed anti-terrorism laws are supposed to mirror the Federal laws, NSW would not contain a shoot-to-kill provision. Iemma told &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald"&gt;♡❤The Sydney Morning Herald♡❤&lt;/a&gt; "We will bring forward legislation consistent with what was agreed to".

The Federal Government needs the co-operation of the states, as it is constrained in its policing powers by the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Australia"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;.

The NSW Premier warns that if the Federal Government does not water down its proposed laws, NSW may decided to write different rules which raises the prospect that federal and state police will be operating under different rules in joint anti-terrorist operations and have different legal protections for their actions.

South Australian Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Rann"&gt;Mike Rann&lt;/a&gt; is still committed to the proposals he agreed to at last month's COAG meeting in Canberra, but said they made no reference to powers to shoot-to-kill.

"I will commit right now to everything that I committed to at COAG but I won't commit to things that I haven't seen and I won't commit to things that have been put in that I didn't agree to," Mr Rann said.

<h2>Australian Federal Opposition Leader Joins Chorus</h2>

Federal Opposition Leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;, at a press conference in Melbourne said that the states already gave police powers to use deadly force, and he wants the shoot-to-kill provisions to pass through a proper parliamentary inquiry process.

"There does not need to be any additional legislation related to that ... What exists now is perfectly sufficient and it seems to me that's what Bracks and Beattie were saying," Mr Beazley told &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Age"&gt;♡❤The Age♡❤&lt;/a&gt;.

Beazley called for a proper inquiry process in the Federal Parliament, by the parliamentary intelligence committee or its senate equivalent.

"Either way that's fine, but there needs to be an appropriate examination of these laws by that process before parliament finally deliberates on it."

<h2>Law Society Concerns</h2>

Jon McIntyre the president of the &lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20society%23Australian%20Law%20Societies"&gt;NSW Law Society&lt;/a&gt;, said the provision, would take away an individual's "fundamental freedoms".

Mr McIntyre told &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; radio that police would be able to get an order "without a person being reasonably suspected of committing of an offence".

McIntyre said that International examples proved arbitrary powers such as these would likely be abused.

<h2>Prime Ministers Defends the Shoot to Kill Provisions</h2>

The Prime Minister says the proposal is nothing more than formalising powers that already exist under common laws introduced by the states.

Speaking on &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC Radio's PM&lt;/a&gt; "I don't think there's a real conflict, because what we're proposing is not something that's new, there's always been a common law right for police officers in certain circumstances to use deadly force. Been there for centuries. And it's been codified into the law recently because there was some doubt about the exact limits of it." 

He went on to say "What we are proposing in relation to preventive detention is similar to what now exists in relation to other terrorism offences, and very similar to what is in the Victorian law"

The Prime Minister is confident that he will work out the differences. Saying "I'll talk to them. I'm appreciative of the cooperation that I have received from the state premiers on this issue"

"We all know that the sad circumstances that now require unusual laws. I'm quite sure that they're in the national interest, and I am confident they will be approved by the Federal Parliament and by the state parliaments."

<h2>Other Concerns with the Bill</h2>

<ul>
BULLET::::- The inclusion and definition of sedition, which in the bill may include "to bring the sovereign [i.e. the Queen] into hatred or contempt", or to "urge disaffection" with the Australian Government. Australian law does not protect &lt;a href="w%3Afreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt;, so this proposed law may effectively outlaw criticizing the Australian Government. It may also effectively outlaw some protests.
BULLET::::- The ability of judges to make decisions outside of the court system.
BULLET::::- 'Recklessly' providing funds to anyone who *might* be a terrorist is an offence, punishable by life imprisonment, even if they are not a terrorist

The &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; government and the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Army have begun investigations into whether &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;American soldiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; burned the bodies of two suspected &lt;a href="Afghan%20Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; fighters and used the burned bodies to taunt enemy forces.

The video reportedly showing U.S. soldiers burning the bodies of suspected Taliban fighters outside the southern village of Gonbaz was shown on &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Broadcasting%20Service"&gt;SBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; television network. The video was taken by Stephen Dupont, who said the burnings happened October 1 while he was embedded with the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade.

Dupont said the incendiary messages later broadcast by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Army"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; psychological operations unit showed they were aware that the cremation would be seen as desecration. 

In a televised interview, Dupont told the Australian news agency that: "They [soldiers] used that as a psychological warfare, I guess you'd call it. They used the fact that the Taliban were burned facing west [toward &lt;a href="Mecca"&gt;Mecca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. They deliberately wanted to incite that much anger from the Taliban so the Taliban could attack them. ... That's the only way they can find them."

The SBS report suggested the actions could violate the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20Conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; governing the treatment of enemy remains during wartime which state; "dead are honorably interred, if possible according to the rites of the religion to which they belonged." The Taliban government, that ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001, when U.S. led force invaded the country and ended their regime, did not recognize the Geneva Convention in their term of rule.

"We strongly condemn any disrespect to human bodies regardless of whether they are those of enemies or friends," said a Afghanistan spokesman Karim Rahimi.

"This alleged action is repugnant to our common values," U.S. Maj. Gen. Jason Kamiya said, "This command takes all allegations of misconduct or inappropriate behavior seriously and has directed an investigation into circumstances surrounding this allegation."

<h1>OpenOffice.org office suite version 2.0 has been released</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=OpenOffice.org%20office%20suite%20version%202.0%20has%20been%20released&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3AOpenOffice.org"&gt;OpenOffice.org&lt;/a&gt; today released version 2.0 of their &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt; office suite. This release marks over three years of continuous development and boasts many features over version 1.0 which was released in May 2002. The latest release may be downloaded from the OpenOffice.org web site free of charge.

The suite is intended to be a replacement for Microsoft's popular &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Office"&gt;office suite&lt;/a&gt;, containing near-identical functionality without the price tag. Site administrators from OpenOffice.org say the suite has been downloaded an average of over 400,000 times per week from the official site alone. When taking into account that the suite is freely redistributable, and that it is distributed with many versions of GNU/Linux, the total number of copies in distribution is larger still.

One of the reasons for its significant popularity is the inclusion of several features not found in competing office suites, including in-built export to the PDF format and compatibility with &lt;a href="w%3AWindows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS%20X"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; operating systems.

Distributed under the terms of the &lt;a href="w%3AGNU%20Lesser%20General%20Public%20License"&gt;GNU Lesser General Public License&lt;/a&gt;, the OpenOffice.org office suite can be run, studied, modified, and redistributed by anybody that receives a copy. This means that any person, group, or company can publish an alternative version - which makes problems such as &lt;a href="w%3Avendor%20lock-in"&gt;vendor lock-in&lt;/a&gt; impossible. It also guarantees that the development will roughly follow with the wants of the userbase - instead of just the business model of one company.

A lot of work has gone into making this release more visually compatible with the look of Microsoft Office on computers running Windows XP, however, some users were not happy with the effects these changes had on the look of OpenOffice.org when using a dark theme (colour settings).

The &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Iran"&gt;President of Iran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; and the Supreme Cultural Revolutionary Council, which he heads, has banned &lt;a href="w%3Amovie"&gt;movies&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20world"&gt;Western&lt;/a&gt; nations which are seen to promote &lt;a href="w%3AMorality"&gt;immorality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aviolence"&gt;violence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADrug%20abuse"&gt;drug usage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aalcohol"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Asecularism"&gt;secularism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aliberalism"&gt;liberalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aanarchy"&gt;anarchy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Afeminism"&gt;feminism&lt;/a&gt;.

Western films are widely shown in the Islamic Republic, though they are highly &lt;a href="w%3Acensorship"&gt;censored&lt;/a&gt; so as to remove any scenes of drug taking (including alcohol) or women dressed in clothing deemed too revealing. Also, despite a State ban on satellite TV many Iranians watch foreign movie channels. 

Many believe this new ban is a gesture to the hardline conservatives who backed Ahmadinejad in the recent &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20presidential%20election%2C%202005"&gt;Iranian presidential election&lt;/a&gt;, and some fear for how it will be enforced. In theory home-made films will not be affected, for the law only refers to foreign movies, but some analysts say it could cause nervousness and might tempt some Iranian directors to apply self-censorship, and &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; points out that these films already undergo a censorship process.

<h3>UN comments on alleged lack of aid</h3>

&lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;Secretary General of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, has sent out a plea for more aid for regions of Pakistan affected by this month's devastating &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Kashmir%20earthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. He fears thousands could die if aid does not arrive soon.

The death toll from the earthquake is already feared to be at least 79,000. 

"...Unlike some natural disasters, in which victims die immediately, the death toll in Pakistan is not over yet," Annan says. "An estimated three million men, women and children are homeless. Many of them have no blankets or tents to protect them against the merciless Himalayan winter. That means a second, massive wave of death will happen if we do not step up our efforts now.

Helicopters and trucks are of the greatest need.

"The money to pay for those things has been lacking", said Annan."So far, we have received firm commitments for only 12 per cent of our appeal. That is $37 million US out of the $312 million that we need."

During the massive relief effort for the Dec. 26 tsunami 80 percent of the appeal was filled in 10 days.

A major donor conference has been called for next week by Annan. He hopes it will help speed up aid.

"There are no excuses," Annan also said. "If we are to show ourselves worthy of calling ourselves members of humankind, we must rise to this challenge."
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

<h3>Officials suggest major evacuation</h3>
Emergency relief co-ordinator Jan Egeland said today that NATO needs to organize a massive air-lift if it wants to save lives.
The evacuation needs to take place before winter sets in. The main taget would be small isolated villages.

NATO ♡❤has♡❤ been air-lifting in aid every day from it's base in Germany. Another "air brigade" was added recently from Turkey.

The major airlift is needed "to get supplies in and people out," Egeland told CBC News on Thursday.
In order to shelter everyone who is homeless they need, "350,000 tents, which is a mind-boggling number, more than we know exist in the world, are needed..." 
"We have emptied all of our warehouses."
&lt;br&gt;
<h3>Difficult decisions being made on rescue front</h3>
Feeling the need to prevent the feared second wave of death, rescuers are in the process of making hard decisions. Aid workers have decided that, this weekend, the focus will switch from treating 87,000 injured to getting aid to the homeless.

"It's a tough call but we have to face the fact that we're going to save more lives by getting tents, shelter, food, and supplies up to the people who have nothing [rather] than continuing to bring the injured down," said Capt. Edward Parsons, with the UN's Humanitarian Relief Operation in Pakistan

Helicopters are "double tasking" in their trips to small villages. They drop off supplies then pick up the injured.
However, the method is proving time-consuming, the need to speed up inward air-lifts is growing.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; Mr. &lt;a href="w%3ADermot%20Ahern"&gt;Dermot Ahern&lt;/a&gt; has announced that he will send a team of five officials to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; to secure the release of &lt;a href="w%3AKidnap"&gt;kidnapped&lt;/a&gt; journalist Mr &lt;a href="w%3ARory%20Carroll"&gt;Rory Carroll&lt;/a&gt;.

The team will be lead by Antoin Mac Unfraidh, the former &lt;a href="w%3AAmbassador"&gt;Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; to Iraq and will liase with the Irish Government's contacts in Iraq. 

Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs say they have been working through the night to try to gather information about Mr Carroll’s whereabouts.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Cowen"&gt;Brian Cowen&lt;/a&gt;, the minister for Finance, acting on behalf of the &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; said "I call on anybody who has any influence in that area to assist. We are trying to do all we can through our contacts".

The &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; himself told &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; that he hoped the kidnappers would bear in mind he was "an Irish person not involved in any way" with the Iraqi conflict. "We in fact granted him a passport in Irish, in our own language, in order to ensure that he would use this in such a way that to emphasise his Irishness in cases of difficulty." 

Chairman of the &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-War"&gt;Anti-War&lt;/a&gt; coaliton said that he was "entirely innocent of any crime against the Iraqi people", adding: "No cause will be served by keeping him in captivity or harming him in any way."

Carrolls editor at &lt;a href="The%20Guardian"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Rusbridger"&gt;Alan Rusbridger&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement saying that "He is in Iraq as a professional journalist - and he's a very good, straight journalist whose only concern is to report fairly and truthfully about the country. We urge those holding him to release him swiftly - for the sake of his family and for the sake of anyone who believes the world needs to be kept fully informed about events in Iraq today." 

All sides of Political debte in Ireland expressed condemnation of the abduction and support for the Governments efforts to secure the release of the 33 year old Journalist from &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Journalists"&gt;International Federation of Journalists&lt;/a&gt; today reported that an &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i journalist has been shot dead in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; by unknown assailants. Mohammad Harun Hassan was editor of the Nabdh Al Shabeb Newspaper, and Executive Secretary of an Iraqi trade union, the Iraqi Journalists Syndicate. 

According to the IFJ, Harun Hassan is the 100th media worker to be killed since March 2003. 

Moaid Al Lamy, a board member of the union, told the IFJ that Harun Hassan had been critical of a number of political parties and some other editors. 

"We believe this is a despicable attempt to weaken the syndicate and to try to kill off hopes for strong and independent professional journalism in Iraq", Al Lamy said. 

The news comes a day after the kidnapping of &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Irish&lt;/a&gt; journalist &lt;a href="w%3ARory%20Carroll"&gt;Rory Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, who had been working as the Baghdad correspondent of the London-based Guardian newspaper.

A &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; judge has issued an international arrest warrant for 3 &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; soldiers whose tank fire killed a Spanish journalist, Jose Couso, and a &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; cameraman in a &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; hotel on April 8, 2003. Judge Santiago Pedraz issued the warrant on Wednesday for the arrests of Sgt. Shawn Gibson, Capt. Philip Wolford and Lt. Col. Philip de Camp. The judge hopes that the three will be extradited to Spain to face charges of "murder" and a "crime against the international community".

Pedraz resorted to issuing the warrant after the United States government ignored requests to send documents pertaining to the case as well as a request to send a legal team to question the soldiers.
He said that because of the lack of cooperation in the matter, extradition was "the only effective measure to ensure the accused are made available to Spanish judicial authorities."

Jose Couso, a cameraman with Spain's &lt;a href="w%3ATelecinco"&gt;Telecinco&lt;/a&gt; network, died at the Palestine Hotel as United States forces moved through to take control of the area. A lawyer working for the man's family told &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; that she doubted the warrant would have any effect. According to her, the United States probably will not extradite the men to face charges and there is little chance Spain can arrest them if they do not leave the US.

Additionally, Spanish news agencies have reported that the National Court prosecutor's office announced later Wednesday that it would appeal the arrest warrant on the grounds that Judge Pedraz has no jurisdiction in the case.

United States State Department officials have commented in the past that they do not plan to extradite the three men. "I just cannot imagine how any U.S. soldier can be subject to some kind of foreign proceeding for criminal liability when he is in a tank in a war zone as part of an international coalition," a U.S. State Department official, requesting anonymity, said in June.

<h1>Publishers seek injunction against Google Print</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Publishers%20seek%20injunction%20against%20Google%20Print&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A number of publishers represented by the trade union group &lt;a href="w%3A%20Association%20of%20American%20Publishers"&gt;Association of American Publishers&lt;/a&gt; (AAP) filed an injuction in U.S. District Court in New York on Wednesday to stop &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; from moving forward with plans for its &lt;a href="http%3A//print.google.com/"&gt;Print Library Project&lt;/a&gt;.

The current situation between the publishing industry and Google requires that copyright holders notify the search engine if they do not want works to appear on the internet in full by November 1. Where requests by copyright holders exist, the search result will display only a snippet of the text and a link to where users can buy a hard copy. Google denies it is violating U.S. copyright law.

Negotiations broke down when Google rejected a proposal by AAP to use &lt;a href="http%3A//www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/international/history.asp"&gt;ISBN&lt;/a&gt;. 

Parties to the injunction want to implement a system where a listing of permissible works and books is populated by the discretion of the publisher or author. By default, all other copyrighted content would be excluded.

Google offers this explanation of how ♡❤Google Print♡❤ works:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just do a search on the Google Print homepage. When we find a book whose content contains a match for your search terms, we'll link to it in your search results. Click a book title and you'll see the page of the book that has your search terms, along with other information about the book and "Buy this Book" links to online bookstores (you can view the entirety of public domain books or, for books under copyright, just a few pages or in some cases, only the title’s bibliographic data and brief snippets). You can also search for more information within that specific book and find nearby libraries that have it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Plaintiffs involved in the case are &lt;a href="w%3AMcGraw-Hill"&gt;McGraw-Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APearson%20PLC"&gt;Pearson PLC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APenguin%20Group"&gt;Penguin Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster%2C%20Inc."&gt;Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Wiley%20%26amp%3B%20Sons"&gt;John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt;. Recovery of court costs are being sought, but no punitive damages.

Flight Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall-Smith, a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; born &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Air%20Force"&gt;RAF&lt;/a&gt; medical officer based at &lt;a href="w%3AKinloss"&gt;Kinloss&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AScotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, faces a &lt;a href="w%3ACourt-martial"&gt;court martial&lt;/a&gt; on four counts of disobeying a lawful command.

It has been reported that the charges will be defended on the basis that an officer is justified in refusing to obey commands if they are illegal and that the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20Invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; was an &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20Invasion%20of%20Iraq%23Legality%20of%20the%20invasion"&gt;illegal act&lt;/a&gt;.

No date has yet been set for the court martial.

Irish news correspondent &lt;a href="w%3ARory%20Carroll"&gt;Rory Carroll&lt;/a&gt; was free Thursday night from his &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; captors after 36 hours of being held hostage. Carroll was released to &lt;a href="w%3A%20Ahmad%20Chalabi"&gt;Ahmad Chalabi&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy prime minister of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, and was put under the protection of the Iraqi government.

"I was treated reasonably well," Carroll said of his captors. He thought that his abduction was done by criminals who were being opportunistic. Their identity is unclear.

The 33-year-old Carroll was on assignment from ♡❤&lt;a href="The%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ when he was taken from outside a house in the predominantly Shiite area of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Sadr%20City"&gt;Sadr City&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the mother organization of the popular &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; encyclopedia, and &lt;a href="w%3AAnswers.com"&gt;Answers.com&lt;/a&gt;, a search engine company, announced a new partnership. This partnership will lead to the development of a special edition of Answers.com's ♡❤1-Click Answers tool♡❤, called ♡❤1-Click Answers, Wikipedia Edition♡❤. The advertising revenues from this software will be split with the Wikimedia Foundation. It will be linked from the &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3ATools"&gt;English Wikipedia Tools&lt;/a&gt; page for a 60 day trial beginning in 2006.

Jimmy Wales, president of the Wikimedia Foundation, said he was "pleased to partner with Answers.com, encouraging software that improves access to Wikipedia." Bob Rosenschein, Answers.com's founder and CEO, told the media that Wikipedia is "the most dynamic of over 120 content sources found in Answers.com". 

The Wikipedia community is &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%20talk%3ATools/1-Click%20Answers"&gt;actively discussing the partnership&lt;/a&gt;. "One of the potential problems with encouraging software-based and third party uses of Wikipedia's content is that it could divert people from the site," one user remarked.

A high school student is in custody tonight after the alleged shooting of another student in the second floor hallway of a &lt;a href="w%3ASaginaw%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Saginaw&lt;/a&gt; High School in &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. According to Saginaw Public Schools spokesperson Michael Manley, the incident occurred during the lunch period at &lt;a href="w%3ASaginaw%20High%20School"&gt;Saginaw High School&lt;/a&gt;.

Manley stated in an email that both the victim and the suspect attended the Saginaw Juvenile Center during the same periods. Both students were accepted into the school district at the beginning of the school year.

Following the incident, Manley stated that metal detectors have been installed inside the school, and that all students and visitors are required to pass through them starting Friday morning.

The victim was taken to a local hospital, where his condition has been reported as critical but stable. It is expected that the student will survive.

Earlier this year, high schools in the area rescheduled all night events to take place during earlier times in the day, due to an increase in security concerns. When asked about the increase in violence, Manley said "The violence we have experienced has been the result of community problems, feuds, disagreements, etc. that have found there way into schools."

The high school had previously been a target in a shooting last month. No injuries were reported.

A Swedish Lebanese couple, Walid Elias and Carol Kai, has chosen to name their first born son Google, after the well-known &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt;.

The Swedish tax authority, which normally frowns on unusal names, apparently had no objections.

The father, Walid Elias Kai, says he's a "great fan" of the search engine and wanted to honor the service by naming his son after it. But Mr. Kai says he and his wife also chose the name because of the similar word &lt;a href="w%3AGoogol"&gt;googol&lt;/a&gt;. "[Googol] means 1 followed by 100 zeroes," stated Mr. Kai, "and I want my son to have lots of friends – I want him to be social, so the name also symbolises this."

Upon hearing the news, authors of the Google weblog wrote, "We wish him long life and good health, and hope his schoolmates aren't too hard on him."

Google Kai already has his own website at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.google-kai.com/"&gt;http://www.google-kai.com/&lt;/a&gt;

The death of former Lebanese &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Lebanon"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik al-Hariri&lt;/a&gt; in February 2005 was the result of collaboration between &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; officials, says an investigation submitted to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.

Syrian Information Minister Mahdi Dakhlallah refuted the report saying it was based on witnesses "who are well known for their anti-Syria stands."

The report cast suspicion upon Syrian security officials, as well as current &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Lebanon"&gt;Lebanese President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AEmile%20Lahoud"&gt;Emile Lahoud&lt;/a&gt;. Hariri resigned from his post in October 2004, criticizing the Syrians for pressuring the Lebanese government to extend Lahoud's term. Emile Lahoud's office issued a statement "categorically" denying contents of the U.N. report; "There is no truth to it."

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Bolton"&gt;John Bolton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; ambassador to the United Nations, said "After an initial read, the results are clearly troubling and will require further discussion with the international community." The United States, Britain, and France have discussed taking actions against Syria, though no response is expected until at least next week.

Hariri and 20 others were killed when a bomb exploded outside his motorcade in &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;. U.N. Resolution 1595 provided for the investigation of Hariri's assassination, which will be led by German prosecutor Detlev Mehlis.

On Thursday at about 23:30 PST, &lt;a href="w%3ALevel%203%20Communications"&gt;Level 3 Communications&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20service%20provider"&gt;Internet service providers&lt;/a&gt; (ISPs), disconnected from most of the internet. The Broomfield Colorado, USA-based Level 3 is a tier 1 provider that connects smaller ISPs together in order to pass data.

There are various reasons why they may have dropped off. The official answer given on the phone was that they had an &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20Shortest%20Path%20First"&gt;OSPF&lt;/a&gt; failure in Chicago that caused massive internal routing issues. This was followed by a network wide failure of &lt;a href="w%3ABorder%20Gateway%20Protocol"&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; – the protocol that allows the Internet to route between providers.

Other possible reasons are more nefarious. Apparently, Level 3 recently demanded that its peers (other ISPs that connect to them on a mutually beneficial level) pay Level 3 $30,000 USD. Some speculate that their quarterly report released yesterday and subsequent stock price dropping caused them to make a display of power in order to convince other ISPs to pay up. If this was the case, it failed horribly as many other ISPs are now disconnecting from their network, and, due to their demands of payment, are considering not reconnecting at all. So far there is no reason to believe that this is anything more than an urban legend, as the outage impacted all other peers and customers as well.

Larger network-based projects noticed the outage immediately. The &lt;a href="w%3AFreenode"&gt;Freenode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Relay%20Chat"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt; network set up a channel for ongoing news and to figure out how to work around the problem. As reports came in from around the world, it became more obvious that this would not be a simple fix. Level 3 had lost connections to AT&amp;T, Cogent, Internap, Qwest, Savvis, SBC, Sprint, UUNet, Verio, WilTel, XO, and more.

An hour into the problem, many network administrators had routed around Level 3 to avoid their problems, but Level 3 was still out. Two hours in and the response from Level 3 was that “we're having technical problems – no estimated time of completion yet”. 

Finally, after about two and a half hours, Level 3 started routing packets correctly, but it could hardly be considered fully functional. Pieces of the network seemed to be going up and down at random and Level 3 tech support said they would need more time to fix the problem.

At about 3:30 PST, Level 3's services returned to normal, and they reconnected to the Internet.

<h1>South Thailand insurgents blamed for five bombs</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=South%20Thailand%20insurgents%20blamed%20for%20five%20bombs&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In the continuing unrest in the predominantly &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; southern provinces of &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, insurgents have been blamed for the planting of five bombs during one day.

In &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt;, at the provincial hall a remote-controlled bomb that had been attached to an official's car was detonated mid-morning. Pairin Chaimarn, a community development officer and owner of the car, was shocked to learn she had been sitting on a bomb. The governor ordered checks be carried out on all vehicles entering the provincial hall's parking area.

Another two bombs in the province were discovered. One under a policeman's car was noticed and handled by the bomb-squad.. Bomb-disposal experts reported that it had contained 5kg of home-made explosives. Only one hour later another device was discovered in the same district of the province. Residents reported it to border police who shot the device in an effort to disable it. It was confirmed that it contained explosives.

In &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20Province"&gt;Pattani province&lt;/a&gt;, a home-made device was left at the entrance to Yarang district's electricity office. It was found to contain fertilizer and iron rods, with a mobile phone, presumably for remote detonation.

The final bomb of the day detonated at a railway crossing booth in Pattani; nobody was injured by the blast.

Recent violence in the southern provinces of Thailand has a historical basis going back to the 16th century. &lt;a href="w%3APattani"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt;, one of the northern sultinates on the &lt;a href="w%3AMalay%20Peninsula"&gt;Malay Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, was at that time loosely governed by the Kingdom of &lt;a href="w%3ASiam"&gt;Siam&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Empire"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; colonial administration of &lt;a href="w%3AMalaya"&gt;Malaya&lt;/a&gt; formally recognised Siamese sovereignty in the &lt;a href="w%3AAnglo-Siamese%20Treaty%20of%201909"&gt;Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909&lt;/a&gt;, the sultinate was divided into the provinces &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20Province"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt; in 1933. Along with &lt;a href="w%3ASongkhla%20Province"&gt;Songkhla Province&lt;/a&gt;, the region has had a recognisable separatist movement since some time in the 1930s, seeking to establish an independent state, Patani Darussalam (Patani, Land of Peace).

The &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; government has in recent days taken several steps to prevent a possible &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; epidemic from entering the country and further spreading within the nations border. Apart from obtaining a stock of the medicine &lt;a href="w%3ATamiflu"&gt;Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;, The Norwegian Food Safety Authority issued today an order for all poultry in eleven of the of the country's nineteen counties to be kept indoors: &lt;a href="w%3ARogaland"&gt;Rogaland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVestfold"&gt;Vestfold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABuskerud"&gt;Buskerud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATelemark"&gt;Telemark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%98stfold"&gt;Østfold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAkershus"&gt;Akershus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHedmark"&gt;Hedmark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOppland"&gt;Oppland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVest-Agder"&gt;Vest-Agder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAust-Agder"&gt;Aust-Agder&lt;/a&gt;. The authority also asked the border customs to increase the inspections against possible illegal import of poultry. 

♡❤"We continue to monitor the situation and are co-operating with other authorities as well as other European authorities"♡❤, said director of health and hygiene within the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Stein Ivar Ormsettrø.

Import of poultry has also been stopped from parts of &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and other countries.

&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia%2C%20Canada"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; – The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia%20Teachers%20Federation%20%28BCTF%29"&gt;BC Teachers' Federation&lt;/a&gt; (BCTF) and the government have both accepted mediator Vince Ready's recommendations. 

Premier Gordan Campbell announced in a news conference today that he will accept the plan unconditionally.

However, Jinny Sims (head of the BCTF) has said that she will only accept the proposal if the government provides firm class-size numbers and support for special-needs students.
"We need for our students a guarantee in writing that this government will make changes to the School Act to put firm class-size numbers" Sims also said, "And in the School Act, they will address class composition. And that means support for special needs kids".

Sims will recommend to her union to accept the proposal if these conditions are met.

Key points of the proposal to which both sides have agreed include:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Government spends $40 million to "harmonize" teachers salaries across BC
BULLET::::- Another $20 million is spent on top of current funding to reduce class-size and help special-need students. This brings that funding up to $120 million.
BULLET::::- The government consults with the BCTF about how class-size reduction should take place.
BULLET::::- The government puts $40 million (one-time) into the unions long-term disability fund.
BULLET::::- The government raises pay for substitute teachers to $120 a day.
</ul>
"I believe the recommendations provide a fair basis for resolution of the present dispute, especially in the context of the additional opportunities for the BCTF to address these and other issues in the next few months," Ready's report said.

If the union votes this weekend, classes could be in this Monday.

<h3>With a cost</h3>

Justice Brenda Brown of the British Columbia Supreme Court made an order today that the BCTF must pay $500,000 for being in contempt of court. She noted that the fine would have been "significantly larger", were it not for the fact that the two sides were working toward an agreement to quickly end the labour disruption. The amount was based on the union's membership numbers and assets ($15 million). 

Legal commentators noted that this is the largest penalty ever ordered by a Canadian court following a finding of contempt. A lawyer for the employer noted that he was satisfied with the size of the fine. Still, it's not over yet. The court has the right to order further penalties if the union and its members continue their illegal job action. As well, an independent prosecutor appointed by the Attorney General's office is reviewing the case to determine whether charges of criminal contempt are appropriate.

Bird Flu has been found in a parrot under quarantine which was being imported from &lt;a href="w%3ASurinam"&gt;Surinam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;. It has been confirmed as the lethal &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain found predominantly in Asia. It is speculated that the flu might have originated from Taiwanese birds which had previously been kept with the South American birds, as no other &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; cases have yet been reported in Surinam. This is the first case of avian flu found in birds destined to be imported to the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; since the recent outbreak affecting many parts of the world. The BBC has said that all birds in the quarantine unit are now being culled. People who may have come into contact with them will be given anti-viral treatment as a precaution.

Although the case was found in the UK it does not affect the UK's 'disease free' status because the bird was under quarantine.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20France"&gt;French government&lt;/a&gt; has protested officially to the US government for some border control that it deemed "a little excessive" with respect to a French minister travelling to the US on October 13 on a diplomatic passport and with a diplomatic visa.

French spokesman, Jean-Baptiste Mattei said; "We protested to the U.S. authorities and have received clarifications via the State Department, which recognized that a professional fault had been made by the officer. He has been reprimanded and will go through a retraining program." The spokesman declined to give details of the incident, but said the action of the officer had been "completely out of place with respect to a government minister."

The official, &lt;a href="w%3AAzouz%20Begag"&gt;Azouz Begag&lt;/a&gt;, was born in &lt;a href="w%3ALyon"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt;, France of &lt;a href="w%3AAlgeria"&gt;Algerian&lt;/a&gt; lineage. A researcher in socioeconomics at &lt;a href="w%3ACNRS"&gt;CNRS&lt;/a&gt;, and a writer, he is now delegate minister in charge of the promotion of equality. His functions include most notably the fight against &lt;a href="w%3Aracism"&gt;racism&lt;/a&gt;.

Neither governments provided specific details about the incident, at first. However, further details have emerged. According to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Monde"&gt;Le Monde&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Mr Begag was told by an officer that his diplomatic visa was not valid for giving conferences, then was taken to an interrogation room. Mr Begag was due to be met at the airport by American officials and French consular officers, but due to miscommunication they could not find him in the airport when he arrived.

It is not the first time that Mr Begag has had to confront suspicions of his identity. He mentioned an event in a French bank where, when entering with a woolen cap, he was taken for a thief and the police was called in. He also mentions the difficulties which, he says, people of Arabic origin have when entering the United States since the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20bombings"&gt;September 11, 2001 bombings&lt;/a&gt;. He has a personal experience of such difficulties in 2003, when, as a writer, he had problems entering the US.

During 19 and 20 October in &lt;a href="w%3ACz%C4%99stochowa"&gt;Częstochowa&lt;/a&gt; took place National Scientific Students Conference, which was mainly devoted to migration of young Polish people. It was prepared by two students organizations from Technical University of Częstochowa and Jan Długosz Academy. The leading theme was: To leave or to stay? Young Poles seeking for prospect year after Polish accession to &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;.

Particular parts of Conference was lead by sociology profesors Marek Szczepański, Adam Rosół and Lech Milian.

For the following two days students were presented their own research work, then discussing the reports with professors. The main problems which those reports concerns were opinion and attitudes of young Pols towards the problems of temporary and permanent emigration. Few voice concern about the unemployment rate among people under 25, an issue connected with job searching, as well as identity matters, acculturation of expatriates or the relevance of emotional sphere to adjustement to new host country.

Amid concerns of electoral fraud, preliminary results now indicate the province of Nineveh will be the "swing province" deciding the fate of Iraq's constitutional referendum. On October 15, a reported 64% of eligible Iraqis voted in the referendum on the draft Iraqi constitution. One week later, preliminary results are available for fourteen of the eighteen provinces. Two of Iraq's 18 provinces have returned "No" votes, making Nineveh the third and deciding province that could veto the new U.S.-backed charter if rejected by more than a two thirds majority of voters. 

Despite a last minute compromise achieved with one political party representing Sunni Arabs, Sunni voters appear to be rejecting the proposed charter by a wide margin. In Anbar, heartland of the insurgency, 96 percent voted "No" and in Salahaddin 81 percent voted "No", according to preliminary results. Nineveh is more ethnically mixed, but still mainly Sunni, and is at the center of fraud concerns when initial tallies of the overall vote appeared to swing wildly 

Election officials caution that these preliminary results should not be construed as forecasts, as the ethnic diversity of those who actually voted may not be represented in these preliminary numbers.

Newly published research shows that the &lt;a href="w%3AAmazon%20rainforest"&gt;Amazon rainforest&lt;/a&gt; is being destroyed at double the rate of all previous estimates. The research was published today in the journal of Science.

A new analysis of satellite images of the Brazilian part of the Amazon basin shows that on average 6,000 square miles of forest is being cut down by selective logging each year. This is in addition to a similar amount clear-cut annually for cattle grazing or farming. As a result, up to 25% more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere every year.

Former Irish politician &lt;a href="w%3ALiam%20Lawlor"&gt;Liam Lawlor&lt;/a&gt; died Saturday in a car crash outside &lt;a href="w%3AMoscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.

Lawlor was on a trip in the Russian capital and was making his way to the airport with his driver and a &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; interpreter. The woman, who sustained serious injuries, survived the crash. The driver of the automobile was also killed.

Lawlor resigned from poltics and his position as a &lt;a href="w%3ATeachta%20D%C3%A1la"&gt;Teachta Dála&lt;/a&gt; in the Irish house of &lt;a href="w%3Aparliament"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AD%C3%A1il%20%C3%89ireann"&gt;the Dáil&lt;/a&gt;) after he admitted receiving sums of money from the lobbyist Frank Dunlop. After &lt;a href="w%3AFianna%20F%C3%A1il"&gt;Fianna Fáil&lt;/a&gt; conducted its own internal investigation, Lawlor resigned from the Party, however he continued to support the government in the Dáil. Lawlor appeared at the Tribunal on several occasions and was imprisoned in &lt;a href="w%3AMountjoy%20Prison"&gt;Mountjoy Prison&lt;/a&gt; for non-compliance with the investigation.

Previous untrue allegations that the &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/a&gt; woman was a call girl have led to the Irish Independent newspaper issuing a formal apology to Mr Lawlor's Family. Reports that Lawlor was in possession of the drug PCP were likewise proved to be false.

<h1>Hundreds of SUNY New Paltz students demonstrate, storm administration building</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hundreds%20of%20SUNY%20New%20Paltz%20students%20demonstrate%2C%20storm%20administration%20building&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Paltz%2C%20New%20York"&gt;New Paltz, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — More than 350 U.S. students took part in a demonstration Friday outside the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20University%20of%20New%20York%20at%20New%20Paltz"&gt;SUNY New Paltz&lt;/a&gt; Student Union Building where student leaders used a &lt;a href="w%3AMegaphone"&gt;bullhorn&lt;/a&gt; from the rooftop to rally the gathering on the concourse below. University police dispersed student leaders from the roof which was followed by more than 100 students storming the Haggerty Administration Building (HAB).

During the 2004&amp;ndash;2005 academic year, students lobbied for a $10 million renovation project for their Student Union Building, which has not been renovated since its construction more than 30 years ago.

HAB spokesman Eric Gullickson said that the supplemental appropriation for the project is the largest in the history of the college and that the six-member advisory committee includes three students but that; "the Student Association, which was offered the first seat on this committee, declined the opportunity," Gullickson said.

Student leaders, including Student Body President R.J. Partington III and Student Senate ChairJustin Holmes, who played a role in organizing this demonstration, testified during the Spring 2005 semester before the New York State Assembly Committee on Higher Education, eventually winning the renovation project. Holmes says that Gullickson's assertions are; "an out-and-out lie. The SA was never offered such a seat. We were offered 1 seat on a seven seat committee, with the administration selecting the other six members."

The major arguments for a capital project on the Student Union Building were that it: 
<ul>
BULLET::::- did not accommodate organizations and organization office needs
BULLET::::- lacked crucial technology for student mobilization
BULLET::::- was built for a student population less than half the size of 2005, and
BULLET::::- was one of the longest standing Student Unions in the SUNY system which had not undergone a renovation

</ul>
During the Fall 2005 semester the HAB claimed that it would oversee the renovation project, citing the need for a larger lobby and bookstore.

The Kingston Daily Freeman reported:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The crystallizing issue for the demonstration was the upcoming $10 million renovation of the Student Union building. The renovation, scheduled to begin in about two years, will be the first major change to the building since it was built 34 years ago, according to college spokesman Eric Gullickson, who said the supplemental appropriation for the project in the state budget is the largest in the college's history.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gullickson also said that a six-member committee had been formed to guide the design process, but student leaders, including Partington, were told that the proposed committee would be seven members, including four non-students and two students who were appointed by the HAB.

"No matter the size and makeup of the HAB's so-called renovation committee, it has nothing to do with the actual renovation process, which will be administered by a student committee, with input from other parties of course considered," responded Holmes.

<h3>Failure of negotiations</h3>
During the Fall 2005 semester, Student Body President R.J. Partington III attempted to negotiate with Administrators, including HAB President Steven G. Poskanzer, over the project.

The HAB refused to concede to student demands.

At this point, the Student Senate passed legislation proclaiming that the project would be overseen by a committee where students constitute a majority, and Partington announced that he “did not recognize and would not sit on” any committee that did not meet the needs of students.

Vice President of Acacdemic Affairs &amp; Governance, Stephanie Adika said, "If the HAB won't even listen to us about our own building, how are they going to listen to us about all the other problems the students have with SUNY New Paltz."

<h2>The Demonstration</h2>
The event itself was organized by a loose coalition of elected student leaders, organization activists, and other students.
More than 350 students converged on the Student Union Building at about 3:10PM. Student leaders took to the roof to address the mass, including:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Student Body President R.J. Partington III
BULLET::::- Vice President of Finance Lee Riley
BULLET::::- Council of Organizations Chair Yoni Levin
BULLET::::- Student Senate Chair Justin Holmes
BULLET::::- Student Senator and President of New Paltz NORML / Students for Sensible Drug Policy Jenny Loeb

</ul>
<h3>Issues Addressed</h3>
Students had been frustrated by a number of issues, including the campus drug policy, the state of the Women’s Studies department, a Black Solidarity Event called “Black Solidarity Day,” which the HAB had not fully recognized, the police on campus, and the lack of competition in food service.

“The reason we will oversee the Student Union Building renovation is that we need a place whose primary purpose is to facilitate the organization and mobilization of students around the many issues we have with campus policies,” said Holmes.

"They try to keep us from going to that event," Lee Riley said of Black Solidarity Day, an annual event that Riley said some professors try to discourage students from attending by scheduling tests or mandatory labs on that day. "We're here to combat that. It's a day when we can promote unity. It's a day when we can promote pride."

<h2>The March</h2>
<h2>Storm of the HAB</h2>
At some point, some students spontaneously decided to enter the Haggerty Administration Building, and well over 100 students followed.

The Kingston Daily Freeman reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
About 100 students flooded into the Haggerty Administration Building toward the end of the demonstration, hoping to meet as a group with college President Steven Poskanzer. And when campus security blocked access to the building's elevators, the group climbed nine flights of stairs and filled the hall way outside of Poskanzer's office. They chanted and drummed on the wood-paneled walls until Student Association President R.J. Partington and Student Senate Chairman Justin Holmes were admitted to Poskanzer's outer office.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Partington and Holmes emerged to a very hot hallway, still filled with more than one hundred students. Most were covered in sweat, and there was concern about oxygen depravation as some students were beginning to feel faint. Several volunteers, including staff of the HAB, held stairwell doors open to allow fresh air in to the crowd.

Upon emerging, President Partington addressed the students, saying, "If Poskanzer does not meet with all of you here, then we are going to do this whole thing over again, except next time we will have twice as many people."

<h2>HAB Positions</h2>
The HAB office of Public Affairs responded to inquires by the Mid-Hudson News, saying,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But, college spokesman Eric Gullickson said the committee is in place only to provide advice to the administration. “It’s an advisory committee that the vice president of student affairs put together himself, seeing an opportunity to get students’ input, of which 50 percent of the people on the committee are students, seeking to get input from them on the planning and development of the Student Union Building,” he said. The committee has no voting power and will not be making any decisions, said Gullickson.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eric Gullickson was contacted by Wikinews for further comment relating to the demonstration and student concerns but declined the offer, saying, "I appreciate you offering us the opportunity to respond, however, we do not wish to contribute."

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
As students drifted off the concourse, organizers took the time to comment to local press and assess their performance.

<h2>SUNY Student Assembly Interest</h2>
Top officials of the Student Assembly took time to review the documentation of the event. 

"Traditionally one might expect that a protest the size of the one which took place last Friday would cause a number of safety concerns for those involved." Nathan Arrowsmith, the SUNY Student Assembly Director of Safety, remarked, "But thanks to excellent organization on the part of the students and a surprising lack of direct confrontation on the part of the police we were able to see an amazing display of student solidarity without serious incident."

"I think it was crucial that the SUNY Assembly was made aware of an event such as this," commented Ryan Arnold, President of the Student Association at SUNY Fredonia. "Our administration is great at working with the students, however there are many SUNY Colleges and Universities that do not know how to go about such a protest that is essential towards their success with the administration."

Arnold sits on many administrative committees at SUNY Fredonia, including a seat as the Student Affairs Chairman, an opportunity that many students do not have at other institutions. 

Holmes and Partington presented a slideshow, with videos, to the Assembly 

<h2>WikiPaltz</h2>
Student Leaders set up a Wiki to gather information about SUNY New Paltz and to mobilize the emerging protest movement.

WikiPaltz grew quickly in the months after it was set up in July, 2005, and includes extensive coverage of the events.

The shortage of the antiviral, &lt;a href="w%3ATamiflu"&gt;Tamiflu&lt;/a&gt;, has prompted &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; to begin work on copying the antiviral without the consent of its manufacturer and patent holder, the Swiss pharmaceutical company &lt;a href="w%3AHoffmann-La%20Roche"&gt;Hoffmann-La Roche&lt;/a&gt;. Though officials have requested permission from Roche, they are not waiting on a response to begin work, citing the need to protect the public. 

In an interview with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the Director of the Division Clinical Research of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Health%20Research%20Institutes%20%28Taiwan%29"&gt;National Health Research Institutes&lt;/a&gt; (NHRI), Su Ih-jen said “We have tried our best to negotiate with Roche …. we have shown our good will to Roche and we appreciate their patent. But to protect our people is the utmost important thing.”

NHRI will produce the generic version of the antiviral. Taiwan will not market the drug commercially, planning to manufacture one to two million doses, only enough to have adequate stock in country. Officials say they can manufacture the antiviral more quickly and at less cost than Roche. One million doses of locally made Tamiflu cost about T$200 million (US$5.9 million), compared with T$1 billion if purchased from Roche. It will take approximately 3 months to manufacture one million doses.

Several other countries have also petitioned Roche for the right to make copies of Tamiflu.
