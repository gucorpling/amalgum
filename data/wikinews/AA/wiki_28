♡❤♡An updated version of this story including results and projected results is available as &lt;a href="2006%20U.S.%20Congressional%20Elections"&gt;2006 U.S. Congressional Elections&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡

With the polls now open throughout most of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; (US), voters are reporting long lines as US citizens line up to vote in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20general%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;2006 United States general elections&lt;/a&gt;, frequently referred to informally in the US as the "2006 midterm election". Predictions of an unusually high level of voter turnout seem to be coming to fruition as voters throughout the country report longer than expected lines. One voter from Kansas City, Missouri reported a 90-minute wait, while voters in southwest Michigan reported that they had to park several blocks from the polls because of the crowds. Typically, fewer than 40% of registered voters go to the polls during non-presidential election years. The highest midterm voter turnout on record occurred in 1970, when 47% of registered voters went to the polls.
<h3>Electronic voting gets mixed reviews</h3>
A third of the states are using electronic voting systems for the first time. Although it was predicted that the electronic systems would be more efficient, reports are mixed about their effectiveness. Air America Radio reports that electronic voting machines in Delaware County, Indiana and Cleveland, Ohio have malfunctioned, frustrating voters and election workers. A report published on the USA Today website said election workers in some parts of Florida had resorted to using paper ballots when their electronic voting machines failed to work. National Public Radio reported that some electronic voting machines in Texas had to be turned off when they improperly gave votes to candidates not selected by voters. Problems were also reported in Maine, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.

A voting problem of a different type was reported in Kentucky, where a Louisville poll worker is alleged to have physically assaulted a voter. Jefferson County clerk spokesperson Paula McCraney said that the voter wanted to press charges after being allegedly choked and pushed by the election worker. No information was available on what led to the incident.

<h3>Congressional control at stake</h3>

All seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the seats in the Senate are up for election. Polls on the eve of the election indicated that the Democrats were likely to take control of the House, with several estimates giving the party a gain of about 30 seats. In the Senate, where the Democrats need six seats to gain a majority, the outcome is less certain. At least five races are considered too close to call.

<h3>"Six year itch"</h3>
Many political pundits expect Democratic gains during this election. Control of Congress has frequently changed hands during midterm elections held during a president's second term. This trend coincides with recent polls that show Americans becoming further disillusioned with Republican control in the wake of growing discontentment about the &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; and a wave of scandals ranging from the &lt;a href="Jack%20Abramoff"&gt;Jack Abramoff&lt;/a&gt; corruption scandal to revelations about sexual improprieties involving Republican Congressman Mark Foley and White House confidant Ted Haggard. Many conservative evangelical Christians, the GOP's most reliable voting block, have become disappointed by the scandals and may not vote in great numbers. Pat Buchanan, whose campaigns have often appealed to that voting block, told ABC News, "There's the spending orgy, the arrogance of power . . . . The war in Iraq, failure to protect our border, hurting the working class in Ohio, for example, the list goes on and on. We're more dissatisfied with the Republican Party than we've ever been."

<h3>Campaigns turn nasty</h3>
Political advertisements turned nasty in the closing days of the campaign, with candidates from both parties turning up the heat on their opponents. MSNBC reported that the FBI was investigating calls made to voters in Virginia in an apparent attempt to intimidate and confuse voters. This follows a similar investigation in California, where staff in Republican Congressional candidate Tan D. Nguyen's campaign office sent letters to Latino voters telling them that "You are advised that if your residence in this country is illegal or you are an immigrant, voting in a federal election is a crime that could result in jail time." (Naturalized citizens are allowed to vote in elections.) 

Candidates in both New York and Michigan reported that automated telephone calls had been made to voters in the dead of night, purporting to be from their campaigns. The candidates said their campaigns had nothing to do with the calls, and had been made fraudulently in an attempt to make voters angry at them. 

It was unclear whether these calls were related to other calls, financed by the National Republican Congressional Committee, that had been made to voters in several states in the previous week. Those calls had generated complaints by voters from both parties who said they were repeated several times in the same day. In at least one state, the calls were pulled when the attorney general notified the NRCC that the calls violated state law.

A different kind of "robocall" was reported in Iowa, where three Democratic candidates for the state House reported that they had been the target of anonymous attack ad calls. The calls inaccurately claimed that the candidates support free health care and college tuition for illegal aliens.

In Nevada, Republican Gubernatorial Candidate Jim Gibbons referred to his opponent, Dina Titus, as "Dina Taxes".

The negative campaigning even worked its way into local, non-partisan races. In Genesee County, Michigan registered voters received automated telephone calls accusing a candidate for probate judge of arson and fraud.

Polling places opened at 13:00 UTC (8:00 AM &lt;a href="w%3AEST"&gt;EST&lt;/a&gt;) this morning in &lt;a href="w%3APalm%20Beach%20County%2C%20Florida"&gt;Palm Beach County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20midterm%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;United States midterm elections&lt;/a&gt;. Early voters wreaked havoc on the city streets, causing backups near polling locations and interrupting traffic flows to area elementary and senior high schools.

Due to the increase in traffic, some area school administrations asked teachers to accept late students without reprimand.

Florida will elect a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Federal senator&lt;/a&gt;, all of its &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congressional%20Delegations%20from%20Florida"&gt;House membership&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20of%20Florida"&gt;Governor&lt;/a&gt;, various other officers and vote on various questions.

A survey, conducted by the &lt;a href="w%3APatients%27%20Association"&gt;Patients' Association&lt;/a&gt;, an independent charity devoted to defending the interests of patients, has revealed "unease and concern among health professionals" that infection control practices in the United Kingdom's &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Health%20Service"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt; are "endangering patients' lives". The survey published today, revealed that NHS infection control staff felt that infection control was inadequately financed, that training was inadequate and that much time has to be spent reassuring patients. 

The Association is concerned that the financial deficits of many NHS trusts may prejudice good infection control practice because the resources allocated for this are not effectively ring-fenced. There was evidence of inadequate training and execution of good practice. The report also listed shortcomings in way supplies were acquired and delays in getting supplies of the preferred disinfectant: 2% &lt;a href="w%3AChlorhexidine%20gluconate"&gt;Chlorhexidine&lt;/a&gt;-based solution.

BBC reported that a recent paper to a Society for General Microbiology conference by a University of Leeds team has shown that two chemical cleaners commonly used in hospitals, far from reducing the prevalence of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AClostridium%20difficile"&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (♡❤C. difficile♡❤) bacterium, actually increased its ability to survive. Only cleaners containing bleach had been proved effective in disposing of this bacterium. Authors of the paper refused to disclose what those two cleaners were. 

There is particular concern in the Patients' Association about the absence of adequate data on the spread of ♡❤C. difficile♡❤. The ♡❤Telegraph♡❤ quotes Katharine Murphy, of the Patients' Association, as saying: "Collection of data about this very dangerous infection is haphazard to say the least, and we are not getting the true picture. How can patients have confidence in their hospitals if the real threat posed by ♡❤C. difficile♡❤ is being played down?" 

The Report found that only a fifth of respondents confirmed the collection of surgical-site infection data and that only 27% reported infection data about ♡❤C. difficile♡❤; despite the requirement that Trusts collect and report these data. 

Trusts are also required to report the incidence of surgical-site infection, but the Patients' Association survey found that only a fifth of respondents confirmed the collection of these data.

The Patients Association called this a "worrying and haphazard situation". 

The ♡❤Telegraph♡❤ reports that experts consider that ♡❤C. difficile♡❤ is an even greater threat to patient's health than &lt;a href="w%3AMRSA"&gt;MRSA&lt;/a&gt;.

Leicester NHS Trust has reported 49 deaths associated with ♡❤C. difficile♡❤. in three of its hospitals. Six deaths have been reported at Maidstone Hospital and the Healthcare Commission has been asked to investigate. ♡❤C. difficile♡❤ was associated with the deaths of nearly 1000 patient in 2003.

A new Code of Practice "for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections" was issued by the Department of Health in October 2006 under the Health Act 2006. This refers to the NHS in England and Wales only.

The two were married on October 6, 2004, according to the petition, a date that &lt;a href="w%3AE%21%20Online"&gt;E! Online&lt;/a&gt; noted was in conflict with a photo spread in &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20%28magazine%29"&gt;♡❤People♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which gave their wedding date as September 18, 2004. The couple currently have two sons, the first named Sean Preston, 1, and a recent baby boy named Jayden James Federline who was born on September 12, 2006. Spears is attempting to gain both full legal and physical custody of both of the children with Federline having visitation rights. 

It is also reported that Spears did not accept spousal support and waived her right to receive any, also asking that the legal fees incurred during the divorce be separated.

Neither Spears nor Federline has yet released a statement.

When the host was calling up the &lt;a href="w%3ACountry%20Music%20Association%20Awards"&gt;Country Music Award&lt;/a&gt; Female Vocalist Of The Year award, &lt;a href="w%3AFaith%20Hill"&gt;Faith Hill&lt;/a&gt; stood up and was in shock after hearing &lt;a href="w%3ACarrie%20Underwood"&gt;Carrie Underwood's&lt;/a&gt; name. "What?!," said Faith Hill directly into the camera as her smile turned into a look of shock.

"The idea that I would act disrespectful towards a fellow musician is unimaginable to me," Hill said in a statement. "For this to become a focus of attention given the talent gathered is utterly ridiculous. Carrie is a talented and deserving female vocalist of the year."

Underwood, 2005 former &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Idol"&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt; winner, did not take it seriously, according to her publicist, Jessie Schmidt.

"She was just messing around," said spokesman Paul Freundlich. "She didn't realize that the camera was rolling the whole time. ... She just thought they were doing a shot when they read the nominees off."

Gary Borman, Hill's manager, said that it was just "a joke". 

Faith Hill had won the Female Vocalist Of The Year award in 2000.

&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Trade%20Organization"&gt;World Trade Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WTO) has officially invited &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; to become a member of their organization. Vietnam is the 150 nation to join the WTO.

Now that the country has joined the WTO, Vietnam will have more access to overseas markets, but will be forced to cut high import tariffs, thus reducing the budget by as much as 21%.

Vietnam has proclaimed its intention to leave the ranks of the world's poorest countries by 2010, and will become a WTO member 30 days after official approval from its National Assembly.

Joining the WTO will force a reduction in import duties, within five to seven years, from their current average rate of 17.6% to 13.8%. It will also eliminate any import quotas WTO countries have against Vietnamese textiles, rice and coffee. Vietnam's banks, insurers and telecommunications companies, however, will have to face competition from foreign interests, and restrictions on foreign ownership of Vietnamese firms will be eliminated.

"Foreign competition is bitter medicine for Vietnamese enterprises, but it will help them become stronger," said Le Dang Doanh, an economist at the ministry of planning and investment.

<h3>House of Representatives</h3>
The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;United States Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; is projected to win control of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3Alower%20house"&gt;lower house&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;United States Congress&lt;/a&gt;, the federal &lt;a href="w%3Alegislature"&gt;legislature&lt;/a&gt;. The Republican leadership has conceded defeat.

<h3>Senate</h3>
In the races for the 33 open seats of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Aupper%20house"&gt;upper house&lt;/a&gt;, the Democrats are projected to win five of the six seats they need to gain a majority. Several races are too close to call.

The key race in &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, upon which the outcome of majority control of the Senate may rest, Republican incumbent &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Allen%20%28U.S.%20politician%29"&gt;George Allen&lt;/a&gt; was asked to concede on Wednesday by Senator and chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Schumer"&gt;Charles Schumer&lt;/a&gt;. Allen's opponent, Democratic challenger &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Webb"&gt;Jim Webb&lt;/a&gt; garnered an unofficial win by the slim margin of 7,000 votes in over 2 million cast.

By state law, the Virginia State Board of Elections will perform a vote recount when election results are within one percentage point difference between candidates. The time table for the election to be certified November 27. The losing candidate has 10 days from the certification to appeal.

A suicide bomber killed at least 42 Pakistani soldiers at an army training centre today in the North West Frontier Province, according to Pakistani government soldiers.

The attack took place in the town of Dargai, 100 km north of Peshawar at 8:40 a.m. local time (0310 UTC) today.

20 people were injured in the attack. Some of them are in a critical condition. The injured were admitted to hospitals in Mardan and Peshawar.

Aftab Ahmed Sherpao, Pakistani Federal Minister of Interior, said that the attack was carried out by a man who got down from a car wearing a chaddor [cloak] and walked into the parade. He added, "After the Bajaur incident this was expected, but we will continue the fight against terror. We condemn it, innocent lives were lost."

Pakistani president &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;General Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt; condemned the suicide attack and directed the interior ministry to track down the culprits involved in the attack.

No group has claimed for the responsibility of the attack yet.

The UK Stem Cell Foundation (UKSCF) has made its first grant to support a unique project that promises hope for thousands of &lt;a href="w%3AMyocardial%20infarction"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; patients. The new procedure involves injecting the patient's heart with his own &lt;a href="w%3Abone%20marrow"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Astem%20cells"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; in the expectation that they will help repair the damaged heart and prolong the patient's active life. 

Two advantages claimed for this procedure are the overcoming of the &lt;a href="w%3AEthics"&gt;ethical issues&lt;/a&gt; related to the use of &lt;a href="w%3AEmbryonic%20stem%20cell"&gt;embryonic stem cells&lt;/a&gt; and the reduction of the probability of &lt;a href="w%3ATransplant%20rejection"&gt;tissue rejection&lt;/a&gt;.

The procedure will be carried out immediately after primary &lt;a href="w%3Aangioplasty"&gt;angioplasty&lt;/a&gt;, the opening up of blocked arteries, normally performed within the vital few hours after the heart attack. 

The new procedure was designed by Dr Anthony Mathur, Senior Lecturer and Consultant Cardiologist, and Professor John Martin, British Heart Foundation Chair in Cardiovascular Sciences. The trial will involve about 100 patients and will be conducted at &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Bartholomew%27s%20Hospital"&gt;St Bartholomew's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.

Professor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Heart%20Foundation"&gt;British Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt; welcomed research into the role stem cells may play in treating heart conditions and saw it as complementing the Foundation's own research programme.

Some 600,000 patients survive heart attacks each year and the cost to the country may be as much as £7 billion taking into account not only hospitalisation and medical costs, but also the costs of lost working time. The bone marrow cell transplant is expected to improve the functionality of the damaged heart and increase greatly the capability of patients. It could have a significant economic effects also.

Nigel Hawkes in the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;♡❤Times♡❤&lt;/a&gt; today argues that it may be unwise to proceed when so little is understood about stem cells. Maybe it would be better to hold back until the science is better developed. He describes the procedure as coming from the "quick and dirty" school of medical research which has produced great benefits before the science has caught up. On the other hand he quotes Roger Pedersen, of the University of Cambridge as saying that we know little about what triggers cells to differentiate, and that "simple alchemy" will not work: "We're going to have to do some science." The feasibility and safety of the procedure has been tested in smaller studies, and the few reports available show a trend towards positive effects, but large &lt;a href="w%3AClinical%20trial"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are still missing.

The Associated Press is reporting that U.S. Secretary of Defense &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; is about to resign. President George W. Bush announced that he will nominate &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt;, former head of the CIA, as a replacement for Rumsfeld, speaking at a White House press conference at 1 p.m. today.

Rumsfeld is the second longest serving defense secretary, serving in the post from 1975 to 1977 under President Ford and under President Bush from the beginning of 2001.

"It'll be a different Congress, a different environment, moving toward a presidential election, and a lot of partisanship and it struck me that this would be a good thing for everybody", Rumsfeld told Pentagon reporters.

This is one week after President Bush told the American People that Rumsfeld was doing a fantastic job and that he wanted the secretary to stay in his job to the end of his presidency.

&lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart%20Canada"&gt;Wal-Mart Canada's&lt;/a&gt; first three supercenters opened in &lt;a href="w%3AAncaster%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Ancaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20Ontario"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStouffville%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Stouffville, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

The idea originally started in the United States in late 2005 and was announced that it would be arriving in Canada.

Flat screen TVs suspended from the ceiling will feature a television network, featuring fashion shows of Wal-Mart's clothing lines, TV commercials featuring brands the retailer carries, and corporate messages.
With an expanded selection of electronics, hardware, home and housewares, the Wal-Mart supercentre could be compared to &lt;a href="w%3AFuture%20Shop"&gt;Future Shop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Depot"&gt;Home Depot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Outfitters"&gt;Home Outfitters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AShoppers%20Drug%20Mart"&gt;Shoppers Drug Mart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AFortinos"&gt;Fortinos&lt;/a&gt;. The supercentre has wider aisles, higher ceilings, clear signage, and cash registers in selected departments such as electronics and clothing.

"Our goal is to become the one-stop shop for customers," said Mario Pilozzi, chief executive of Wal-Mart Canada. "You see how fresh that is today? We are going to maintain that freshness in these stores."

Wal-Mart's Canadian supercentres are more sophisticated then their U.S. counterparts, because Canadian grocers have created higher expectations among the average consumer, company officials say.

However, Wal-Mart openings are controversial in many communities. Activists claim they can be detrimental to local economies, driving out locally owned businesses, lowering wages, and leading to suburban sprawl.

Wal-Mart already has plans to open fourteen new supercentres in 2007, of them Scarborough, Sarnia, Brampton and Vaughan will be early in the year.

A rare, but normal, astronomical event occurred today as the planet &lt;a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt; passed in front of the Sun from the perspective of the Earth. The event, called a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAstronomical%20transit"&gt;transit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was at least partially visible from most of the planet, except from Europe when the transit happened during local nighttime.

Visible as a perfectly round dot only 1/195th the diameter of the Sun, Mercury took about an hour and a half to move across the southern limb of the Sun, starting at 7:12PM UTC and ending at 9:41PM UTC.

From the point of view of the Earth, transits of this type can only occur with the two innermost planets - Mercury and Venus. Due to the orbital inclination of Mercury - 7° relative to the Earth - transits do not happen every time Mercury passes the Earth every 116 days. Only once every 23 times does a transit happen. The last time Mercury transited the Sun was May 7, 2003. The next transit will occur on May 9, 2016.

Such rare events have fascinated astronomers since the invention of the telescope first allowed them to view them. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACaptain%20Cook"&gt;Captain Cook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , for example, found Australia's east coast while on a voyage to track the transit of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVenus"&gt;Venus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1769. Recording these transits allowed astronomers to make the first accurate calculations of the distance between the Sun and the Earth.

While not scientifically used for this purpose anymore, transits provide a glimpse into one way astronomers can currently search for extra-solar planets. Astronomers using this method of searching will monitor other stars to see if the star dims ever so slightly as an extra-solar planet passes between the star it is orbiting and the Earth. Being able to detect such a small, temporary drop in brightness may indicate the presence of such a planet.

Viewing solar transits are fascinating, but only if done safely. People must never look directly at the Sun at any time! The safest way of viewing a transit is to project the image of the Sun as seen through a telescope onto a screen. It may also be viewed with properly made and placed solar filters.

The House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs published its Eighth Report today. This criticizes the way in which the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) protects information. The FCO has the presumption that information should be regarded secret unless there are good reasons for disclosure. The Committee regarded this management practice as a "relic of a bygone age, when secrecy was endemic in public life".

These days, in the Committee's view, attitudes to information are quite different and the presumption is that information should be available to the public unless there are "very strong and valid reasons not to disclose it". 

The Committee gave an example. Extracts from the farewell e-gram from William Patey, the Ambassador to Baghdad, appeared in the press. The Committee had asked for, but had been refused, a copy of the message. Within days, the press reported that outgoing Heads of Mission were forbidden to send such messages.

The Committee noted that all the FCO Board papers it has asked for had been provided.

A new study by &lt;a href="w%3AStatistics%20Canada"&gt;Statistics Canada&lt;/a&gt; shows that 38 per cent of Canadians enjoy their daily commute to work. One in six workers, about 16 per cent even said that they liked commuting a lot and 30 per cent do not.

The average commute for people from &lt;a href="w%3ABurlington%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Burlington&lt;/a&gt; to Toronto takes about 45 minutes. 

The shorter the distance to work, the more enjoyable the commute is. Most commuters who travel to work by bike enjoy the trip the most. "People taking public transit get the least amount of enjoyment out of the commute, which could be because their trips are often longer," said Martin Turcotte, the author of the study. "&lt;a href="w%3ABaby%20boomer"&gt;Baby boomers&lt;/a&gt; like commuting more than younger people," he said.

"The time alone is therapeutic," said a 33-year-old, who has been commuting for seven years. "I am alone in my car and I can control all the elements. I can have it hot or cold, have the music on or off and I can choose to take phone calls or not."

"It's also an opportunity to exercise that I otherwise wouldn't have," said Chris Heysel, who cycles 21 kilometres from &lt;a href="w%3AStoney%20Creek%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Stoney Creek&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AMcMaster%20University"&gt;McMaster University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;.

More workers said that they disliked chores like cleaning the house and grocery shopping more than they did commuting to work.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%2C%20United%20States"&gt;Virginia, United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — A ballot referendum to amend the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Bill%20of%20Rights"&gt;Virginia Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt; that denies to same-sex and unmarried couples any legal status that approximates that granted to married couples was approved by state voters during the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AMidterm%20election"&gt;midterm election&lt;/a&gt; by a 57% to 43% margin.

The &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; result, along with voters from seven other U.S. states who decided on similar constitutional amendments, brings the total to &lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;27 states&lt;/a&gt; that now constitutionally ban the recognition of same-sex unions at the state level. &lt;a href="w%3AArizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; voters failed to pass a similar ballot initiative this election cycle, making it the first and only U.S. state to reject a constitutional ban.

Both the governor of Virginia, &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Kaine"&gt;Tim Kaine&lt;/a&gt;, and Senator-elect, &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Webb"&gt;Jim Webb&lt;/a&gt;, publically opposed the amendment before the vote. Governor Kaine said the broad language against the recognition of the "legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals” within the referendum might have negative consequences on the state's business climate. Further, that "it would invite protracted court challenges in areas including contracts, custody cases and end-of-life decisions."

The Attorney General of Virginia, &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20McDonnell"&gt;Robert F. McDonell&lt;/a&gt; argued that the rights of unmarried individuals are still protected, because such legal protections flow from &lt;a href="w%3ACommon-law"&gt;common law&lt;/a&gt;, not solely from marriage.

However, the Bill of Rights is the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.constitution.org/bor/vir_bor.htm%7C"&gt;basis and foundation of government&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, as discussed by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite%3Fpagename%3DRTD%252FMGArticle%252FRTD_BasicArticle%26amp%3B%2509s%3D1045855935007%26amp%3Bc%3DMGArticle%26amp%3Bcid%3D1149190400903%26amp%3Bpath%3D%2521editorials%2521oped%7CJudge"&gt;Raymond A. Warren&lt;/a&gt;, any portion of common law that is determined by the seven-member Virginia Supreme Court to be in conflict with the amendment would no longer provide any such protection within Virginia.

The amendment establishes a section that explicitly prevents the government from recognizing the legal status of any relationships outside of heterosexual marriage. Though paragraph one of the amendment specifically bans same-sex marriage, paragraph two prevents the government from recognizing the legal status of any relationship of unmarried individuals that would in anyway approximate marriage.

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; That only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this Commonwealth and its political subdivisions.
This Commonwealth and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage. Nor shall this Commonwealth or its political subdivisions create or recognize another union, partnership, or other legal status to which is assigned the rights, benefits, obligations, qualities, or effects of marriage.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – Section 15-A. "Marriage" which was amended to the Virginia Bill of Rights&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Judge Warren argues that one of the greatest dangers of this amendment is that “no body knows what the sentence means”. The Judge’s position is reinforced by the views of an eminent Professor of Law within Virginia, who is a recognized expert on the social issues surrounding marriage. The professor described the amendment as “murky”. 

Judge Warren argues that this modification affectively transfers broad power to the 7-member Supreme Court to interpret how this amendment affects the existing laws, benefits and rights that unwed partners currently enjoy. This would be in contrast to instead creating public policies, which could be adjusted through democratic processes as social understandings of the underlying issues evolve.

The Judge’s argument, which is consistent with &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Kaine"&gt;Tim Kaine’s&lt;/a&gt; and Senator-elect &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Webb"&gt;Jim Webb’s&lt;/a&gt; position, is that there will be significant costs to the society and many years of uncertainty, as these issues are worked-out in the courts. 

For instance, the domestic partner benefits that are offered by many companies operating in Virginia are a concern. Since corporate policies must be consistent with Virginia law, these domestic partner benefits are at risk. This uncertainty may then discourage both the talent and the employers who need to attract that talent from doing business in the state. 

Making “murky” modifications to the very foundation of government, which in-turn underlies the most complex social system in history, argues for prudence and pause.

<h2>Potential for unintended impacts on current law</h2>
All of Virginia’s current laws were formed on the foundation that they needed to secure the rights identified in the Bill of Rights. However, that foundation has now fundamentally changed. The state is now forbidden from recognizing a broad set of previously recognized rights associated with unwed relationships. So many existing laws may now be unconstitutional, or will no longer safeguard same-sex or unwed couples and their families.

For example, in 2004 Ohio passed a similar amendment with practically identical language. They also had a 27-year-old domestic-violence law that was applied to all domestic partners. But on May 30, 2006, Ohio’s Third Appellant Court ruled that that law was now unconstitutional due to Ohio’s 2004 “Defense of Marriage” amendment. Though Ohio’s Supreme Court must still hear this case, it does demonstrate how the amendment threatens the stability of existing laws concerning unwed relationships. An excerpt from the ruling follows:
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; In doing so [finding Ohio's domestic violence law unconstitutional], we noted that it was unlikely that this was an intended result of the Defense of Marriage Amendment. However, we felt constrained to apply the amended provision of the Ohio Constitution as written, and held that the relationship established in the statute for cohabitants intended to “approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effect of marriage” in violation of the Amendment.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – May 30, 2006, State v. Shaffer, 2006-Ohio-2662&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

<h2>Stabilizing the marriage tradition</h2>

The institution of marriage, as a union between one man and one woman has been a dominant tradition within our society for at least 2 thousand years. The existence of a fundamental tradition that is rooted with the procreation of the human species argues for a conservative and measured approach when faced with absorbing the changes demanded by an evolving society. (Buckley and Ribstein)

Since the recognition of same-sex marriage represents a significant departure from these traditions, Virginia law has prohibited same sex marriage for over 30 years. Judge Warren argues that it would have been unlikely that Virginia's rather conservative judges would have changed the definition of marriage, even without the amendment.

However, supporters of the amendment are also concerned that the recognition of new standard form relationships, such as same-sex unions could have unintended consequences.

For example, a writer of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Weekly%20Standard"&gt;The Weekly Standard&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Stanley Kurtz, a fellow at the Hudson Institute, blames same-sex marriage in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; for an increase in parental cohabitation contracts. He asserts that same-sex marriage has detached &lt;a href="w%3Aprocreation"&gt;procreation&lt;/a&gt; from marriage in the Dutch mind and would likely do the same in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

However, in the 1999 case of , the Vermont court rejected as illogical and lacking empirical support, the argument that giving the same benefits to same sex and heterosexual couples would have unpredictable effects on the institution of marriage(Buckley and Ribstein). However, it stopped short of requiring the recognition of same sex marriage. The court noted that arguments about destabilization of the institution of marriage are “not altogether irrelevant. A sudden change in the marriage laws or the statutory benefits traditionally incidental to marriage may have disruptive and unforeseen consequences.”

<h2>Security of Individual Rights</h2>
The 1776 &lt;a href="http%3A//www.constitution.org/bor/vir_bor.htm%7CVirginia"&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt; was the first document in the Americas to declare protection of Individual Rights to all people, to define these rights as forming the foundation of the government and to recognize Individual Rights as being superior to all other Laws instituted by the government. 

&lt;a href="w%3ARights"&gt;Rights&lt;/a&gt; differ fundamentally from other instituted laws. Individual Rights are an inherent power or liberty, not awarded by human power, to which one is justly entitled and which cannot be legally deprived or restricted by government. Laws, on the other hand, are the obligations and restrictions instituted by governments that are needed to secure those rights. Since rights are considered superior to laws, the judicial branch should necessarily strike down the passage of any law that violates any of these rights. 

The state Supreme Courts of Massachusetts in 2003 and of New Jersey last month, have ruled that anti-same-sex marriage laws were unconstitutional because they found that the state had to give the same rights to gay couples as they did to heterosexual couples.

To avoid this outcome, proponents of preserving only heterosexual marriage as an acceptable partnership, have chosen to amend marriage laws, which carried the risk of being found unconstitutional, into the Bill of Rights.

The following sections of the &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Bill%20of%20Rights"&gt;Virginia Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt; may be in conflict with the “Marriage” amendment:
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; ♡❤♡Section 1♡❤♡ That all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – Sections 1 of the &lt;a href="http%3A//legis.state.va.us/Laws/search/Constitution.htm%231S15"&gt;Virginia Bill of Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The Bill of Rights is also a vehicle whereby Virginia decided what is a right. 

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; That all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people, that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and at all times amenable to them.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – Article 1, Section 2. Constitution of Virginia&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The evangelical Christian summer camp "Kids on Fire " featured in the documentary ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJesus%20Camp"&gt;Jesus Camp&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ will shut down for several years due to negative reactions to the film, negative e-mails, phone calls and letters. Many accuse camp leader &lt;a href="w%3ABecky%20Fischer"&gt;Becky Fischer&lt;/a&gt; of "brainwashing" the children.

The documentary showed camp leader Becky Fischer acting as a "drill instructor" for young children preparing themselves for spiritual and political warfare. Fischer makes explicit comparisons between her camp and Islamist 'jihad training camps'. It also shows children praying before a photograph of President Bush.

The film included scenes with disgraced preacher &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Haggard"&gt;Ted Haggard&lt;/a&gt;, who resigned his leadership of the National Association of Evangelicals after he was accused of having sex with a male prostitute and using methamphetamine. 

Haggard has criticized the film as mocking the evangelical movement and for using his statement that "If the Evangelicals vote, they determine the election." The film makers responded that "Pastor Haggard is the only person in Jesus Camp who has a problem with how he was portrayed" and stated that they had been careful to avoid his more inflammatory and divisive comments.

A 73-year old retired pastor, Reverend Roland Weisselberg, burned himself alive during &lt;a href="w%3AReformation%20Day"&gt;Reformation Day&lt;/a&gt; services on Tuesday]in &lt;a href="w%3AErfurt"&gt;Erfurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href="w%3Aself-immolation"&gt;self-immolation&lt;/a&gt; was apparently in protest against the spread of &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, which he felt the &lt;a href="w%3AProtestant"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; church should take more seriously.

His last words were "Jesus and Oskar,", believed to a reference to &lt;a href="w%3AOskar%20Bruesewitz"&gt;Oskar Bruesewitz&lt;/a&gt;, a priest who burned himself alive to protest the Communist government of East Germany. He was transported to a burns unit in &lt;a href="w%3AHalle"&gt;Halle&lt;/a&gt; but died en route.

Rev. Weisselberg had lived under &lt;a href="w%3ACommunism"&gt;Communism&lt;/a&gt; in East Germany, and had been a publisher in his former vocation. 

Axel Noack, &lt;a href="w%3ABishop"&gt;Bishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASaxony"&gt;Saxony&lt;/a&gt;, said that he was shocked at Rev. Weisselberg's self-immolation, stressing that &lt;a href="w%3AChristians"&gt;Christians&lt;/a&gt; could not accept a "clash of cultures". He confessed that the issue of Islam had been sidelined within the &lt;a href="w%3AChurch"&gt;Church&lt;/a&gt; and was only spoken about in private. There were few &lt;a href="w%3AMuslims"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; there with whom they could engage in dialogue, Noack said.

&lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Corporation announced on Wednesday it has finished all work on its long-delayed &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Vista"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt; (OS) and plans to release it to consumers January 30 2007.

The announcement means &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; is on track to meet its revised release schedule.

Jim Allchin, co-president of the Microsoft division that includes Windows, said that Windows Vista's code was released to begin manufacturing copies early on Wednesday.

"This is a good day," Allchin declared. 

Microsoft previously announced that it would release Windows Vista to large business clients at an event at the &lt;a href="w%3ANASDAQ"&gt;NASDAQ Stock Market&lt;/a&gt; on November 30 2006, and make it available to consumers sometime in January 2007.

The release will be the first major upgrade in more than five years to the OS of the company that powers most of the world's PCs. Vista claims to have improved graphics, more effective tools for finding documents, pictures and other items on PCs, and a new Internet browser.

Vista's release has been victim to a series of delays, the most recent delay was blamed in part on efforts to improve security of the OS. 

In its quest to get Vista up and running, Microsoft also has had to scrap some of its original goals, including getting rid of a more sophisticated method for sorting and organizing information. Analysts have said that scaling back the system could hurt the company if people don't see enough of a reason to upgrade.

The most recent delays also forced Microsoft to miss the holiday season, possibly dealing a blow to computer makers and retailers who would have been hoping for the new OS to boost holiday gift sales.

Microsoft and other computer manufacturers are offering holiday shoppers coupons good for a free or discounted Vista upgrade.

It's not clear how quickly big businesses will start using Vista. It can often take months if not years for companies to test a new operating system and make sure it will work well with the other programs they rely on.

Allchin said Microsoft is providing tools that allow companies to test for compatibility problems more quickly than with past Windows releases. He also said he hopes the security improvements would drive companies to upgrade faster.

Microsoft estimates that the new OS could set off a hike of 10% or more in Windows software sales in the financial year to June 30, with most of the increase coming in the second half of the year.

Microsoft shares rose 3 cents (from US$ 28.95) to close at US$28.98 Wednesday on the NASDAQ.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A60%20Minutes"&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ correspondent &lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Bradley"&gt;Ed Bradley&lt;/a&gt; has died today at &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Sinai%20Hospital%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in New York at the age of 65 after a struggle with leukemia.

"It's an incredibly sad day for everyone at CBS News. Ed was a phenomenal reporter and a great man," Senior Broadcast Producer Bill Owens told CBSNews. "Never have the words, 'he will be missed' meant more."

Born and raised in &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, Bradley was diagnosed with leukemia two years ago. Bradley's condition worsened two weeks ago and he contracted pneumonia and succumbed to the disease.

Sen. George Allen (R-VA) today conceded the senatorial race to Democrat James Webb, confirming that there would be a Democratic majority in the Senate and the House for the first time in over a decade.

With this win, the Democrats have now gained more seats in Congress than the Republicans did in the 1994 'Republican Revolution' that first brought Conservatives to control of the House and the Senate.

Webb won the Virginia seat by 7200 votes out of 2.37 million, as reported by the Washington Post. When Allen did not request a recount, that ensured a Democratic majority in the Senate.

Rumor said that Allen had hoped to use his Senate seat as a springboard to a run for the Presidency; and more rumors suggested that if Vice President Dick Cheney were forced to resign ("due to ill health") following investigations of laws broken by Bush and Cheney, that Allen had hoped to be appointed in Cheney's stead. With the loss of the Senate seat, Allen's visions of a Presidential run have become impossible.

Webb, who was a decorated Vietnam veteran and an early opponent of the war in Iraq, is quoted (by atrios at http://atrios.blogspot.com/) as saying that he was particularly concerned with issues of economic fairness and social justice:

"[It was reported] that I came to the Democratic party purely on issues regarding the Iraq war. Nothing could be further from the truth.

I think I and a lot of people like me had aligned themselves with the Republican party on national security issues but were always concerned about issues of economic fairness and social justice."

<h1>Royal Canadian Legion upset over white poppies</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Royal%20Canadian%20Legion%20upset%20over%20white%20poppies&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Legion"&gt;Royal Canadian Legion&lt;/a&gt; are upset over the distribution of &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Poppy"&gt;white poppies&lt;/a&gt; at a store in &lt;a href="w%3AEdmonton"&gt;Edmonton, Alberta&lt;/a&gt;. Veterans in Canada sell red poppies to remember the soldiers that fought in War which is now called &lt;a href="w%3ARemembrance%20Day"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;.

Michael Kalmanovitch, owner of The Earth's General Store, who has been selling white poppies for the past three years, says the white poppies symbolize the hope for peace.

A veteran at the Royal Canadian Legion says that white poppies are an insult and may infringe on the legion's trademark.

"If he, Kalmanovitch [the owner] doesn't, then we will proceed with further legal action," said Steven Clark, Ottawa-based remembrance co-ordinator who oversees the poppy trademark for the Legion.

A British organization called the &lt;a href="w%3APeace%20Pledge%20Union"&gt;Peace Pledge Union&lt;/a&gt; in London, England started the distribution of white poppies in 1993, and over the years the idea has been sold to Canada. The white poppy is a symbol of opposition to the war and they also pay tribute to the pain of those who have lost someone in war.

Mr. Kalmanovitch says that he won't cease white poppy sales until he's officially been notified by the Peace Pledge Union, a British organization that took over from the &lt;a href="w%3AWomen%27s%20Co-Operative%20Guild"&gt;Women's Co-Operative Guild&lt;/a&gt; to distribute the white poppies worldwide.

Marya Nyland, who belongs to &lt;a href="w%3AWomen%20in%20Black"&gt;Women in Black&lt;/a&gt;, an international peace organization, which has been distributing the white poppies across Canada for the last 11 years, said, "Peace is free. You never buy peace."

"It's offensive and it's disturbing that this white poppy would appear at this time of year," he said. "To me, the white poppy is an insult to the veterans. The Women in Black organization, I think, are piggybacking on the sacred time of the year," said Harvey Shevalier, president of the Legion's Alberta-Northwest Territories Command.

Peace activists are advised to focus their efforts on September 21, &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Day%20of%20Peace"&gt;UN-sanctioned International Day of Peace&lt;/a&gt;. However, white poppies would still infringe on the Legion's trademark even if they change the date to Sept. 21.

The poppies are &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToonie"&gt;$2&lt;/a&gt; apiece and sell quickly. Two-hundred of them sold on Monday and the store has ordered more, according to Mr. Kalmanovitch, the store owner.

About 12,000 white poppies are distributed each November in Canada.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Allen%20%28U.S.%20politician%29"&gt;George Allen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , incumbent Republican &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, conceded the state's mid-term election to Democratic challenger &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Webb"&gt;Jim Webb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Thursday. Democrats have now gained the six seats needed by the party to hold majority control of the Senate.

"The people of Virginia have spoken, they have spoken in a closely divided voice. We have two 49ers," Allen said during the afternoon press conference in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArlington%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Arlington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Allen garnered 49.25% of the vote, compared to the 49.55% who supported Webb. "I do not wish to cause more rancor by protracted litigation that would not, in my opinion, alter the results."

The concession by Allen in traditionally Republican Virginia follows what were once prospects for an Allen 2008 presidential bid. An easy Allen re-election campaign to the Senate was expected, but what came was the Democrats ability to frame the election as a national referendum on the war in Iraq. Democrats may have succeeded nationally to draw on the issue of Iraq, but local politics were very much in play in Northern Virginia. 

According to the ♡❤Virginia Pilot♡❤, "Unofficial returns gave Democratic nominee Webb a 120,000-vote advantage over Allen in Northern Virginia's eight localities. But Webb trailed badly across most of the rest of the state and would have decisively lost the election without his Northern Virginia support." The margin by which Webb won was 9,000 votes.

Allen's formulaic stance against tax increases, whether for highway taxes to improve congested northern highway and commuter corridors, or outright fiscal conservativism of all taxes in the face of a burgeoning national deficit, worked against him. 

The state constitutional amendment banning recognition of same-sex marriage supported by Allen, but opposed by Webb and Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Kaine"&gt;Tim Kaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and most Northern Virginians, worked against Allen in the election.

The confirmation of &lt;a href="John%20Bolton"&gt;John Bolton&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Permanent%20Representative%20to%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;US Permanent Representative to the United Nations&lt;/a&gt; is in doubt as Republican Senator &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%20Chafee"&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/a&gt; joins Democrats in opposing his nomination.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Bolton"&gt;John Bolton&lt;/a&gt; was first nominated to the position by &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; in March 2005, but his appointment was opposed at that time when the Democrats on the Senate appointments committee, along with Republican Senator &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Voinovich"&gt;George Voinovich&lt;/a&gt;. He was then appointed by the President during congressional recess in August. This recess appointment must now be confirmed by the Senate.

Bolton's previous confirmation stalled after the Senate committee's demands for information about Bolton's activities while he was in the State Department were rejected by the administration. In addition, there were concerns about whether or not he had exaggerated reports about &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria's&lt;/a&gt; weaponry and doubts about the suitability of his temperament as an Ambassador for the United States. 

While the Senate is in recess, the President can make appointments which have to be ratified subsequently. President Bush appointed John Bolton as Permanent Representative to the UN on August 1, the first day of the recess, asserting that the post was too important to be left vacant at a time when the country was at war and there was a vital debate about the reform of the UN. 

Democratic Senator &lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20Kennedy"&gt;Edward Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; called the appointment "an abuse of power". The appointment is due to be confirmed before January 2007 after which it lapses.

Dr. John Bolton, a prominent &lt;a href="w%3Aneoconservative"&gt;neoconservative&lt;/a&gt; and sometime aide to &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Baker"&gt;James Baker&lt;/a&gt;, has been highly critical of the &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; and its role in international affairs. His opinions were shared by other Republicans including Sen. &lt;a href="w%3ANorm%20Coleman"&gt;Norm Coleman&lt;/a&gt; who is reported as saying that the UN was "mismanaged and possibly corrupt". He was nominated for a &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; in February this year by &lt;a href="w%3APer%20Ahjmark"&gt;Per Ahjmark&lt;/a&gt;, former deputy prime minister of &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. 

President Bush is reported as saying that he wants Bolton's appointment confirmed before January when the Democrats take power. The present constitution of the Senate Committee is 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats and Republican Sen. George Voinovich had come to support Bolton's appointment. However, the move by Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee, on the grounds that, at the recent elections, the people had spoken out against US foreign policy, could result in a hung vote. That would result in John Bolton being removed from his position as US Ambassador to the UN.

Last Thursday, CNN edited out portions of &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20King%20Live"&gt;Larry King's&lt;/a&gt; "live" interview with &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Maher"&gt;Bill Maher&lt;/a&gt; for the west coast showing, and removed the same portions from the online transcript.

The deleted portions consisted of Bill Maher saying that Republican National Committee chair &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Mehlman"&gt;Ken Mehlman&lt;/a&gt; was gay.

Here is the deleted portion of the transcript:

Ken Mehlman, currently the chair of the National Republican Committee, has been known to avoid questions about his sexuality, and supports a constitutional ban on same sex marriage.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Canadian%20PM%20to%20amend%20Criminal%20Code%2C%20drugged%20drivers%20to%20be%20charged&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="w%3AMADD%20Canada"&gt;MADD Canada&lt;/a&gt;, has proposed to amend the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Criminal%20Code"&gt;Criminal Code&lt;/a&gt; to make driving while under the influence of drugs as unacceptable as drunk driving.

Harper was at a news conference in &lt;a href="w%3AKitchener%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Kitchener&lt;/a&gt; today during the 19th annual Project Red Ribbon campaign, sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD).

"Just as a drunk driver does, a drug-impaired driver presents a danger to himself and others," Harper said. "We can act to prevent more such incidents from occurring."

The PM also spoke of his personal connection to Tory Senator &lt;a href="w%3AMarjorie%20LeBreton"&gt;Marjorie LeBreton&lt;/a&gt;, who lost her daughter and grandson to an impaired driver 10 years ago. The family of David Ryder, one of five teens who were killed near Ottawa in a multi-car crash caused by a driver high on &lt;a href="w%3ACannabis%20%28drug%29"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, accompanied Harper at the conference today.

Police will be able to determine what drug a driver may have consumed. When police find a drugged driver, they will go to a police station and bring the driver to a specially trained police officer that can determine what drugs they were on.

According to MADD, the problem has been eliminated in the United States with the introduction of a series of tests that looks for families of drugs.

Harper with MADD Canada tied a red ribbon on the aerial of a vehicle as part of MADD's annual campaign targeting impaired driving during the holiday season. The bill will be proposed next week in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;.

In an &lt;a href="w%3Ainternet"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;-based study published today on the website of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Medical%20Journal"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n investigators tested how well &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20%28verb%29"&gt;Googling&lt;/a&gt; could help to establish a difficult diagnosis. The search results met against their criteria in 15 out of 26 cases.

Previous anecdotes of the use of &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; in reaching a difficult diagnosis are presented in the paper. In a case described in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (NEJM), a physician diagnosed &lt;a href="w%3AIPEX"&gt;IPEX syndrome&lt;/a&gt; after submitting the typical diagnostic clues to the &lt;a href="w%3Asearch%20engine"&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt;. A patient's father replied to doctor's saying that his son had acute &lt;a href="w%3Asubclavian%20vein"&gt;subclavian vein&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Athrombosis"&gt;thrombosis&lt;/a&gt; of unknown origin: "But of course he
has &lt;a href="w%3APaget-Schroetter%20disease"&gt;Paget-von Schrötter syndrome&lt;/a&gt;."

Hangwi Tang and Jennifer Hwee Kwoon Ng from the &lt;a href="w%3APrincess%20Alexandra%20Hospital"&gt;Princess Alexandra Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; selected clinical cases from the NEJM blind to the correct diagnosis. They selected 3 to 5 rather specific features, searched Google, and selected the 3 disorders from the results that seemed to fit the case best. If one of those was right, Google was said to be "right".

The scientists admit that an internet search probably works better with specific symptoms rather than with phrases such as "fever ill pain". Also, the percentage may depend on the operating physician's knowledge base, and the test was not &lt;a href="w%3Adouble-blind"&gt;double-blind&lt;/a&gt;.

Experts commented that the internet is not a replacement for doctors, but should be seen as a way of supporting doctors and patients. A spokeswoman for the Patient Association added that "a lot of sites are not credible. There are lots of good sites out there, but we also know that there are many that are not credible."

Speaking about the "terrorist threat" in Britain, &lt;a href="w%3ADame%20Eliza%20Manningham-Buller"&gt;Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller&lt;/a&gt;, Director-General of the British Security Service &lt;a href="w%3AMI5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that she was alarmed by the "scale and speed" with which Muslims, even those still at school, are being radicalised.

She told the &lt;a href="w%3AMile%20End%20Group"&gt;Mile End Group&lt;/a&gt; run by Professor &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hennessy"&gt;Peter Hennessy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Mary%20College%2C%20University%20of%20London"&gt;Queen Mary College&lt;/a&gt;, that the view of history which prompted feelings of grievance and injustice was shared, not only by extremists, but by many others in the country. For example, opinion polls suggest that over 100,000 people think that the July 7, 2005 attacks in London were justified. (This inference from the data is contested by The 1990 Trust)

She also claimed that MI5 is aware of some 200 groupings, comprising about 1600 individuals, including many teenagers, who are actively planning suicide attacks and the use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons; these include "resilient networks, some directed from Al-Qaida in Pakistan, some more loosely inspired by it".

&lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; supported Dame Eliza's statement, but said "This is a threat that has grown up over a generation." 

Concurrently, the Foreign Secretary, &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt;, in a speech to the&lt;a href="w%3A%20Royal%20United%20Services%20Institute"&gt;Royal United Services Institute&lt;/a&gt; think tank, was calling on the Muslim community to "stand up and be counted" in the fight against extremism. She said that "Muslim communities have a special ability to make a difference in the struggle against extremism."

&lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; from will launch a 2008 &lt;a href="w%3AExploratory%20committee"&gt;exploratory committee&lt;/a&gt; next week, said &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; officials. According to an official, McCain has already opened a bank account for the committee.

Aides to McCain say the senator will discuss whether to seek the presidency with his family over the Christmas holiday, and make a final decision thereafter. This decision was later disputed by a McCain advisor, but later evidence showed that McCain in fact has opened a bank account for an exploratory committee.

McCain's team is exploring office space in , hiring staff and building infrastructure in key &lt;a href="w%3APrimary%20election"&gt;early-primary&lt;/a&gt; states such as , and .

In addition, Joe Biden, a US Senator confirmed he will seek the Democratic 2008 Presidential Nomination and will probably hire a Exploratory committee early next year. Russ Feingold, a US Senator from Wisconsin who had previously been suspected to run has denied interest in the nomination saying he wants to continue his work in the US senate.

32-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ABelinda%20Emmett"&gt;Belinda Emmett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARove%20McManus"&gt;Rove McManus's&lt;/a&gt; wife, died this morning in St Vincent hospital, Sydney, Australia due to cancer. Ms Emmett's family said in a statement: "It is with great sadness we advise that Belinda Emmett's battle with cancer has ended."

Because of her death, with Rove McManus, or more correctly John McManus, and other family at her side, Rove has cancelled next Tuesdays Rove Live show. A statement on Network Ten, which airs Rove Live, said: "Ten will give Rove the time he needs away from the show and any support we can during this very sad time."

"Belinda passed away just after dawn this morning at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney with her family and husband by her side. However the hospital will not divulge how long she was being treated for at the hospital. A spokesman for the hospital said: "As you can imagine, they are very distressed."

When Ms Emmett was 24-years-old in 1998, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Successful surgery removed a malignant tumour, radiotherapy followed for a total of six weeks. Then, in 2001, Ms Emmett was diagnosed with secondary bone cancer.

"Network Ten notes with great sadness Belinda Emmett's passing this morning. Our heartfelt sympathies are with Rove McManus and the Emmett and McManus families. We add our support to the call for media and members of the public to respect Rove's privacy."

TV station, Seven, where Ms Emmett worked as an actor also showed their support saying: "Our deepest sympathy is extended to Belinda's family who have supported her through this illness. During Belinda's time on Home and Away and All Saints, she made many long-lasting friendships. Her acting ability and her warmth made her a joy to work with and her spirit will be remembered."

The Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, said their family is saddened by the news of hearing that Ms Emmett had passed away. "She fought a very courageous battle against cancer," said Mr Howard, "On behalf of Janette and myself, I extend my deepest sympathies to her husband, Rove McManus, and her family and friends."

The leader of the opposition, Kim Beazley, said that their family had also passed on their sympathy to the Emmett and McManus families. "This is truly sad news which I think will affect all Australians," Mr Beazley said, "The tenderness and care in their relationship (Rove and Belinda) through their adversity, I think, has been an inspiration to many many Australians."

Starting at 5:00 a.m., nearly two-thousand &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Torontonians&lt;/a&gt; started gathering to kick up their heels.

A promotion for &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Rockettes"&gt;The Rockettes&lt;/a&gt; Radio City Christmas Spectacular, which will be playing in Toronto throughout the holiday season, a chorus line of either 1,681 or 1,715 Toronto residents was formed. To break the record, the group successfully danced for five minutes non-stop.

The media has had conflicting reports about the number of kickers. The events organizers, Citytv program &lt;a href="w%3ABreakfast%20Television"&gt;Breakfast Television&lt;/a&gt;, reported 1,249, while the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Press"&gt;Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt; suggested 1,681, and the Toronto Star counted 1,715. No matter the number, it beat the previous record of 1,151.

Carey Low of Guinness certified the record, and says it is very likely the record attempt will be included in the next publication of the &lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20World%20Records"&gt;Guinness World Records book&lt;/a&gt;.

Among those participating were Toronto mayoral candidate Steven LeDrew, 71-year-old Jack McKay and 72-year-old Dorothy McKay, both tap dancers, and Mississauga-resident Suresh Joachim, who personally holds 21 other Guinness records. Participant Jeanette Heller, 95-years-old, is the oldest living Rockette.

The record's official title is "Longest Single Line of Dancers".

Rockettes do 800 high kicks during every show, sometimes performing four shows a day.

Reports have surfaced that officials from &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; may meet with officials from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; to talk about the sanctions against North Korea and other problems between the two countries. The meeting may take place sometime next week and is aimed at getting 6-party talks, regarding North Korea's nuclear program, back on track.

Despite the reports by media sources, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20White%20House"&gt;The White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has denied that any plans of the sort exist.

"[We] are not aware of any plans for a meeting," said a spokesman for the White House, Tony Fratto.

Officials at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20State%20Department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; refused to comment on the reports.

"I cannot comment on the reports," said a spokesman for the State Department, Kurtis Cooper.

On October 31, 2006, officials from the U.S. met with North Korean officials in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing%2C%20China"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which led the North Koreans to agree to return to 6-party talks regarding North Korea's nuclear program.

"It looks like a hurricane, but it doesn't behave like a hurricane. Whatever it is, we're going to focus on the eye of this storm and find out why it's there," said Doctor Andrew Ingersoll, a member of Cassini's imaging team at the California Institute of Technology located in &lt;a href="w%3APasadena%2C%20California"&gt;Pasadena&lt;/a&gt;.

The storm is approximately 5,000 miles across or roughly two-thirds the diameter of Earth and is stationary. The winds in the storm, which are blowing clockwise are reaching about 350 miles per hour and two spiral arms of clouds are extending from the center of the storm. Scientists say that the storm's clouds are anywhere between three to five times taller and larger than any clouds found on Earth.

It is not known what has caused the storm to form.

The first person to become infected with the &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; or Bird Flu virus in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has been declared healthy after being infected one year ago.

Doctors say that He Junyao, 10-years-old, who was infected on October 18, 2005 is healthy and all his body functions are "normal."

"[His] body functions are all normal" and the illness "has not affected the boy's growth," said Doctor Jiang Yaohui of the Hunan Provincial Children's Hospital. Yaohui also stated that the quick and "proper treatment" the boy had received was the reason that he survived.

The boy has been granted free medical check-ups until his eighteenth birthday.

At least 19 people have become ill from the illness in China and at least 14 of those have died.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Mets"&gt;New York Mets&lt;/a&gt; baseball team has agreed to a 20-year sponsorship deal with financial house &lt;a href="w%3ACitigroup"&gt;Citigroup&lt;/a&gt; for the team's new ballpark, now called &lt;a href="w%3ACitiField"&gt;CitiField&lt;/a&gt;. The deal, which includes stadium naming rights, is worth more than $20 million annually, according to a baseball official.

This tops the approximately ten million annually the NFL's Houston Texans receive from Reliant Energy to call their home Reliant Stadium.

The agreement between the Mets and the financial services company includes options for both the team and Citigroup that could extend the deal to up to 35-years. Other commercial arrangements are part of the contract, the official said.

Construction on the ballpark, next to the current stadium in Queens, New York, began last summer and is scheduled to be ready for the 2009 season. The Mets have played at Shea Stadium since 1964, the team's third year in the league. The ballpark is named for William A. Shea, a lawyer who helped bring National League baseball back to New York.

The announcement will be made Monday at a special ceremony that will be attended by New York Govener, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Pataki"&gt;George Pataki&lt;/a&gt; and New York City Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.

Citigroup is one of the world's largest full-service banks, with two hundred million customers in more than 100 countries.

Ankola's trouble began when Balaji Telefilms Ltd., dragged him to the court for appearing in a rival production house. He had signed up a contract with this production house in the month of August, and was expected to abide by the contract for the next 12 months. However, he shot through the months of September and October and did not show up in November. The High Court ordered that until the arbitration in this matter is pending, the actor cannot act, endorse, advertise or do voice-overs for production houses that compete with Balaji.

Polish Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Jarosław Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt; has ordered the pharmaceutical company Jelfa to halt production following revelations that Jelfa had placed mislabelled medication on the market, whose use could be potentially fatal. 

Jelfa distributed vials labelled as Corhydron, a &lt;a href="w%3AHydrocortisone"&gt;hydrocortisone&lt;/a&gt; used to treat allergies and inflammation, but in fact containing Suxamethonium chloride, a drug normally used to cause muscle paralysis during emergency surgery. 

The Health Ministry has appealed to people suffering from asthma or allergies to check their medication and return any Corhydron ampoules they possess to the pharmacy.

&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.polskieradio.pl"&gt;Polskie Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reports that the mislabelling was discovered a month ago, but Jelfa and the &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.mz.gov.pl"&gt;Polish Health ministry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; did not inform of the problem. 

Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski ordered Jelfa to halt production until it can assure the Polish Government that it can properly manage its production. 

The ♡❤&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.masterpage.com.pl/outlook/"&gt;Polish Outlook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;♡❤ reports that that drug companies in Poland were operating unregulated since December, 2005 as the regulations has expired. The government was putting in place new regulations.

The owner of Jelfa is AB Sanitas, the largest drug producer in neighbouring Lithuania. The shut-down has been questioned by the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Lithuania"&gt;Lithuanian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGediminas%20Kirkilas"&gt;Gediminas Kirkilas&lt;/a&gt;, who expressed concern over the situation and said that he wants to try to settle the issue diplomatically.

<h1>UK to step up anti-terror legislation</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UK%20to%20step%20up%20anti-terror%20legislation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

New measures to counter the threat of terrorism in UK are expected in the &lt;a href="w%3ASpeech%20from%20the%20throne"&gt;Queen’s Speech&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Ian%20Blair"&gt;Sir Ian Blair&lt;/a&gt;, Metropolitan police chief, in a speech in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, highlighted the scale of disaffection among the Muslim community, pointing to reports that between 40,000 and 120,000 Muslims believed that the &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%207%2C%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;London bombings&lt;/a&gt;, when four British suicide bombers killed 52 civilians, were justified. He believed that this disaffection was related to the very negative way in which many in the Muslim community perceived the country’s foreign policy. This view had been expressed last month by &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Secretary"&gt;Foreign Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt; and by the Head of &lt;a href="w%3AMI5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADame%20Eliza%20Manningham-Buller"&gt;Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller&lt;/a&gt;, earlier in the week. However, Prime minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; contested the strong connection to foreign policy, saying that the problem has "grown up over a generation".

Sir Ian outlined where he thought new legislation was needed. Despite the fact that the measure had caused the Government to be defeated in the last session of &lt;a href="w%3AParliament"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, he wanted the extension of the 28 days suspects can be held without charge to be reconsidered. He wanted the law restricting the reporting of court proceedings relaxed to let people, particularly in the communities from which those on trial come, to see justice being done. As things stand, once they have charged a suspect, the police have no right to continue questioning; this should be changed, he said. He also wanted &lt;a href="w%3Aphone%20tap%20evidence"&gt;phone tap evidence&lt;/a&gt; to be allowed in court and flag burning to be made illegal. &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reid%20%28politician%29"&gt;John Reid&lt;/a&gt; will have an opportunity of introducing new legislation in the Queen's Speech.
Following Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller’s statement that MI5 has the task of keeping track of 1,600 suspects engaged in 30 known terrorist plots with a staff of 2,800, and that disaffection is increasing as never before, it is expected that more resources will be provided to support her department’s work. &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Mercer"&gt;Patrick Mercer&lt;/a&gt;, the shadow homeland security minister said that both the &lt;a href="w%3ASecret%20Intelligence%20Service"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and security servcies needed a substantial increase in resources. &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; has said that his first priority as &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; would be to head anti-terrorism measures personally. In his present post he has responsibility for the allocation of resources to government departments.

The opinion poll findings quoted by Dame Eliza are questioned by the 1990 Trust (a charitable trust supported by the Rowntree Trust, Comic Relief, CRE and others). Introducing an internet survey conducted between the 8th and 27th September 2006, Karen Chouhan of the 1990 Trust said "This (referring to Dame Manningham-Buller’s speech) is nothing short of irresponsible politicking and journalism which is designed to create a moral panic to pave the way for renewed legislative assaults on civil liberties and can only serve to fuel fears and hostility towards Muslim communities in the UK". The specific criticism of the use being made of the ICM/Sunday Telegraph Poll, that has been widely reported, is that "some sections of the media have conflated Muslim respondents answering positively to the question of whether they have sympathy ‘with the feeling and motives of those who carried out the attacks’ (20% of those polled in the same ICM/Telegraph survey of February 2006 answered affirmatively) with the violence itself. To understand the motive behind an action cannot be equated with violence itself, and the media have a responsibility to create a clear demarcation".

A Report from the Joseph Rowntree Trust, by Professor Stuart Weir, Director of Democratic Audit at the University of Essex, Dr Andrew Blick and Tufyal Choudhury was published today November 13, 2006. It concludes that "the government’s counter terrorism legislation and rhetorical stance are between them creating serious losses in human rights and criminal justice protections...and so are prejudicing the ability of the government and security forces to gain the very trust and cooperation from individuals in those communities that they require to combat terrorism."
Parliament resumes its work next week when the Queen’s Speech will indicate what new &lt;a href="w%3Aanti-terrorist"&gt;anti-terrorist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aanti-racist"&gt;anti-racist&lt;/a&gt; legislation the Government intends to propose.

&lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; Foreign Affairs Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Zahar"&gt;Mahmoud al-Zahar&lt;/a&gt; said today that &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; is against peace with Israel, will not give up the right of return of Palestinian refugees and will not recognize Israel even if a Palestinian state is created in the pre-1967 borders.

Al-Zahar also threatened Israel with response to the artillery shelling by the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israel Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ABeit%20Hanoun"&gt;Beit Hanoun&lt;/a&gt;, where 19 Palestinians were killed due to machinery fault at one of the artillery stations.

The foreign minister also noted that Hamas will receive most seats in the Palestinian parliament, thus changing Palestinian Authority's policy to its liking. He also revealed that Hamas turned down Palenstinian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas's&lt;/a&gt; offer to release kidnapped Israeli soldier &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt; under Egyptian custody prior to Israel's assurance of release up to a thousand Palestinian prisoners.

Alberta premier &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Klein"&gt;Ralph Klein&lt;/a&gt; was at the annual &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt; Homeless Foundation roast Tuesday evening when he poked fun at Liberal MP &lt;a href="w%3ABelinda%20Stronach"&gt;Belinda Stronach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACrossing%20the%20floor"&gt;crossing the floor&lt;/a&gt; from the Conservatives to the Liberals. "I wasn't surprised that she crossed over to the Liberals. I don't think she ever did have a Conservative bone in her body. Well, maybe one." [Referring to Conservative MP &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20MacKay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt;, her ex boyfriend]. "Well, speaking of Peter MacKay...," he continued.

Klein refused to apologize for the remark saying: "I'm making no apologies...I read the copy and I approved. I thought it was a funny line...So did Bruce [his bodyguard]," he added.

"A roast is a roast is a roast. It's not a toast," Klein told reporters.

The audience laughed at the joke, but after some people said they felt uncomfortable with it.

"Ms. Stronach roasted the premier two years ago and made remarks about his weight, his clothing and even his flatulence," Marisa Etmanski, Klein's press secretary, told the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Press"&gt;Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt;. "In a roast situation, these remarks were hysterical, and that's the same kind of thing that happened this year."
Stronach, a &lt;a href="w%3AFeminism"&gt;feminist&lt;/a&gt;, was offended by the joke and said that "we want to attract many more women to participate in politics" and "improve the civility that occurs in public life." 

Stronach was in Montreal on Thursday for an international conference on global poverty and defended herself from the comment. "Ralph should put his money where his mouth is and buy a whole bunch of bednets to save kids from malaria in Africa."

The joke was taken from Mr. MacKay's alleged comment calling Stronach a "dog" last month in the House of Commons.

"I don't know of any person who is more respectful of women, who is less inclined to tell off-colour stories or use improper language," said &lt;a href="w%3AShirley%20McClellan"&gt;Shirley McClellan&lt;/a&gt;, Klein's deputy premier. "I've worked with this gentleman for 17 years, and have never been treated with anything more than the utmost respect. And I am so disappointed in our media."

The video (see external links section) has made its way around the popular internet video site &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. It has been viewed more than 19,500 times and more than 100 comments had been posted about the video.

<h1>Gerald Ford oldest living US President ever</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Gerald%20Ford%20oldest%20living%20US%20President%20ever&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
After passing &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Ford"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; became the oldest living United States President in history at 93 years old.

Ford was born on July 14, 1913 in Omaha, Nebraska and has been alive for 93 years and 121 days. Former record-holder Reagan died at 93 years and 120 days in June, 2004. Before Reagan held the record, John Adams' 90 year lifespan gave him the bragging rights. George Washington, the first former president to die, held the record before that.

A former Michigan congressman, Ford became Vice President in December of 1973 under &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Nixon"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="w%3ASpiro%20Agnew"&gt;Spiro Agnew&lt;/a&gt; resigned due to taking bribes.

After Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 (possibly to avoid impeachment) because of the Watergate scandal, Ford became the 38th President.

Ford was the only president who was never elected to either the presidency or the vice presidency, and remained in office until defeated by &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt; in the November 1976 Presidential election.

Ford and his wife &lt;a href="w%3ABetty%20Ford"&gt;Betty&lt;/a&gt;, 88, live in Rancho Mirage in the desert area of Southern &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

"The length of one's days matters less than the love of one's family and friends," said Ford in a statement in the local Desert Sun newspaper.

Ford has battled a series of illnesses this year. He has been hospitalized four times for &lt;a href="w%3Aangioplasty"&gt;angioplasty&lt;/a&gt;, shortness of breath and &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, and other tests.

Rebels known as the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UDFU) or the UFDR with its French initials in the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20African%20Republic"&gt;Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt; (CAR) claim to have taken over another town in the CAR after a two-week long offensive. 

The rebels told a &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; reporter via satellite telephone that they had captured &lt;a href="w%3AOuadda-Djalle"&gt;Ouadda-Djalle&lt;/a&gt;, an isolated settlement 200 km west of the border with &lt;a href="w%3ASudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;. 

A government spokesman has only confirmed the rebels' activity but so far, not the seizure of the town. The government claims that Ouadda-Djalle still remains in the army's hands. 

The UFDR claims their reasons for rebelling are to fight against corruption and mismanagement under CAR President &lt;a href="w%3AFrancois%20Bozize"&gt;Francois Bozize&lt;/a&gt;'s handling, who seized power in a &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; coup.

The first town to fall into the hands of the UFDR was &lt;a href="w%3ABirao"&gt;Birao&lt;/a&gt;, which was captured in October. Both towns claimed by the rebels are near eastern &lt;a href="w%3AChad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; and Sudan's western &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region.

The CAR government believes that the rebels are being supported by Sudanese authorities and are operating from Darfur. Sudan has denied this, though.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; military has been requested to come and stop the rebellion from getting out of control.

"We captured this town in the early hours of the morning this Friday after [a] fierce battle with the regular army," Abakar Saboune, one of the rebels said. 

Saboune also said twenty government troops were killed in the seizure, and twelve more were taken prisoner. The rebels only lost three people, and another two were wounded.

The UFDR's forces, currently located 750 km north of the &lt;a href="w%3ABangui"&gt;Bangui&lt;/a&gt;, are thought to be ready to capture another two towns. 

The rebels requested that a national conference be held to discuss the matter of sharing power, but the government has, at this point, not responded.

Three &lt;a href="w%3AMorocco"&gt;Moroccans&lt;/a&gt;, who were formerly held in extrajudicial detention in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detainee%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay detainee camp&lt;/a&gt;s, in &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMohamed%20Souleymani%20Laalami"&gt;Mohamed Souleymani Laalami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANajib%20Lahssini"&gt;Najib Lahssini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Ouali"&gt;Mohammed Ouali&lt;/a&gt;, were sentenced on Friday November 10.

Laalami's Moroccan conviction was for creating a "criminal group". He was sentenced to five years imprisonment.

Najib Lahssini and Mohammed Ouali were convicted of falsifying documents, and were sentenced to three years imprisonment.

The three men's extrajudicial detention in Guantanamo was based on a secret determination that they were "enemy combatants". 
The US Supreme Court forced the US Department of Defense to conduct &lt;a href="w%3ACombatant%20Status%20Review%20Tribunal"&gt;Combatant Status Review Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;s, between July of 2004 and March of 2005.

♡❤Al Jazeera♡❤ reports that the three men's transfer to Morocco occurred prior to February 2006, and that their trial was unrelated to their Guantanamo detention. Al Jazeera reports that the USA had allowed seven other Moroccans to be repatriated.

♡❤Maroo Annonces♡❤ reported that FBI director Mueller had visited Morocco in early February, to negotiate the repatriation of the detainees to Moroccan anti-terrorism Police; that a February 12 visit from Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld coincided with the men's transfer; and that the Moroccan counter-terrorism police had finished their investigation on February 22nd.

During Mohamed Souleymani Laalami's Tribunal he was accused of attending the &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Farouq%20training%20camp"&gt;al Farouq training camp&lt;/a&gt;, a military training camp that is alleged to have trained terrorists, including 9-11 hijackers, &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Reid%20%28shoe%20bomber%29"&gt;Richard Reid&lt;/a&gt;, "the shoe bomber", &lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Ressam"&gt;Ahmed Ressam&lt;/a&gt;, "the millennium bomber". Souleymani denied attending the camp.
Souleymani was also accused of being captured in the &lt;a href="w%3ATora%20Bora"&gt;Tora Bora&lt;/a&gt; mountains. Laalami, in turn, alleged that he had beaten, and threatened with death, during his interrogations in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, to force him to falsely confess to please his interrogators.

Lahssini chose not to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

The US Department of Defense was forced to release an official list of the names of all the Guantanamo detainees who had been held in military custody. Although all the press reports describe Mohammed Ouali as a former Guantanamo detainee, there is no detainee named Mohammed Ouali on the official list of detainee names.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMeena%20Keshwar%20Kamal"&gt;Meena Keshwar Kamal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , popularly known as Meena, the founder of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARevolutionary%20Association%20of%20the%20Women%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (RAWA) has been listed among the "60 Asian Heroes" along with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMother%20Teresa"&gt;Mother Teresa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKang%20Chol%20Hwan"&gt;Kang Chol Hwan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and others, in the Asian edition of ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20%28magazine%29"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ Magazine. The magazine dedicated its November 13, 2006 special anniversary issue to pay "homage to the men and women who have shaped our destiny and our times." 

Aryn Baker writes in her profile of Meena: "Although she was only 30 when she died, Meena had already planted the seeds of an &lt;a href="Afhanistan"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; women's rights movement based on the power of knowledge. She believed that if women were able to read and write, that if they could communicate and learn about the world, they would discover their own strength and could make a difference in their own society."

Meena established RAWA in 1977 to promotes women's rights and a secular democracy. The group opposed both the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -supported regime and the later &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMujahideen"&gt;Mujahideen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIslamist"&gt;Islamist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; rulers. After 10 years of struggle for women's rights, she was assassinated in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQueeta"&gt;Queeta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on February 4, 1987 allegedly by the agents of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKhadamat-e%20Etela%27at-e%20Dawlati"&gt;Khadamat-e Etela'at-e Dawlati&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (KHAD), the secret police of the Soviet-supported regime in Afghanistan, which functioned under the control of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKGB"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

27-year-old Robin Parkircher arrived in &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; today to apologize to &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; survivors for his grandfather's behavior. Parkircher's grandfather was an &lt;a href="w%3ASchutzstaffel"&gt;SS&lt;/a&gt; guard in a &lt;a href="w%3ANazi"&gt;Nazi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aconcentration%20camp"&gt;concentration camp&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ABremen%20%28city%29"&gt;Bremen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, where over eight hundred women were incarcerated. In an interview, Parkircher told Israeli &lt;a href="w%3AYedioth%20Ahronoth"&gt;Yediot Aharonot&lt;/a&gt; newspaper that years after his grandfather passed away, Parkircher found a picture of him wearing an SS &lt;a href="w%3Auniform"&gt;uniform&lt;/a&gt;. After inquiring with his grandmother, he discovered about his grandfather's service as a camp guard.

After the discovery, the younger Parkircher decided he should look for the camp survivors and ask for their forgiveness. After months-long search, he discovered survivors in Nordia senior citizen home in central Israel.

His first visit was to author and camp survivor Lili Curtis, with whom he previously unsuccessfully tried to communicate. After the communication attempts failed, Parkircher decided to come to Israel by himself and meet with Curtis.

After the meeting, Curtis said that she was confused at first and moved as the conversation developed. Following the conversation between the two, Parkircher was invited to a meal with residents of Nordia House, where he used the opportunity to talk and apologize to the survivors. Witnesses reported later that the apology was very moving and brought many of them to tears.

He is scheduled to stay in Israel for another twelve days, to visit additional survivors of the concentration camp.

Opposition MPs are calling on &lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Hillier"&gt;General Rick Hillier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Staff%20%28Canada%29"&gt;chief of the Defence Staff&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces"&gt;Canadian Forces&lt;/a&gt;, to allow Governor General &lt;a href="w%3AMicha%C3%ABlle%20Jean"&gt;Michaelle Jean&lt;/a&gt; visit &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar, Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. 

The trip still has not yet been arranged due to security concerns.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; went to Afghanistan earlier this year, then followed Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20O%27Connor"&gt;Gordon O'Connor&lt;/a&gt; and Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20MacKay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt; going to Afghanistan in support for the Canadian troops. Former Gov. Gen. &lt;a href="w%3AAdrienne%20Clarkson"&gt;Adrienne Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; visited the Canadian troops in Afghanistan twice. The security was less of an issue because the soldiers were in &lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;.

Earlier this year, Jean told Hillier that she wanted to visit the troops in Kandahar to witness some of the provincial reconstruction teams at work outside the Canadian base and meet with local citizens.

"If all of them can go at various times, I am certain the military can make arrangements for the commander-in-chief to go," said Liberal MP &lt;a href="w%3AUjjal%20Dosanjh"&gt;Ujjal Dosanjh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOpposition%20Critics"&gt;official Opposition defence critic&lt;/a&gt;. "She's the commander-in-chief... We all know it's a ceremonial position, but it is important for the troops to see the Governor General, the ultimate authority in dismissing the government or not dismissing the government, is there to appreciate what they're doing and lend support."

New Democratic Party defence critic &lt;a href="w%3ADawn%20Black"&gt;Dawn Black&lt;/a&gt; also supports the idea on Jean going to Afghanistan. "It's clear that other people have been able to get in and out. I would think arrangements could be made for the Governor General to get in and out as well. There are entertainers going in!"

She is anxious to visit the Canadian troops, according to her spokesman, Randy Mylyk.

Jean was shedueled to go to the country during the &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Medusa"&gt;Operation Medusa&lt;/a&gt; in early September, when Canadians waged a major offensive against insurgents.

Jean has been visiting military bases in cities such as Esquimalt, British Columbia, Edmonton, Alberta, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, and also meeting with families of Canada's fallen.

As families fled their homes in the early morning hours on Thursday October 26, there was no warning. The Esperanza Fire southeast of Los Angeles and West of Palm Springs, California, had ballooned under the influence of Santa Ana winds to more than 19,000 acres as of the morning of October 27. No time to get the animals, no time for crates or even a leash. Sadly, owners left behind not only their horses, lamas, donkeys, chickens, rabbits, but also their dogs and cats.

Many of the families who did manage to evacuate their pets found themselves in the parking lot at the Fellowship in the Pass Church Red Cross Shelter where a MuttShack Animal Rescue team caught up with them.

Pam Anderson, Director of the emergency Red Cross shelter said that many people with animals had come and left.

The air was thick with smoke, and ash was raining down on the parking lot where dog owners, not able to take their dogs into the shelter were camping out in pup tents and
in their cars.

Those who could afford it checked themselves into pet friendly hotels in nearby towns.

Some were prepared. Jane Garner, a small dog breeder was able to get all her animals out, and had set up her puppy runs alongside her RV in the parking lot. Others were not doing too well, having left home without as much as a leash.

The same scenario played out at the Red Cross shelter at Hemet High School. Animals were being boarded in vans, trailers and cars and small travel crates.

When MuttShack Animal Rescue arrived, a small fracas had sent several dogs off in different directions, running out of the school parking lot down busy streets necessitating an instant rescue response.

The Incident Command for the Esperanza Animals, Ramona Humane Society in San Jacinto welcomed MuttShack‘s offer to help at the shelters.

Ramona Humane Society had recently published a notice in their Newsletter about the newly passed “PETS Act"
and warned owners not wait until a major disaster such as an earthquake or fire
to prepare. "Be proactive to ensure that your pet will be taken care of.”

MuttShack and PetSmart Charities set up ad hoc facilities for the animals at both shelters.

The Red Cross shelter, run by Madison Burtchaell of the Orange County Red Cross was very accommodating about allowing a small emergency pet shelter adjacent to the School.

Barbara A. Fought of PetSmart Charities, an organization that works with animal welfare organizations and provide assistance in disasters, provided crates and emergency supplies.

MuttShack and Red Cross volunteers, Martin St. John, Tom Hamilton, and Steve Meissner helped assemble the crates to secure a safe environment for evacuated pets.

It was a great relief for evacuees who had camped out in the parking lot to finally leave their vehicles and relax at the shelter, setting up their cots to grab some sorely needed rest.

Firefighters and residents reported loss of wildlife and animals. The Esperanza fire burned 34 homes, consumed 40,000 acres and cost five Firefighters their lives before it was contained four days later on October 30. Firefighting operations cost nearly $10 million.

MuttShack Animal Rescue is a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization active in disasters and dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and care of lost or discarded dogs, cats and other animals.

&lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s national assembly has passed bill 230-41 legalizing &lt;a href="w%3Agay%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; in that country. The bill allows for the voluntary civil union or marriage between two people. It does not specify the orientation or sex of the people involved.

It was passed just in time to meet the Constitutional Court deadline of December 1, set forth by its ruling of December last year which said the current marriage law is unconstitutional.

The bill is being hailed by gay and liberal activists as another step forward out of the country's apartheid past, while at the same time religious clergy and traditional lawmakers are stating that the passage of the bill is "the saddest day in our 12 years of democracy." Islamist leader Sheikh Sharif Ahmed has said the bill is a "foreign action imposed on Africa". 

Homosexuality is &lt;a href="w%3AHomosexuality%20laws%20of%20the%20world"&gt;overwhelmingly illegal&lt;/a&gt; on the African continent, and even in countries such as South Africa it is not unusual for gays to be persecuted and attacked for their orientation.

Now that the bill has passed the National Assembly with a vote of 230-41 its next stop is the National Council of Provinces where its passage is widely expected on its way to being signed by President &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Studies%20find%20radioactive%20material%20at%20Israel%20bomb%20site%20in%20Lebanon&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Studies carried out by researchers near the village of &lt;a href="w%3AKhiam"&gt;Khiam&lt;/a&gt; found radio active material at the site of bombing by &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; says that it has found no evidence of urianum-based munitions.

Two previously unknown Lebanese professors of physics, Mohammad Ali Kubaissi and Ibrahim Rachidi claim that the levels of radiation, about 700 nanosieverts per hour, twenty times the average levels, are consistent with the use of a &lt;a href="w%3Adepleted%20uranium"&gt;depleted uranium&lt;/a&gt; bomb casing. Military use of depleted uranium is quite controversial due to its toxicity and low level radioactivity. Depleted uranium features in the list of weapons capable of causing mass destruction, superflous injury and unnecessary suffering, passed by the &lt;a href="w%3ASub-Commission%20on%20Prevention%20of%20Discrimination%20and%20Protection%20of%20Minorities"&gt;Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUNHRC"&gt;UNHRC&lt;/a&gt; in 1996 and 1997.

This analysis has been partially coroborated by an independent consultant specialising in career, organisation and community psychology issues, Dai Williams, affiliated with the environmentalist organisation &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Audit"&gt;Green Audit&lt;/a&gt;, with testing done by Chris Busby, a member of the Defence Depleted Uranium Oversight Board of the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29"&gt;British Ministry of Defence&lt;/a&gt; and a director and co-founder of Green Audit. Williams believes that these anomalies may have been caused by Israel's use of uranium based weapons involving some secret physical techniques, not nuclear fission; however, there are no known such physical processes.

The U.S. is currently the only nation known to use depleted uranium bomb casings and munitions. Some observers have claimed that Israel used depleted uranium muntions during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war; however, U.N. observers have never found Israel using depleted uranium.

This level of radiation is also consistent with Israel having destroyed some form of storage facility for nuclear material. Such facilities are speculated to exist in the Middle East, often controlled by Islamic extremist groups who (allegedly) hope to construct a &lt;a href="w%3Adirty%20bomb"&gt;dirty bomb&lt;/a&gt;.

Dirty bombs are not considered to be as effective militarily as merely using more explosives. Post September 11th news reports about the dangers of dirty bombs have been criticized as fear mongering for fallaciously assuming years of continued exposure by victims without acounting for clean up procedures, or even rain fall.

Investigations by the Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, &lt;a href="w%3AB%27Tselem"&gt;B'Tselem&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that &lt;a href="w%3AIDF"&gt;Israeli soldiers&lt;/a&gt; shot dead two unarmed, wounded &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20Palestine"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; in a town west of &lt;a href="w%3AJenin"&gt;Jenin&lt;/a&gt;. 

Salim Abu al-Heijah and Mahmoud Abu Hassan had gone to a relative's home to seek shelter and medical aid. About 20 minutes later, Israeli troops ordered the men's family members to vacate the house, broke in, and allegedly executed the injured men, after stepping over them.

The Israeli military denied the allegations, saying "The force identified suspicious characters during a search of the area and opened fire towards them."

The B'Tselem report states that the fact that the Israeli soldiers did not attempt to tie up the deceased, or search the body following the killing, indicates that the soldiers did not perceive the victims as potential threats.

&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; marks its tenth birthday by launching Al Jazeera English on cable, satellite, on broadband, &lt;a href="w%3AIPTV"&gt;IPTV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AADSL"&gt;ADSL&lt;/a&gt;, terrestrial and mobile phone platforms in &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Europe"&gt;Western Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and there will be a live stream to the one billion users of the Internet worldwide. Cable providers will take the signals to 40 million subscriber. This, claims Al Jazeera, is a unique event in terms of the scale of audience already available at the time of launch. Sky, a leading satellite broadcaster will distribute Al Jazeera English.

At the same time, Al Jazeera's English website, aljazeera.net/English, will have a new look and will provide live streams of the TV channel, &lt;a href="w%3ARSS"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt; feeds, e-mail, newsletters and interactive discussion boards and will allow everyone to "express their opinion freely, encouraging debates, viewpoints and counter viewpoints". Notably, &lt;a href="w%3Aaljazeera.com"&gt;aljazeera.com&lt;/a&gt; is an unrelated website publishing inflammatory opinion articles about Middle East issues.

Al Jazeera claims to be impartial and says that its team of journalists "share a common set of attributes: objectivity, accuracy, and a passion for truth". It is supported by the Emir of Qatar, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who enabled it to start up with a grant of $150M and it is said to receive $30m annually from him.

&lt;a href="w%3ANigel%20Parson"&gt;Nigel Parson&lt;/a&gt;, al-Jazeera International's British managing director, said he intended to bring home to British viewers what was being done in their name. He would not hesitate to show dead soldiers in "long shots" and with "pixilated faces", even before their next of kin had been told. ♡❤The Telegraph♡❤ reports reactions of two opposition defence spokesmen: "a promotion of brutality" and "grotesque" said a Tory and "banning such material could result in the public getting a sanitised, cleaned-up version of those realities" voiced by a Liberal Democrat. The Ministry of Defence is reported as saying that the public had a right to know what goes on in operational theatres, but expected media to report with "consideration of the welfare of service families".

The London office has contributors from the BBC including Sir David Frost, Rageh Omaar and Darren Jordon, and from ITN, Shiulie Ghosh.

Al Jazeera is often criticised in the West. On one occasion its offices were bombed by the U.S., when on 13 November 2001, a U.S. missile hit Al Jazeera's office in Kabul, Afghanistan. On 8 April 2003 a U.S. missile hit a generator near the &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; office and the subsequent fire killed a reporter. In &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, Al Jazeera reporter &lt;a href="w%3ATaysir%20Allouni"&gt;Taysir Allouni&lt;/a&gt; was sentenced to seven years for being a financial courier for &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. He claims that his only association with that group was an interview with &lt;a href="w%3Abin%20Laden"&gt;bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; after 9/11.

Iranian state broadcaster Voice of Islamic Republic of Iran has published a report on its English-language web site outlining a theory of an alleged conspiracy involving Pope &lt;a href="w%3ABenedict%20XVI"&gt;Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; and former U.S. secretary of state Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Kissinger"&gt;Henry Kissinger&lt;/a&gt;. The report revives earlier claims of a Papal-Jewish conspiracy reported by some media outlets in Arab and Muslim countries. 

Commenting on a recent private audience granted to Dr. Kissinger by Pope Benedict XVI, the Iranian broadcaster described Kissinger as "anti-Christian" presumably because he is Jewish. The Iranian radio stated that "this is not the first time the Vatican, which claims to be champion of Christianity uses foreign, anti-Christian experts."

Citing a report by the Italian daily newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Stampa"&gt;La Stampa&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the Iranian radio reported that "the Leader of the Catholic sect of Christianity, Pope Benedict XVI has called on former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, a Jew who does not believe in either Prophet Jesus (peace upon him) or his Virgin mother, Mary (peace upon her), to become a member of the Vatican’s consultative council on foreign policy."
Iranian radio further claimed that the previous Roman-Catholic pontiff, Pope &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20II"&gt;John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;, also consulted with foreign "anti-Christian" experts, in this case the former U.S. national security adviser, Dr. &lt;a href="w%3AZbigniew%20Brzezinski"&gt;Zbigniew Brzezinski&lt;/a&gt;. Like the previous pope, Dr. Brzezinski is both Polish and Catholic -- the fact acknowledged by the Iranian broadcaster. Dr. Brzezinski's last name was misspelled on the Iranian radio web site as "Berzhinsky." Dr. Kissinger was born in Germany, which is also the birthplace of Pope Benedict XVI. Young Henry Kissinger and his immediate family managed to escape Nazi persecution of Jews by immigrating to the United States in the 1930s.

As a proof that there may be an anti-Muslim conspiracy involving Dr. Kissinger, the Iranian broadcaster asserted that one of the most important topics of his contacts with Pope Benedict XVI "are related to resurgent Islam, which is claiming more and more adherents around the globe." Pope Benedict XVI came earlier under severe criticism in Muslim countries for his comments about the history of Islam made during the visit to his native Germany in September 2006. Some media commentators in the West also criticized the pope for his comments as contributing to religious tensions, while others defended his right to discuss the history of Islam. The Jewish-American &lt;a href="w%3AAnti%20Defamation%20League"&gt;Anti Defamation League&lt;/a&gt; reported that media outlets in Muslim countries claimed there was a Jewish conspiracy behind the pope's comments. 

In reviving the Jewish-Papal conspiracy theory, the Iranian radio did not explain what makes both Dr. Kissinger and Dr. Brzezinski "anti-Christian" and why the popes would knowingly consult on a regular basis with people holding anti-Christian views. 

Commenting on the Iranian broadcast,&lt;a href="w%3AFreeMediaOnline.org"&gt;FreeMediaOnline.org&lt;/a&gt;, a California-based nonprofit media watch organization supporting press freedom worldwide, reported that audiences which tend to believe broad &lt;a href="w%3Apropaganda"&gt;propaganda&lt;/a&gt; claims are not likely to question logical and factual inconsistencies such as those contained in the Iranian broadcast. Iranian media reports with anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli claims often have factual mistakes and are frequently written in ungrammatical and difficult to understand English.

&lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt; Chairman, told &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;ns not to allow sentiments over the Iraq War to damage relations with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Talking at a benefit dinner for the American-Australian Association, in Sydney, Mr. Murdoch cited surveys which have shown that anti-US sentiments to be more prevalent than ever. He warned Australians not to let a rift develop between the two countries.

Mr. Murdoch believes that doubts about the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20war"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt; should not cloud the relationship stating, "Wars end, administrations come and go". 

"The Australian people must not allow the perfectly legitimate doubts about one policy or one American administration to cloud their long-term judgement."

Mr. Murdoch also touched on the environment during his speech saying both countries must look into new sources of energy to combat climate change.

&lt;a href="w%3AHalton%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Halton&lt;/a&gt; MP &lt;a href="w%3AGarth%20Turner"&gt;Garth Turner&lt;/a&gt; accounced at a news conference that he has resigned his membership from the Conservative party, a month after he was suspended from the Tory caucus due to his own posting on his blog.

Turner said Tuesday that he would continue as an Independent. &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20May"&gt;Elizabeth May&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; Leader, asked him to join the Green party last month. Turner would be the first member of the party to serve in this capacity. Turner will be in May's &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20Ontario"&gt;London, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; riding to campaign with her on Wednesday.

"Party politics, and not just specifically this party, is the problem," said outspoken MP Turner. "People may end up sending MPs to Ottawa who are party supporters through and through, or they may end up sending people who, like me, are a pain in the ass."

His riding association has been told he won't be allowed to run as a Conservative in the next election.

"We have to break this tedious cycle of electing politicians who sell us on change and deliver same old same old," Turner said. "This raises more questions about the role of the average Canadian in the political process and their ability to choose their own representative."

Turner says he will bring in a private member's bill to give independents more opportunity in the House of Commons and allow them to give tax receipts for political contributions.

Turner is known for his outspoken remarks on his popular blog that include criticism of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; and Tory policies.

A new law that proposes no spitting, swearing, or urinating in public passed its second reading in &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ACalgary%20City%20Council"&gt;Calgary City Council&lt;/a&gt; is expected to pass it into law later this year.

Fines would range from $50 for carrying a visible knife or standing on public benches and $300 for urinating or defecating in public. People who spit would face a $100 fine and those who fight in city streets would pay a $250 ticket.

"You have to set the groundwork of expectations — mutual expectations — in order to be able to work well together, live well together," said Ald. Madeline King, a councilor who represents part of Calgary's inner city. "This is the right thing to do — this is a social contract between Calgarians that calls for a minimum amount of respect," he said.

"Unless you have rules, things don’t work so well in terms of living together harmoniously," said Ald. Madeleine King. "It's not targeting the homeless, it's targeting anyone who behaves in this way."

It will come back to council for final approval next week. 

City lawyers have concerns about enforcing some parts of the legislation.

&lt;a href="w%3AMurat%20Kurnaz"&gt;Murat Kurnaz&lt;/a&gt;, a Turk born and raised in Germany, who was held in extrajudicial detention by the United States for five years, described systematic torture while held in the 
&lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay detainment camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;.

Kurnaz alleges he was subjected to electric shocks, waterboarding, the technique of leading a victim to feel he was on the verge of drowning, being shackled to the ceiling for days on end, being denied food, one time for a period of twenty days.

Kurnaz's case first received widespread scrutiny in March of 2005, when his fully classified dossier was accidentally briefly declassified. 

One allegation against Kurnaz was that he had been a friend of a man who killed himself during a suicide bombing mission. However the dossier revealed that his friend, the alleged suicide bomber, was alive and well and living in Germany. The Bremen Prosecutor's office had certified that his friend, who American intelligence analysts had initially alleged was a suicide bomber, was found to be innocent.

Another allegation was that he had traveled with a group of missionaries from the Pakistani missionary group &lt;a href="w%3ATablighi%20Jamaat"&gt;Tablighi Jamaat&lt;/a&gt;. The files submitted on Kurnaz's behalf to his &lt;a href="w%3AAdministrative%20Rewiew%20Board"&gt;Administrative Rewiew Board&lt;/a&gt; by lawyers filing his &lt;a href="w%3AHabeas%20corpus"&gt;writ of habeas corpus&lt;/a&gt; contained three letter from American professors of religious studies, who had studied the Tablighi Jamaat. The letters from these experts were consistent in their description of the Tablighi Jamaat as a large apolitical organization.

Unlike Christian missionary groups the Tablighi Jamaat only worked among fellow muslims. Missions consisted of traveling, in small groups, between mosques in foreign lands. The missionaries would discuss the practice of Islam in their various nations, and the practice of Islam in their host mosques.

An Israeli woman was killed early morning today by a &lt;a href="w%3AQassam%20rocket"&gt;Qassam rocket&lt;/a&gt; launched by &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; fighters from &lt;a href="w%3ABeit%20Hanoun"&gt;Beit Hanoun&lt;/a&gt; in the northern &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;. Rockets were launched at the southern Israeli city of &lt;a href="w%3ASderot"&gt;Sderoth&lt;/a&gt; and several other locations. Two rockets landed in the city, killing a 57-year-old woman and injuring a 24-year-old bodyguard of the Israeli Defense Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAmir%20Peretz"&gt;Amir Peretz&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in the city. Several other people were treated for shock.

The bodyguard lost both legs due to shrapnel wounds and is still in surgery, several hours after the attack.

The &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Al-Quds%20brigades"&gt;Al-Quds Brigades&lt;/a&gt;, military wing of &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt;, took responsibility for the attack, saying they have launched "two sophisticated Quds rockets at a mid-range" as a retaliation for the IDF artillery shelling of Beit Hanoun earlier this month, in which 19 people were killed. &lt;a href="w%3AIzz%20ad-Din%20al-Qassam%20Brigades"&gt;Izz al-Din al-Qassam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;' military wing, also took responsibility for the attack.

IDF officials said today that the attack was carried out from the area around Beit Hanoun cemetery, where large-scale Qassam launching operation is underway.

Another attack occurred hours later, when another rocket landed near several young men, injuring a 17-year-old youth severely and several others lightly. 

With today's attacks, 10 Israelis have been killed by Qassam rockets since 2002 and over 270 injured. Attacks by Israel aimed at Hamas fighters have killed over 400 Palestinians including many civilians, since June this year.

A tsunami alert has been issued by the Japanese Meteorological Agency after a 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck the &lt;a href="w%3AKuril%20islands"&gt;Kuril islands&lt;/a&gt;. The alert warns that a 2 metre high tsunami could hit the Pacific coast of Hokkaido &amp; Honshu 1210 GMT. Coastal residents have been asked to move to higher ground.

The United States Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has warned that the tsunami will hit northern Japan and Russia. 

An official from the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center as said that the tsunami was not expected to hit Hawaii and the West Coast of North and South America. She added that there was a slight chance of it hitting the western &lt;a href="w%3AAleutian%20Islands"&gt;Aleutian Islands&lt;/a&gt;.

The United States Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre warning states indicates the estimated inital tsunami arrival times as follows.

NOTE: ACTUAL ARRIVAL TIMES MAY DIFFER AND THE INITIAL WAVE MAY NOT BE THE LARGEST. THE TIME BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE TSUNAMI WAVES CAN BE FIVE MINUTES TO ONE HOUR. IN CASE OF CONFLICTING INFORMATION... THE
MORE CONSERVATIVE INFORMATION SHOULD BE USED FOR SAFETY.

The anti-globalization &lt;a href="w%3Aculture%20jamming"&gt;culture jamming&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Yes%20Men"&gt;The Yes Men&lt;/a&gt; recently delivered a presentation at a &lt;a href="w%3AWharton%20Business%20School"&gt;Wharton Business School&lt;/a&gt; conference on trade and investment in Africa.

A performance artist, using the name Hanniford Schmidt, pretending to be a WTO representative, announced a new WTO initiative for "full private stewardry of labor" in some parts of Africa. His talk attempted to make clear that this meant slavery.

"This is what free trade's all about," said Schmidt. "It's about the freedom to buy and sell anything—even people."

Schmidt reported that "One conference attendee asked what incentive employers had to remain as stewards once their employees are too old to work or reproduce" but that "there were no other questions from the audience that took issue with Schmidt's proposal."

Wharton Business School placed a notice on the conference site stating that their invitation of Schmidt had been based upon his misrepresentation of himself as a representative of the WTO, and that they do not endorse his views.

A tsunami wave alert for the outer coast of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; has been dropped. It was lifted about three hours after the alert was issued.

The alert was issued at 4:10 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Time%20Zone"&gt;PST&lt;/a&gt; for B.C. north and central coasts to the northern tip of &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Island"&gt;Vancouver Island&lt;/a&gt; and also the west coast of Vancouver Island south to Sombrio Point. It was expected to hit at 9:00 a.m. PST, 12:00 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;ET&lt;/a&gt;.

"That's our latest information - that if a wave was generated it would be hardly noticeable," said Cam Filmer, executive director of Provincial Emergency Planning office.

No impacts are expected from any tsunami wave that might reach B.C.'s outer coast, Emergency officials in British Columbia say.

Recent reports from Japan and Alaska indicate that any wave that might reach coastal B.C. will be very small.

Currently, there are blackouts, heavy rain and high winds throughout the area. 8,000 customers in Sechelt, Whistler, Bowen Island and Quadra Island, B.C. have no power. Winds are up to 100 kilometres an hour in some areas and rainfall amounts of 50 to 110 millimetres, &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironment%20Canada"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt; reports.

Float plane services are cancelled between &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANanaimo%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Nanaimo&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AFerries"&gt;Ferries&lt;/a&gt; are also cancelled on routes linking the mainland to Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands.

The tsunami alert issued for certain areas of Russia and Japan after an 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck near the north coast of Japan have been lifted. While the tsunami alert has been lifted, Japan's Meteorological Agency's web site is still showing watches in affect for most of the eastern Pacific coast of Hokkaido.

A small 40cm (15.7 inches) wave did wash up in some areas of the eastern coast of Japan, but this was nowhere near the 200cm (6.5 feet) wave that had been feared.

The Irish-born left-handed batsman has only played three one-day internationals and one Twenty20 for England, averaging 10.33. 

Joyce was chosen over Owais Shah and Rob Key; who have both had test experience for England, with Rob Key playing for the losing 2002/03 tourists at the last Ashes series in Australia.

Specialist &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Barker"&gt;James Barker&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Army"&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt; soldier in the &lt;a href="w%3A502nd%20Infantry%20Regiment"&gt;502nd Infantry Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, pleaded guilty to raping a 14 year old Iraqi girl before murdering her and her family and was sentenced to life in prison. 

Barker could face up to 90 years in jail, but is eligible for parole in 20 years. 
The incident took place in the town of Mahmudiyah, south of Baghdad in March, 2006. Five soldiers are facing charges in connection with the rape-slayings, which sparked outrage in Iraq, and led Iraqi leaders to call for a review of the immunity from prosecution given to coalition forces operating in Iraq.

Baker testified in detail about what had taken place, which led to the court-martial proceedings against three other soldiers, Pfc. Jesse Spielman, Sgt. Paul Cortez, and Pfc. Bryan Howard. A fifth soldier, &lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20D.%20Green"&gt;Steven D. Green&lt;/a&gt; , who is no longer in military service, faces trial in a civilian court in Kentucky.

<h1>U.S. Airways makes bid on Delta</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=U.S.%20Airways%20makes%20bid%20on%20Delta&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
In an unexpected move, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Airways"&gt;US Airways&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has placed a $8 billion bid for &lt;a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines"&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt; in the morning of November 15, 2006, rallying the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which closed at 12,251.71, a record high. 

The offer to buy Delta once the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -based airline emerges from &lt;a href="bankruptcy"&gt;bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; protection by the middle of 2007 would give Delta's unsecured creditors &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;4 billion in cash and 78.5 million shares of US Airways stock. Delta has yet to file its own plan of reorganization. 

If completed, the deal would combine two of the oldest and most storied airlines in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Delta started as a crop duster in the 1920s and grew to make its base at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta-Hartsfield"&gt;Atlanta-Hartsfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the nation's largest airport. US Air started as a mail carrier in the 1930s and has gone through several mergers and two bankruptcies.

"Consumers will have more choice and more reach, and a carrier that has a cost structure of a low-fare carrier," US Air CEO &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADoug%20Parker"&gt;Doug Parker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said in a phone interview. 

The last airline deal of this magnitude, United Airline's proposed purchase of US Airways, was blocked by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Justice%20Department"&gt;Justice Department&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aantitrust"&gt;antitrust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; grounds in 2001, just before the &lt;a href="9/11"&gt;Sept. 11 terrorist attack&lt;/a&gt;.

Management of Delta have not endorsed the deal, stating they wish to prevail as independent. On Wall Street, however, US Air (up $6.64 to $57.57) investors welcomed the proposal, sending the carrier's stock soaring more than 12 percent in midday &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;New York Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; trading. Investors also were pleased with Delta, with shares soaring 19 percent but then going back to modest gains. If the deal is completed the airline would operate under the name of Delta but nothing is set in stone.

&lt;a href="Jack%20Abramoff"&gt;Jack Abramoff&lt;/a&gt;, the disgraced ex-lobbyist began his six year prison sentence today. Abramoff himself pled guilty on January 3, to three criminal felony counts in a &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; federal court related to the defrauding of American Indian tribes and corruption of public officials. The following day he pled guilty to two criminal felony counts in a separate federal court, in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , related to his fraudulent dealings with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASunCruz%20Casinos"&gt;SunCruz Casinos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

On March 29, he was sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution of more than $21 million. His prison sentence was the minimum permitted under a plea bargain with federal prosecutors. Abramoff arrived at about 6:30 a.m. ET at a prison facility in western Maryland and began serving a nearly six-year prison sentence for a fraudulent deal to buy a fleet of casino ships in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. The camp is all male.

Stephen Finger, executive assistant at the prison, said all inmates work while there. Incoming inmates such as Abramoff typically are assigned to jobs such as food service work. Finger said that inmates can work their way up from low-level jobs paying 12 cents an hour to better positions paying up to 40 cents an hour.

Abramoff has ties to many Republican officials including former Representative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Ney"&gt;Bob Ney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , two of former Representative &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt;'s Aides, Senator &lt;a href="Conrad%20Burns"&gt;Conrad Burns&lt;/a&gt; (lost on Election Day) and Representative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Doolittle"&gt;John Doolittle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Sixteen-year-old student Ang Chuang Yang of Singapore has earned a place in the record books, thanks to his fast thumbs.

Yang typed a 160-character SMS message in just 41.52 seconds, beating the previous record by seven-tenths of a second. The student was competing in a competition organized by &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore%20Telecoms"&gt;SingTel&lt;/a&gt;.

The record was first set by 18-year-old Ben Cook of Utah, two years ago. He soon lost the record to a girl in Asia, then won it back last July, "significantly besting his own previous typing speed", says the website ♡❤impulse♡❤.

Each record is set by typing a standard text chosen by &lt;a href="w%3AGuinness%20World%20Records"&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt;, the organization to which the record has been submitted. The message reads: "The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human."

He claims his secret is using a phone with a larger keypad. Speech-to-text software recently introduced by mobile company Nuance is not allowed for use under Guinness rules.

&lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%20University"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Bollinger"&gt;Lee Bollinger&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday jokingly named &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; to a professorship. 

In opening remarks at the Kraft Program Series, "Challenges of New Democracies," he said that "the last time he was here I said that 'one more lecture,' and he'd be up for tenure. So, this is it. Today we welcome professor Bill Clinton." 

Mr. Clinton and former Czech President &lt;a href="w%3AV%C3%A1clav%20Havel"&gt;Václav Havel&lt;/a&gt; were guest lecturers at the &lt;a href="w%3AMorningside%20Heights%2C%20Manhattan"&gt;Morningside Heights&lt;/a&gt; campus. Havel is midway through a seven week writing residency at Columbia. 

Both nations former leaders spoke about the challenges they faced during their times in office in order to bring the former &lt;a href="w%3AWarsaw%20Pact"&gt;Warsaw Pact&lt;/a&gt; countries into the West. 

Havel mentioned that no one anticipated the rise of criminal mafias in the post-communist period, and that he and other dissidents imaged a swift transition from communism to democracy. He cited &lt;a href="w%3ACzechoslovakia"&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;'s 1948 destruction of civil society as a significant delay.

Clinton urged the United States to use its international economic power to improve the world. 

Citing an even distribution of "intelligence and ability... throughout the world," with India and China's enormous population, he said that it's only a matter of time when "other people get their act together" and "have more people than we do" when, "as a nation, we won't be dominant." 

Acknowledging increasing American reliance upon Chinese economic growth, Clinton said the Chinese government will shortly have "a trillion dollars in cash reserves" while the United States has "a combined annual budget and trade deficit of a trillion dollars." 

Mentioning the Bush administration's tax cut given to him and others in his income tax class, he said that the United States "had to borrow money from (the Chinese government) to pay for my tax cut." 

He also suggested that increasing American foreign aid to 0.7% of the U.S.'s $11 trillion Gross Domestic Product aid through cuts in the Department of Defense budget would "create a world with more partners and fewer adversaries."

Mr. Bollinger also mentioned the war in Iraq. 

Criticizing a "dubious construction of a very vaguely identified threat of &lt;a href="w%3AWeapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;WMDs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;," Mr. Havel questioned why planners failed to anticipate civil instability after initial combat operations. 

Mr. Clinton declined comment citing his recent testimony before the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Study%20Group"&gt;Baker-Hamilton Commission&lt;/a&gt; and his wife Hillary's position as &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asenator"&gt;senator&lt;/a&gt;. He added, however, that "whatever she says, I'm for." 

He acknowledged that it is an international best interest policy if Iraq "held together rather than falling apart, we would be better off if it had some measure of security and couldn't become a base for terrorist operations."

Currently, there are blackouts, heavy rain, and high winds in British Columbia. Over 220,000 &lt;a href="w%3ABC%20Hydro"&gt;BC Hydro&lt;/a&gt; customers have no power. Buildings have already collapsed and trees have been knowed down. Five Vancouver rivers were in danger of flooding, which rain fell at 10 mm an hour for more than six hours at midday.

The steel frame of a four-storey building under construction in &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; collapsed. Construction workers escaped injury, luckily they were on a coffee break at the time of the incident. The steel frame crushed cars in a parking lot and missed a truck driver.

Citizens had to evacuate a subdivision of 30 homes. The winds smashed trees into houses in &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Vancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;West Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;.

"We have some real fears here with electrical problems," said Captain Rob Jones Cook of the Vancouver Fire Department. "This is impinging on electrical poles and lamp standards. We also have hydro bus lines running down two sides of the building." The Vancouver Fire Department says they have no idea as to why the building collapsed.

Winds are gusting at more than 100 kilometres an hour (62 mph) in some areas and rainfall amounts of 50 to 130 millimetres.

According BC Hydro spokeswoman Elisha Moreno, the hardest-hit areas are Vancouver, Surrey, Langley, Abbotsford and Mission, B.C. "We're trying to be optimistic and hoping it's by end of day today, but there may very well be customers that are into the early-morning hours before restoration," Moreno said.

Extensive &lt;a href="w%3AFerry"&gt;ferry&lt;/a&gt; cancellations, road closures, and massive power outages are in effect until the storm ends.

The &lt;a href="RCMP"&gt;RCMP&lt;/a&gt; have advised people to stay home and off the highway.

The same heavy weather has also affected nearby Washington State, USA.

According to New Zealand doctor, Doctor Glenn Twentyman from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Department%20of%20Child%2C%20Youth%20and%20Family%20Services"&gt;Child, Youth and Family Services&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AWiri"&gt;Wiri, South Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Ahoodie"&gt;hoodies&lt;/a&gt; can be a health risk because they block sunlight which causes a vitamin D deficiency, thus weak bones and low energy.

Dr Twentyman said: "It's the hoodies and the hats and the downward glance of the teenagers, shading your face all the time."

Dr Twentyman said that every young person that he had tested showed a deficiency of vitamin D. Vitamin D helps vital minerals to be absorbed into the bones. Vitamin D is given to our body from the sun. "A lot of these kids stay away from sunshine. They don't hang out at the beach or in the bush. Some are into drugs and alcohol and a lot of it is indoor activity and night-time activity. They sleep during the day. They are wearing those hoods and literally they don't get out in the sun."

Even though vitamin D is usually absorbed through sun it can also be found in: fatty fish, liver, eggs, full fat milk and butter.

There is an increase in reports of vitamin D deficiency in Oceania. This is most likely because of people trying to cover up because of the higher risk of getting skin cancer due to the ozone hole over New Zealand. His comments come as evidence mounts of increasing vitamin D deficiency in Australasia, partly caused by covering up to avoid skin cancer. Also one student from Tangaroa College, Vincent Wesche, said that he wears a hoodie because "I don't want to lose my hair," also referring to rugby player, &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Spencer"&gt;Carlos Spencer&lt;/a&gt;, "Carlos Spencer is starting to lose his hair from the sun."

Doctor Cameron Grant, from Starship hospital in Auckland, said that he had done a study for four years which found that infants living in Auckland did have a deficiency of vitamin D. "We know that vitamin D deficiency is a health issue in New Zealand. We know that people who are at risk of vitamin D deficiency are for example groups who keep themselves clothed and keep themselves indoors for religious reasons ... so his idea is not an unreasonable one."
Another study also showed that 87% of pregnant woman living in Wellington were vitamin D deficient.

Dr Twentyman said that the people who are most likely to have a vitamin D deficiency are "depressed people and the elderly, such as those kept indoors in rest homes all day."

Her Majesty &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%20Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;Duke of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; are set to visit the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in May 2007 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Jamestown%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Jamestown Settlement&lt;/a&gt;.

This will be Her Majesty’s fourth State Visit to the United States. 

Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh welcomed President and Mrs. Bush on a State Visit to the United Kingdom at &lt;a href="w%3ABuckingham%20Palace"&gt;Buckingham Palace&lt;/a&gt; in November 2003 – during that visit, Her Majesty paid tribute to the 'special relationship' between the United Kingdom and the United States.

A statement released by the White House read:

"Laura and I welcome Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness, Prince Philip, The Duke of Edinburgh, for a State Visit in May 2007 to celebrate the 400th Anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement. 

"The United States and the United Kingdom enjoy an extraordinary friendship that is sustained by deep historical and cultural ties and a commitment to defend freedom around the world. We look forward to Her Majesty's State Visit as an occasion to celebrate these enduring bonds."

The Queen herself mentioned the upcoming visit in this week's &lt;a href="w%3ASpeech%20from%20the%20Throne"&gt;Speech from the Throne&lt;/a&gt; during the British State Opening of Parliament.

"The Duke of Edinburgh and I look forward to our State Visit to the United States of America in May 2007 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Jamestown Settlement."

&lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; officials coordinating the ongoing Jamestown commemoration have scheduled an America's Anniversary Weekend event on and near Jamestown May 11, 12, and 13. 

Jamestown, the first British settlement of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, was established in the name of His Majesty, &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20I%20of%20England"&gt;King James I of England&lt;/a&gt;.

Incumbent President &lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Kabila"&gt;Joseph Kabila&lt;/a&gt; has been declared the winner of the 2006 Presidential elections by the &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20Electoral%20Commission"&gt;Independent Electoral Commission&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;. 

Chairperson of the electoral commission, Apollinaire Malu Malu, announced that Kabila polled 58 percent of the vote to his rival &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Pierre%20Bemba"&gt;Jean-Pierre Bemba&lt;/a&gt;'s 42 percent, in the run-off vote held on October 29. 

Kabila has called for calm following the announcement by the election commission. 

Bemba has released a statement saying he does not accept the declared election result. Bemba and his supporters have previously disputed the provisional results announced by the commission. 

Kabila is the world's youngest head of state, getting the title as leader of Congo in 2001, after his father, Laurent-Desiré Kabila was assassinated in 2001. 

Election officials have rejected claims of fraud. International observers monitoring the polls have said that despite some problems, the polling was largely free and fair. 

Kinshasa is tense amidst fears that violence between the two leaders' armed supporters may break out. The U.N. peacekeeping force has stepped up security, deploying tanks on the streets of the capital.

Soldiers told residents in the area to get out of their homes after they noticed several armed men in a nearby wooded area. The soldiers then asked for air support, which killed nine of the insurgents. The insurgents were wearing high explosives, say the soldiers. 

Nine other suspected insurgents were arrested in the raid.

Oscar-winner &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAngelina%20Jolie"&gt;Angelina Jolie&lt;/a&gt; in a recent interview with the press acknowledged that playing slain journalist &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ADaniel%20Pearl"&gt;Daniel Pearl&lt;/a&gt;'s wife in the new movie, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Mighty%20Heart"&gt;A Mighty Heart&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, was a challenge in itself as she has to portray her strength amid the loss of her husband. Jolie said she wants to make the world understand this woman and her family.

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ADan%20Futterman"&gt;Dan Futterman&lt;/a&gt; portrays Pearl and Jolie plays &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMariane%20Pearl"&gt;Mariane Pearl&lt;/a&gt; who was kidnapped and murdered in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in 2002. He was on a research assignment on Islamic militants in the aftermath of the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt;.

"We need to tell the story of Daniel Pearl and the reason we are making this film is because it's very important to have a dialogue between the two cultures," Jolie told an Indian daily on Thursday in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. Jolie arrived in India last month to begin work on filming portions of the movie there. 

Due to security concerns this movie could not be filmed in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AKarachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and its venue was shifted to western &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; cities of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3APune"&gt;Pune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;. This movie is produced by &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABrad%20Pitt"&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/a&gt; who is also Jolie's partner.

Jolie is most famous for her roles in ♡❤Girl, Interrupted♡❤ for which she won an Oscar, and ♡❤Lara Croft: Tomb Raider♡❤, the 2001 blockbuster.

The flag-lowering ceremony at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWagah"&gt;Wagah crossing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; between &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, known for the aggressive and hostile manner in which it is carried out, has become more peaceful; at least on the Indian side so far.

To cries of ♡❤Pakistan Zindabad♡❤ (Long live Pakistan) and ♡❤Jai Hind♡❤ (Long live India) from the audience the two Border guards detachments at the Wagah gate have entertained visitors each evening. With warrior-like stamping and gesturing, they perform the ritual of “beating the retreat” (the lowering the colours) on their respective sides of the Border and closing the gates for the night. 

Until now, the ceremony has been performed symmetrically by the two detachments, but the aggression has been ameliorated by (very cursory) handshakes by the two duty officers.

India has announced that on the Indian side, at least, the tone will be much less aggressive in future. It has yet to be seen if Pakistan will follow suit.

&lt;a href="Nancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; was chosen by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Democrats&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; to take the title and role of House Speaker on Thursday. Unanimously chosen, Pelosi will be the first woman Speaker in US history. 

While calling for unity within the Democratic party as the party votes as to who gains leadership positions within the House and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the first time in 12 years. Within moments of being officially chosen Speaker-Elect she pushed forward her nomination of Representative John Murtha for the No. 2 post in the House &amp;mdash; majority leader. Voting is now going on in this contested race between Murtha and Representative Steny Hoyer, the current Democratic Party second-in-command.

Pelosi takes the position in January, taking over for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Hastert"&gt;Dennis Hastert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Hastert confirmed that he would not seek election as House Minority Leader in 2007.

Officials on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; island of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMayotte"&gt;Mayotte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said that a &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;n vessel they searched today had no illegal cargo.

The ship was searched by &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACustoms"&gt;Customs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to enforce &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20sanctions"&gt;sanctions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; imposed by an October 14 resolution of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;.

The ship was searched at the small French island of Mayotte. The BBC reports that this may be the first search of a North Korean vessel under the new sanctions regime.

Touching down at 6:30 a.m.(EST) this morning in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, a tornado has killed eight people. Some mobile homes exploded, while others were moved off their foundations, according to Bob High, a reporter for the ♡❤News Reporter♡❤ newspaper. Strong winds threw one couple from their home into the neighbor's yard, he added.

Several people are reported to be missing and as many as 200 emergency services people, along with trained dogs, are currently searching for them. Fears are that some may be trapped under the rubble.

Red Cross teams are being assembled. They will enter the area as soon as Columbus County Emergency Services deem it is safe.

As of 12:32 p.m.(EST), there are still tornado warnings active in the area.

The storm has left thousands without power.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
A proposed hotel that was supposed to be built at the corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo, New York is apparently off the table. The former proposal was going to be called The Elmwood Village Hotel and would have consisted of 72 rooms and cost between $7 to $10 million &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; dollars to build. 

Nearly an hour later the men replaced the sign with a different and unexpected sign: "For Sale: 5 commercial parcels and 1 carriage house, By: Owner." Those 5 "parcels" are 1109-1121 Elmwood and 999 Forest Avenue, which is located in an illegal alley, according to the City of Buffalo, behind the 5 other properties on Elmwood. Hans Mobius owns all properties named in the sale.

Sam Savarino, CEO of Savarino Companies never owned the properties and has repeatadly told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ in exclusive interviews that he still had a "contract to buy the properties" and on October 2, 2006 told ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ in an exclusive interview that he "extended" the "agreement to purchase the property[s] and will have it under contract for what we hope is a sufficient period of time."

"He [Mobius] is undoubtedly concerned because he has lost some tenants and is a bit impatient. I think he has properly portrayed the situation," said Savarino in an exclusive interview with ♡❤Wikinews♡❤.

Savarino also says that there may be "legal issues" to work out now, before anything else can move forward, regarding the proposal.

"There are some legal complexities that must be sorted out before anything can happen there," added Savarino.

Nancy Pollina, owner of Don Apparel which was located at 1109 Elmwood, but closed on October 14, 2006 considers this a possible "victory" in regards to the lawsuit filed against the hotel to stop it from being built, alleging that several laws were broken, including not performing an Environmental Impact Study before the proposal was approved by the city, during its approval and the proposal was "rushed." Patricia Morris, who operates Don Apparel with Pollina, Angeline Genovese and Evelyn Bencinich, owners of residences on Granger Place which abut the rear of the proposed site, Nina Freudenheim, a resident of nearby Penhurst Park, and Sandra Girage, the owner of a two-family residence on Forest Avenue less than a hundred feet from the proposed hotel's sole entrance and exit driveway, were also plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They filed the suit with a lawyer representing them, Arthur J. Giacalone, on April 25, 2006 in New York State Supreme Court, but the case has never gone to a courtroom.

Giacalone believes that a press release issued in July regarding the project was nothing but a statement to "save face," but that the placement of the for sale sign might be a way of convincing Savarino to speed up the sale of the properties.

"I thought all along that Savarino’s July press release might be no more than an effort to save face. But we have no way of knowing. Similarly, Mobius might have put the for-sale sign up in an attempt to pressure Savarino into closing the deal. There’s no way to tell," said Giacalone in an exclusive interview with ♡❤Wikinews.♡❤

In regards to the lawsuit, Giacalone thinks it may now be in "limbo."

"The lawsuit still sits in limbo," added Giacalone.

Friedman won the &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize%20in%20Economics"&gt;Nobel Prize in Economics&lt;/a&gt; in 1976 and essentially defined the theory of &lt;a href="w%3AMonetarism"&gt;Monetarism&lt;/a&gt;. He served on U.S. President Reagan's Economic Policy Advisory Board and significantly influenced post-WWII economic policy in the U.S.

He was a leading figure in the &lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20school%20%28economics%29"&gt;Chicago school&lt;/a&gt; of economics.

With the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20municipal%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;2006 Ontario municipal elections&lt;/a&gt; out of the way since Monday, the next scheduled for 2010, one would think campaigning was over. However, &lt;a href="w%3ABrampton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Brampton&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ASusan%20Fennell"&gt;Susan Fennell&lt;/a&gt; already has two competitors aiming to take her down in four years time.

Her first two announced competitors are set to complete: &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20R.%20A.%20Moulton"&gt;John R. A. Moulton&lt;/a&gt;, who finished third in the last election, and political newcomer &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Argyll"&gt;Tom Argyll&lt;/a&gt;.

When asked by Wikinews for general comments about the election, Moulton replied "I will be back!!!!" 

Argall, who pens under the self-described "pretentious" pen name of T. Gregory Argall, announced his intentions after asking candidates for information, and writing about this experience on website ♡❤The Brampton News♡❤.

"This is no longer just a study in sociology. This not simply a game of "can-I-get-elected?" It is a serious undertaking and I will follow through if elected," Argall says on his campaign MySpace account. "I was born in Brampton and I have lived here all my life. This city is important to me."

Neither candidate can spend money on campaigning, nor accept donations, until registered for their shot at the top job until the city begins accepting submissions in 2010. This is believed to be the earliest any would-be Brampton mayoral candidate has stated their intention, due to the fact the span between previous municipal elections was two, then three years.

Moulton received 5.9% of the vote, for third place. &lt;a href="w%3ASunny%20Gandhi"&gt;Sunny Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmjid%20Iqbal"&gt;Amjid Iqbal&lt;/a&gt; both received fewer votes, while front runners Susan Fennell and Raj Sharda took 74.8% and 14.1% respectively. Sharda had been endorsed by the ♡❤Toronto Star♡❤ newspaper.

Moulton's message also stated that "We can not put the environment on the back burner / We have to react now!!!"

An alleged Russian spy was arrested in &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, having threatened national security. The man is identified as a Russian spy and has been living under a false name. 

As he prepared to board a plane out of Canada, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%20Border%20Services"&gt;Canada Border Services&lt;/a&gt; agents took the man into custody at &lt;a href="w%3AMontr%C3%A9al-Pierre%20Elliott%20Trudeau%20International%20Airport"&gt;Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal on Tuesday. Public Safety Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStockwell%20Day"&gt;Stockwell Day&lt;/a&gt; and Immigration Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMonte%20Solberg"&gt;Monte Solberg&lt;/a&gt; signed the document that authorized the man's arrest. 

This document is called the &lt;a href="w%3ASecurity%20certificate"&gt;national security certificate&lt;/a&gt; and is rarely used. The certificate alerts Ottawa about possible threats to the country. The ministers of immigration and public safety are obliged to sign the national security certificate.

"The government's most important duty is to ensure the security of all Canadians. A security certificate has been issued ... against a foreign national. He is now in custody in Montreal," said Melissa Leclerc, spokeswoman for Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day. "A foreign national alleging to be a Canadian citizen named Paul William Hampel was arrested in Montreal after a national security certificate under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was issued against him."

The man came to Canada several years ago with the name of Paul William Hampel, and is now reported to be false. Officials at the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Service"&gt;Canadian Security Intelligence Service&lt;/a&gt; (CSIS) are working on identifying the man who entered Canada years ago.

"He is now in custody in Montreal. This is not a counter-terrorism case. More information will become available as the Federal Court process unfolds. Any speculation about the individual's other nationality is premature at this point," Barbara Campion, a spokesperson for CSIS.

Ottawa believed the man had been "engaging in an act of espionage or an act of subversion," and "belonged to an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages."

"I don't think we're going to get the most intimate of details, no, not at all," he told CTV Montreal...We'll see a public version of the allegations that will be released by the federal court judge who is going to be responsible for reviewing the basis upon which cabinet will have declared this individual subject to a security certificate. beyond that, though, we may see things settle more quietly between governments," said David Harris, former chief of strategic planning at CSIS.

"There are also influence operations where countries might try to influence their expatriates and émigré communities in Canada. Beyond that, there is a real appetite building among many countries for technological secrets," he said. "They can be of use to industries of the sponsoring nations and these things can have values in the billions for the economies of those countries undertaking these operations."

Reports say the man's methods in Canada matched the techniques used by the Russian intelligence agency's Directorate S, which runs the Russian spy network.

Twenty people since 1991 have been charged under the Security Certificate legislation in Canada. The last time it was used was in 2003.

The court hearing for the man being held in Montreal will be on Wednesday. It is still unclear if the hearing will be in Ottawa, the nations capital, or in Montreal. 

More information will be released as the case progresses.

Two elderly women whose &lt;a href="w%3AClosed-circuit%20television"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt; pictures were shown in newspapers across the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday after they were caught on camera stealing a bag at a railway station in &lt;a href="w%3ASunderland"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt; have turned themselves in.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Transport%20Police"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; has announced that women admitted the offence and have received an official caution in a case variously dubbed the "Grey Train Robbery" and "Gran Larceny."

The women contacted police services after the case received major newspaper and media coverage under headlines such as "Nans on the Run" and "Artful Codgers."

A security camera image released by police showed two grey-haired women, in their 60s or 70s, wearing knee-length skirts, white blouses and overcoats at &lt;a href="w%3ASunderland%20station"&gt;Sunderland station&lt;/a&gt;.

Police had appealed for help in finding the women after a student's bag was stolen from a station platform.

"They handed themselves in," police announced in a statement. "They subsequently were interviewed and admitted the offence. Both received police cautions."

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; politician and head of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Future%20New%20Zealand"&gt;United Future&lt;/a&gt; party, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Dunne"&gt;Peter Dunne&lt;/a&gt;, has defended the group of 12 girls from &lt;a href="w%3ASt%20Margaret%27s%20College"&gt;St Margaret's College&lt;/a&gt; who attempted to do an "undie run" through &lt;a href="w%3AChrist%27s%20College%2C%20Canterbury"&gt;Christ's College&lt;/a&gt;. Both schools are located in &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

According to newspaper, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Press"&gt;The Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the 12 &lt;a href="w%3ASixth%20form"&gt;year 13 (seventh form)&lt;/a&gt; girls were stopped by staff who worked for Christ's College when they arrived at the school in their underwear.

It has been reported that the girls' punishment is to banned from the &lt;a href="w%3AProm"&gt;Leavers Dinner&lt;/a&gt; that takes place at the end of the year. Dunne replied to this report by saying: "Let’s put this into perspective. It's simply end of year hijinks. There is no malice involved and in comparison with other activities that teenagers get themselves into, this really is at the low end of the spectrum. I agree that schools need to be vigilant especially as the end of year approaches, however I think they may have gone a little over the top in punishing students for what is traditionally a harmless bit of fun."

Dunne said: "The tradition of undie runs at Christchurch high schools has been going on for many years in good spirits. Such heavy-handedness is political correctness gone mad. It is traditional for Christchurch schools to get up to such antics at this time of year. While the public expects a certain standard of behaviour I would doubt if many people would be offended by such an event as occurred on Monday."

It is said by a person that works for Mr. Dunne that he may have participated in the "undie runs" when he was a teenager.

Simon Leese, principal of Christ's College, said: "Underwear runs were a dangerous practice."

Claudia Wysocki, executive principal of St Margaret's College, did not comment as it is private and only concerns the girls involved, their parents and the school.

Dunne said: "Kids will be kids; if we are unnecessarily pedantic they will inevitably be compelled to rebel in more destructive ways."

&lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; is set to meet with Chinese President &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AAsia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation"&gt;Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation&lt;/a&gt; summit in &lt;a href="w%3AHanoi%2C%20Vietnam"&gt;Hanoi, Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.

Harper arrived in Hanoi at about 7:30 a.m. ET on yesterday.

On Wednesday, the Chinese government proposed the meeting during the APEC conference between the two leaders, the Chinese government withdrew from the meeting right after Harper agreed to it. They said they would signal at the eleventh hour that its president would meet with Mr. Harper. They added that China rejects any criticism of its &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman-rights"&gt;human-rights&lt;/a&gt; situation. 

Harper vowed to speak his mind on human rights issues regardless of Chinese sensibilities. "We'll talk in a frank manner and we won't accept conditions on the subjects of discussion," Harper said.

"I think Canadians want us to promote our trade relations worldwide. We do that. But I don't think Canadians want us to sell out important Canadian values of belief in democracy, freedom and human rights — they don't want us to sell that out to the almighty dollar," said Harper.

"This is not the only incident of the Chinese demanding or asking for a meeting and then declining it once it is accepted and it is a pattern that kind of perplexes us," he said.
China's human rights has been raised by former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; when Hu visited Ottawa last year. Martin said he had a full discussion of human rights with the Chinese president and had raised the cases of &lt;a href="w%3AFalun%20Gong"&gt;10 Falun Gong members&lt;/a&gt;.

"The Chinese government attaches great importance to China-Canada relations," said Jiang Yu, a Beijing foreign affairs spokeswoman. "During the APEC meeting, President Hu Jintao and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper will meet."

Ottawa said it would like to discuss a number of issues, including the case of, &lt;a href="w%3AHuseyincan%20Celil"&gt;Huseyincan Celil&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese-Canadian who is being held in a China prison for allegedly having links to Muslim separatist extremist groups in his native &lt;a href="w%3AXinjiang"&gt;Xinjiang&lt;/a&gt; province.

Ex-&lt;a href="Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATommy%20Thompson"&gt;Tommy Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has decided to launch an exploratory committee early next year to explore a possible 2008 White House bid. Thompson is one of three large Republican candidates to form exploratory committees in the past week. Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;) and Former &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARudolph%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudolph Giuliani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; both have formed committees; Giuliani's has already begun work and McCain's will begin work after the Christmas holiday. 

"I will be forming an exploratory committee for president after the first of the year, and then I will be spending time in &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; and other states across the country," Thompson said in an interview. Thompson went on to say that his experience as a former Wisconsin governor and as health secretary during President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s first presidential term would be valuable assets in what is becoming more crowded and is expected to be quite competitive. 

Other potential Republican candidates include Massachusetts Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Arkansas Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Huckabee"&gt;Mike Huckabee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senators&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Tennessee"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Brownback"&gt;Sam Brownback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Kansas"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, and former &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; Speaker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANewt%20Gingrich"&gt;Newt Gingrich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; Representative &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADuncan%20Hunter"&gt;Duncan Hunter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; already began his run last month.

&lt;a href="w%3AIslamism"&gt;Islamist groups&lt;/a&gt; have vowed large scale protests after &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan's&lt;/a&gt; Parliament amended laws to transfer rape cases from &lt;a href="w%3ASharia"&gt;Sharia&lt;/a&gt; courts to civil courts.

Sharia courts in Pakistan, based on Islamic religious law, try rape cases under "Hudood" laws instituted in 1979. The laws say that a rape victim must herself face adultery charges unless she can produce four Muslim male witnesses to the rape. The maximum sentence for adultery is death by stoning.

The laws are widely condemned by women's and rights groups as an almost impossible burden of proof. Human rights groups have long campaigned for changes to the religious laws. On Wednesday, Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favor of the amendments.

A coalition of Islamic parties, the &lt;a href="w%3AMuttahida%20Majlis-e-Amal"&gt;Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal&lt;/a&gt; (MMA), which forms the Parliamentary opposition, has opposed the changes, saying it encourages "free sex". The MMA says that its members will resign from national and provincial assemblies in protest.

Ninety minutes wasn't long enough to decide the &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Soccer"&gt;Major League Soccer's&lt;/a&gt; 2006 Championship game last Sunday between the &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%20Dynamo"&gt;Houston Dynamo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Revolution"&gt;New England Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of regulation play the score stood at 0-0.

Two 15 minute overtime periods commenced. In the 113th minute Revolution striker &lt;a href="w%3ATaylor%20Twellman"&gt;Taylor Twellman&lt;/a&gt; finally put the ball into the net from 18 meters out, giving New England a 1-0 lead. Minutes later - one commentator mentioned it happened while New England was still celebrating its goal - Houston's &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Ching"&gt;Brian Ching&lt;/a&gt;, with a header assist from &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Mullan"&gt;Brian Mullan&lt;/a&gt;, brought the score back to a tie at 1-1.

Five minutes later the championship game went into a best-of-five penalty kick period.

Making the final score 4-3, Brian Ching made the winning kick that finally gave Houston the 2006 Major League Soccer championship as the record crowd of 22,427 in Frisco's Pizza Hut Park watched.

Rioting erupted in &lt;a href="w%3ATonga"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; today in protest at the slow pace of democratic reform, with rampaging protesters setting fire to buildings and overturning police and government vehicles. The violence erupted two months after the death of the South Pacific nation's conservative king. 

Rioting crowds overturned cars, looted and set fire to shops and offices, and stoned government buildings including the prime minister's office.

"Five or possibly six people appear to have been killed," Australian Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; said.
Downer said the situation was serious, and Australia and New Zealand had troops and police on standby to fly to Tonga, but Tongan authorities have said they can control the situation. 
Chinese-owned shops were being targeted and the police had been powerless to help, he said.
"It's scary," witness Linny Folau told the Matangi Tonga online magazine, saying rioters were jumping and dancing to loud music in a park opposite parliament.
Clouds of black smoke hung over large areas of the normally sleepy capital, including the offices of the company Shoreline, partly owned by King George Tupou V, one witness told Reuters.
The rioting began after parliament went into recess for the year without voting on proposals for sweeping democratic reforms to Tonga's semi-feudal system.

Late on Thursday evening, however, the Tonga-Now website quoted prominent pro-democracy member of parliament Akilisi Pohiva claiming victory and urging demonstrators to stop looting and go home.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; condemned the violence and warned their nationals in Tonga to stay away from large gatherings.
&lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Peters"&gt;Winston Peters&lt;/a&gt; said New Zealand, which has long-standing links with Tonga and a large expatriate Tongan community, would help the island nation to recover from the violence and damage, but for now the issue was a domestic matter.
In August 2005 public servants staged a six-week strike over pay that halted services at hospitals and schools.
There are no universal elections in Tonga, where 10 of the 14 cabinet posts in government are appointed by the monarchy for life. However it appears now that the government has agreed to new elections in 2008 in which a majority of the parliament would be directly elected by popular vote.

When he succeeded his late father in September, King Tupou V signalled some democratic changes.

&lt;a href="UCLA"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; police tasered a student who repeatedly refused to show ID while the officers were making a usual 11:00PM safety sweep of a campus library. &lt;a href="w%3ATaser"&gt;Tasers&lt;/a&gt; are meant to be non-lethal weapons which immobilize people by discharging an electrical charge into their bodies. Their use has been considered controversial.

A statement put out by the University of California, LA police department says that the student, Mostafa Tabatabainejad, 23, was asked to leave multiple times during the incident and refused. It goes on to say that when officers tried to escort him out of the library he continued to refuse to cooperate. 

Some witnesses refute this statement saying that Tabatabainejad had been walking toward the door of the library when police grabbed him.

Police tasered Tabatabainejad multiple times after the student attempted to encourage other students to join him in his act of resistance. This action was caught by another student via a cell phone. The video has been posted to YouTube. Tabatabainejad repeatedly said in the video that he would leave, but they would not let him.

This is the third incident this month where the Los Angeles police department has been taped engaging in controversial behavior.

Acting Chancellor Norman Abrams in a statement promised an investigation saying that the safety of the university students is a paramount concern.

A group of 13 teenage boys raped a 13-year old school girl in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZurich"&gt;Zurich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last weekend, reports the website of the German language newspaper ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A20%20Minuten"&gt;20 Minuten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. The report says that the girl was raped repeatedly and the act was filmed on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amobile%20phone"&gt;mobile phones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Six of the suspects are &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; nationals, two come from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one comes from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , two from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Macedonia"&gt;Republic of Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , one from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADominican%20Republic"&gt;Dominican Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and one from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABosnia%20and%20Hercegovina"&gt;Bosnia and Hercegovina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . All live in Zurich. 

All the suspects were arrested on Thursday. Police secured 3 mobile phones. Police say that securing the phones ensures the movies don't get published on the Internet and cannot spark potential copycat acts.

The alleged act took place in the flat of an 18-year-old colleague of a 15-year-old friend of the victim. The victim and four of the arrested suspects attend the same school Schulhaus Buhnrain in Zurich Seebach.

According to 20 Minuten, the families of the perpetrators have now massively threatened the victim.

Verena Lang Temperli, a school official, told 20 Minuten that this case is a problem of society itself, not a problem of the school.

<h1>Brazilian model dies of anorexia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Brazilian%20model%20dies%20of%20anorexia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAnorexia%20nervosa"&gt;Anorexia nervosa&lt;/a&gt; claimed the life of another model. &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAna%20Carolina%20Reston"&gt;Ana Carolina Reston&lt;/a&gt; was 21 years old when she died on November 14 in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASao%20Paulo"&gt;São Paulo&lt;/a&gt; from a generalized infection caused by anorexia, an eating disorder in which sufferers obsessively deprive themselves of food in pursuit of an ultra-slim look.

She was &lt;nowiki&gt;5'8♡❤&lt;/nowiki&gt; tall and weighed only 88 pounds. Doctors consider this weight normal for a 12-year-old girl who is no more than 5 feet tall. Her mother has revealed to the press that her diet, since the last two months, consisted only of apples and tomatoes.

Reston's death is set to strengthen claims of links between the fashion industry and eating disorders. It comes shortly after one of Europe's most prestigious catwalk shows, in the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMadrid"&gt;Spanish capital&lt;/a&gt;, banned underweight models, using their &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Abody%20mass%20index"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt; as a guide.

It was the death of another model, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ALuisel%20Ramos"&gt;Luisel Ramos&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AUruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; that first cast light on the problem of models starving themselves to achieve "the perfect form". Ramos died of a heart failure during a fashion show.

Anorexia is a common eating disorder in which people strive to get thin because they think that they are overweight.

&lt;a href="w%3AHefei"&gt;HEFEI&lt;/a&gt;, China (Wikinews) After about one week of free access to &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20Wikipedia"&gt;Chinese Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, millions of netizens in mainland &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; found their access blocked once again. All requests for pages on the site are now answered only with the error message "The page cannot be displayed."

According to test results and feedback available so far, everything has been reverted to what it was before mid-October. No direct access to any project page under the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is available, and the keyword "zh.wikipedia.org", which is the URL of Chinese Wikipedia, is a banned search term. Attempts to search for that string in any &lt;a href="w%3Asearch%20engine"&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt; outside mainland China (&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAltaVista"&gt;AltaVista&lt;/a&gt;, etc) results in the blocking of access to that search engine for several minutes.

The Chinese government had lifted its ban on all non-Chinese versions of Wikipedia in mid-October, and the Chinese version on November 12. Whether the five-day partial absence of censorship (with politically sensitive contents still forbidden) was intentional or accidental is still unknown, however it had allowed millions in China to witness the Chinese Wikipedia's attainment of 100,000 entries. Many netizens had expressed their delight on online bulletin boards and chat rooms all over the country.

No reason has been given as to why this happened.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAudit%20Commission"&gt;Audit Commission&lt;/a&gt; has delivered a report that questions the reappointment of &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Storey"&gt;Mike Storey&lt;/a&gt;, the former leader of &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20City%20Council"&gt;Liverpool City Council&lt;/a&gt;. It also brings into question the conduct of his replacement as leader, &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Bradley"&gt;Warren Bradley&lt;/a&gt;.

This follows a report from &lt;a href="w%3AKPMG"&gt;KPMG&lt;/a&gt;, which the council has refused to release. Earlier in 2006 the council was the subject of a series of reports from alleged council insiders via a blog. These allegations have surfaced again on several other blogs.

<h1>Justice Sachar committee says Indian Muslims &quot;lag behind&quot; other communities</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Justice%20Sachar%20committee%20says%20Indian%20Muslims%20%26quot%3Blag%20behind%26quot%3B%20other%20communities&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Justice Rajinder Sachar Committee report states that &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Muslims"&gt;Indian Muslims&lt;/a&gt; are "lagging behind" other religious communities and need to be provided more "equal opportunities". The report, however, remains silent on the issue of &lt;a href="w%3AReservation%20in%20India"&gt;reservations&lt;/a&gt; for Muslims in the workplace and educational institutions. 

The report went on to say that the community is relatively poorer, more illiterate, has lower access to education, lower representation in public and private sector jobs and lower availability of bank credit for self-employment. In urban areas, the report said that Muslims mostly lives in slums characterised by poor municipal infrastructure.

The committee says that the community is "only slightly better off than &lt;a href="w%3AScheduled%20Castes"&gt;Scheduled Castes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AScheduled%20Tribes"&gt;Scheduled Tribes&lt;/a&gt; and worse off than &lt;a href="w%3AOther%20Backward%20Classes"&gt;Other Backward Classes&lt;/a&gt; (OBCs), and in some cases, behind &lt;a href="w%3ADalits"&gt;Dalits&lt;/a&gt;."

The report suggests educational reforms in madrassas, and the allocation of 15% of all government funds to Muslims. 

Justice Sachar, who led the seven-member team, submitted his report to Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AManmohan%20Singh"&gt;Manmohan Singh&lt;/a&gt;, who praised the comprehensive nature of the study and indicated that it would be tabled in the next session of Parliament.

Five contractors, four &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="w%3AAustria"&gt;Austrian&lt;/a&gt;, working for Crescent Security Group were kidnapped in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; after their convoy was attacked and hijacked by militants. At least 2 of the American men have been freed by police officers, but the security guard from Austria, a 25 year-old former soldier, has been killed. His body was found in &lt;a href="w%3ASafwan%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Safwan, Iraq&lt;/a&gt; according to a police officer for the &lt;a href="w%3ABasra%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Basra, Iraq&lt;/a&gt; police force.

"Police were able to free two of the foreigners kidnapped and they are in good health," said the Basra provincial governor, Mohammed al-Waili. 

The men were on their way to &lt;a href="w%3ANassiriya%2C%20Iraq"&gt;Nassiriya, Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and were taking a road that is supposed to be guarded to ensure the safety of convoys traveling in the region.

The fate of the other two missing men is not yet known.

The new &lt;a href="w%3APlayStation%203"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; is getting more people lining up in stores than people walking out. &lt;a href="w%3AEBay"&gt;EBay&lt;/a&gt; has pages full of PlayStation 3s, retailing at US$500-$600, auctioning at about US$3,000 up to US$5,000. The gaming console, which would normally sell for between five to six hundred dollars, sold out in minutes at stores across the US.

Some incidents of violence have been reported. Two gunmen in &lt;a href="w%3APutnam%2C%20Connecticut"&gt;Putnam, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, for example, came up to 15 to 20 people standing outside &lt;a href="w%3AWal-Mart"&gt;Wal-Mart&lt;/a&gt; a little after 3:00 a.m. EST and demanded money. One man resisted and was shot in the chest and shoulder. Police are now searching for the suspects.

EBay is restricting PlayStation 3's to only experienced eBay sellers with high ratings. Only one PS3 can be listed per eBay account. The listing has to include a photo of the pre-order receipt and the seller must guarantee shipment within 30 days starting from the date of purchase.

One individual stood in line for 3 entire days in order to purchase the PS3. He claimed to have bought the game console for $300 and then sold it on Ebay for a grand total of $3000.

Severe rainfall on the 16th of November has led to a water quality warning affecting more than two million people living in the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Vancouver%20Regional%20District"&gt;Greater Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; metropolitan region. Wednesday's storm triggered severe landslides in the region's three water reservoirs, creating sediment levels up to ninety times higher than permitted under federal health standards. The &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Coastal%20Health%20Authority"&gt;Vancouver Coastal Health Authority&lt;/a&gt; issued a warning to residents advising them to boil all water intended for personal consumption. The advisory is mandatory for hospitals, daycares, and other public facilities, and is in effect until further notice. 

The region's Chief Medical Health Officer has advised that tap water not be used for anything. "We know that with turbidity levels this high there is an increased risk of gastrointestinal illness. So people need to be aware of that, although it's their choice," warned Dr. Patricia Daly. "If I'm asked, I'm telling the public: Don't drink the water from the tap at this time. Drink bottled water or boil your water for a full minute." 

Commercial operations were affected as well. Food stores were ordered to turn off produce sprayers used to cool vegetables, and restaurants had to stop serving many food products. Many of Vancouver's hundreds of coffee shops were quiet.

The Greater Vancouver area has received a total of 236.8mm of rain this month. The rainfall record of 350.8mm was set in 1983, according to measurements taken at &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20International%20Airport"&gt;Vancouver International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ABC%20Hydro"&gt;BC Hydro&lt;/a&gt;, the province's primary electrical provider, was busy repairing power and telephone lines blown down in the heavy winds. Over 220,000 customers were left without electricity in the aftermath of the storm, with more rain expected on Sunday.

Renowned &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Michigan"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt; college football coach &lt;a href="w%3ABo%20Schembechler"&gt;Bo Schembechler&lt;/a&gt;, died Friday at the age of 77.

Schembechler collapsed at the studios of WXYZ-TV after taping a TV show on the eve of the Wolverines' No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown with perennial rival &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20State"&gt;Ohio State&lt;/a&gt;. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he died at 11:42 a.m. "The electrical part of the heart was working fine but the mechanical part was not working," said Dr. Shukri David, the head of cardiology at Providence Hospital. "The heart was sending signals to the heart muscle to contract. The muscle was not responding."

Schembechler had a heart attack on the eve of his first Rose Bowl in 1970 and another one in 1987. He had two quadruple heart-bypass operations, and doctors implanted a pacemaker to regulate his heartbeat after he became ill during a taping at WXYZ on Oct. 20.

"This is a tremendous shock and an irreplaceable loss," University of Michigan president Mary Sue Coleman said at a news conference at Providence Hospital in Southfield, where the coach died.

The seven-time &lt;a href="w%3ABig%20Ten"&gt;Big Ten&lt;/a&gt; coach of the year compiled a 194-48-5 record at Michigan from 1969-89. Schembechler's record in 26 years of coaching was 234-65-8.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;New Zealand National party&lt;/a&gt; is rejecting the government's ambitions to build a new stadium on Auckland, New Zealand's waterfront for the 2011 Rugby World Cup final instead it is backing the option of an upgrade of &lt;a href="w%3AEden%20Park"&gt;Eden Park&lt;/a&gt;.

Yesterday, Friday, Member of Parliaments (MP) from the National party met with &lt;a href="w%3ATrevor%20Mallard"&gt;Trevor Mallard&lt;/a&gt;, sports minister, to discuss the possibility of a waterfront stadium but National remain unmoved. Deputy leader, &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Brownlee"&gt;Gerry Brownlee&lt;/a&gt;, said: "If it was a new car I wouldn't buy it."

It was reported that &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Key"&gt;John Key&lt;/a&gt;, Gerry Brownlee, &lt;a href="w%3AKatherine%20Rich"&gt;Katherine Rich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMurray%20McCully"&gt;Murray McCully&lt;/a&gt; were all present at the meeting with Mr Mallard. And all of those MPs threw a lot of questions at Mr Mallard.

Mr Mallard said: "I actually thought it was a very positive meeting. I thought Catherine Rich and John Key's level of understanding increased and their enthusiasm was very positive."

Mr Brownlee said: "The [NZ]$385 million Eden Park costings seemed relatively certain against the $500 million waterfront estimate, where the price would not be known till it's built."

The reason for the debate is because to host the Rugby World Cup the venue which is used for the final game has to have 60,000 seats, all of New Zealand's stadiums are currently under that minimum.

Mr Mallard confirmed that North Harbour Stadium is also being considered as a "very good back-up option." This is mainly because it can begin upgrading of its stadium before Eden Park or the waterfront stadium. "North Harbour could be called on if you ran into problems with the other options," Mr Mallard said, "There are consenting issues there with buildability and there would still be a lot of transport issues getting people there and there's not a lot of infrastructure around it."

The decision of which stadium will be the venue of the grand final of the 2011 Rugby World Cup final will be made this Friday by the Auckland City Council and Auckland Regional Council, which is asking for the public's opinion to help them with their decision. The council's decision is the one the government will go with according to Mr Mallard: "There's no way the Government would override the councils' decisions."

Mr Mallard added: "I love Eden Park, and my gut feeling for a long time was to upgrade it. If you like I've got a romantic attachment, so for me if Aucklanders decide that's their approach I will back them."

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Rugby%20Board"&gt;International Rugby Board&lt;/a&gt; also announced the Rugby World Cup will be played around September. 2011 instead of around the June period.

There are 62 &lt;a href="w%3Acantonments"&gt;cantonments&lt;/a&gt; and 650 military stations in the country, some of which are in disrepair. The new law will ensure that the Army does its bit to prevent other such structures from becoming dilapidated.

One example is the St. Martin's Church which was founded in 1929 by Field Marshall Sir William Birdwood of the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Indian%20Army"&gt;British Indian Army&lt;/a&gt;. The plaster has peeled off the structures cracked walls, and heavy seepage has damaged the dome. The church also serves as a makeshift school-cum-storehouse for local residents.

Conservation Architect Ratish Nanda said the move is significant because it will not only protect heritage in the cantonments but also areas around it, adding that cantonments will "show the way forward". Urban Designer K T Ravindran said, "This law means that areas where we have built heritage will not fall into the hands of open market." 

Some of the main aims of the law are to ensure that:&amp;ndash;
<ul>
BULLET::::- The &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Army"&gt;Indian Army&lt;/a&gt; follows schemes of restricting construction and development plans in the cantonment area.
BULLET::::- Preemptive measures are taken to protect heritage.
BULLET::::- Construction that affects heritage buildings is carried out only after permission is obtained from the Cantonment Board.
BULLET::::- Any construction disfiguring a heritage site can be challenged in a court of law.
BULLET::::- The Cantonment Board conserves and maintains ancient and historical monuments.

The Palestinian group &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt; may stop firing rockets into Israel, following a request to that effect by President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Abbas met leaders of the group and urged them to halt the violence. "Abbas said the truce is a national necessity. We said the truce must be mutual ... and part of a national consensus." said &lt;a href="w%3AKhedr%20Habib"&gt;Khedr Habib&lt;/a&gt;, an Islamic Jihad leader in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;. 

The group's website quoted &lt;a href="w%3AKhaled%20al-Batch"&gt;Khaled al-Batch&lt;/a&gt;, another leader of the group, as saying the proposal was "worth studying." While Islamic Jihad is not the only group to fire rockets across the border, it has repeatedly rejected calls to cease its actions. An Israeli woman was killed by a Qassam rocket in the town of Sderoth three days ago. Over 400 Palestinians, including many civilians, have been killed by attacks since June, which Israel says are aimed at Palestinian fighters.

<h1>Anant Gupta returns after spending 5 days with his abductors</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Anant%20Gupta%20returns%20after%20spending%205%20days%20with%20his%20abductors&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Anant Gupta who was kidnapped from the elite locality of Sector 14, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANoida"&gt;Noida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; has returned home. He was kidnapped on November 13, 2006 and released by his abductors yesterday morning. The police have made an arrest in the city of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;. The other two accused are absconding. The boy claimed that he was kept in a jungle and was treated nicely by the three men. 

At a press conference the police claimed that they had identified the kidnappers within 10 hours of the kidnapping. Police said that the three year old Anant was kept at a house in New Delhi and later shifted to &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMathura"&gt;Mathura&lt;/a&gt;. The kidnappers had threatened the family with dire consequences if their demands were not met. 

A day after insisting that no ransom was paid the police finally admitted that a sum of Rs. 5 million was paid to the criminals. The ransom amount was later recovered from the home of the accused. 

In a fresh twist to the story, the grandfather of the boy told the media that it was an autorickshaw driver who brought his grandson home and not the police. The &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AUttar%20Pradesh"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt; police had claimed that the boy was rescued on Friday by the Special Task Force near the state border.

There were several raids conducted in the western regions of the state and several people were detained for questioning even though there are a few loose ends that need to be bridged. 

This was one of the first instances of kidnapping cases involving an executive of high-profile software company in the recent times. Stories of abduction are common in the states of Uttar Pradesh and &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABihar"&gt;Bihar&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Socialist Ségolène Royal launches campaign for French presidency</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Socialist%20S%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal%20launches%20campaign%20for%20French%20presidency&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Royal is now a leading candidate to succeed Jacques Chirac in May 2007. She was elected yesterday by over 100,000 activists after a moderate, and some say &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Blairite&lt;/a&gt;, campaign.

In the early hours of Friday morning, the result of a vote by members of the &lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Party%20%28France%29"&gt;French Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; (Parti Socialiste, PS) was announced, with centrist &lt;a href="w%3AS%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal"&gt;Ségolène Royal&lt;/a&gt; leading the poll to become their candidate in next year's election for &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20French%20Republic"&gt;President of the Republic&lt;/a&gt;.

While many parties contest the presidential elections, the winner is expected to be an official candidate of one of the two main parties, the Socialists and the conservative &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;Union for a Popular Movement&lt;/a&gt; (UMP). Speaking on French television tonight, &lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande"&gt;François Hollande&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the PS and Royal's partner, announced a party recruitment drive to reinforce Royal's campaign against the larger UMP.
<h4>&amp;ldquo;Ask what you can do for your country&amp;rdquo;</h4>
Royal spent Friday in her home town of &lt;a href="w%3AMelle%2C%20Deux-S%C3%A8vres"&gt;Melle, Deux-Sèvres&lt;/a&gt;, where she addressed the world's press, and spoke with supporters, before returning to Paris. 

The selection has kept columnists and editorial writers busy. In her Friday press conference, she spoke directly to the French people; her words, &amp;ldquo;Gather, mobilise, ask what you can do for your country,&amp;rdquo; reminding John Lichfield (&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Independent"&gt;♡❤The Independent♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, London) of &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. The Manchester ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;Guardian's&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Martin Kettle used Royal's success as an opportunity to criticise &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; for appearing to back &lt;a href="w%3ANicholas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicholas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; of the UMP.

The UMP, the leading conservative party, plans to select its candidate in January. This is the first French presidential campaign where the party candidates are selected by a ballot of the mass membership.

French presidential elections traditionally involve a number of candidates (last elections in 2002 saw the French people choosing between 16 candidates.) One of the questions is now the ability of Royal to unite the French left. Traditionally, parties on the parliamentarian left (MDC, Les Verts, Parti Radical de Gauche, Parti Communiste) have been involved in a number of coalitions, most recently before the 2002 elections. Unity in government does not reflect in the polls as the governing majority was represented by four candidates in 2002: Lionel Jospin (PS), Robert Hue (PC), Noël Mamère (Les Verts), Jean-Pierre Chevènement (MDC). The division of the left in the first round of the elections in 2002 is one of the given explanations for the surprise second round opposing &lt;a href="w%3AJean-Marie%20Le%20Pen"&gt;Jean-Marie Le Pen&lt;/a&gt; (FN) and &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;.

France is a parliamentary democracy, where the President is the Head of State, but independent of both the National Assembly (legislature) and the executive, which is led by the Prime Minister. The presidency is a high profile and influential role, currently filled by conservative-aligned veteran statesman, Jacques Chirac, whose second term expires in May 2007.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Pitt"&gt;Brad Pitt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAngelina%20Jolie"&gt;Angelina Jolie's&lt;/a&gt; bodyguards have been accused of saying racial slurs to parents of an Islamic school in south &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai, India&lt;/a&gt;. The parents have told the media that the bodyguards said "YOU BLOODY INDIANS AND YOU BLOODY MUSLIMS" when they came to pick up their children from the school. The 3 bodyguards were arrested and later released on surety of Rs 25,000.

Brad Pitt appeared in an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ANDTV"&gt;NDTV&lt;/a&gt; and denied all charges on the bodyguards. He said that the bodyguards were fathers too and would never say such a thing. Pitt also said that he would have never even chosen bodyguards who weren't tolerant towards other religions. "I have to say that we are horrified by these allegations," Pitt said in an interview for NDTV, which will broadcast tonight. 

The incident occurred when the gates of the school, in which they were filming, were opened up to allow parents to pick up their children.

Speaking in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKhartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Egeland"&gt;Jan Egeland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, said “this is the moment of truth. We are playing with a powder keg”. This followed disagreement about the role that UN would play in providing a force to help deal with the crisis in &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, retiring &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Secretary%20General"&gt;UN Secretary General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , yesterday announced agreement of African, Arab and European leaders to provide a 20,000 force to supplement the 7,000 &lt;a href="African%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; peacekeepers trying to cope with the situation that had resulted in 240,000 being killed and 2.5 million being displaced during three years of conflict in the western region. 

However, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALam%20Akol"&gt;Lam Akol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;ese foreign minister, said: "What we agreed upon in &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href="African%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; (AU) force assuming full command, while the UN role would be confined to providing technical and logistical assistance to the AU mission." No dates had been agreed for the deployment of the UN forces.

Egeland said that the delay would cause the situation to become infinitely worse and would prevent the ingress of humanitarian aid to the millions affected.

<h3>New violence</h3>

The African Union is reported as saying that Birmaza, a northern village, has been attacked by the Sudanese government troops and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJanjaweed"&gt;Janjaweed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; militia with air support. 70 dead are reported. The Sudan government has denied that it supports the Janjaweed.

<h3>Darfur conflict threatens to spread</h3>

&lt;a href="Chad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APascal%20Yoadimnadji"&gt;Pascal Yoadimnadji&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says that “mercenaries in the pay of the Sudanese” have invaded towns in northeast &lt;a href="Central%20African%20Republic"&gt;Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt;. He said troops would be sent to help the Republic resist these incursions. Sudan continues to deny supporting the mercenaries.

Wednesday at the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Institute%20of%20Physics"&gt;American Institute of Physics&lt;/a&gt; Industrial Physics Forum meeting in San Francisco, a group of researchers proposed new research into an old way, invented by , to transfer power wirelessly. Marin Soljacic and his &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt; colleagues revived an idea which involves a source that creates a short range oscillating field. Nearby circuits that resonate at the frequency of the source absorb some of the energy. The system would operate in much the same way as the coils inside a &lt;a href="w%3Atransformer"&gt;transformer&lt;/a&gt;, except that the researchers believe they can develop sources that transfer energy over much longer distances than is typical in transformers. Technology based on this proposal could mean wireless gadgets such as cell phones and iPods never have to be plugged into a wall outlet. The researchers also propose that it could power micro-robots or other machines that are too small to carry their own batteries. Eventually it might enable electric transportation such as buses to recharge wirelessly through power sources near the roadway. One potential problem with the system could be its inefficiency. Soljacic's calculations show that it is at best 60% efficient.

With the title "Pedder Street Clock Tower" the Chinese edition of Wikipedia has reached its 100,000th article. With this milestone reached the Chinese Wikipedia becomes the 12th largest Wikipedia currently developed, and the second largest Asian language Wikipedia just after its Japanese counterpart.

The Chinese Wikipedia was created in October of 2002 and currently supports about 120,000 users. New articles for this growing encyclopedia are being made at a rate of 200 per day.

The Chinese Wikipedia community has been organized and active even in the face of what could be seen as a challenging environment. The first Chinese Wikimedia Conference, for example, was held in Hong Kong in August 2006. Additionally, Wikimania 2007 will be held in Taipei, Taiwan.

The government of China, however, instituted a year-long ban on the Chinese and English versions of Wikipedia in October of 2005 out of concerns regarding various articles about Tibet, Taiwan, and other subjects. In October, 2006 Beijing unblocked the English version of Wikipedia, and in early November the Chinese version was unblocked as well. Then, on 15 November both versions were again blocked with no warning or explanation.

The aim of the various Wikipedia sites is to provide a high-quality information source in as many languages as possible.

New Zealand's &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Certificate%20of%20Educational%20Achievement"&gt;National Certificate of Educational Achievement&lt;/a&gt; (NCEA) external end of year exams started today. It is expected that "...136,000 people [will be] sitting exams at 405 exam centres..." Bali Haque, deputy chief executive of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Qualifications%20Authority"&gt;New Zealand Qualifications Authority&lt;/a&gt; (NZQA) said.

The exams will finish on December 9.

These exams are also being closely scrutinised because of the past problems with NCEA. "...there will always be some anomalies and unforeseen events, such as the traffic jams and floods of 2005," Mr Haque said, "We are confident that we are prepared for such eventualities." The problems faced in the past include when in 2005 hundreds of English papers were remarked due to a problem with the marking schedule which caused low pass rates. In 2004 a problem with the marking consistency resulted in thousands of students failing scholarships. These problems caused the government to launch an inquiry and this year the education minister, &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Maharey"&gt;Steve Maharey&lt;/a&gt;, said that he is confident nothing will go wrong. Principal of Tawa college, Murray Lucas, said: "I'm quietly confident that it will go reasonably well and that there won't be the problems that were attached to the scholarship exams in 2004, and there will be a great deal more in consistency."

Over 4,500 supervisors will, of course, supervise the 555 exams.

Principals in recent weeks have criticised the NCEA for allowing students to receive credits if the answers are written in "&lt;a href="w%3AShort%20message%20service"&gt;text&lt;/a&gt; (SMS) abbreviations".

&lt;a href="w%3ANintendo"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; has released its newest video game console in North America. Known as the &lt;a href="w%3AWii"&gt;Wii&lt;/a&gt;, the system and games have an MSRP of US$249.99 and US$49.99 respectively. The North American release is to be followed by the December 2nd launch in Japan and the December 8th launch in Europe.

Launched officially at midnight, more than a thousand people gathered in New York's Time Square to be among the first to buy one of the Wii. In contrast to the crowds that have challenged crowd control officials over the last two days in connection with the launch of Sony's &lt;a href="w%3APlaystation%203"&gt;Playstation 3&lt;/a&gt;, the Wii crowds have been much calmer. Many observers attribute this to the fact that Nintendo had more than ten times as many Wii consoles available on launching day than Sony did for their PS3 that had been hounded by part shortages in manufacturing right up to the day of launch.

Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime said that several tough choices had been made in the design of the Wii. The company decided to develop a new way of playing games with revolutionary controllers instead of following the PS3 and the Xbox down the road of stunning graphic and multimedia options. This produced a console with a much talked-about sensor/controller design and the lowest price point of the three major consoles. While not having a DVD player or high-definition TV capabilities, the Wii retails for about $250 while its competitors the Xbox 360 and PS3 retail for about $400 and $600 respectively. 

While the Wii will launch with several games available, one of its advertised advantages is that the new console is largely compatible with older games made for the GameCube, giving the new console an instant and extensive launching library. A GameCube controller will be needed to play GameCube games with the Wii. Several hardware items that GameCube games may be expecting, such as the modem or broadband adapter or the GameBoy player are not supported on the Wii.

Across the country in Los Angeles about 500 people were waiting for the doors to open at Universal City Walk's Game Stop store. Fearing that the Wii introduction might be as contentious as the PS3 debut just a few days ago, the store handed out numbered wristbands to the throng. No problems were reported.

Almost one million people in Vancouver, Canada are still under a boil water advisory. Severe rainfall on the 16th of November led to a water quality warning for the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Vancouver%20Regional%20District"&gt;Greater Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; area's two million residents. The restriction was partially lifted on Friday, but residents of &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABurnaby%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Burnaby&lt;/a&gt;, and three &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Shore%20%28Greater%20Vancouver%29"&gt;North Shore&lt;/a&gt; municipalities are still advised to boil their drinking water due to high &lt;a href="w%3Aturbidity"&gt;turbidity&lt;/a&gt; levels.

A new storm is predicted to hit the region on Sunday, although it is not expected to be as severe. Wednesday's storm triggered landslides in three area water reservoirs, creating sediment levels up to ninety times higher than permitted under federal health standards. Grocery stores, restaurants, and other commercial outlets were also affected by the advisory. Over 210,000 homes were left without electricity as power lines were knocked out. Some residents are still without power.

The advisory is the largest in Canadian history.

Fire crews in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; are racing to contain two fires burning out of control in the &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Mountains%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Blue Mountains&lt;/a&gt; West of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; before an expected worsening of conditions on Tuesday.

The fires which have been burning in the &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Victoria%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Mount Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABlackheath%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Blackheath&lt;/a&gt; since last Sunday have burnt around 2500 hectares of bushland. So far no homes have been under direct threat.

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has forecast strong North-Westerly winds in the area on Tuesday. These winds could fan the fire directly into the towns of Mount Victoria and Blackheath.

In an attempt to contain the fires, fire personnel from the NSW Fire Brigade, Rural Fire Service and the National Parks and Wildlife Service have been undertaking backburning operations over the weekend. The backburning operations have been supported by fourteen aircraft, which have been carrying out waterbombing operations.

As a result of the fire crew's operations, the &lt;a href="w%3ABell%27s%20Line%20of%20Road"&gt;Bell's Line of Road&lt;/a&gt; has been closed, with traffic advised to use the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Western%20Highway"&gt;Great Western Highway&lt;/a&gt;.

Over 1,90,000 students appeared for the &lt;a href="w%3ACommon%20Admission%20Test"&gt;Common Admission Test&lt;/a&gt; (CAT) which was conducted in 23 cities in the country. The test is taken by those seeking admission into the six prestigious &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Institute%20of%20Management"&gt;Indian Institutes of Management&lt;/a&gt; (IIMs) and 80 other top &lt;a href="w%3Abusiness%20school"&gt;management institutes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The test began at 10:30 a.m. (&lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Standard%20Time"&gt;IST&lt;/a&gt;), and the results are expected in the first week of January. 

&lt;a href="w%3AIIM%20Ahmedabad"&gt;IIM-Ahmedabad&lt;/a&gt; is the only institute which has already specified the minimum marks it will take for students to make the cut. There has been a 20% rise in the number of entrants over last year. Students who score over 33% in the written test will be invited to the interview and group discussion rounds of the exam.

BULLET::::- No limit will be set on the number of attempts at the test.
BULLET::::- Graduates need to have at least 50% aggregate to apply.
BULLET::::- Students awaiting their results can sit for the CAT but would need to produce their passing certificates upon admission.

Led by Nizar Rayan, a senior &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; fighter, hundreds of &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; refugees gathered to protect the house of the leader of a militant group in Jabaliya refugee camp in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; and succeeded in thwarting an &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i attack.

As part of their campaign against Palestinian fighters, Israeli forces had warned Mohammedweil Baroud, a commander in the Popular Resistance Committee, that his house would be attacked in 30 minutes time. He was told to take his family out of the house in order to avoid civilian casualties. Instead, he called for help from the local mosque and people swarmed round and over Mr Baroud's house in such numbers as to dissuade the Israelis from making the promised attack.

The Palestinians claimed this to have been the first successful defence of its kind. Palestinian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIsmail%20Haniyeh"&gt;Ismail Haniyeh&lt;/a&gt;, visiting the house, said that people had been driven to this remedy because the UN had refused to defend them. On Friday, the Security Council vetoed a resolution condemning Israeli military action in Gaza. Nizar Rayan promised "We will pay with our lives to protect the houses of the fighters, so they can resist the enemy, assured their homes are being protected".

On November 8, an Israeli shell killed 19 civilians in Beit Hanoun, due to, what the Israelis called, a "technical fault in targeting".

An Israeli spokesman said that Israeli forces differentiate between innocent people and "terrorists" and that they would continue the attacks.

A Palestinian rocket killed an Israeli woman and seriously wounded a man in the town of Sderot on November 15. &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, the Palestinian president has called for a ceasefire by those launching rockets and suicide attacks against Israel and the Palestinian group &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt; is said to be considering this request carefully. Over 400 Palestinians, including many civilians, have been killed since June by attacks, which Israel says are aimed at Palestinian fighters.

According to reports from &lt;a href="w%3AAFP"&gt;Agence France-Press&lt;/a&gt; (AFP), and &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Nation%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; has met with the recently appointed Prime Minister, &lt;a href="Surayud%20Chulanont"&gt;Surayud Chulanont&lt;/a&gt;.

Surayud, appointed by the leaders of the bloodless September 19 coup, outlined the plans of the government to introduce constitutional reforms and political change. According to AFP there had been suggestions that Bush would not meet with Surayud, but the two shook hands cordially and Bush was said to have described the coup which ousted populist &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; as "military intervention".

The US President has been making further use of the opportunities for dialogue at the APEC summit, today saw him catching up with &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n president &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;.

Deputy to the Iraq Health Minister,&lt;a href="w%3A%20Ammar%20al-Saffar"&gt;Ammar al-Saffar&lt;/a&gt;, who lives with his sister in Baghdad's Sunni neighbourhood of Adhamiya, was kidnapped today.

It is reported that six uniformed men and others wearing suits, arrived at Mr Saffer’s home in police cars and pickup trucks and took him off.

As one of the deputies to the Health Minister, Mr Saffer called earlier this year for as much as $8 Billion to restore Iraq’s health services.

On August 9, 2006, Mr Saffar discussed the health situation in Iraq with the BBC. He said that the insurgents were killing doctors and trying to create a brain drain. 100 doctors had been killed “because they were trying to help people and because they were Shia”. He said that there are about 18,000 doctors in Iraq but many have left, while others practice at home rather than at hospitals where they could be better protected. Under Saddam they were not permitted to leave, now there is no restriction. But now there are cash incentives: under Saddam they earned $2-3 a month, now they can earn up to $500 a month. On security, he said that the people blamed the US for the violence because, although they were responsible for security, they left the borders poorly guarded. 

Mr Saffer survived an assassination attempt in June, 2004 when he was fired upon as he left his home. He was uninjured.

Stephen Harper met with Chinese President &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. The fifteen minute conversation at the &lt;a href="w%3AAsia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation"&gt;APEC&lt;/a&gt; summit was not a "very long discussion" and according to Mr. Harper was a "very frank discussion". It occurred just before a gala dinner on Saturday with 21 other world leaders.

Harper raised many issues including the case of Chinese-Canadian, &lt;a href="w%3AHuseyincan%20Celil"&gt;Huseyincan Celil&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese-Canadian who is being held in a China prison for allegedly having links to Muslim separatist extremist groups in his native Xinjiang province. Hu refused the meeting days before due to talks about Harper bringing up China's &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; record. Beijing denied that and said "President Hu Jintao and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper will meet."

"We've had very frank discussions with a wide range of leaders, including although it was not a very long discussion, a very frank discussion with President Hu of China, a distinct impression, if I may say that, that the Chinese aren't used to that from a Canadian government, but I can't speak for them," Harper said at the end of the APEC summit. "I think if you're going to have frank discussions with other leaders, then you know, except obviously for the broad objectives you're trying to pursue, I think the details of those discussions have to be private,"

A Chinese foreign ministry official gave the Canadian media the first details of the meeting. The details were sent by e-mail to Canadian media travelling with him 14 hours later.

"If you run out of private discussions every 10 minutes and give a play-by-play of everything that was said, nobody will have a frank discussion with you," said Harper. "The fact of the matter is that neglecting human rights has not opened a lot of doors either. Obviously we don't think you get anywhere by short changing your values."

"It was quite a brief one," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said.

Harper, 47, on his first trip to Asia, said he "had a good time" at the conference.

UK troops in Kenya killed a white rhino after it allegedly charged at them. 

The ♡❤♡White Rhinoceros♡❤♡* or ♡❤♡Square-lipped rhinoceros♡❤♡ (♡❤Ceratotherium simum♡❤) is one of the five species of &lt;a href="rhinoceros"&gt;rhinoceros&lt;/a&gt; that still exists and is one of the few &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amegafauna"&gt;megafauna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; species left. The White Rhino is under threat from habitat loss and poaching, most recently by an offshoot of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ajanjaweed"&gt;janjaweed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A recent population count in the Congo turned up only 10 rhinos left in the wild, which led conservationists in January 2005 to propose airlifting White Rhinos from Garamba into &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, where their numbers decreased to less than 200*. Although official approval was initially obtained, resentment of foreign interference within the Congo has prevented the airlift from happening as of the beginning of 2006.

The &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, has expressed his continuing support for a 90 day holding period for terror suspects.

Despite the concern expressed by the head of MI5 and the demands from the Metropolitan Police for more powers, there was no mention of new anti-terror legislation in the &lt;a href="w%3ASpeech%20from%20the%20Throne"&gt;Queen’s Speech&lt;/a&gt;.

Yet the Prime Minister still wants to extend the present period for which police can hold a suspect from 28 days to 90 days. Blair stated that he believed that the evidence supported the longer period, and said that proposals would be based on an analysis of recent experience and that legislation could be brought in before Christmas if it was thought necessary. 

Gordon Brown has said that he, too, would support an extension to 90 days were an analysis to show that it was required.

Lord Carlile, responsible for overseeing terrorist legislation, said he expected new laws to be proposed in the new year, but, if an extension of the period of detention without charge was proposed, it would have to be backed with evidence of the need for it, as the Home Secretary had promised. 

Shami Chakrabarti, head of Liberty, the human rights charity, said: "Ninety days is internment - our nightmare but a terrorist recruiter's dream”. She deplored the absence of proposals to use intercept evidence and other means in the pursuit of terrorists.
Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, said that although the extension from 14 to 28 days was justified by experience, he was unaware of any evidence that would support the extension to 90 days. 

The Metropolitan Police had wanted the law to be changed so that interrogation could continue after charges had been made. Lord Goldsmith said of this that there would have to be safeguards to protect prisoners from being bullied by police interrogators, but it might provide an alternative to the extension to 90 days detention period.

Although the Attorney General had, in September, agreed that the admission of intercept evidence in court would be an “important tool in the fight against terrorism”, Home Secretary, John Reid, had rejected the proposal because he had seen no evidence to support its use. The Attorney General now says that ways are being sought to enable phone tapping evidence to be admitted in court without revealing how and where it had been obtained.

Downing Steet refused to comment on Lord Goldsmith's statement.

The Conservative shadow home secretary, David Davis, welcomed Lord Goldsmith’s statement about the 90 day period and said that this justified the stance taken by opponents of the Bill that had resulted in the rejection of the 90 day proposal and the acceptance of 28 days as the maximum period of detention without charge.

&lt;a href="w%3AOtaki%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Otaki&lt;/a&gt;, a small town located in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Island"&gt;North Island of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, has been subject to vandals who have smashed around 70 windows in the local primary school, Otaki Primary School.

The smashed windows resulted in the closure of the primary school today. It is expected that the school will be open tomorrow.

The primary school was not the only property damaged. The police are reporting that the library, memorial hall, law offices, tyre factor, butchery and the citizen's advice bureau were all attacked, with other attacks possible.

The police say that the damage was done on Saturday night. Business owners are still reporting property damage. Sergeant Mark Toms said: "The damage seems to be widespread, and has not been confined to the school. Mr Toms said that they "are following strong leads as to who is responsible for the vandalism."

Wikinews interviews Lawrence Douglas, Professor of Law, Jurisprudence and Social Thought at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmherst%20College"&gt;Amherst College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , on questions of the fairness and credibility of the Saddam Hussein trial, and the purpose, conduct and impact of courts trying international law crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

Prof. Douglas is the author of ♡❤The Memory of Judgment: Making Law and History in the Trials of the Holocaust♡❤ (Yale University Press, 2001), an acclaimed study of war crimes trials. His writing has appeared in venues including the ♡❤Los Angeles Times♡❤, the ♡❤Washington Post♡❤, and ♡❤The New Yorker♡❤, and he is a frequent contributor to the ♡❤Times Literary Supplement♡❤.

<h2>The Dujail trial</h2>
♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: Did Saddam Hussein get a fair trial? 

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: Clearly the trial suffered from numerous and substantial flaws which never would have been tolerated had the trial been staged before an international tribunal, as many human rights observers advocated. All the same, the trial was not a complete sham. The prosecution was able to present strong evidence connecting Saddam to the killings in Dujail. The judges apparently struggled long to weigh the evidence brought against the various defendants (though their compendious written judgment has not yet been made public). So if the Hussein trial failed to live up to the hopes of some that Iraqi jurists would quickly master the rules of the rule of law, it also disappointed the doomsday prognostications of others who foretold a legal catastrophe.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: Saddam is believed to have committed atrocities on a huge scale. Do such crimes merit a fair trial, one with the same standards as that for a "common" crime?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: The magnitude of the crimes should not change our commitment to a fair legal process. This is not to say that the identical rules of evidence that apply in the trial of a "common" criminal must be applied to a spectacular trial of a high-level perpetrator. For example, the Nuremberg and Eichmann trials both permitted hearsay and entertained a more capacious notion of relevance than would have been permitted in a "common" trial. But these unorthodox evidentiary rules did not erode the fairness of the proceedings.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: Saddam's defense lawyers, rights groups and observers have questioned the fairness and validity of this trial. What do you make of the concerns raised by them?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: The fact that the judge who finally took the reins of control, Raouf Rasheed Abdel-Rahman, frequently got into shouting matches with the defendants and suddenly curtailed the calling of defense witnesses certainly did little to contribute to the image of a neutral, even-handed tribunal.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: Some of the issues raised concern matters that were outside the Court's ambit and control (e.g., the murder of three defense team members, the opposition to the use of the death penalty, the effect of the verdict on the continuing violence in the country). Leaving these aside, what do you make of the concerns raised about the Court's own proceedings, its decisions and actions?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: Clearly the Tribunal made all sorts of missteps and questionable moves. It's worth bearing in mind, however, that even the best-intentioned court would have faced staggering problems given the tactics of Saddam and the larger political climate outside of the courtroom. Saddam himself placed the Tribunal in an extremely difficult position. The first presiding judge, Rizgar Mohammed Amin, was faulted for his failure to restrain the defendant, and this failure arguably made the court look impotent. His replacement, Judge Abdel-Rahman was faulted for the opposite reason: for dragging the defendant from the courtroom at the slightest provocation, a strategy that undermined the dignity of the court and its appearance of neutrality. So the court was caught in a difficult position, which was not improved by the periodic news that a member of the defense team had been assassinated. That said, the fact that one of the accused was acquitted is a good sign. At the very least, the judges appeared to have learned the Nuremberg lesson that nothing legitimates the death sentence of an architect of atrocity better than the acquittal of a lackey.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: Have the actions of the Iraqi authorities undermined the fairness or independence of the Tribunal?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: The tribunal was subjected to withering political pressure from the Iraqi government, resulting in the resignation of the first presiding judge and in the withdrawal of a possible replacement. Clearly this kind of political pressure is inappropriate. At the very least it undermines the perception of the tribunal's independence, and matters of perception play an extremely important role in legitimizing the legal process.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: The trial has been criticized by Saddam's defense lawyers as having a "pre-determined verdict". What is the line dividing a trial with a "pre-determined verdict" and a trial where there is a widespread belief that the accused is guilty? Can there be a fair trial in this latter circumstance?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: Clearly the likelihood of a guilty verdict cannot be a measure of the fairness of a trial. If it were, then the strongest cases could be deemed the least fair. It's important, then, to distinguish between the assumption of guilt, as a factual matter, and the presumption of innocence – the legal norm that requires the state to assume the burden of proving guilt, even in cases in which many people may assume that the accused is guilty. The assumption of guilt can never replace the state's obligation to assume the burden of proof. If it does, the trial is a farce.

<h2>International criminal and humanitarian courts</h2>

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: How significant is the Saddam trial to international criminal jurisprudence? Will it impact other trials?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: Taken in tandem with the Milosevic trial (which ended, after more than three years of trial, with the death of the former Yugoslav president in March), the Saddam trial makes clear how difficult it is to control the court behavior of former strongmen. Saddam clearly took a page from Milosevic's playbook, mounting a defense of disruption that continuously challenged the legitimacy of the tribunal. I think prosecutors and judges need to come up with new ways of dealing with such recalcitrant defendants. As a further matter, I suppose the irregularities of the Saddam trial will lead some jurists to strengthen the call for international trials of former dictators; clearly, opponents of the death penalty will likewise petition in favor of relying on international courts to deal with the legacy of atrocious crimes.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: Do international tribunals such as the ones set up to try crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Cambodia... etc do a good job? What have they succeeded in? What problems have they experienced?
♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: We should distinguish between international tribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the hybrid courts that have been constituted in Sierra Leone and now in Cambodia. None of these courts have compiled perfect records, but mostly they have been quite effective. Notwithstanding the missteps and disappointments associated with the Milosevic trial – the former president's death in March cheated the tribunal of the opportunity of ever passing judgment – the ICTY has brought other high level perpetrators to justice and has contributed importantly to the growth of international criminal law. One problem that all these courts have faced are the start-up costs. As ad hoc tribunals, these courts have been created out of nothing, and the cost of building courts, hiring staff, establishing competence has been extraordinarily high. As a permanent institution, the International Criminal Court (ICC) promises to solve some of these problems.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: How effective have national courts and individual countries been in bringing high-level leaders to account for abuses?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: The record is uneven. In the wake of the atrocities of World War II, thousands of domestic trials were staged. The most spectacular of these – the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem in 1961, the Barbie trial in Lyon in 1987 – were enormously important, despite their flaws, in establishing a responsible account of terrible crimes. Other countries have been less successful. The fact that Pol Pot died peacefully without ever having to answer for his crimes is regrettable, indeed, but not entirely unexpected. A country that is still very much in the grips of its traumatic history is hardly in the position to engage in a reckoning with its past in a manner that accords with the rule of law. 

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: How do the two (domestic versus international courts) compare?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: Clearly there are tradeoffs. International trials inevitably arouse resentment in the nations most directly implicated in the commission of the adjudged crimes; international tribunals convey the message that domestic national courts are not up to the task of doing justice. Moreover, as these trials may unfold thousands of miles removed from the site of the crimes, they fail to be organically connected to the communities that should be most involved in the case. Conversely, domestic national courts invite the charge of being insufficiently distanced from the crimes under consideration; these courts thus may be assailed as partisan instruments of victor's justice, or, conversely, as instruments lacking the legal resources and political will to bring perpetrators to justice. If – and it's a big if – we can trust domestic national courts, I think they are to be preferred over international tribunals for the reasons suggested above. International tribunals should be courts of last resort, relied upon in situations in which domestic courts should not be taxed, or cannot be trusted, to deal adequately with the legal legacy of atrocity. 

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: One of the reasons for setting up the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Criminal%20Court"&gt;International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other international courts has been to serve as a deterrent against committing crimes under international humanitarian law; to work around the impunity enjoyed by some leaders in their home countries. How well is this purpose being served?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: I'm not sure I would necessarily associate the goal of deterrence with the goal of ending impunity – that is, I believe it is critical to fight impunity, even if bringing perpetrators to justice appears to do little by the way of deterring other leaders from engaging in atrocious acts. That said, I think it's awfully difficult to measure deterrence inasmuch as it's a negative effect. The fact that atrocities continue to occur around the globe doesn't mean that some potential perpetrators might not have thought twice about engaging in criminal acts.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: In the efforts to secure an end to the conflict between the Ugandan government and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALord%27s%20Resistance%20Army"&gt;Lord's Resistance Army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (LRA) rebels, LRA leaders have demanded that crimes against humanity charges filed against them by the ICC be dropped, as part of the deal. Is there a tension between ensuring justice for the victims of past crimes and preventing/mitigating future suffering? How can such a tension be resolved?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: The problem resists easy solution. Once you indict a head of state as, say, a perpetrator of genocide, it becomes extremely difficult to work to a political solution with that leader. At the same time, the ICC is a legal institution, not a political device, and it does not take its orders from negotiators or other political actors. It would be nice to say that the dilemma is false – that perpetrators of atrocities always reveal themselves to be unreliable, treacherous parties to political settlements – though I'm not sure this is correct. &lt;a href="Muammar%20al-Gaddafi"&gt;Qaddafi&lt;/a&gt;, arguably responsible for crimes against humanity, is now the West's poster boy of the rehabilitated strongman.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: International law tribunals have been criticized for selectively trying certain perpetrators. Does this selectivity make the process any less valid? 

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: Selectivity can be as benign as it is necessary. All criminal trials are selective inasmuch as only a small percentage of those who break the law ever find themselves in the dock at a criminal trial. It is well accepted that trials of organized crime figures will invariably focus on the conduct of a few. Obviously the goal is to go after the leaders of a criminal organization. The ICC has specifically set itself the goal of going after leaders, not underlings. Problems arise when selectivity is the consequence not of an effort to conserve prosecutorial resources, but born of a political calculus. The ICTY, for example, has wisely brought prosecutions against Croats as well as Serbs. Still, some critics have attacked the ICTY for failing to bring charges against NATO nations for the air war over Kosovo and Serbia in 1999. I am not convinced of the merits of this specific critique, but all fair-minded persons must agree that international justice binds the strong as well as the weak.
♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: The International Criminal Court was set up in part to counter this problem, with a promise for "universal justice" Has this attempt at ensuring fairness worked?
♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: By its very terms, the ICC cannot deliver "universal justice," as it has no jurisdiction over crimes committed in a conflict in which neither belligerent is a member of the court. Also, the hope that the court would bind the strong as well as the weak has obviously been frustrated by the Bush administration's concerted efforts to undermine the fledgling body. The one ray of hope here is the fact that Bush did not block the referral of the Darfur crimes to the ICC. The ultimate efficacy and fairness of the ICC will be demonstrated in the years to come.

<h2>Courts and writing history</h2>
♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: You have suggested in your book, ♡❤ The Memory of Judgment♡❤, that the Holocaust trials have a pedagogical value - they document events and serve as a historical record, in addition to serving the cause of justice. How well does a criminal trial capture the history of the events underlying the crimes?
♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: I think it's fair to say that trials are not well equipped at rendering history in its full complexity. What they can do very effectively is use document and testimony to construct a historical account that reaches a huge audience. This account may never match the most nuanced renderings of the past that issue from the pen of the professional historian. But it can establish a baseline of indisputable fact that discredits the apologists of perpetrators and gives the lie to those who would baldly falsify the historical record.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: What does the historical account presented by a judicial process offer that scholarly or journalistic or propagandist accounts don't?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: Certainly trials have the power to galvanize national and international attention in a way that other accounts rarely can. Prosecutors can often call upon extraordinarily powerful tools of discovery for the purposes of accumulating and organizing vast amounts of evidence. Survivors are given the opportunity to present stories of victimization in the form of legally potent evidence. Spectators of the trial – either those present in the courtroom or those who follow the proceeding on television – directly witness the presentation of evidence and testimony. In this way, they become witnesses to the witnesses. 

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: Is the pedagogical purpose served even when the trials are or are seen as, selective and less than fair?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: One of the central pedagogic aims of these trials is to make visible the workings of the rule of law. This is a particularly important goal in transitional societies that historically have lacked a robust commitment to the rule of law. Clearly this aim cannot be realized if the trial is perceived as deeply flawed. As a further matter, the quality of the justice will inevitably influence the way observers perceive the quality of the history presented in the courtroom. A biased proceeding will not be viewed as a neutral forum for the presentation of history.
♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: Many rights and humanitarian groups document abuses and crimes to serve as a record of events. Do trials offer more?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: I think of the documentary work of human rights groups and of trials as complementary. The work compiled by humanitarian groups can make its way into the prosecution's dossier. Conversely, researchers can further mine the archival trove compiled by prosecutors. Yet as I've already mentioned, trials enjoy the power to galvanize national and international attention. One cannot underestimate the drama of seeing a former head of state or a high-level perpetrator standing before his accusers, victims, and judges.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: How about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATruth%20commission"&gt;truth and reconciliation commissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which are usually explicitly charged with the task to record events in addition to punishing those guilty of a crime?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: Again, I see the work of trials and truth commissions as complementary, not antagonistic. Trials are about adjudicating guilt; they issue in the imposition of a coercive sanction. This fixation on fixing guilt and imposing punishment may serve the interests of reconciliation and transition, but that is not its principal purpose. Moreover, because trials assign blame and impose sanctions, it is critical that they be performed fairly. Truth commissions, by contrast, are often explicitly geared toward advancing the goals of reconciliation: they are part of an instrumental calculus that seeks a smooth transition to a more humane political order. Truth commissions may, then, be better suited to the experiences of certain nations than trials. That said, the two are not mutually exclusive and can often work in tandem with one another. As time passes, a nation that, in the interests of stabilizing a fledgling democracy, originally accepted a truth commission may come to see, as its institutions strengthen, the attractions, if not the necessity, of trials, too. 

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: You have written that law has responded to the Holocaust by creating and expanding on the concepts of genocide and crimes against humanity. Are these additions to legal discourse and legal apparatus adequate to handle the events since then, such as the Rwandan genocide, the breakup of Yugoslavia? Do these events show a need for, or did they spawn, a fresh expansion?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: I think we need to distinguish between the substantive crimes that high-level perpetrators stand accused of having committed – e.g., genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes – and the principles of criminal accountability that prosecutors use to organize and prove their case. Here I have in mind concepts such as the "joint criminal enterprise," which has been usefully elaborated by prosecutors at the ICTY to facilitate complex prosecutions of high-level perpetrators. Some have called for the expansion of the substantive crimes to include novel offenses, such as "the crime of atrocity." I, for one, think it counterproductive to proliferate the number of major international crimes; "genocide" and "crimes against humanity" are both clearly enough defined yet capacious enough to embrace the full spectrum of atrocity.

<h2>Back to Saddam's trial</h2>
♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: How well did the Saddam trial fare in writing history?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: The tribunal's written decision is yet to appear, so it's difficult to answer this question. Perhaps more to the point, the trial dealt with a relative minor set of crimes, those pertaining to the reprisal killings of 148 Shias in Dujail in 1982. While such a focus made for a more manageable case for the prosecution, it did not serve the broader interest of demonstrating the full sweep of atrocity perpetrated by Saddam's regime.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: Does the court's record of events really matter? Don't "Iraqis know Saddam's crimes, trial or no trial"?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: I think a court's record of events can make a difference. Though many Germans were aware of the "excesses" of the Nazis, the Nuremberg trial made clear to them the extent and depth of atrocity perpetrated by their leaders. This accounting helped erode whatever residual sympathy the Nazis enjoyed among the German people. Ideally, the Hussein trial would have achieved a similar end. I doubt though that this has happened. Unfortunately, in the minds of many Iraqis, the crimes for which Saddam has been sentenced to death pale in comparison to the violence that grips the Iraqi nation on a daily basis. If anything, a sizeable percentage of the population probably now longs for a strong leader capable of reimposing conditions of security and order.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: Should the trial have been conducted by an international tribunal instead of an Iraqi one?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: Clearly an international tribunal could have avoided some of the more unseemly problems that vexed the Iraqi court. Still, I believe an international court would have been plagued by other problems. As the Milosevic trial made clear, the fact that a trial is conducted before an international tribunal does not guarantee that it is perceived as legitimate or independent – the ICTY was dismissed in Serbia as the lapdog of NATO. And as I mentioned earlier, removing a case to an international court sends the implicit message that the Iraqi legal system is deficient, something guaranteed to breed resentment. And as the Milosevic trial made clear, there is no reason to believe that Saddam would have been more deferential to his international judges than he was to Iraqi jurists.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: There is a possibility that Saddam may be executed without facing trial over other, far more significant crimes such as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAl-Anfal%20Campaign"&gt;Anfal killings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in which an estimated 100,000 people died. How important is it, for serving justice and for establishing a historical record, for Saddam to face trial for the Anfal killings, the repression of the 1991 Shia uprising, and other alleged acts?

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: In August, just as Saddam's first trial was winding down, his second began – this one involving his regime's alleged atrocities committed against Iraqi Kurds during the Anfal military campaign in the late 1980s. Needless to say, this trial involves far more serious crimes than those at issue in the first trial; in terms of the role of the trial as a tool for clarifying a horrific past, this proceeding promises to do far fuller justice to the abominable crimes of Saddam's regime. This fact alone creates a strong case for delaying Saddam's execution until at least the completion of this second trial. Indeed, it would be best to delay his execution until all the crimes of his regime, such as the bloody repression campaign of 1991, can be submitted to legal judgment. Ideally this would serve the interests of history and justice, as Iraqi prosecutors and judges would grow increasingly familiar with conducting trials according to the rule of law.

<h2>International law and the United States</h2>
♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has moved to redefine its rules regarding the treatment of terrorist suspects, combatants and detainees. At the same time, it has sought to reduce judicial, congressional and public scrutiny of the government's conduct in its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWar%20On%20Terror"&gt;War On Terror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Do these moves conflict with the Unites States' obligations under international law?
♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: Two bodies of the United Nations, the Committee against Torture and the Human Rights Committee have concluded that the executive policy of secret detentions violates international treaty obligations. The Military Commissions Act of 2006, passed into law in the end of September, permits the use of evidence against unlawful alien enemy combatants obtained through cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; international law bars such use. From the summer of 2002 until the end of 2004, the executive branch operated under a definition of torture that was absurdly permissive – it made a mockery of both international and domestic law prohibiting the practice of torture. It's fair to say the Bush administration has treated international law not a code of binding norms but as a series of recommendations to be followed as it sees fit.

♡❤♡WN♡❤♡: The outgoing Defense Secretary, &lt;a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; has been sued in Germany for alleged war crimes over the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse"&gt;abuse in Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and allegedly, in the &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay detainment camp&lt;/a&gt;. Under what circumstances will senior commanders or civilian leaders be held responsible for abuse committed under their command? If the German prosecutors do open a case, is the United States or Secretary Rumsfeld obliged to respond or act upon it? 

♡❤♡LD♡❤♡: I think it's fair to say that &lt;a href="Angela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; would be horrified to see a German prosecutor bring forward war crimes charges against Donald Rumsfeld, &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="John%20Yoo"&gt;John Yoo&lt;/a&gt;, and others named in the criminal complaint recently filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights. All the same, German courts have been receptive to exercising universal jurisdiction, so it's not completely unthinkable that a case might move forward – though not to trial. That could not occur in Rumsfeld's absence and there is little chance that the former defense secretary would schedule a flight to Berlin if he feared being seized on arrival. I, for one, am not a fan of the aggressive reliance on universal jurisdiction as a way of achieving global justice – the opportunities for abuse are too great. In this case, Rumsfeld and the Bush administration would decry the entire proceeding as illegitimate and thoroughly politicized. And they would score big points domestically by presenting the Germans' actions as the most emphatic confirmation of the administration's worst fears of international criminal law run amok.

An &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; air strike on a car carrying &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; militants killed two &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20Palestine"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20City"&gt;Gaza City&lt;/a&gt;. 

The attack also injured approximately eight people, including an elderly passerby. Hospital sources say the septuagenarian later succumbed to his wounds. The other victim was a street vendor. Seven other people, including two Hamas militants and two children were also wounded in the attack.

Witnesses say the strike occurred near a mosque in the city's Zeitoun neighborhood as the prayer concluded and worshipers came out. A spokesman for the Israeli military confirmed the attack, but did not provide any further details. 

An &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israeli Defence&lt;/a&gt; spokesman confirmed that &lt;a href="w%3AAmir%20Peretz"&gt;Amir Peretz&lt;/a&gt; had called President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, asking the latter to stop fighters from launching rockets into Israel. "During a telephone conversation, Mr Peretz asked Mr Abbas to exercise his authority to put a stop to the rocket fire," the spokesman said. 

In Gaza City a spokesman for the ruling party, Hamas said that Israel would not be able to stop Palestinian fighters from firing rockets into its territory. 

An Israeli woman was killed when a &lt;a href="w%3AQassam%20rocket"&gt;Qassam rocket&lt;/a&gt; hit the town of Sderoth on the 15 of this month. Over 400 Palestinians, including many civilians have been killed by attacks, which Israel says are aimed at halting the rocket fire which has terrorized Southern Israel since Israel disengaged from the Gaza strip. The rockets have wounded or killed hundreds.

Qatar called an emergency meeting of the General Assembly on Saturday to debate the ceasefire resolution that fell at the Security Council last week on account of a veto by the United States. After some amendment, the General Assembly passed the resolution with a large majority. 156 countries supported, seven opposed and six abstained in the vote. Among those opposing were Israel, the United States and Australia.

The resolution calls on both Israel and Palestine to stop their violent activities: the Palestinian firing of rockets into Israel and the Israeli incursions into Palestinian territory.

The reason given by Ambassador Bolton for opposing the motion was that it served the interests of those “hostile to Israel's inalienable and recognised right to exist”. Attempts to form a party of national unity in Palestine are being thwarted by failure to agree on this point. Although Fatah would acknowledge Israel’s right to exist, Hamas is opposing any such statement.
The UN resolution also instructed the Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to investigate the killing of 19 people by shell fire in Beit Hanoun in Gaza. At least 12 artillery shells landed on the village because, according to the Israelis, of a “tragic mistake”.

Reports are now coming in of a repeat of the “civil defence” measures taken on Saturday by civilians swarming around and over a house targeted for demolition by Israeli military forces. On this occasion, the house is occupied by a senior member of Hamas, the ruling party. It is located in Beit Lahiya in the north of the Gaza strip.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper announced today the sixth change in [[w:Typeface|fount in the paper’s 221 years history, and the introduction of a new [[w:Coat of arms|coat of arms]] in the masthead.

The need for the latest change in fount was prompted by the adoption of a "compact" paper size in 2004. The new fount, Times Modern, replaces Times Classic and, with more letters per line, the paper's head of design, David Driver, writes that it "...allows for more articulation in the process of writing". Readers are assured that the change is "not a reckless impulse but reading conditions for many people have become less leisurely".

The [[w:Masthead (publishing)|masthead]] and [[w:Coat of arms|insignia]] have also been redesigned. The historic problem of depicting the lion in the masthead as fierce is addressed by engraver Ewina Ellis. She told Driver, "It is very difficult to make a facing lion fierce — or even faintly cross. They can weep, grin and hold door-knocker rings quite easily, but in comparison to the unicorn with its horn, goat-beard, spiky ears and flowing mane, their silhouette is lumpen. I pitied the poor engravers who had no more seen a lion than a unicorn."

Vietnamese market sellers plan to open a new chain to compete with other supermarkets. The shops will run primarily in small towns and will offer food and drugs. They are to be opened in the next few years, said Nguyen Duong former chairman of the Prague-based Association of Vietnamese Entrepreneurs. For this purpose, they are buying available vacant shops from &lt;a href="w%3ACzech%20Republic"&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; retail chain &lt;a href="w%3AJednota"&gt;Jednota&lt;/a&gt;. 

So far Vietnamese retailers focus on selling shoes, clothes, and electronics. This is to be changed now. After some time, when the shops will be successfully established, sellers will move from the outside to the inside. of buildings. "Within three to five years [Vietnamese] outdoor markets will disappear completely", Duong said. But it seems the new chain will have a hard time, as the market is getting saturated and even some bigger companies have decided to leave the Czech Republic. Last week Belgium-based retailer, &lt;a href="w%3ADelvita"&gt;Delvita&lt;/a&gt;, sold its supermarket to German Rewe group which will be rebranded to Billa.

Neither the current Vietnamese business activities are without problems. Czech Customs confiscated products worth 50,000,000 CZK (€1,786,000) during the trademark falsification round-up Saturday. The inspection took place simultaneously in Pilsen, Prachatice, Chomutov, and Prague. "This sort of inspection will continue, we have positive experience with actions in the time before Christmas", said a spokesman of the Czech Customs agency.

Leader of New Zealand political party, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20First"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt; and foreign minister, &lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Peters"&gt;Winston Peters&lt;/a&gt; has claimed that he was in possession of the emails stolen from the head of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20party"&gt;New Zealand National party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADoctor%20Don%20Brash"&gt;Doctor Don Brash&lt;/a&gt;. He now claims that his office has destroyed the emails due to mounting legal issues, including an &lt;a href="w%3AInjunction"&gt;injunction&lt;/a&gt; which prohibits the publication of the emails. This happened while Mr. Peters was away.

Dr. Brash said: "Mr. Peters has today admitted being in possession of stolen emails, but now claims that staff destroyed the emails when they found out a police inquiry was underway. And now Mr. Peters is asking the public to accept that he played no part in the decision to destroy this evidence. I find that hard to believe."

However Mr. Peters is claiming the he nor his party has anything to do with stealing the emails, Mr. Peters said: "...I understand the leaker has distributed the emails quite widely, and I can't be held responsible for anyone else's actions. What I can say is that when the police first became involved, a staff decision was made in my absence to destroy any emails we had."

Dr. Brash said: "This shows a serious lack of respect for the legal process by the office of one of our most senior law makers."

Mr. Peters said: "It is time National came clean. The public wants to know what the fuss is all about. If the emails are just about National Party organisation, then no-one will be interested, and New Zealand First has always been clear it would never use the personal stuff."

"[Mr. Peters is] saying that his staff didn't bother to consult him before destroying material that their leader had bragged about over a number of months. That is just incredible and Mr. Peters needs to come clean," Dr. Brash said.

The police investigation over who hacked into Dr. Brash's computer and stole his personal emails is still continuing. The court should be given the possession of any emails.

The Leader of the opposition, &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt;, criticized Stephen Harper's performance at the four day &lt;a href="w%3AAPEC"&gt;APEC&lt;/a&gt; summit in the House of Commons yesterday. He says that the PM called his meeting with the Chinese President "a historic event."

Graham says that it was hardly "a historic event" and his performance was "a big fat zero."

Harper returned to Ottawa from the four day trip to Vietnam yesterday and was away from question period when the comment was made.

"It's always very pleasurable to stand up and give speeches defending Canadian principles. But the test of the speeches is whether they deliver the results," said Liberal leadership candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt;. "The test of whether Mr. Harper's approach in this 15 minute meeting will be whether this guy is released or not," said Michael Ignatieff, referring to the case of &lt;a href="w%3AHuseyincan%20Celil"&gt;Huseyincan Celil&lt;/a&gt;.

Harper raised the case of Huseyincan Celil, a Chinese-Canadian stuck in a China prison for allegedly having links to Muslim separatist extremist groups.

&lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Kenney"&gt;Jason Kenney&lt;/a&gt;, parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, defended Harper and said he was proud of Harper's actions and they protected Canadian values.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Speaker &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt; said Monday the House Democratic Party leadership would not support the announced plan of Representative Charles Rangel to put forth a bill with the aim to reinstate the draft. There has been no draft since 1973 after the Vietnam War when the U.S. armed forces changed to an all volunteer army. The U.S. currently requires registration of all males between the ages of 18 and 26 for the purposes of a possible national emergency, but there is currently no active draft.

"There's no question in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft, and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm's way," Rep. Rangel said Sunday.

Representative Rangel (D-NY), a Korean War veteran, has brought bills to reinstate the draft to the floor of the House several times. None of these bills successfully moved through the congressional process. In 2003 Rangel put forth legislation to draft men and women between the ages of 18 to 26. Earlier this year he proposed legislation to commence draft military service for men and women between the ages of 18 to 42. 

Democrats interviewed in various outlets Sunday expressed no support for the draft plan. Pelosi noted, however, that Rangel remains "a strong voice for social justice in our country" and his support of the draft is done to make a valid point.

A book has been written based around leaked political emails sourcing from leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20party"&gt;New Zealand National party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADoctor%20Don%20Brash"&gt;Doctor Don Brash&lt;/a&gt;. The book has been titled ♡❤The Hollow Men: A Study in the Politics of Deception♡❤ and it's by author, &lt;a href="w%3ANicky%20Hager"&gt;Nicky Hager&lt;/a&gt;, an activist for left-wing causes.

The release of the book was supposed to be today, however the release of the book has been prohibited by the High Court because of an injunction, issued last week, banning the publication of the leaked emails. The injunction applies to anyone as the plantiifs are in the names of "Jane Doe and John Doe".

The topics in the book cover a lot ranging from policies and matters to do with the party. The book also includes Dr Brash's relationship with the exclusive brethren. The books also shows that people within the party, who had denied links with the exclusive brethern, had in fact had links with them. Those people include Dr Brash, John Key the spokesman for finance and Stephen Joyce the campaign manager. The contents page has been revealed, it showed that the book includes political strategies behind the Orewa speech, the input into Nationals campaign from neo-conservatives in America, industry lobby group influences, doners to National and also the election spending strategy that was thought up by Australian advisers.
He also said it looked at a range of possible breaches of election finance laws and parliamentary spending rules.

Mr Hager confirmed that the book doesn't just use emails but also interviews with people inside the National Party who are unhappy. 

Mr Hager said that the book uses emails from Dr Brash that are non-personal and the book does not include anything about Dr Brash's private life. He said that well-placed sources from within National had provided him with the emails. Mr Hager said: "[The emails did not come] from hacking into the parliamentary server or gaining access to Don Brash's computer system or something like that".

In response to the book National has begun to attack Mr Hager's credibility. Gerry Brownlee, deputy leader, has labbled Mr Hager as a well known intriguist. "Helen Clark roundly ditched him over his Corngate allegations a few years ago and it would be interesting to know what she would make of his latest claims."

Dr Brash said that it is not expected that their communications with the public would be made public.

The New Zealand Labour party is claiming that this book will be the "death knell" for National. Michael Cullen, deputy prime minister (PM), said: "The claims about Brash's and John Key's dealings with the Exclusive Brethren are very damaging. The trouble for the National Party is the book may knock out both of them in one go and the party will have to look beyond Key as leader."

Current affairs show which is broadcast on TV3, &lt;a href="w%3ACampbell%20Live"&gt;Campbell Live&lt;/a&gt;, has filed legal precedings in the high court to allow the publication of the book. Carol Hirshfeld, producer, said: "[Our] lawyers are arguing the court didn't take sufficient account of the public interest and that constitutes an unreasonable restriction on freedom of expression. Another key point in the application is that Brash knew for some time that the emails were in the public domain, but delayed acting until now." On today's show host of Campbell Live, John Campbell, said that he and some of his bosses had read the book.

The injunction stops the publish and broadcast, which includes the internet, of the emails. It is also prohibited to reveal what the emails contain or giving the emails to another person except the High Court where they are supposed to be given.

Two large fires in the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABlue%20Mountains%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Blue Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, West of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; are burning out of control in difficult fire fighting conditions.

The first, a 8,000 hectare blaze near &lt;a href="w%3ABlackheath%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Blackheath&lt;/a&gt;, which has been burning for nine days broke containment lines at 11 PM &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEDT&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. Fire crews had been attempting to contain the fire before the onset of difficult conditions today.

Commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service said fire fighters had made a brave effort to contain the fire. When the fire jumped containment lines, around 95 percent of the fire had been contained.

"They've worked extremely hard now for six days but probably their most herculean effort was last night," My Koperberg said.

"They were down on the Grose River working in atrocious conditions as a last-ditch stand ... and they nearly got there.

"They had several metres still to go when it became too hot and we had to evacuate them because it would have endangered them."

A second fire has begun burning on a 5 km (3 mile) front, along the &lt;a href="w%3APutty%20Road"&gt;Putty Road&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3AWiseman%27s%20Ferry%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Wiseman's Ferry&lt;/a&gt; . It is thought that the fire could affect the village of St Albans.

With temperatures in the high 30 degree Celsius range and winds around 50 km/h (31 Mph), fire fighters are bracing for the worst in the Blue Mountains over the next few days. It is feared forecasted wind gusts of up to 80 km/h (49 Mph) overnight could fan the first fire into the township of Winmalee as it heads East.

<h1>Lebanese Christian leader assassinated</h1>

Yesterday, &lt;a href="w%3APierre%20Amine%20Gemayel"&gt;Pierre Gemayel&lt;/a&gt; was shot in his car and was declared dead at the hospital. He was the Lebanese industry minister.

Today, his corpse was driven into his native town of &lt;a href="w%3ABikfaya"&gt;Bikfaya&lt;/a&gt; followed by thousand of people mourning him.
He is the fifth personality assassinated in Lebanon in one year and the fifth of the Gemayel's family according to his father, former president &lt;a href="w%3AAmin%20Gemayel"&gt;Amin Gemayel&lt;/a&gt;.

One week ago, Samir Geagea, the commander in chief of the Lebanese Forces, announced rumor of assassination of one minister.

The funeral of Pierre Gemayel will be held tomorrow in the cathedral of &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;.

According to the White House National Security Council spokesman, President Bush, having expressed his condolences to Lebanon’s Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, affirmed "the unwavering commitment of the United States to help build Lebanese democracy, and to support Lebanese independence from the encroachments of Iran and Syria."

&lt;a href="w%3ANepal"&gt;Nepal's&lt;/a&gt; 10-year civil war has come to a peaceful conclusion with the signing of a historic accord between &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Nepal"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGirija_Prasad_Koirala"&gt;Girija Prasad Koirala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APrachanda"&gt;Prachanda&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20Nepal%20%28Maoist%29"&gt;Maoist&lt;/a&gt; rebel faction that had been fighting for political change. The deal was signed in &lt;a href="w%3AKathmandu"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.

The deal would allow the Maoists into the Nepalese government, and place both Maoist and government weapons under UN scrutiny. The Maoists had been observing a ceasefire since its &lt;a href="Maoists%20in%20Nepal%20declare%20three%20month%20ceasefire"&gt;declaration&lt;/a&gt; more than six months previously.

Prachanda said that the peace agreement would end the 238-year old feudal system. He added that his party would work with new responsibility and make new strong Nepal.

Meanwhile, Koirala said that the deal ended the politics of terron and violence and started the politics of co-operation. He thanked Prachanda to find out a peaceful solution in the country.

The government and the Maoist rebels were accused of human rights abuses in fighting that killed more than 13,000 people.

Nepalese king Gyanendra Singh has welcomed Tuesday's peace deal between the government and the Maoist rebels.
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; by ensuring sustainable peace, a prosperous Nepal can now be built with the collective efforts of all Nepalese people through multi-party democracy

On Monday morning, a 26-year-old man named Oliver Neal was stopped in southern &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; by police, who took him into custody after finding four packets of cocaine in his possession.

According to a police statement, Mr. Neal shot himself in the back of the head while handcuffed in the back of a patrol car, and after having been searched for a weapon. Neal was treated at the Hospital of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Pennsylvania"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, with news reports listing his condition as critical or stable.

Neal's family held a press conference on Tuesday. His father said, “He had his problems in the past, but that has no bearing on what occurred.”

Both Internal Affairs and a Philadelphia homicide team are investigating the shooting.

24 years ago &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; severed diplomatic relations because Syria accused Iraq of giving support to the &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Muslim Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; who were causing disorder in Syria. Now, as an outcome of meetings between Walid Moallem the Syrian Foreign Minister, the Iraqi President &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt; and Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Nuri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;, relations will be restored.

Both countries are agreed that the borders between them should be sealed more tightly to prevent the flow of fighters, arms and ammunition to Iraq, Syria saying that Iraq should do more to secure the border than it has been doing lately.

The two countries are agreed that US troops are needed in Iraq at present but that they should leave as soon as they are no longer needed. Syria wants a timetable for the progressive withdrawal of US forces.

The steps needed to establish full diplomatic relations and to open embassies in Baghdad and Damascus are set out in an agreement signed today in Baghdad. Zebari proclaimed "We will hoist the Iraqi flag in Syria and the Syrian flag in Iraq”.
Meanwhile, President Talabani has agreed to meet Iran’s President &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday to discuss security matters.

Although the British Prime Minister has been encouraging more positive relations between Iraq and its neighbors, Syria and Iran, the United States has been critical of both of them. Last week, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she was opposed to including Syria and Iran in talks about security in Iraq. She accused Syria of having aligned itself with "the forces of extremism" and expressed frustration that despite repeated talks with Syria, nothing seems to have influenced their behavior. Regarding Iran, she said she could see nothing in its behavior that suggested it could contribute to stability in the area. She expressed the view that Iraq must take more responsibility for its own security.

Today, the White House welcomed the news of the rapprochement between Syria and Iraq. The spokesman for the US National Security Council saying "We’ve always encouraged Iraq’s neighbors to take a role in supporting and assisting the unity government in Iraq”. 

President Bush met the Iraq Study Group, headed by former secretary of state James Baker on Monday. The Democrats in the Group said that, in order to encourage the Iraqi government to face its responsibilities, there should be a phased withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, starting now. The President rejected this suggestion, remarking that this was a military matter and depended upon the situation on the ground. 

Recommendations from the bi-partisan study Group are expected to be delivered to the President and Congress sometime in December this year. The group is composed of five Democrats and five Republicans.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
A "white powder" has been discovered at the Michael J. Dillon courthouse at 68 Court Street in downtown Buffalo, New York.

According to Buffalo Fire Chief, Don Mcfeely, "a call was placed to 911 at approximately 1:58 p.m. [EST], by a woman working on the third floor" of the courthouse after she opened a "letter which contained a suspicious white powder."

The building was immediately evacuated, which had at least 200 people in it, but it is unknown where the occupants of the building went, as only fire, police, and government officials were observed around the outside of the building. No decontamination site was seen, but according to witnesses, Hazmat officials were seen entering the building with bio-hazard suits.

Mcfeely also stated that the letter "contained codes," but would not elaborate on what the codes were or what they meant and that a "message was written on the letter which suggested that the powder was harmful." 

Preliminary tests performed on the scene determined that the powder was not &lt;a href="w%3AAnthrax"&gt;Anthrax&lt;/a&gt;, but the test did not "rule out anything else that maybe harmful," stated Mcfeely. "The letter has been removed from the building and has been taken to the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; field office in Buffalo for further tests."

The letter was not addressed to anyone specifically, being addressed to just the courthouse itself.

So far no injuries or illnesses have been reported and according to Mcfeely, no one has been taken to the hospital, although stretchers were seen entering the building. The fire department was not on high alert but blocked off the area surrounding the courthouse as a "precautionary measure," said Mcfeely. The area was opened to traffic again at about 5:00 p.m. and the courthouse was open for business today.

The FBI has not released a statement and it is still unknown what the powder is.

UK Home Secretary John Reid contradicted the Prime Minister’s opinion that foreign policy and the war in Iraq are not the reason some Muslim youth turn to terrorism. 

Reid is reported as saying in an interview with the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Evening%20Standard"&gt;London Evening Standard&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ "I do believe that foreign policy is sometimes a motivating factor in radicalisation of young Muslims and the potential recruitment to terror…It is better to be frank about it. To say it isn't a cause isn't to say it has nothing to do with the whole process."

Blair has said repeatedly that the idea that the war had been a factor in radicalising youth was "rubbish" and, when speaking to the Commons Liaison Committee said it should be "challenged at every level".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Buffalo, New York developers have been stymied by old real estate deeds. 

The prospective Elmwood Village Hotel may be scuttled and businesses now located there may be forced to move. 

Frustrations over property located in an area once known as "Granger Estates" circulate around a clause in the original deeds over land divided by then-owner Erastus Granger in the early 1800's. 

According to the documents, "no business establishment of any kind whatsoever" shall ever be constructed on the property, and they shall forever be exclusively for residential use only. Also prohibited are barns, farms and stables. 

Sam Savarino, CEO of Savarino Companies, the prospective hotel developer, announced that his legal research team found the restrictions on properties located between 1109 and 1121 Elmwood Avenue which also stated in part that "no businesses, hospitality establishment of anykind whatsoever" shall ever be permitted to be built on the property. 

Savarino, whom is expected to contest the restrictions, said that his company could have ignored the findings, but that, "we can't risk the future of a multimillion-dollar project on the hope they wouldn't be discovered. Our opponents would have had a field day if they'd surfaced after the fact." 

Savarino said his attorneys and researchers are anticipated to determine "exactly what weight the restrictions carry and if there's a way for the courts to negate them." 

Existing businesses are also jeopardized. 

Hans Mobius, owner of some of the restricted properties upon which a carriage house is built, said, he wasn't aware of any restrictions, and "never had a reason to research the deed and title documents." He confidently added that, "the lawyers can get this taken care of." 

Other threatened businesses include Don Apparel, H.O.D. Tattoo, Forest Plaza Art Gallery and Allentown Music.

<h1>Alabama School Bus Crash kills 4</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Alabama%20School%20Bus%20Crash%20kills%204&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Tragedy struck Huntsville, Alabama Monday morning when a school bus transporting Lee High School students to a local trade school careened over a retaining wall on an elevated part of Interstate 565 at the U.S. highway 231 exit and plummeted 30 feet. 

Killed in the initial crash were Nicole Ford, 19, Christine Collier, 16. Tanesha Hill, 17, died later at Huntsville Hospital. A fourth victim, Crystal Renee McCrary, 17, died Tuesday. Anthony Scott, the bus driver, and 14 students remain hospitalized, according to Huntsville Hospital spokeswoman Pam Sparks. 

Huntsville Police spokesman Wendell Johnson said a 1990 Toyota Celica apparently hit the Laidlaw Education Services-contracted school bus. The bus driver apparently attempted evasive action, and a reaction sent the right tire climbing up the protective barrier. The buses momentum caused it to teeter on the wall briefly, flipped upside down, careening headlong onto the ground below. It was unclear if the driver jumped or was ejected, though National Transportation Safety Board spokeswoman Debbie Hersman said the bus driver was found on the overpass, and that, "We are trying to determine why the bus driver was on the overpass." 

Investigating agencies at federal, state and local levels include the NTSB, Alabama State Department of Transportation, Alabama Department of Public Safety, and Huntsville Police Department. 

Thad Sokolowski, a 17-year-old Lee High School eyewitness said, "The orange car was going to pass the bus. He thought something was wrong with the car, like his tire got blown out because it started fishtailing." He added that the orange Toyota hit the bus, "but not hard. It was a bump," adding that the bus "skidded down the rail and it was gone." 

His description of the wreck was given to his mother, Bonnie Sokolowski, and published in the Huntsville Times, because he did not want to speak with reporters. 

Police Chief Rex Reynolds said evidence will be presented to a Grand Jury, as is required by state law for fatalities involving minors, and added that charges have not yet been filed against the 17-year old Toyota driver. Chief Reynolds said the bus driver had a clean driving record. 

Mass chaos ensued and Crestwood Medical Center and Huntsville Hospital, the two local hospitals, both activated their Mass Casualty action plans. Emergency response personnel from throughout the area were called upon to assist in rescue efforts. Huntsville Hospital emergency room physician Dr. Sherrie Squyres said all off-duty hospital medical and nursing personnel were requested to return to work, and that three trauma surgeons and one neurosurgeon were committed exclusively to accident response. 

Among the problems facing hospital and rescue personnel was the absence of personal identification among the victims. Huntsville City Schools Superintendent Dr. Ann Roy Moore said that the Lee High School principal had initiated a student ID card program, "but not every student carried the ID."

Brad Holley, Field Director for Alabama Department of Education, noting the tragedy said "We have not had a student killed while riding a school bus since 1969." Huntsville's last school bus related fatality was November 19, 1968 when a bus transporting students from Lee High Chapman Junior High Schools careened off Bankhead Parkway on Monte Sano Mountain above Tollgate Road. Faulty brakes caused that wreck.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Family%20sues%20CNN%27s%20Nancy%20Grace%20after%20%27heated%20debate%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The family of a woman who committed suicide recently after appearing on &lt;a href="w%3ACNN%20Headline%20News"&gt;CNN Headline News&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Grace"&gt;Nancy Grace's&lt;/a&gt; self titled show said Tuesday that they will be taking her to court.

&lt;a href="w%3AMelinda%20Duckett"&gt;Melinda Duckett&lt;/a&gt;, the mother of an infant son, &lt;a href="w%3ATrenton%20Duckett"&gt;Trenton Duckett&lt;/a&gt;, reported him missing on August 27, and fatally shot herself in her grandparents' retirement home on September 8. Shortly before her death, she had appeared on Grace's show, where she engaged in debate with the former Georgia prosecutor regarding her perceived lack of transparency regarding the disappearance. A suicide note was later found at the scene. The case made national headlines after her appearance.

"Nancy Grace and the others, they just bashed her to the end," said Duckett's grandfather, Bill Eubanks, during an interview with ♡❤The Orlando Sentinel♡❤. "She wasn't one anyone ever would have thought of to do something like this. She and that baby just loved each other, couldn't get away from each other. She wouldn't hurt a bug."

Grace's spokeswoman called the suicide "a sad development," and Grace herself issued a statement saying, "I do not feel that our show is to blame for what happened to Melinda Duckett." 

"The truth," said Grace, "is not always nice or polite or easy to go down. Sometimes it's harsh, and it hurts."

However, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Smoking%20Gun"&gt;thesmokinggun.com&lt;/a&gt;, a true crime website run by &lt;a href="w%3ACourt%20TV"&gt;Court TV&lt;/a&gt; (where Grace also hosts a show), revealed pending litigation by the family on the behalf of Melinda Duckett's estate. Duckett's family is issuing a wrongful death claim against both CNN and Nancy Grace.

After the murder of Grace's fiancee in 1979, she became a prosecutor in her native Georgia and later hosted her own show on Court TV, followed later by her CNN tenure. Grace, however, has been criticized for her sense of ethics and allegedly playing fast and loose with the facts, both in the courtroom and on the air.

Grace's heated interview, however, was not without proper motive. The police had long suspected Melinda Duckett of involvement in her son's disappearance, due to her behavior and contradictory statements. After Duckett's suicide, police named her as a prime suspect in her son's disappearance. Recently, they have announced that they have reason to believe that Trenton Duckett is still alive.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; approved a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AState_funeral%23Canada"&gt;state funeral&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the last standing &lt;a href="World%20War%20I"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; veteran Tuesday. Three of them are still alive, Percy Wilson, who is 105 years old, Lloyd Clemett and John Babcock, both 106. They are the last three living veterans among the 619,636 Canadians who served between 1914 and 1918.

The motion, introduced by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANDP"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was favored by all party leaders. The motion was prompted by an online petition by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Dominion%20Institute"&gt;Dominion Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a national organization which promotes Canadian history.

State funerals in Canada, by tradition, are reserved for prime ministers and governors general. This bill, which is now in affect in Canada, means that state funerals are not only for prime ministers but for people who have served the country.

"We want to thank the tens of thousands of Canadians who signed our petition in support of state funeral," said &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARudyard%20Griffiths"&gt;Rudyard Griffiths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the director of the Dominion Institute. "By passing a motion to offer a full state funeral today the Parliament of Canada will allow a grateful nation to pay proper tribute to our last Great War veteran on his passing and honour the over 600,000 Canadians he served with under arms from 1914-1918."

Australia, also held a state funeral for the final veteran of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Gallipoli"&gt;Battle of Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A State Funeral was offered for &lt;a href="Steve%20Irwin"&gt;Steve Irwin&lt;/a&gt; in September 2006, but the offer was declined by his family's wishes. Canada is the fourth country to have a funeral honoring the last war veteran that served in any war.

"We won't be able to look them in the eyes anymore and thank them for their service the way we should for everyone who is willing to serve our country the way they did and our armed forces personnel still do," NDP Leader Jack Layton said.

Since November 6, around 100,000 Canadians had signed the online petition.

&lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Brash"&gt;Doctor Don Brash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;New Zealand National party&lt;/a&gt; leader, is seeking legal advice to see if the &lt;a href="w%3Ainjunction"&gt;injunction&lt;/a&gt; he has placed on his emails to stop them from being published will still be valid if he lets a new book based around those emails to be released to the public. Dr Brash, however, wants the people who he sent emails and received emails from not named.

"As I've said earlier, I want to see the book by Nicky Hager published so that the claims can be exposed to daylight," Dr Brash said, "On the strength of the initial discussion with Mr Brown [legal counsel], I am confident that there are ways in which the book can be released, even in the next few days. These are being actively explored.

The book in question is by &lt;a href="w%3ANicky%20Hager"&gt;Nicky Hager&lt;/a&gt; and has been given the title: ♡❤The Hollow Men: A Study in the Politics of Deception♡❤. It includes emails that were, allegedly, given to him by insiders in the National party, who Mr Hager will not name, it also includes interviews with unhappy people inside the National party. Despite the claims made by Mr Hager, Dr Brash is still adamant that they were stolen from his computer.

The book includes political strategies behind the Orewa speech, the input into Nationals campaign from neo-conservatives in America, industry lobby group influences, donors to National and also the election spending strategy that was thought up by Australian advisers. The accusations that the author, Mr Hager, has made are wild according to Dr Brash.

The injunction that was issued from the High Court stops anyone from broadcasting, publishing or giving the emails to anyone, in any form, which includes the internet.

Michelle Boag, the person who got Dr Brash to enter the National party, said: "Mr Hager has no credibility. The media is giving the author and activist too much attention. He got access to some stolen property, he selectively took bits to try to reinforce it and now people are believing this man who has never in his life published anything that has had any credibility. All the media is doing is help Mr Hager to sell his book in time for Christmas."

The book has been published by Craig Potton Publishing.

<h1>Honda Civic tops Canada's list of most stolen cars</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Honda%20Civic%20tops%20Canada%27s%20list%20of%20most%20stolen%20cars&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The 1999 and 2000 year model &lt;a href="w%3AHonda%20Civic"&gt;Honda Civic&lt;/a&gt; SiR tops the list of Canada's most stolen cars. 

Consumer popularity also assures the cars will be popular with thieves. Its the second year in a row the Honda SiR has topped the list.

Rick Dubin Vice President of Investigations for the &lt;a href="w%3AInsurance%20Bureau%20of%20Canada"&gt;Insurance Bureau of Canada&lt;/a&gt; said "The Civics are easy targets." 

Dubin said that once stolen, the cars are most often sold to "chop shops" where thieves completely dismantle the vehicles. The automobile's individual parts are worth more than the entire car. 

The sheer numbers of the cars and their lack of theft deterrent systems make them thieves' preferred choices.
<h3>No immobilizer</h3>
1999 and 2000 Honda Civics do not come with an electronic immobilizer, however all Hondas from 2001 and onward are equipped with an immobilizer. Immobilizers will be mandatory on all new cars sold beginning September 2007. The devices enable an engine computer to recognize an electronic code in the key. If the code in the key and the engine don't match exactly, the vehicle can't be started. 

In third place was the 2004 &lt;a href="w%3ASubaru%20Impreza"&gt;Subaru Impreza&lt;/a&gt;, while the 1999 &lt;a href="w%3AAcura%20Integra"&gt;Acura Integra&lt;/a&gt; came in fourth, with the 1994 Honda Civic rounding out the top five. 

In sixth place, the 1998 Acura Integra, and the 1993 &lt;a href="w%3ADodge%20Shadow"&gt;Dodge Shadow&lt;/a&gt; completed seventh. 

When asked why early model vehicles are selected, he said that, "auto thieves continue to find it easier to steal older vehicles lacking an IBC-approved immobilizer. We've seen this trend developing for several years, and these results confirm it." 

Another Honda automobile, the 1996 year model Civic filled eighth place, with the 2000 German &lt;a href="w%3AAudi%20TT%20Quattro"&gt;Audi TT Quattro&lt;/a&gt; in ninth. 

The American 1996 &lt;a href="w%3AChevrolet/GMC%20Blazer"&gt;Chevrolet/GMC Blazer&lt;/a&gt; rounded out the top ten.

None of the above cars had an electronic immobilizer.

&lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Pierce%20Bush"&gt;Barbara Bush&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; had her purse stolen while on a two-week trip in &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.

Unnamed law enforcement officials told news agencies that the 24-year old Miss Bush was "not in the immediate proximity" of her purse when it was stolen. Her &lt;a href="w%3Amobile%20phone"&gt;cell phone&lt;/a&gt; was among the items stolen. 

According to the source, "at no point were the protectees out of visual contact and at no point was there any risk of harm."

Miss Bush was having dinner in the San Telmo neighborhood of &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt; during her first night there when the incident occurred. According to the reports, &lt;a href="w%3ASecret%20Service"&gt;Secret Service&lt;/a&gt; agents guarding Miss Bush failed to notice the theft. 

According to additional unnamed law enforcement sources, an agent member of Miss Bush's advance party Secret Service was badly beaten during an "altercation" on his personal time, which the agent reported as an attempted mugging. The agent's condition is fine. 

A Bush administration official confirmed that "a theft incident" involving Barbara Bush had occurred, but declined details. The Secret Service, which is charged with the protecting the First Family's personal security, declined comment, as did the White House, and the First Lady's office. 

There have been recent reports that Miss Bush has been living and working in &lt;a href="w%3APanama"&gt;Panama&lt;/a&gt; as an intern for &lt;a href="w%3AUNICEF"&gt;UNICEF&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>New Zealand National party pays back owed GST</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%20National%20party%20pays%20back%20owed%20GST&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;New Zealand National party&lt;/a&gt; has announced that it will pay back the &lt;a href="w%3AGoods%20and%20Services%20Tax%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;GST (Goods and Services Tax)&lt;/a&gt; it owes to five different advertisers, all television stations, by buying advertising time for the several different charities. The advertisements will appear on the owed media outlets. They have decided with the current path is it would "unlawful" to pay back the GST normally.

The GST amounted to NZ$112,000.

National's original plan of getting a one time bill passed that it would allow them to pack the owed GST to the media outlets was ditched in favour of this new one. "With the prospect of legislation diminishing, it's time to accept that National cannot go down that path," Judy Kirk, president of the National party, said.

If National was to pay back the GST, they would be breaking the law by going over the electioneering cap set by the Broadcasting Act.

The owed media companies are &lt;a href="w%3ATVNZ"&gt;TVNZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATV3%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;TV3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20Television"&gt;Sky Television&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes Sky's free-to-air channel, &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Television%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Prime&lt;/a&gt;.

Ms Kirk said: "We want to get some closure on the matter and have taken extensive legal advice on our options... We have secured clear advice that it would be unlawful to pay the five outstanding media creditors, and that it would be unlawful for them to accept payment. We do not wish to break the law, and nor do we wish to place our creditors in the position of breaking the law."

"...we will purchase the media advertising time directly from broadcasters and ask that they allocate it amongst the range of charities currently supported by each," Ms Kirk said.

National said that their error on not paying for the GST did not effect the outcome of the election, unlike the Labour party's overspending.

The French postal service &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Poste"&gt;La Poste&lt;/a&gt; has reached agreement with &lt;a href="w%3ASNCF"&gt;SNCF&lt;/a&gt;, the national rail company, to create a joint rail-based high-speed courier service. The planned joint venture was announced on Monday by the two state-owned businesses.

La Poste's return to rail was prompted by stiff competition and rulings of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt;. In the late 1990s, mail train services were largely replaced by road and air shipment. Faced with European prohibitions on night flights, and the harmful effects of carbon emissions, La Poste changed its policy.

There will be 3 &lt;a href="w%3ATGV"&gt;TGV&lt;/a&gt; high-speed mail trains in the new fleet, soon expanding to 10. Environmentally speaking, the trains will contribute a reduction in atmospheric pollution from fossil fuels.

The winter session of the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20India"&gt;Parliament of India&lt;/a&gt; has begun today. Both the houses, &lt;a href="w%3ALok%20Sabha"&gt;Lok Sabha&lt;/a&gt; (Lower House) and &lt;a href="w%3ARajya%20Sabha"&gt;Rajya Sabha&lt;/a&gt; (Upper House), were adjourned after paying obituaries to BSP leader &lt;a href="w%3AKanshi%20Ram"&gt;Kanshi Ram&lt;/a&gt; and four other former &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament%23India"&gt;MPs&lt;/a&gt;.

The Rajya Sabha was adjourned without transacting any business today as a mark of respect to &lt;a href="w%3ALalit%20Suri"&gt;Lalit Suri&lt;/a&gt;, a sitting member of Rajya Sabha who passed away on October 10, 2006.

Six newly elected members, including BJP leader Shahnawaj Hussain, newly elected Lok Sabha member from Bhagalpur constituency, and Narahari Mahato from Purulia constituency, took their oaths of office.

Three new members of the Union Council of Ministers were introduced in the Lok Sabha. The members are Defence minister &lt;a href="w%3AA.%20K.%20Antony"&gt;A K Antony&lt;/a&gt;, Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting &lt;a href="w%3AAmbareesh"&gt;M H Ambareesh&lt;/a&gt; and Minister of State for Water Resources &lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Prakash%20Narayan%20Yadav"&gt;Jay Prakash Narayan Yadav&lt;/a&gt;.

Nine people are confirmed dead in a fire in a leather bag factory in &lt;a href="w%3AKolkata"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt;'s South 24 Pargana district in Topsia area.

Eighteen people were seriously injured and admitted to the National Medical College and Hospital.

Inspector General of Police (Law and Order) Raj Kanojia said that the fire broke out at about 3 a.m. local time, when the victims were inside the factory and all the doors were closed.

Director General of Fire Brigade Gopal Bhattacharjee said that it was an illegal factory in Kolkata located at third floor of the building. At the time of fire, all the exits were shut and workers could not come out from the factory.

The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. Kolkata Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya suggested that a short circuit or an unattended cigarette may have caused the fire.

Five firetenders were rushed to the spot. Firefighters fought the blaze for hours and rescued the people who were residing in the building at the time of fire.

Israel's Supreme Court yesterday ordered the Israeli government to recognize foreign-based &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriages&lt;/a&gt;. Same-sex marriages legally performed outside Israel will be recognized as full marriages in Israel.

The vote on the ruling was 6-1 with the single no vote coming from a conservative Jew on the bench. The ruling immediately touched off controversy in the conservative and orthodox communities within the nation. Orthodox community leaders had been instrumental in canceling gay pride celebrations last month in Jerusalem.

Lawyers within Israel say the ruling is largely symbolic. Israel already gives gay couples many of the rights of heterosexual couples. The Supreme Court ruling will now allow them to adopt children and gain tax benefits, however.

This latest ruling was the result of a suit brought by five couples at least one of whom had been married in Canada last year when that nation recognized same-sex marriage.

Civil registration of marriages performed outside of Israel has a long history within the country dating back to a Supreme Court decision made in the 1960s. Actual marriage within Israel is overseen by rabbinical authorities under Jewish religious law and so all marriages within Israel are religious in nature. Not only has this been a difficulty when it comes to same-sex marriage, but issues have long been a problem in mixed marriages where one partner is not Jewish, or among people who can't satisfactorily prove their Jewish heritage. The power held by Orthodox leaders in Israel with regard to marriage has been a point of contention in the country with Conservative and Reform sects for years indicating that while from a legal standpoint this latest ruling may be small, it may have far wider ramification in many related areas.

Israel is the first middle-eastern nation to recognize any form of same-sex union, and only the fourth nation in the world to officially recognize same-sex marriages. Israel has recognized &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20unions%20in%20Israel"&gt;same-sex common law marriage&lt;/a&gt; since 1994. Homosexual Palestinians often attempt to flee to Israel as they may be tortured or killed by the Palestinian Authority; however, Israel usually does not grant asylum on the basis of sexual orientation.

&lt;a href="w%3AMethane"&gt;Methane&lt;/a&gt; gas was blamed for the explosion deaths of 8 &lt;a href="w%3AMiner"&gt;miner&lt;/a&gt;s in southern &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt;'s Halemba &lt;a href="w%3ACoal"&gt;coal&lt;/a&gt; mine Tuesday, November 21. Officials say at least 15 are missing. 

Rescue efforts were halted because dangerously high levels of methane gas returned, according to Zbigniew Madej, spokesman for state-owned Coal Co., which operates the mine. 

The missing miners' locater devices were not emitting signals, increasing rescurers' concerns for their well-being. Grzegorz Pawlaszek, head of Coal Co., said the 15 missing miners' fate is "not known," but added that "there is a chance to find someone still alive." 

“This is a tragedy. People have died here,” Polish Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJaroslaw%20Kaczynski"&gt;Jaroslaw Kaczynski&lt;/a&gt; said when he came to Ruda Slaska to see the blast.

Earlier Wednesday, a reconnaissance rescue team descended 3000 feet toward the blast scene, only to retreat because of safety concerns related to high methane gas levels. Rescue digging efforts were also halted because of explosion concerns. 

The missing men were aged 21-59. One of the miner's family members, Andrzej Pytlik, 30, remained on scene with his sister, hoping and waiting for news of her husband, Krystian Gaszka. 

Pytlik, also a miner, said through teary eyes that, "I work in the mines and I know that hope is scant because that's the truth." 

The explosion occurred in a closed portion of the mine where the now-missing miners were working to retrieve abandoned equipment. According to Pawlaszek, the value of the equipment was $23 million, adding that "It was new equipment and that is why we decided to retrieve it." 

He indicated that the recovery work was performed under the supervision of gas detection specialists, and that the bodies of the recovered miners were difficult to identify because of the severity of burns and because their ID tags were blown away in the explosion. 

The Halemba mine, located in &lt;a href="w%3ARuda%20Slaska"&gt;Ruda Slaska&lt;/a&gt;, has produced coal for nearly 50 years, has been fraught with safety concerns and has a track record of serious accidents. One of the oldest mines in Poland, it is centrally located in the industrial Silesia region. 

Earlier this year, a miner was trapped underground in the Halemba mine five days after a cave-in. In 1990, 19 miners were killed and 20 hurt in a gas explosion, and five were killed in collapse in 1991. 

Inside, priests and mining officials were comforting and counseling with distraught relatives. Outside, eight white candles flickered on a main gate wall.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20the%20Prime%20Minister%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Prime Ministers Office&lt;/a&gt; announced today there will be a &lt;a href="w%3AConscience%20vote"&gt;free vote&lt;/a&gt; on reopening the &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt; marriage debate in the House of Commons. Stephen Harper had already talked about having a free vote many times but the date was never set.

The previous government lead by former Liberal leader &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; approved same-sex marriage last year. Harper made this vote one of his promises during the federal election campaign. The 2005 legislation made Canada the fourth country in the world to legalize gay marriage after the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.

A gay marriage lobby group argued that it was not fair to "leave this issue hanging over our heads" and urged the Conservative government to have a vote soon. "Either get on with the vote or admit that the equal-marriage ship has sailed," Laurie Arron, national co-ordinator of &lt;a href="w%3ACanadians%20for%20Equal%20Marriage"&gt;Canadians for Equal Marriage&lt;/a&gt; said at a news conference.

It will not directly challenge the existing legislation but it will ask MPs if they would like to reopen the debate.

Because of the composition of the house of commons, the Conservative government's minority status and its lack of allies in the house on this question, the motion is almost sure to be voted down. Many see this motion as a symbolic gesture to satisfy the government's conservative base. 

Over 12,000 gay couples have married in Canada since &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Marriage%20Act"&gt;Bill C-38&lt;/a&gt; passed.

The vote will have to happen before December 15, when the MPs go home for the Christmas holidays.

The Labour Party's 2005 election manifesto read "We are committed to retaining the independent &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20deterrent"&gt;nuclear deterrent&lt;/a&gt;”. Although there have been reports that planning and design work on replacement vessels and new designs of nuclear war heads has been proceeding for some years, the first Cabinet meeting to consider this pledge will take place tomorrow. 

No Cabinet papers have been circulated before the meeting at which it is said there will be a “first run round the issues”. A further Cabinet meeting is to be held prior to the publication of a White Paper just before Christmas. The principle of retaining a nuclear deterrent will be put to the vote in the House of Commons next year and, although it may split the Labour Party, is likely to be carried with the support of the Conservative opposition.

It is reported that some Cabinet Ministers have reservations about the prudence of maintaining the nuclear deterrent when the apparent threats are from saboteurs and suicide bombers. They also have doubts about the legality of adding to the stock of nuclear warheads contrary to the spirit of the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt; and about the way that the decision is being pushed through without consultation with the Labour Party. Among those with doubts are the Foreign Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHilary%20Benn"&gt;Hilary Benn&lt;/a&gt;, Minister of State for International Development, and &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hain"&gt;Peter Hain&lt;/a&gt;, Secretary of State for Wales and Northern Ireland. 

The only other European country with nuclear capability is &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Brown are agreed on the need to retain a nuclear deterrent. Their reasons include keeping the country's seat at the top table of international politics. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ATrident%20missile"&gt;Trident missile&lt;/a&gt; system is carried in four nuclear-powered &lt;a href="w%3AVanguard%20class%20submarines"&gt;Vanguard class submarines&lt;/a&gt;, the first of which was commissioned in August 1993. The current Trident system cost £12.6 Bn to introduce at 1996 prices, and requires £280m a year to maintain.

Replacements for the smaller nuclear-powered w:attack submarines are under construction and will be armed with &lt;a href="w%3ATomahawk%20missile"&gt;Tomahawk missile&lt;/a&gt; tactical missile systems. The atomic weapons establishment at Aldermaston is reported to be developing tactical nuclear weapons, smaller and of shorter range than Trident suitable for firing using the same type of launcher as Tomahawks.

<h1>Harper to recognize Quebec as nation within Canada</h1>
The &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;Prime Minister of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, announced at 3:00 p.m. Wednesday that he will recognize &lt;a href="w%3AQuebecois"&gt;Quebecois&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href="w%3Anation"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, despite a similar &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Quebecois"&gt;Bloc Quebecois'&lt;/a&gt; motion.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aseparatist"&gt;separatist&lt;/a&gt; Bloc Quebecois (BQ) opposition party originally introduced the motion to recognize Quebec as a nation, without specifying in or out of Canada. But Harper said that he will only recognize the Quebecois as a nation within Canada.

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AQuebeckers"&gt;Quebeckers&lt;/a&gt; know who they are, they know they've participated in the foundation, in the founding of Canada and its development and in its greatness. They know that they've protected their language and unique culture but they also promoted their values and interests within Canada. 

The real question is straightforward: Do Quebeckers form a nation within a united Canada? The answer is yes. 

Do Quebeckers form an independent nation from Canada? The answer is no and it will always be no!

I say to my federalist colleagues and I also say to the separatist side that we here will do what we must, what our forefathers have always done to preserve this country, Canada, strong, united independent and free.

&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;cite style="font-style:normal;"&gt; – &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;Prime Minister of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The Bloc, led by &lt;a href="w%3AGilles%20Duceppe"&gt;Gilles Duceppe&lt;/a&gt; is, by tradition, dedicated to separating Quebec completely from Canada. This has never passed.

"I would say we're devoted to this country with its boundless potential and dedicated to building Canada which includes Quebec while the Bloc is dedicated to destroying Canada," interim Liberal leader &lt;a href="Bill%20Graham"&gt;Bill Graham&lt;/a&gt; in response to Harper's speech. "We are fundamentally opposed to breaking up of Canada ... On this point we must clearly and fundamentally disagree and fundamentally fight for the rights of Canada and the whole of Canada."

Mr. Duceppe opposed the prime minister's position on Quebec.

"It isn't up to the prime minister to decide what Quebeckers will choose as an option," Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe said. "It's up to Quebeckers ... to decide what their future will be ... not as long as they remain within Canada that is supposedly united. They are not a nation as long as they are a country ...Never will I accept the only condition to be a nation is to recognize the right to remain in Canada. We are what we are, full stop."

The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; have ten elected MPs in the province.

According to outgoing &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts%20governor"&gt;Massachusetts governor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;, an explosion that was "equivalent to a 2,000 lb. bomb" and registered 0.5 on the Richter scale decimated an area of &lt;a href="w%3ADanvers%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Danvers&lt;/a&gt; and is also a "Thanksgiving miracle."

The explosion occurred around 2:45 am EST, this morning in the Danversport area of Danvers, Massachusetts at the plant for solvent and ink manufacturer, CAI Inc. The explosion, which was caught on security camera and was heard up to over 25-50 miles away in southern &lt;a href="w%3AMaine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;.

The explosion damaged over 90 homes, blowing out windows and knocking some houses off their foundations. Officials believe that some of the more extensively damaged houses will have to be leveled and rebuilt. Some of the buildings damaged included a bakery, boats at a close by marina and the New England Home for the Deaf, an assisted-living facility for people who are deaf or deafblind and elderly residents requiring constant care. "These people are extremely fragile," said state Rep. &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Speliotis"&gt;Ted Speliotis&lt;/a&gt;, D-Danvers, whose district includes the affected area. "Many of them have Alzheimer's and other illnesses. It's clear they can't stay here long, but it's clear they won't be able to return for quite a while."

Danvers Fire Chief James P. Tutko toured the area by helicopter and said many residents would be kept from their homes for the foreseeable future. "It looks like a war zone, that's the only thing I can say," Tutko said. When asked about the loss of no life at all, he responded "Somebody out there likes us." Finally, he said that finding out the cause of the explosion would take days.

Outgoing governor Mitt Romney toured the area and said the explosion was a "Thanksgiving miracle" as the explosion was "equivalent to a 2,000 lb bomb going off in a residential neighborhood," and that no one was killed and only about 10 people suffered only minor injuries in area that included over 300 residents. Residents of the area have been evacuated to the Danvers High School where temporary shelter has been set up by the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Red%20Cross"&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; of Massachusetts Bay. Donations are being taken for residents affected by the explosion. Residents are also being told to start filing insurance claims right away and to keep track of their expenses for items bought.

There were minor environmental concerns due to water runoff of chemicals. According the &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s on-scene coordinator Mike Nalipinski, preliminary tests showed low levels of toluene, a solvent, but said it was nothing of significance. Water runoff from the water used by firefighters left a purple sheen on the river and tests were being conducted. However, the water is not a local drinking water supply and the chemical evaporates quickly. Chief Tutko said there was no risk of toxic fumes getting into the air.

An Eastern Propane facility was also located near the area, however, it was not the source of the explosion. A spokesman for the company said that although the property suffered some minor damage, their tanks are secure.

According to WHDH television, a person who answered the telephone at CAI's Georgetown, Massachusetts headquarters refused comment, and a telephone message left at the company president's home was not immediately returned.

<h1>Injunction fails to stop decision on waterfront stadium in New Zealand</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Injunction%20fails%20to%20stop%20decision%20on%20waterfront%20stadium%20in%20New%20Zealand&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Today an injunction that was filed in the High Court yesterday to stop the Auckland City Council and Auckland Regional Council from telling the Government which stadium they prefer has failed. The decision is over a new stadium located on the waterfront of Auckland, New Zealand or an upgrade of the already existing, Eden Park, Auckland. The stadium is for the final of the Rugby World Cup 2011, which New Zealand is hosting.

The injunction was filed by a group of five Aucklanders who believe that the decision is being rushed. The injunction was filed in the name of a private citizen to represent a group of five Aucklanders. Rodney Hide, leader of the ACT party and Member of Parliament (MP) and MP for the Green party, Keith Locke, are helping the fight for the injunction as they believe the Aucklanders have a strong case.

Justice John Priestley said that the group did not need this injunction because they could fight the stadium decision in the future by different means. A second injunction has already been filed for two days, starting December 11.
Mayor of Auckland, Dick Hubbard, said: "The council's advisors have informed that processes have been proper and appropriate."

Rodney Harrison, Queens Counsel (QC), said: "The group that lodged the injunction were Auckland ratepayers, residents and concerned citizens but none of whom could be called high profile. I have no idea what those decisions might be. Exactly how the defendants (local government) react to central Government requests or pressure is a matter for them."

ARC chairman, Mike Lee attacked his own counsel Brian Latimore for failing to follow instructions at today's High Court injunction hearing. The instruction were "not to oppose any injunction, merely to assist the court by explaining what was going on and leave the argument to the judge and the other parties."

Mr Lee said: "We were there as peacekeepers not combatants and it seems this guy has gone in and opened fire."

Patrick McGuire, one of the five Aucklanders who had sought the injunction, said that Mr Hide had introduced all of them to each other after they each wrote a letter to him with their concerns. Mr McGuire said it requires "public input".

Mr Hide said that he "had acted as a middle-man, arranging for the members of the group to meet with lawyers." Mr Locke and Mr Hide are working together because they are concerned the legal processes of the decision over which stadium will be chosen and how the decision will be made. Mr Hide said he did not like the waterfront stadium, "I'm not a lawyer but the legal advice we have had is that the injunction has a high chance of succeeding."

The two councils, Auckland City and Auckland Regional, have been consulting the affected groups to see which decision they should go with. The Auckland City Council is currently in a meeting discussing the stadium decision and the Regional Council will do it tomorrow.

If the waterfront stadium was chosen then the stadium will be located on Ports of Auckland land and they want a guarantee that their running of the ports will not be affected. Denis Carlisle, president of the local Maritime union, said: "The Ports of Auckland are asking for guarantees that they will not suffer any financial loss from the stadium project, and likewise the Maritime Union will be seeking compensation for our members for any loss of work. The issue was about safeguarding Port of Auckland's role as a major working port."

"[The Ports of Auckland] is one of the key gateways between New Zealand and the global economy."

<h1>Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation instant scratch tickets under scrutiny</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ontario%20Lottery%20and%20Gaming%20Corporation%20instant%20scratch%20tickets%20under%20scrutiny&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3ACBC%20News"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt; has raised new security concerns over the &lt;a href="w%3AScratchcard"&gt;instant scratch&lt;/a&gt; tickets sold by the OLGC. CBC's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20fifth%20estate"&gt;the fifth estate&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported in a special investigation on October 25 the &lt;a href="w%3AOLGC"&gt;Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation's&lt;/a&gt; (OLGC) tickets are not being given to lottery winners and are claimed more often by the retailers who sell them averaging at &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CAN&lt;/a&gt;$500,000. 

The report investigated several aspects of the lottery retail trade, including a report that tickets were stolen by the clerks of convenience stores. One reported case involved a convenience store clerk who, after checking the ticket bought by a customer who brought suit, said he did not win. 

Retailers appeared to win prizes more often than the general public. However it also appeared that retailers were a core audience of the lottery games and due to that, statistically, could be expected to win more than the general public. The study found that the retailers were winning about 2.5 times more than the general audience and spending almost twice as much on their tickets. Retailers spent CAN$23.30 over the past four weeks. The average person spends CAN$12.30.

"We are here to make sure that all of our players have confidence in our process," OLG chief executive Duncan Brown said. "Lottery retailer means, in our broad definition, anybody that works for a lottery retailer or is related to a lottery retailer. That’s 140,000 people ... in Ontario...What was missing from the fifth estate’s numbers was the frequency of play by the retailers." 

There were 30 complaints referring to the instant scratch tickets from 1999 to 2006. Only once ware charges laid by police. Nine cases had special investigations, winnings totaling at CAN$3,629.

Retailers could, in a process called "pin pricking," attempt to uncover codes printed on the instant scratch tickets under a latex coating that show which card is the winner.

In the wake of earlier allegations, OLG devices were installed for anyone who wanted to check their own tickets, for security reasons.

"Any time someone connected with the OLG tries to claim a prize we conduct a higher level of investigation than what we would do with somebody who is not associated with OLG. And this includes looking at the tickets very carefully, especially in the case of scratch tickets," Teresa Roncon, a spokeswoman for the OLGC said.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;New Zealand National Party&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Brash"&gt;Dr. Don Brash&lt;/a&gt; has resigned as the leader of opposition. Dr Brash made the announcement at press conference held in parliament, stating that ongoing media speculation about his leadership was damaging the party's reputation. Brash will officially step down on Monday, where the party will vote for a new leader and deputy-leader.

"For some weeks now I've been giving consideration to the right time and the right way to announce this decision. I've held off because I've been keen to have two untidy matters dealt with before my departure," Dr Brash said.

The decision came after a &lt;a href="w%3AGoods%20and%20Service%20Tax"&gt;Goods and Service Tax&lt;/a&gt; error in last year's election made by the party, "Although this had nothing to do with me personally it was a source of embarrassment and I was very keen indeed to get the matter resolved before my resignation." And recent news of Brash's emails making their way into "outsiders' hands" was also a factor in his decision to leave. The emails were the subject of a book published by &lt;a href="w%3ANicky%20Hager"&gt;Nicky Hager&lt;/a&gt;, which is expected to be released to the public tomorrow morning. Dr Brash said: "The announcement of Mr Hager's book almost caused me to defer my resignation as leader. I deeply resent the lies and distortions which seem to have been included in his book and I intend to vigorously contest those allegations." Dr. Brash denied media questioning regarding Nicky Hager's book's influence on his decision to resign from leadership.

It seems that &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Key"&gt;John Key&lt;/a&gt; will be the next leader, with a recent Auckland poll showing Key only 1.4 points behind Brash. Nicky Hager has claimed the information in his book may be damaging to John Key as well. Brash's decision came with the Nationals ahead in the poll. Dr. Brash mentioned that he would remain in politics for the National Party if the new leader would provide him with a senior position following the Monday when he steps down from the post. The decision has left the party in crisis, set for their fifth leader in 9 years. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; said the National Party are having an identity crisis and is unstable.

Dr Brash regrets that he will not be able to lead National into the next election which will take place in 2008.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Cullen"&gt;Michael Cullen&lt;/a&gt;, deputy Prime Minister, said: "Brash's resignation was inevitable. This continued instability in the National Party is a sign of a party still nowhere near ready to govern. Dr Brash's resignation was inevitable. But it solves little. By all accounts Mr Key, the likely successor, was deeply involved in all the events that have eventually led to Dr Brash's downfall."

As of 9 am this morning, &lt;a href="w%3AGas%20flare"&gt;flaring&lt;/a&gt; is still being carried out by &lt;a href="w%3AExxonMobil"&gt;ExxonMobil&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AJurong%20Island"&gt;Jurong Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the 3rd day flaring works are being carried out by the company to burn off excess fuel from the &lt;a href="w%3AOil%20refinery"&gt;refinery plant&lt;/a&gt;.

The flame, according to Ms Eva Ho, Communications Manager of ExxonMobil, is dying. ExxonMobil wishes to assure members of the public that no health risk is posed as water and carbon dioxide are produced as a result of the flaring.

Meng Yew Choong, Assistant Director of Corporate Communication at the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Environment%20Agency"&gt;National Environment Agency&lt;/a&gt; also clarifies:

Regular STOMP contributor Mike Muk shot a video of the flaring as well and he sent it in to Stomp.

STOMPer NZSheep also sent a picture to a website, offering the closest look of the flaring activity, taken just outside the security fences surrounding Jurong Island.

The Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) of &lt;a href="Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, Justice MA Aziz has agreed to step aside for three months, the country's president and chief advisor to caretaker government, &lt;a href="w%3AIajuddin%20Ahmed"&gt;Iajuddin Ahmed&lt;/a&gt; announced in a television address to the nation late last night. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh%20Awami%20League"&gt;Awami League&lt;/a&gt;-led alliance accused Aziz of bias towards the &lt;a href="w%3ABangladesh%20Nationalist%20Party"&gt;Bangladesh Nationalist Party&lt;/a&gt; (BNP), led by former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABegum%20Khaleda%20Zia"&gt;Begum Khaleda Zia&lt;/a&gt;, who ended her five-year term in October 2006.

President Ahmed said that Justice Aziz has agreed to go on leave for three months in order to untangle himself from the present crises over the &lt;a href="w%3ABangladeshi%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202007"&gt;2007 parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt;. The President has decided to appoint two more election commissioners under article 118(1) of the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Bangladesh"&gt;Bangladeshi constitution&lt;/a&gt;.

The alliance parties resumed their agitation against Justice Aziz for the third time on Monday and said that they would continue the indefinite stir until he quits the office.

On Tuesday, BVA published a telephone poll conducted for French magazine ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Figaro"&gt;Le Figaro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ and news channel &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATF1%20Group"&gt;LCI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to gauge support for right-wing presidential candidates. 73% of ♡❤&lt;a href="Union%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;Union pour un Mouvement Populaire&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (Union for a Popular Movement or UMP) party supporters identified Interior Minister &lt;a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; as their preferred candidate for May's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20France"&gt;presidential&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; election.

The UMP is one of the two major parties in France, and represents conservative politics. It was formed in 2002 as a union of several right-wing parties, and currently controls the legislature (the National Assembly) and the executive. Current president &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; is aligned with the UMP.

Sarkozy's rivals trail far behind him, with Defense Minister &lt;a href="Mich%C3%A8le%20Alliot-Marie"&gt;Michèle Alliot-Marie&lt;/a&gt; at 5%, Prime Minister &lt;a href="Dominique%20de%20Villepin"&gt;Dominique de Villepin&lt;/a&gt; at 4% and President Jacques Chirac with 1%. Sarkozy's support among the entire group polled is significantly lower, at only 34%. Alliot-Marie has 4%, de Villepin and Chirac have 3% each, and the remaining 43% did not express a preference.

On Monday, de Villepin told ♡❤Le Figaro♡❤ that the right was united "around the one with the best chance of winning."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Auckland%20City%20Council%20supports%20waterfront%20stadium%20in%20New%20Zealand&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%20City%20Council"&gt;Auckland City Council&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has approved the proposed &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;700 million+ waterfront stadium in 13-7 (yes-no) vote in a marathon session lasting nearly 5 hours on Thursday night instead of an upgrade of Eden Park costing around $400 million. However they have called for the stadium to be location "substantially east" of the central government's preferred Marsden Wharf/Captain Cook site. The proposed stadium has been dubbed "&lt;a href="w%3AStadium%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Stadium New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;" by the media.

Two weeks ago Trevor Mallard, sports minister, said that the two councils had two weeks to come up with a decision on whether or not to support a waterfront stadium or Eden Park.

It is now falls on the &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%20Regional%20Council"&gt;Auckland Regional Council&lt;/a&gt; to approve the stadium plans or propose something else, which is supposed to happen tomorrow, Friday. Based on both these decisions, the central government will then make a decision on whether to construct the new Stadium New Zealand or upgrade the current Eden Park, located also in Auckland, which site will also be chosen. It is intended that this stadium will be used for the &lt;a href="w%3ARugby%20World%20Cup%202011"&gt;2011 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; final.

&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Hubbard"&gt;Dick Hubbard&lt;/a&gt;, Mayor of Auckland, said: "In the past Auckland had missed too many opportunities. We can't get it wrong, we cannot bypass this opportunity. Controversy is a good sign, a healthy sign – all the major projects around the world have had controversy. Today it's not about rugby, it is about boldness and vision against caution."

As long as the waterfront stadium is moved then they have a "strong and absolute preference" towards the stadium. Neil Abel, councillor, had tried to remove the "strong and absolute" remark because he believes that Aucklanders did not get an opportunity to indicate that the decision is absolute.

Christine Caughey, councillor, said that the pressure that was put upon them for their decision by Mr Mallard was like "putting a gun to your head."

Other councillors also said that there wasn't enough time given for Aucklanders to have their say and to make their decision. They also said that some of their questions about the costs and transport, etc were left unanswered.

Despite those setbacks the majority did agree that the design of the stadium should be "bold, iconic and reflect our first city of the Pacific aspirations".

If the government cant make a deal with the Ports of Auckland, which owns the land the waterfront stadium is to be located, the regional council, other stakeholders, to move the stadium then the ACC will withdraw their support and support their second favoured, an upgrade of Eden Park.

Unfavoured &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; held mighty Germany to 1-1 draw in Nicosia’s &lt;a href="w%3ANeo%20GSP%20Stadium"&gt;new GSP stadium&lt;/a&gt; on the 15th of November.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ballack"&gt;Michael Ballack&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AChelsea%20FC"&gt;Chelsea FC&lt;/a&gt; gave Germany the lead in the 16th minute and it appeared that the Germans were on their way to a fourth consecutive victory in Group D. But &lt;a href="w%3AOkkas"&gt;Yiannakis Okkas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AOlympiacos"&gt;Olympiakos Piraeus&lt;/a&gt; leveled the game on the stroke of half time driving a long-range volley past German keeper Timo Hildebrand.

Despite several chances for both teams the game ended in a draw leaving the 3 times world champions disappointed and the home fans celebrating one of their proudest results to date.

This result follows Cyprus’ 5-2 thumping of Ireland in their previous home game.

An ongoing struggle in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; between the authorities and a local &lt;a href="Hindu"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; village has turned serious. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AForum%2018"&gt;Forum 18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been documenting the alleged human rights abuse regarding the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Society%20for%20Krishna%20Consciousness"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; village for some time, but as of 21st November events took a drastic turn.

The following was seen and written by Ninel Fokina, president of the Almaty &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki%20Committee%20for%20Human%20Rights"&gt;Helsinki Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and Andrei Grishin, official member of the International Bureau of Human Rights and Law Observance:

On November 21, 2006 at 1 pm the information was received that according to the court decision to evict the members of the religion organization International Society for Krishna Consciousness from the occupied land near Sri Vrindavan Dham farm, and the demolition of 13 country houses will begin
immediately.

Heavy equipment was brought to the suburban community: trucks, demolition machines, three busses with riot policemen, a bus with
demolition squad and the local authorities including the Hakim. Electricity was disconnected in the morning of the same day.

There were only women and children in the village. All men went to work in town.

The president of the Almaty Helsinki Committee Ninel Fokina tried to contact different officials in Astana (the capital): B.
Baikadamov, the envoy of human rights, B. Muhamedjanov, the minister for
internal affairs I. Bakhtibayev, the assistant General Prosecutor; R.
Aliev, the deputy minister for foreign affairs.

She had a conversation with B. Baikadamov, the only person she could reach at that time, who promised to communicate to the
Committee of Religious Affairs at the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court, and the Court Administration Committee which includes the department of court decision execution.

At 3 pm representatives of human rights organizations: Ninel Fokina, Andrei Grishin, and Maxim Varfolomeev, press-secretary of the
Society for Krishna Consciousness, plus, a journalist and representative
of Astana TV channel left for the village which is located 40 km from
Almaty.

All the roads to village were closed and patrolled by police. They would not let anyone go through. The human rights representatives and the journalist took detour through the fields. It was snowing, but they were able to reach the border of the village because of the four-wheel-drive jeep they were traveling in. But even that road was closed by patrol.

The jeep was not allowed to drive into the village. The patrol explained it was instruction of authorities. When Grishin and the jeep driver tried to pass by walk they were stopped and threatened to be
put in handcuffs. And the patrol promised to send for additional force.

Lieutenant colonel, who came with another patrol car, explained that they are not allowed to the village for their own safety. He said that at that time the electric line was being dismounted in the area.

The driver of the jeep had his wife and two months old daughter in the
village. He was begging to let him go through, but his request was denied. He was told that safety is guaranteed to his family.
This group could still enter the village. They approached it from the other detour road, and leaving the car on the sidewalk, one by one they
entered the village.

As they approached the village they met two small groups of young people who were not drunk but unnaturally exited.They held hammers, big dumb-bells, metal crow-bars and sticks. Two of them politely greeted the group, and one said gaily, “Your houses are finished.

Four big busses with toned windows and two cars of ambulance were parked at the entrance of the village in the grove. 30-40 policemen stood by the houses, and 20-30 people in civil clothes including
the leaders of the district with the Hakim, the head of local executive
authority stood on the street, watching the demolition.

It was snowing. Residents’ household stuff such as mattresses, blankets,
utensils cookware, and furniture were laying outside on the lawns by their houses. People in construction outfits (labor people) got inside the houses and started crushing windows and doors, destroying
walls. The bulldozer was demolishing the buildings and the big stone fencing with cast iron openwork lattice which separated the houses from the driving area.

A small group of inhabitants (20-30 people, mostly women) did not offer
physical resistance. One of the women felt dizzy, fell down and was picked up by the ambulance. Police was bringing down those
few (basically women) who tried to interfere with the destruction of their property. Two men tried to prevent the entrance of destroyers into a house, but were brought down by 15 policemen who twisted their hands and took them away to the police car.

During all these events none of the representatives from the Office of
Public Prosecutor were present at the place of the event, even though both Krishna people and legal service people demanded meeting with representatives of the Office of Public Prosecutor who are obligated to be present during this type of actions.

The Hakim of the Yetisu district who was personally responsible for this
action noticed A. Grishin photographing the destruction of the houses using a digital camera and commanded the policemen to detain
him. A. Grishin is an officer of the Human Rights Bureau and a journalist.

To avoid confiscation of the camera A. Grishin tried to escape. He ran away by 200 meters and was caught by the police. Police officers confiscated his digital camera and took away his journalist certificate.

Then he was let free, but police refused to return the camera, saying that they would give it to the Hakim. The camera was indeed found in the car of the Hakim, but the flash card and the batteries were
confiscated. When Grishin approached the Hakim to find out for what
reason his camera and his journalist ID were confiscated, the Hakim told in front of the witnesses, “If I see you here again, I will personally crash Your eyes, even though I am the Hakim.”

No one of the policemen, who took part in the camera and ID confiscation,
wanted to reveal their names.

Ms. Fokina was able to talk with the assistant of the General prosecutor I. Bakhtibayev, who did confirm that he would contact the prosecutor of the province and he would work out this situation.

The envoy of human rights E. Baikadamov, who was also contacted, said that the president of the Court Administration Committee Z. Makashev confirmed that he would contact immediately the provincial department and would give the appropriate instructions.

All the attempts of the representatives of the human rights organizations to find the people in charge of the operation and give
them any information were unsuccessful.

All the present officials refused to speak and declared that they were not responsible for the action. The Police colonels would point at bailiffs. The bailiffs did not confirm their being bailiffs.

The OSCE representatives in Almaty Eugenia Benigni and Lisa Zhumakhmetova
did not make it to the village. Their car just was stoped by police.

When the darkness fell, at around 6 pm, everything was finished: 13 houses destroyed, people thrown to the snowbound street, the village left without electricity, without heat and water.

The condition of the witnesses can be described as shock. The condition of the people who were thrown from their destroyed houses to the dirt and snow cannot be described.

When all the 13 buildings were destroyed as was planned ... while the
adjacent houses of other people who do not belong to the Society for Krishna Consciousness were left untouched even though their
title deeds have the same status ... the bailiffs decided to give an
interview to the TV channel “to avoid one-sided opinion.” However no one of them introduced himself. The only thing they could say, “we are executing the court decision.”

Neither the Hakim, nor the police chiefs, nor the bailiffs would listen to the arguments that the governmental commission established to solve the issue around the Society for Krishna Consciousness has not yet come to final decision.

Notice: the notifications of eviction and demolition of the 13 houses owned by members of the cottage cooperative, who are the members of the religious organization Society for Krishna Consciousness, were
delivered to the watchman of Sri Vrindavan Dham in the evening of

Former &lt;a href="Major%20League%20Baseball"&gt;Major League Baseball&lt;/a&gt; pitcher and coach &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APat%20Dobson"&gt;Pat Dobson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; died of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aleukemia"&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Wednesday, November 22.

Dobson is best known for winning 20 games in the 1971 season for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%20Orioles"&gt;Baltimore Orioles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He was a major league &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAll-Star"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1972.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%20Regional%20Council"&gt;Auckland Regional Council&lt;/a&gt; (ARC) has voted to support an upgrade of &lt;a href="w%3AEden%20Park"&gt;Eden Park&lt;/a&gt; and not the New Zealand government's preferred option of a new stadium built on Auckland's waterfront. The stadium consultation is because to host the Rugby World Cup, which New Zealand is hosting in 2011, the final venue has to be able to seat at least 60,000 people.

&lt;a href="w%3ATrevor%20Mallard"&gt;Trevor Mallard&lt;/a&gt;, minister for sports, would not comment on the decision made by the ARC. Mr Mallard would not speak to the media until Monday when he goes to the cabinet.

Yesterday the &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%20City%20Council"&gt;Auckland City Council&lt;/a&gt; also made their decision on the stadium but they had a different opinion, going with the waterfront stadium.

Mr Mallard said a fortnight ago that the final will go to Christchurch's stadium &lt;a href="w%3AJade%20Stadium"&gt;Jade Stadium&lt;/a&gt; if the two councils could not agree on the stadium they wish to pursue.

With coming to its decision the ARC said that it sympathizes with the public as there was no formal public consultation and the two weeks given to them to make their decision and tell the government their choice was not enough time.

The ARC also said that the Auckland City Councils resolution to move the waterfront stadium around 200 metres to the east is not viable as found by a Technical Working Group working for Trevor Mallard.

"By taking this decision, they may be putting more responsibility on Auckland ratepayers," the mayor of Auckland, Dick Hubbard, said.

The ARC found the waterfront stadium was "inappropriate" because there would be a significant adverse reaction to the council owned Ports of Auckland, special legislation would be required to build it, it would have a "negative impact on the heritage and urban design values of the Britomart precinct and the adjacent waterfront area", and it would be quite expensive to build.

With all the above considered the ARC decided to pursue the Eden Park option as it is also an internationally recognised stadium and was used for the bid to attempt New Zealand to get the 2011 Ruby World Cup.

"Trevor Mallard's stadium is a dead duck," he said. "This afternoon he has no option but to take the waterfront stadium off the table," Keith Locke, Member of Parliament for the Green party.

Mr &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Litvinenko"&gt;Alexander Litvinenko&lt;/a&gt;, reputed to have been an Ex-Russian spy who had defected to Britain, died last night in mysterious circumstances. He had alleged many associations between people in high places and organised international crime, implying that &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20Putin"&gt;President Putin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARomano%20Prodi"&gt;Romano Prodi&lt;/a&gt; among others had been involved personally. He had sought political asylum in UK in 2000 and became a naturalised citizen in October this year, just weeks before his death.

Mr Litvinenko was said to have been investigating the shooting of Russian journalist and human rights activist &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Politkovskaya"&gt;Anna Politkovskaya&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known critic of Russian activities in &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechnya&lt;/a&gt;, in her apartment in Moscow October 7, 2006. It is reported that he had met two Russians in an hotel room, one said to be former member of the &lt;a href="w%3AKGB"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; in conneciton with the affair and he went on to meet Mario Scaramella at a &lt;a href="w%3Asushi"&gt;sushi&lt;/a&gt; bar in Piccadilly where some papers were exchanged. Some hours after this he was taken ill. 

Mr Litvinenko was admitted to &lt;a href="w%3ABarnet%20General%20Hospital"&gt;Barnet General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, north London on November 1, 2006 complaining of feeling sick. By November 11, he was said to be suffering from ♡❤serious poisoning♡❤. A week later he was transferred to &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20College%20Hospital"&gt;University College Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in central London. A week later he was said to have been poisoned by ingesting &lt;a href="w%3Athallium"&gt;thallium&lt;/a&gt;, once used in rat poison, but, in the opinion of some doctors, there were signs of &lt;a href="w%3Aradioactive%20poisoning"&gt;radioactive poisoning&lt;/a&gt;, including loss of weight and shedding of hair. Various explanations of his condition were offered. Last night he suffered a heart attack, after having left a message blaming President Putin for having him killed. 

The radioactive &lt;a href="w%3Aisotope"&gt;isotope&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apolonium"&gt;polonium&lt;/a&gt;-210 was found in his blood and urine as reported by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom%27s%20Health%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;. The post-mortem was cancelled. Subsequently the Agency examined conditions in the hospitals in which Mr Litvinenko has been treated. Police visited the Itsu sushi restaurant in Piccadilly, his home in Muswell Hill and the Millennium Hotel, Grosvenor Square where the meeting on November 1 had been held. Traces of radiocactivity were found in all three places. It is speculated that the polonium was probably eaten by Litvinenko as a substance that could be combined with a salt-like substance, such as &lt;a href="w%3Apolonium%20nitrate"&gt;polonium nitrate&lt;/a&gt;.

It was reported that a meeting had been held in Cabinet Office Briefing Room A (COBRA) used for high level emergency planning and control, to consider the implications of these events. The Foreign Office asked Moscow for a response to the accusation of Russian involvement and President Putin himself dismissed the allegations saying (before the cause of death had been established) that there was no proof of an unnatural death and that the case was being used as a "political provocation".

<h1>Britain to replace Trident nuclear missile system</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Britain%20to%20replace%20Trident%20nuclear%20missile%20system&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; Cabinet decided that Britain will retain its nuclear deterrent by replacing the &lt;a href="w%3ATrident%20missile"&gt;Trident missile&lt;/a&gt; system carried on submarines, in its first meeting on the subject yesterday. The case for considering land-based and airborne systems made by former Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGeoff%20Hoon"&gt;Geoff Hoon&lt;/a&gt; was rejected. 

The Cabinet agreed that three or four new submarines should be built to carry the new missiles, but the number of nuclear warheads to be carried by each vessel will be decided at a later date. The existing fleet of four &lt;a href="w%3AVanguard%20class%20submarines"&gt;Vanguard class submarines&lt;/a&gt;, even if refitted, is due for decommissioning by 2024 at the latest. The time for design and construction is expected to be 17 years, so there is a need for an early decision. Chancellor &lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt; is reported as being keen to get construction started as soon as possible, in order to retain the skills of the existing workforce. 

Some Cabinet Ministers thought to oppose the replacement of Trident, who worried that there might be a breach of &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt; or who had concern that the Labour party had not been consulted sufficiently. They include &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Hain"&gt;Peter Hain&lt;/a&gt;, who, until recently, was a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ACampaign%20for%20Nuclear%20Disarmament"&gt;Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament&lt;/a&gt;. The Cabinet Ministers expressed themselves content to carry out consultation and have a debate in Parliament in February. 

Some 200 Members of Parliament have demanded that Parliament debate alternatives. It was agreed that a white paper for this purpose would be published before Christmas and a period of consultation would follow. Parliament would be asked to vote on the Cabinet’s proposal—not to choose between alternative systems, but to support the Cabinet’s choice "in principle." Although the Government, with Conservative support, is most likely to get approval for its plan, &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20House"&gt;Leader of the House&lt;/a&gt;, has announced that the vote will be &lt;a href="w%3Awhipped"&gt;whipped&lt;/a&gt;.

Caleb Uriah Lussier, 20, a student at &lt;a href="w%3AWord%20Of%20Life"&gt;Word of Life Bible Institute&lt;/a&gt;, has been arrested and charged with two felony counts of third degree burglary and one count of felony third degree arson of Christ Episcopal Church in Pottersville, New York, on May 30th, after first collecting and placing the bibles out of reach of the fire.

Warren County Sheriff Larry Cleveland said Lussier confessed to the burning the church, saying Lussier Christ Church had deviated from the Bible and the word of God.

Police reported that Mr. Lussier confessed to stealing from the church twice in May and he described to authorities how he used gas to set the fire itself. He allegedly also confessed to sending threatening letters to a church in Plymouth, and setting a fire to the New Testament Church in his hometown in December, 2005. 

Authorities were put onto Mr. Lussier's trail by way of a tip from a congregant from another community church who reported that Mr. Lussier looked out of place when he attended services. At that point Mr. Lussier had no police record and a connection had not been made between the Pottersville church arson case and the Plymouth church fire where, similarly, a bag of Bibles had been previously saved from the arson.

Mr. Lussier is currently in Warren County jail on a $250,000 cash bail or a $500,000 bond. He is scheduled to appear back in court later this month.

Christ Episcopal Church serves a parish of about 15 people.

Word of Life is a large evangelical fundamentalist youth ministry with major campuses in Schroom Lake, NY, Florida, and California, and smaller campuses in 46 countries.

&lt;a href="w%3AAnita%20O%27Day"&gt;Anita O'Day&lt;/a&gt;, best known for her sassy rendition of "Sweet Georgia Brown" and "Honeysuckle Rose" died in her sleep early &lt;a href="w%3AThanksgiving"&gt;Thanksgiving Day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANovember"&gt;November&lt;/a&gt; 23, &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. She was 87. 

Known as the "Jezebel of Jazz," she was one of America's most respected &lt;a href="w%3Ajazz"&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt; vocalists whose vocal contemporaries included &lt;a href="w%3AElla%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Ella Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABillie%20Holiday"&gt;Billie Holiday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASarah%20Vaughan"&gt;Sarah Vaughan&lt;/a&gt;. 

A &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; native, she gained national recognition while touring with Jazz legends &lt;a href="w%3AGene%20Krupa"&gt;Gene Krupa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStan%20Kenton"&gt;Stan Kenton&lt;/a&gt;. Her first national hit was on "Let Me Off Uptown" with Gene Krupa's orchestra, which became a million dollar seller. &lt;a href="w%3ADown%20Beat"&gt;Downbeat&lt;/a&gt; magazine named her "New Star of the Year" in &lt;a href="w%3A1942"&gt;1942&lt;/a&gt;. After touring with Stan Kenton and his Orchestra, and recording "And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine," her talent shown as a solo star. Her style became a foundational influence upon modern jazz recordings. 

Her innovative &lt;a href="w%3AScat%20singing"&gt;scat&lt;/a&gt; style singing and lyrical ballads were recorded on &lt;a href="w%3AVerve%20records"&gt;Verve Records&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s. Her colorfully innovative vocal style was evidenced in motion pictures "The Gene Krupa Story" and &lt;a href="w%3AJazz%20On%20A%20Summer%27s%20Day"&gt;"Jazz On A Summer's Day&lt;/a&gt;." 

Having a close brush with death from &lt;a href="w%3Aheroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAddiction"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3A1967"&gt;1967&lt;/a&gt;, she also survived &lt;a href="w%3AAlcoholism"&gt;alcohol addiction&lt;/a&gt;. She completed her &lt;a href="w%3AAutobiography"&gt;autobiography&lt;/a&gt; "High Times, Hard Times" in &lt;a href="w%3A1981"&gt;1981&lt;/a&gt; and is the subject of a full-length &lt;a href="w%3ADocumentary%20film"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; "Anita O'Day - the Life of A Jazz Singer," which has yet to be released. Her last album, which she recorded at age 85, "Indestructable Anita O'Day," on the Kayo Sterophonics/MRI label, was released last year. 

Robbie Cavolina, her manager, said she was recovering from &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; convalescent hospital. And recollected that "On Tuesday night, she said to me, 'get me out of here.' But it didn't happen." 

Referring to her renewed musical activity, he said that "She got to see how many people really loved her at the shows we did, in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3A%20London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. She had come back after all of this time. She really lived a very full and exciting life."

Born Anita Belle Colton O'Day, &lt;a href="w%3A%20October"&gt;October&lt;/a&gt; 18, &lt;a href="w%3A1919"&gt;1919&lt;/a&gt;, she escaped from a broken home at age 14, and began contesting with touring walk-a-thons popular at the time, and was occasionally asked to sing. Upon her return to Chicago, she landed her first legitimate singing job at Planet Mars, a Chicago &lt;a href="w%3ANightclub"&gt;nightclub&lt;/a&gt;. Carl Cons, Down Beat magazine's then-editor, was so impressed with her performance that he invited her to open his new jazz club. 

As a showcase for promising jazz talent, The Off-Beat was frequented by such musicians as drummer Gene Krupa, and others. During one of her performances there in &lt;a href="w%3A1941"&gt;1941&lt;/a&gt;, Krupa recruited her to join his &lt;a href="w%3Aorchestra"&gt;orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. 

In &lt;a href="w%3A1943"&gt;1943&lt;/a&gt;, Anita left Krupa's band and married professional &lt;a href="w%3Agolf"&gt;golfer&lt;/a&gt; Carl Hoff. She later briefly joined &lt;a href="w%3Aclarinet"&gt;clarinetist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWoody%20Herman"&gt;Woody Herman's&lt;/a&gt; band, then reluctantly Stan Kenton's. Thinking her style wasn't compatible with hers, she was surprised when in &lt;a href="w%3A1944"&gt;1944&lt;/a&gt; the tune "And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine" became a national hit. 

Anita's fierce love of &lt;a href="w%3ASwing%20%28genre%29"&gt;swing&lt;/a&gt; beats, conflicted however with Kenton's infatuation with strident rhythms and novelty tunes, and a year later, left over artistic differences. 

Her &lt;a href="w%3AImprovisation"&gt;improvisational&lt;/a&gt; style, and love of &lt;a href="w%3ABebop"&gt;bebop&lt;/a&gt; lured her toward those with whom she could hone her talent, and by the late 1940s began her career as a solo jazz vocal artist. 

She invited John Poole, a &lt;a href="w%3ADrum"&gt;drummer&lt;/a&gt; whom she met at the Club Starlite in Los Angeles, to join her. She once said of John, "If the drummer is no good, I can't make it. That's why I like John Poole. He's my favorite drummer." Their musical affiliation lasted 32 years. 

In &lt;a href="w%3A1955"&gt;1955&lt;/a&gt;, Norman Granz signed Anita to his company, &lt;a href="w%3AVerve%20records"&gt;Verve records&lt;/a&gt;, and her debut album "This is Anita" was the label's first &lt;a href="w%3AGramophone%20record"&gt;LP&lt;/a&gt;. Though she rarely sang ballads, her interpretation of &lt;a href="w%3AA%20Nightingale%20Sang%20in%20Berkeley%20Square%20%28song%29"&gt;"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&lt;/a&gt;," was considered so enthralling and fascinating that rocketed her career to new levels.

Her performances with jazz greats &lt;a href="w%3ALouis%20Armstrong"&gt;Louis Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADinah%20Washington"&gt;Dinah Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AThelonious%20Monk"&gt;Thelonious Monk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Shearling"&gt;George Shearling&lt;/a&gt; and others were renown. She became an international star after her performance of &lt;a href="w%3AJazz%20on%20a%20Summer%27s%20Day"&gt;"Jazz on a Summer's Day"&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3A1958"&gt;1958&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANewport%20Jazz%20Festival"&gt;Newport Jazz Festival&lt;/a&gt;, which later became a documentary film. 

Anita recorded 16 albums between &lt;a href="w%3A1957"&gt;1957&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A1963"&gt;1963&lt;/a&gt; with a variety of groups, ranging from small ensembles, big bands to large orchestras. Her performances' ranged from vibraphonist Cal Tjader to The 3 Sounds, a hard bop trio. Her first Japanese tour in &lt;a href="w%3A1964"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; was received with acclaim while stateside, the popularity of jazz was decreasing. 

Her nonconventional, self-initiated cold-turkey recovery from &lt;a href="w%3Aheroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; addiction at a &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt; retreat was successful, and she later returned to work. Her last public performance was at &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;'s Cinegrill Cabaret Lounge at age 83.

&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Miami"&gt;University of Miami&lt;/a&gt; head football coach &lt;a href="w%3ALarry%20Coker"&gt;Larry Coker&lt;/a&gt; was fired today after a five win, five loss season. 

He was fired after a disappointing season which was filled with conterversy and tragedy. On October 14th, a brawl in a game against &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20International%20University"&gt;Florida International University&lt;/a&gt; led to the suspension of 13 UM players. On November 7th, starting &lt;a href="w%3Adefensive%20lineman"&gt;defensive lineman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Pata"&gt;Bryan Pata&lt;/a&gt; was shot and killed outside his apartment in &lt;a href="w%3AKendall%2C%20Florida"&gt;Kendall&lt;/a&gt;. The Hurricanes also went though a four game losing streak.

"We have suffered disappointments and tragedy off and on the field," University of Miami President &lt;a href="w%3ADonna%20Shalala"&gt;Donna Shalala&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement regarding Coker's firing. "We can and will do better."

Coker firing came one day after a 17-14 win over 17th ranked &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20College"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt;. Coker may coach one more game if the Hurricanes get selected for a bowl game. &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Rutgers"&gt;University of Rutgers&lt;/a&gt; head coach &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Schiano"&gt;Greg Schiano&lt;/a&gt; and former &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Wisconsin"&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; coach &lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Alvarez"&gt;Barry Alvarez&lt;/a&gt; has emerged as one of the top candidates.

The report from the &lt;a href="w%3ACole%20Inquiry"&gt;Cole Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; has been handed down to &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General%20of%20Australia"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jeffrey"&gt;Michael Jeffrey&lt;/a&gt;. The inquiry was setup by the &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government just over twelve months ago to investigate claims of corruption in relation to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOil-for-Food%20Programme"&gt;Oil-for-Food Program&lt;/a&gt;.

The report will be made public next week.

Mainstream media has speculated that the report will recommend a string of charges against former AWB executives. It is believed that around &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$222 million of illegal payments were made to a Jordanian trucking company partly owned by &lt;a href="w%3ASaddan%20Hussein"&gt;Hussein's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; regime. AWB executives claim it was a victim of the Iraq government's corruption.

The Australian government has also come under scrutiny for failing to investigate reports of the AWB breaching UN sanctions against Iraq. It is expected that the report will contain little about the government's role as that is outside the inquiry's terms of reference.

The opposition is expected to attack the government when the report is tabled in parliament this week. Opposition spokesman for Public Accountability, Kelvin Thomson said the inquiry was set up to return a verdict wanted by the government and that the terms of reference were deliberately narrow.

"The inquiry has been given rorted terms of reference. It has been limited to reporting on the conduct of AWB, it has not been allowed to make findings concerning the conduct of Howard Government ministers."

"The Opposition expressly raised this with Commissioner Cole earlier this year and this was Commissioner Cole's response."

"So all along, the Howard Government has been seeking a verdict of AWB guilty, Government innocent," said Mr Thomson.

Former chairman of AWB, Trevor Flugge said he will not read the report when it is released and said he has done nothing wrong but fears going to gaol.

Speaking to ♡❤The Australian♡❤ newspaper, Mr Flugge said he had no interest in reading the Cole report because the case has been built against him from the outset.

"My public life is obviously over. And I can't honestly say that I miss it," Mr Flugge said.

<h1>Traces of radiation found where Litvinenko ate</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Traces%20of%20radiation%20found%20where%20Litvinenko%20ate&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Traces of radioactive material that apparently killed former Russian spy &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Litvinenko"&gt;Alexander Litvinenko&lt;/a&gt; were found at restaurants where he met other spies just before falling ill and at his home, &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; said Friday. 

Litvinenko, a former &lt;a href="w%3AKGB"&gt;KGB&lt;/a&gt; agent who was investigating the death of Russian journalist &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Politkovskaya"&gt;Anna Politkovskaya&lt;/a&gt; suddenly fell ill on November 1. In interviews, he stated that he had met with two former KGB officials earlier in the day, and then had had lunch at &lt;a href="w%3AItsu"&gt;Itsu&lt;/a&gt;, a sushi restaurant on Piccadilly in London. He died two days later at the age of 44. 

"Traces of &lt;a href="w%3APolonium-210"&gt;Polonium-210&lt;/a&gt; were found at the Itsu sushi restaurant in Piccadilly, the Millennium Hotel, Grosvenor Square, and at Mr. Litvinenko's home in Muswell Hill, London," Scotland Yard said in a statement. "We are not prepared to discuss further."

Roger Cox, head of the HPA's radiation protection branch, confirmed that the radiation was found in Litvinenko's body.

"A large quantity of alpha radiation from polonium-210 was found in the urine of Mr. Litvinenko", Cox said, adding that it was "unlikely" that the radioactive material came from natural sources.

Litvinenko, in a statement written before his death and read Friday, accused Russian President &lt;a href="Vladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; of being behind his murder, a charge Putin denied. 

"You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr. Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life," Litvinenko said in his statement.

Doctors all around the world have been explaining to the media how harmful Polonium-210 can be to a person. 

"Only a very, very small amount of polonium would need to be ingested to be fatal, but that depends on how pure the polonium is," said Dr. Mike Keir, a radiation protection adviser at the Royal Victoria Infirmary.

Chinese president, &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; has signed a free-trade deal with his Pakistani counterpart, &lt;a href="w%3APervez%20Musharraf"&gt;General Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;, during ongoing talks in &lt;a href="w%3AIslamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;. They signed a five-year pact to boost bilateral trade on Friday.

After a three-day trip to &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, Hu Jintao travelled to Pakistan for a four-day visit and received a royal reception at his arrival. His visit to Pakistan is the first by a Chinese leader in a decade.

According to diplomats, the agreement could triple the value of bilateral trade within next five years, to $15bn.

Pakistani commerce minister, &lt;a href="w%3AHumayoun%20Akhtar"&gt;Humayoun Akhtar&lt;/a&gt; said that new trade pact would energize the efforts to cut tariffs. He added that the trade would be completely tariff-free between the two countries within next five years.

Both countries have agreed a number of new defence and energy deals. The Pakistan Air Force and Chinese Aviation Industries have agreed for long term collaboration in the fields of aircraft manufacturing including Airborne Warning And Control Systems (AWACS).

The Vice President is seeking the Sunni royal family's influence and tribal connections to calm Iraq after an especially violent week.

A Saudi official said Cheney and Abdullah would discuss "the deteriorating situation in Iraq" as well as the situation in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the standoff with &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. Cheney will also meet the Saudi Crown Prince Sultan, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.

The Middle East has another summit planned for today but in Tehran. Iran, the United States' top rival in the Middle East, had planned its own summit today, inviting the presidents of Iraq and &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; in what was seen as a bid to assert its role as a powerbroker in the Iraqi conflict. Syria never responded to the invitation and Iraqi President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was unable to go to Iran today because Baghdad's airport was ordered closed after the burst of violence, and he said he would be unable to visit Iran before Sunday at the earliest.

Still, today Lebanon is the biggest issue for all Middle East countries. Saudi Arabia has strong links to the anti-Syrian bloc that dominates Lebanon's government and the U.S. accuses Iran — along with its ally Syria — of trying to overthrow Lebanon's U.S.-backed government.

With the hopes of funding the creation of a statue in northern India that would end up dwarfing the Statue of Liberty, an unprecedented collection of Buddhist artifacts continue crisscrossing American, Europe, and Asia in three different, but related collections.
The Maitreya Project, the brainchild of Lama Zopa Rinpoche, seeks to build a monument and development dedicated to Buddhism at Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh in northern India. The centerpiece of this massive development will be a 152m (500 ft) bronze statue of the Maitreya Buddha, the Buddha of the future.

Buddhist belief says that there have been Buddhas in the distant past and there will be Buddhas in the distant future. The historical Buddha, the one who was born in India about 2500 years ago, is known as Shakyamuni Buddha. Buddhist belief says that sometime in the distant future the teachings that Shakyamuni Buddha brought to Earth will fade away. At that point the Maitreya Buddha will be born and gain enlightenment in order to refresh and renew Buddhist teachings.

Along with the statue, the development is also planned to include temples, exhibition halls, parks, a museum, library, and a theater as well as a hospital and educational center.

In order to move forward with this project the Maitreya Project has created collections of artifacts that are touring the world. Once the statue is built these artifacts will be housed in it for viewing. 
Buddhist artifacts are usually associated with the body of the person involved. While they can be such things as bone and teeth, usually they are pearl-like objects that are found and collected after the enlightened person is creamated. These pearl-like objects are called ringsel.

There are three collections of artifacts currently touring American, Europe, and East Asia. They include relics from the immediate past Buddha, called Kasyapa, the historical Buddha, five of his original disciples, several Tibetan and Zen masters, and the 14th Dalai Lama, &lt;a href="w%3ATenzin%20Gyatso"&gt;Tenzin Gyatso&lt;/a&gt;.

Wikinews reporter Richard Kinne spent three days with the relics when the North American tour came to Ithaca, NY a few weeks ago. The relics travel with two caretakers, one of whom is always in close proximity to the relics. Setup for the relics display can take about four hours depending on the venue. Taking it down takes a bit under two hours. 
Each morning of the tour the relics are taken out of their padded case and placed in clear plexiglass display cases. The relics are displayed individually in small containers called stupas. Some containers appear very full, while others contian just one very small object. Each evening the process is reversed and the padded case stays with the relic caretakers. 

Between the morning and the evening people from all walks of life come to see the relics - believers, people who are curious, academics, Buddhist monks and nuns, both older folks and small children. While the Heart Relic Tour just does deals with displaying the relics, the sponsoring venue can add to the display in various ways such as lectures, meditation classes and demonstrations, or various other rituals.

The tour in North America reaches Jacksonville, FL during the first weekend of December. From there it will go to Miami between the 9th to the 11th, and then to Phoenix, AZ between the 15th to the 17th. In Asia the tour spends time in Malaysia in the first part of December.

To mark the end of the presidential campaign in &lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, opposition candidate &lt;a href="w%3AManuel%20Rosales"&gt;Manuel Rosales&lt;/a&gt; held a rally with up to 1.4 million people attending according to one source. Manuel Rosales is the opposition candidate to Venezuelan President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; who is running for his 2nd six-year term. 

The rally, which in Venezuela they call "Avalancha" because of its size, was held on the highway that runs through Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. The Presidential elections will be held December 3rd and Manuel Rosales has a much better shot of winning than most would have anticipated earlier in the year. Observers from Organization of American States, the European Union, and the Carter Center will be present to ensure that the elections are fair and make sure the people's vote is secured. 

Large public demonstrations are banned by the government for December 3rd and 4th to ensure the elections "go smoothly."

Both &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJapan%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; have qualifed for the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; next October and November. The World Cup pools are now starting to take their final shape, with just two repechage positions remaining. 86 nations have attempted to qualify for next years' tournament.

Georgia drew 11-all &lt;a href="w%3APortugal%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; in the final leg of the last series of European qualification, however in the previous match, Georgia were victorious, thus on points, Georgia go through to France. Georgia join Pool D, where they will face &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;, hosts &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIreland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANamibia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;. Georgia have previously qualified for one other World Cup, the &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2003 tournament&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Portugal's loss, their hopes to qualify are still very much alive, though they now face &lt;a href="w%3AMorocco%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; for the right to then face &lt;a href="w%3AUruguay%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; to take out one of the two repechage spots in the World Cup.

Japan defeated &lt;a href="w%3AKorea%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt; 54 points to nil, this coming after their win over &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the week. Japan go through to Pool B, where they join &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. Japan have qualified for every &lt;a href="w%3ARugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;World Cup&lt;/a&gt; since the first tournament in 1987. Korea (who have yet to debut at the Rugby World Cup) can also still qualify, as they will now play &lt;a href="w%3ATonga%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Tonga&lt;/a&gt; for the second repechage position.

A suicide bomber has killed at least seven people in an attack on a restaurant situated in south-eastern &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. Twenty people are seriously injured in the attack.

The attack took place in the &lt;a href="w%3AUrgun%20District"&gt;Urgun&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href="w%3APaktika%20Province"&gt;Paktika&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AProvinces%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;, which shares its border with that of &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;.

Governor Mohammed Akram Akhpelwak said that most of those killed are civilians. He added that intention of the attack could have been to target a senior provincial official and an Afghan special forces commander.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;United States Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; will hear arguments this Wednesday to determine whether the &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush%20administration"&gt;Bush administration&lt;/a&gt; must regulate &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20dioxide"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; emissions to deal with the &lt;a href="w%3Aglobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; threat. The case is presented by a group of environmentalists and leaders of some large cities.

The coalition, led by Massachusetts, demanded to review the case and insisted that carbon-dioxide is harmful to the environment as much as lead and smog-causing elements. The Bush administration is expected to argue before the court that the EPA has lacked the power under the Clean Air Act to regulate CO as a pollutant.

Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly and others have argued that this case is very important from the point of view of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s statutory responsibilities to deal with the most pressing environmental problem.

The case comes just a few weeks after a federal government report concluded that far fewer polar bear cubs are surviving off Alaska's northern coast, something many environmentalists are blaming on global warming. Also earlier this month the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration"&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/a&gt; said that signs of warming continue in the Arctic with a decline in sea ice, an increase in shrubs growing on the tundra, and rising concerns about the Greenland ice sheet.

&lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stephane Dion&lt;/a&gt; has won the leadership of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; today at &lt;a href="w%3APalais%20des%20congr%C3%A8s%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al"&gt;Palais des congrès de Montréal&lt;/a&gt; with 2,521 (54.7%) votes to former Harvard academic &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt; with 2,084 (45.3%) votes. Dion entered the convention as a &lt;a href="w%3Adark%20horse"&gt;dark horse&lt;/a&gt; but surged past three other candidates to win on the fourth ballot.

The Liberal party dominated politics in Canada for the past century. The Conservative party won government in a January 2006 election held amid a desire for regime change and a patronage scandal in mostly French-speaking Quebec.

"Stephen, if you're listening, we are counting the days until the next election," Dion told Conservative Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; during his victory speech.

"What started as a network of loyal supporters and became a movement reaching every territory and province in our country. This movement ended in the great honour you have given me today," he told his party's convention after the results were announced.

"The most exciting race in the history of our party is over," Dion, a former environment minister, told the 5,000 party delegates. "Let's get ready for the election."

Taking aim at the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aminority%20government"&gt;minority government&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, Dion told the crowd and a national television audience, "We do not believe the Conservatives have bad intentions; we simply believe they lead to bad results." 

Dion's come-from-behind victory was a surprise to many observers and much of the media who had expected Ignatieff or former Ontario premier &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt; to win. Dion was in fourth place in terms of committed delegates who had been elected by local &lt;a href="w%3Ariding%20association"&gt;riding associations&lt;/a&gt; but was able to place third in the first ballot, edging former Ontario education minister &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; by two votes, due to the support of ex-officio delegates who were free to support any candidate. 

Rae appeared to have momentum due to the support of several former candidates and was well-positioned immediately after the second ballot when fifth-place &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Dryden"&gt;Ken Dryden&lt;/a&gt; threw his support to the former Ontario premier. The decision by Kennedy to withdraw and endorse Dion changed the convention's dynamic and gave Dion enough momentum to vault over Rae and Ignatieff to place first on the third ballot. Rae was eliminated and did not publicly endorse either of the remaining candidates but the victory of Dion was nevertheless seen as inevitable at this point by many observers, particularly as a number of Rae's high-profile supporters such as former finance minister &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Goodale"&gt;Ralph Goodale&lt;/a&gt; and former candidates Volpe and Dryden threw their support to Dion. 

His campaign emphasized the environment (particularly support for the &lt;a href="w%3AKyoto%20Accord%23Position%20of%20Canada"&gt;Kyoto Accord&lt;/a&gt; which has been rejected by the Conservative government), sustainable development, and social justice.
Dion, 51, was a professor at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversit%C3%A9%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al"&gt;University of Montréal&lt;/a&gt; when he was recruited by then prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Chretien"&gt;Jean Chretien&lt;/a&gt; to run for the Liberals in a 1996 by-election. In a rare move, since repeated by the Conservatives, Dion was appointed to &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Cabinet"&gt;Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; without having won a seat in the House of Commons. He won the by-election and served as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs under Chretien and then as Minister of the Environment under &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; who succeeded Chretien as prime minister in 2003.

Dion was seen as a longshot when he announced his candidacy to succeed Martin in April 2006 but soon emerged in the pack of four candidates who were seen as being in the first tier of contenders with the best chance of victory. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt; both were seen as having serious liabilities due to the former's several-decade absence from Canada in 2000 to 2005 and perceived support for the war in Iraq, and the latter's past as a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; including a stint as NDP &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Premier of Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. Dion was positioned as a compromise candidate with several surveys showing him to be the second choice of most delegates. As well, Kennedy's lack of fluency in French and poor showing in Quebec during the delegate selectio process eliminated him as a viable second choice for many delegates.

It is reported that The Head of &lt;a href="w%3ARosAtom"&gt;RosAtom&lt;/a&gt; Russia’s Federal Atomic Agency, &lt;a href="w%3ASergei%20Kiriyenko"&gt;Sergei Kiriyenko&lt;/a&gt;, will meet Iran’s Foreign Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AManouchehr%20Mottaki"&gt;Manouchehr Mottaki&lt;/a&gt;, in Tehran December 11 to discuss economic affairs of mutual interest.

Kiriyenko, former Russian Prime Minister, had proposed in February this year, that Russia would provide Iran with enriched uranium for its nuclear power plants, thus avoiding the need for Iran to build plants that might be used for weapon production. Since then there have been Security Council resolutions and threats of economic sanctions against Iran which has persisted in building an enrichment plant. 

Russia has been building a light water reactor for Iran at &lt;a href="w%3ABushehr"&gt;Bushehr&lt;/a&gt; but there have been delays in completion, ‘for technical reasons’. The original reactors at Busheh, contracted to be built by Siemens in 1975, were bombed in 1985 and 1988 by Iraq. 

Now, having trained Iranian troops in their use, Russia is delivering a consignment of Tor-M1 missiles to Iran. These are ground to air missiles for defence purposes with a range of about 18,000 feet.

The &lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;n Government has declared victory for a third term, with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bracks"&gt;Steve Bracks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; now the state's longest-serving &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Premier. Following last weekend's state election, despite a primary vote swing of 4.4 per cent against the State Government, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were unable to get the substantial shift neeeded to unseat Bracks' government.

Premier Steve Bracks told the ABC that the win is a historic result. "Only the second time in 150 years that a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has won three consecutive elections," he said. Labor's Victorian president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Shorten"&gt;Bill Shorten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said the party expected to lose some seats after achieving a record win in 2002. 

Opposition leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Baillieu"&gt;Ted Baillieu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; conceded defeat but said the election result showed a renewed confidence in his team. "I look forward to working with them to keep this Government accountable," he said. He urged the Liberal Party to work towards the 2010 campaign.

Votes are still to be fully counted but the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have achieved eight Lower House seats, while the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Labor are still battling to see which party obtains the inner-city seat of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Age"&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ reports that Mr Bracks could have a majority of 22 seats in the new parliament &amp;mdash; down from 36. 

The Bracks government was elected in 1999. Bracks is now Labor's longest serving Victorian premier, exceeding &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Cain%20%28junior%29"&gt;John Cain Jr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's 3,047 day reign.

World Madison champion &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsaac%20G%C3%A1lvez"&gt;Isaac Gálvez Lopez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; died in the early hours of Sunday morning after crashing on the fifth day of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Days%20of%20Ghent"&gt;Six Days of Ghent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; track cycling race.

He collided with &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;'s Dimitri DeFauw during the second Madison of the evening and hit a metal barrier. He was immediately knocked unconscious, and despite being resuscitated, he was pronounced dead at the Gent University Clinic hospital.

The race was immediately suspended, and the final day's racing was cancelled.

At the time of the accident, Gálvez and team-mate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Llaneras"&gt;Juan Llaneras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were lying second in the overall standings, one lap behind the Belgium/&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGerman"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pair &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIljo%20Keisse"&gt;Iljo Keisse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Bartko"&gt;Robert Bartko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Negotiations about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula may be resumed soon. Talks which had included &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;Democratic People's Republic of Korea&lt;/a&gt; (DPRK) in Northern Korea, the &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;Republic of Korea&lt;/a&gt; (ROK) in South Korea, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; broke down last November when USA took sanctions against the DPRK alleging that it had engaged in money laundering.

The DPRK alarmed the world and provoked international denunciation by conducting an underground nuclear test on October 8, 2006. Since then the DPRK has indicated its willingness to resume talks on nuclear disarmament, but no date has yet been fixed for a formal meeting. 

Kenichiro Sasae, head of Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau has arrived in Beijing to meet Wu Dawei, vice foreign minister of China 

The DPRK's Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, may also visit Beijing shortly.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chong"&gt;Michael Chong&lt;/a&gt;, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Minister of Sport, and MP for the riding of &lt;a href="w%3AWellington%E2%80%94Halton%20Hills"&gt;Wellington—Halton Hills&lt;/a&gt;, has resigned over &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper's&lt;/a&gt; Quebec motion. The motion asks MPs if Quebec is a nation "within a united Canada".

Chong opposed the vote saying that it was akin to ethnic nationalism, which he opposes. 

"It is nothing else but the recognition of ethnic nationalism, and that is something I cannot support. It cannot be interpreted as the recognition of a territorial nationalism, or it does not refer to the geographic entity, but to a group of people," Chong said.

"I am resigning as minister so I can abstain from the vote tonight," Chong said at a news conference in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, the nations capital. "While I am loyal to my party and to my leader, my first loyalty is to my country. I believe in one nation undivided called Canada."

Chong remains a Conservative member of Parliament. Later in the day, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed &lt;a href="w%3AYork%E2%80%94Simcoe"&gt;York—Simcoe, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; MP &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Van%20Loan"&gt;Peter Van Loan&lt;/a&gt; to the position vacated by Chong.

Harper asked Liberal race contender &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt; for guidance with the Quebec motion instead of asking the now former Intergovernmental Affairs Minister, Michael Chong.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt;, the front-runner in the Liberal leadership race, has proposed a similar motion. Liberal leadership candidate, &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, said he opposes the motion and finds it divisive to national unity and could advance the separatist agenda.

The vote will be held tonight in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; duck and goose hunters, and waterfowl hunters in other parts of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20of%20America"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, might for the first time find themselves approached by state game officials who are testing harvested birds for the presence of &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt;.
The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) announced last week, at the start of the waterfowl hunting season, that it is working cooperatively with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Interior in its national strategy to monitor the spread of the pathogenic strain of Asian H5N1 among migratory birds. Species of particular interest are the &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Goose"&gt;brant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Bewick%27s%20Swan"&gt;tundra swan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Mute%20Swan"&gt;mute swan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A%20Mallard"&gt;mallard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3A%20Snow%20Goose"&gt;snow goose&lt;/a&gt;.

VDGIF staff are in the field checking popular hunting spots, waterway boat ramps, and wildlife management areas where returning hunters may be asked to allow them to perform a swab test on bagged birds. The VDGIF press release says the procedure only takes seconds to perform, and those who bagged 3 birds of the targeted species can call the department to have someone come check the birds.

Avian Flu first surfaced in Asia in 2003. It is uncertain what factors contribute to the spread of the disease, but newer strains of &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20spread%20of%20H5N1%20in%202006"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; are more communicable than earlier recognized strains. "Although the spread of H5N1 in Asia has been primarily due to movement of domestic birds, the movement of this virus into wild birds raised the possibility that these species may also spread the virus," the U.S.Department of the Interior found in its March 2006 interagency strategic plan for early detection of the disease. It was found that Avian flu moved into wild birds and caused mortality among species of barheaded geese, brown-headed gulls, black-headed gulls, ruddy shelducks, and great cormorants in China in 2005.

The migratory flyways considered most at risk of disease transmission are on the Pacific side of the Americas in Alaska and the Pacific NorthWest, closest to Asia. The Atlantic flyway shares migratory influence from Europe and Africa where the Avian Flu has also been found.

A low pathogenic strain of H5N1 that currently exists in North America is common among waterfowl. Testing for the more virulent strains involves swabbing the bird's throat or rectum.

The &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; approved a motion recognizing the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQuebecois"&gt;Québécois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [the people of Quebec] as a nation within &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, Monday night, by a margin of 266 to 16. The government motion was supported by the opposition Liberal, New Democratic and Bloc Québécois parties although 15 Liberal MPs voted against it along with Independent MP &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGarth%20Turner"&gt;Garth Turner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Several Conservative MPs abstained from the vote including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chong"&gt;Michael Chong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who resigned earlier in the day as Intergovernmental Affairs minister due to his opposition to the motion. While the dissenting Liberal MPs do not face censure by their party, Conservative backbenchers who opposed the resolution could only go as far as abstaining if they wished to remain in the Tory caucus, according to Mr. Chong. 

The surprise motion was introduced by Prime Minister &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; on November 22 in response to a motion by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20sovereignty"&gt;separatist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Bloc Québécois that the House recognize Quebec as a nation. The government resolution substituted the word Québécois for Quebeckers and added the words "within a united Canada". The motion reads: "That this House recognize that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada."

The government has stated that they have no intention to amend the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20Canada"&gt;Constitution of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to recognize Quebec's national status although several political analysts have argued that such an attempt is now inevitable. 

Recognizing Quebec as a nation is a concept that has divided the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the period leading to its leadership convention this weekend with leadership contender &lt;a href="Michael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt; proposing that idea earlier this fall. Leadership candidates &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Dryden"&gt;Ken Dryden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Volpe"&gt;Joe Volpe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; voted against the House of Commons resolution and contender &lt;a href="Gerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; also expressed his opposition while &lt;a href="Bob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;, who have both been critical of Ignatieff's call for a constitutional amendment have expressed their support for the House of Commons resolution.

A pair of &lt;a href="w%3Aby-election"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt;s called to fill vacancies in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Canadian House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; have resulted in the status quo being maintained with &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href="w%3AGlen%20Pearson"&gt;Glen Pearson&lt;/a&gt; beating back a strong challenge by &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20May"&gt;Elizabeth May&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20North%20Centre"&gt;London North Centre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARaymond%20Gravel"&gt;Raymond Gravel&lt;/a&gt; retaining the Quebec riding of &lt;a href="w%3ARepentigny%20%28electoral%20district%29"&gt;Repentigny&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Quebecois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt;.

The by-elections were necessitated by the resignation of Liberal MP &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Fontana"&gt;Joe Fontana&lt;/a&gt; who left parliament in a failed bid to become mayor of London, Ontario and by the death of BQ MP &lt;a href="w%3ABeno%C3%AEt%20Sauvageau"&gt;Benoît Sauvageau&lt;/a&gt; in a tragic car crash.

The London vote was closely watched due to May's attempt to become Canada's first Green Party MP and by the high-profile candidacy of former London mayor &lt;a href="w%3ADianne%20Haskett"&gt;Dianne Haskett&lt;/a&gt; running for the Conservatives. 

Pearson, a firefighter and community activist, won London North Centre with 34.7% of the vote with the Green Party's Elizabeth May coming 3,000 votes behind with 25.9% and Tory Dianne Haskett finishing third with 24%. The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMegan%20Walker"&gt;Megan Walker&lt;/a&gt; came fourth with 14.2%.

In the Montreal-area riding of Repentigny the BQ's Gravel won easily with 66.3% of the vote, Conservative &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Bourgon"&gt;Stéphane Bourgon&lt;/a&gt; finished well back in second place with 18.7% with New Democrat Réjean Bellemare coming in third with 7% of the vote.

The votes were also viewed as a test of the popularity of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aminority%20government"&gt;minority government&lt;/a&gt;. In Repentigny, the vote shares were similar to the outcomes in the Montreal-area riding in the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Canadian%20election"&gt;last federal election&lt;/a&gt; with the BQ doing slightly better and the Liberals slightly worse. In London North Centre the major change was in the Green Party's result with Elizabeth May quadrupled the party's previous result by taking votes from all of the other parties. The Liberals and Tories each lost 5% while the NDP dropped 10% or one-third of their votes from the January 23rd general election.

The envoys of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; have reached &lt;a href="Beijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. They will hold a meeting to negotiate over the North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.

The US State Department has said that a meeting between Christopher Hill, US negotiator, and DPRK's Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan was an “open possibility”.

The top North Korean envoy, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Kye%20Gwan"&gt;Kim Kye Gwan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had indicated that the initiative for negotiations should be taken by the United States and that the DPRK was ready to negotiate at any time. He said that DPTK was in a “dignified position” as it had demonstrated through its nuclear test that it could defend itself against sanctions and other pressures. 

Any meetings between the envoys will be informal and, according to the Chun Yung-woo the South Korean envoy, will concentrate on preparing the ground for negotiations and will not address the issues directly. 

Christopher Hill said "The issue for us is to make sure we are extremely well-planned and ready for the six-party talks, which we do anticipate will get going at some point very soon,"

The negotiations are expected to discuss such matters as US economic sanctions against DRPK, the recent underground nuclear test in North Korea and the development of long range ballistic missiles by the DPRK.

Atmospheric scientists warn that &lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse%20gas"&gt;greenhouse gas&lt;/a&gt; emissions are increasing more rapidly, despite global efforts to curb the use of fossil fuels, new research by &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20Organisation"&gt;Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (CSIRO) shows.

According to CSIRO research scientist Dr Mike Raupach, 7.9 billion tonnes of carbon were emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide in 2005 - a doubling in the rate of increase since 1990 - and the rate of increase continues to accelerate.

Data from the Cape Grim air pollution monitoring station in north-west &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; shows carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 2.5% each year for the past five years. "From 2000 to 2005, the growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions was more than 2.5% per year, whereas in the 1990s it was less than 1% per year," Dr Raupach says. 

Dr Raupach, who co-chairs the international &lt;a href="http%3A//www.globalcarbonproject.org/"&gt;Global Carbon Project&lt;/a&gt; also, was surprised by his research results. "It shows recent efforts globally to reduce emissions have had little impact on emissions growth," he said. The CSIRO found that in global terms, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; has the highest current growth rate in CO emissions although it's emissions per person are below the global average. China's accumulated contribution since the start the 1800s is only five per cent of the global total. The USA and Europe have each contributed more than 25% of accumulated global emissions. 

Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere — a separate measure to carbon emissions — had also increased at an unprecedented rate. Dr Paul Fraser, also from &lt;a href="w%3ACSIRO%20Marine%20and%20Atmospheric%20Research"&gt;CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research&lt;/a&gt;, said that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide grew by two parts per million in 2005, the fourth year in a row of above-average growth. "To have four years in a row of above-average carbon dioxide growth is unprecedented," Dr Fraser said. 

He said the trend over recent years suggests the growth rate is accelerating, "signifying that fossil fuels are having an impact on greenhouse gas concentrations in a way we haven’t seen in the past."

The bodies of two Canadian soldiers killed by a suicide bomber in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar, Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; were brought back to Canada. Both were from &lt;a href="w%3ACFB%20Petawawa"&gt;CFB Petawawa&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3APetawawa%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Petawawa, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

Their vehicle has intercepted on a road by a suicide bomber. A helicopter came helping all injured and possibly dead soldiers into it where they received medical attention somewhere safe. This time, their vehicle was blown up by a man's car when he drived into them and detonated his car. Two Canadians were killed, the rest were injured.

Canadian, &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; soldiers stood at &lt;a href="w%3AKandhar%20Airfield"&gt;Kandhar Airfield&lt;/a&gt; Thursday to farewell Cpl. Albert Storm and Officer Robert Girouard. A piper played ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmazing%20Grace"&gt;Amazing Grace&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ as the Canadian flag-covered coffins were carried onto the &lt;a href="w%3AC-130%20Hercules"&gt;C-130 Hercules&lt;/a&gt; aircraft for their flight home.

"It's very hard for me to do it but I know my colleague, my friend and soldier, is going home to a restful place," Cpl. Victor Thibault, 38, of &lt;a href="w%3ADigby%2C%20Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Digby, Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; said to the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Press"&gt;Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt;. "He's done what he had to do and I believe that's good... He was a good friend. I will miss him," he said. 

Forty-four Canadian soldiers as well as one diplomat have been killed in Afghanistan since 2002. About 2,500 Canadian troops are serving in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; internet censors have re-blocked the online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. The site, previously unblocked in early November after a year-long ban, once again appears to be inaccessible to &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; web surfers. 

Many surfers had welcomed access to the site, with a 75% increase in the number of new articles posted, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The ban on Wikipedia is likely an effort to contain information relating to sensitive topics in China, such as &lt;a href="w%3ATibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;. CNN reports that Chinese registrations on Wikipedia had jumped to around 1,300 a day after the unblocking, more than three times the previous average of 400 per-day. 

It is still unclear if the ban will be lifted again, as the list of blocked and unblocked material for Beijing's internet zone is constantly changed.

A number of properties in a &lt;a href="w%3AHare%20Krishna"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt; village in &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; were demolished on November 21, by the local authorities, causing international outrage by religious freedom groups and associations alike. Since the attack fears are now rising within the community of further demolition to the remaining properties, including the main &lt;a href="w%3AHindu%20temple"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; structure.

"The community is in shock, but they are determined to defend their homes and place of worship," community member Govinda Swami told Forum 18 News Service. He says destruction of the temple would be "devastating".

The authorities in Kazaksthan claim that the Hare Krishna devotees had no official right to their homes. However human rights activists Ninel Fokina and Andrei Grishin, state in reply that while 13 out of the 66 Hare Krishna homes were destroyed on court orders, "the adjacent houses of other people who do not belong to the Society for Krishna Consciousness were left untouched even though their title deeds have the same status".

The Hare village itself, known as 'Sri Vrindavan Dham commune' (named after &lt;a href="w%3AVrindavan"&gt;Vrindavan forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; is based in the Keskelen district, in the town of Seleksia, close to Almaty. It was the only village of it's type run by Hare Krishna devotees in the country.

According to human rights activist Yevgeni Zhovtis: "Unfortunately Kazakh law does not prohibit evictions during the winter period and also does not oblige the court bailiffs to give those being evicted a few days notice," "All the same, there were crude violations of the law. The court bailiffs had the right to evict the residents of the houses but not to demolish the buildings themselves. It was also a very crude violation to throw the belongings of the Krishna devotees into the mud. The court bailiffs were obliged to put the devotees' belongings into store."

Local journalist Grishin claims to have had his camera confiscated by the Police and to have been threatened "If I see you here again, I will personally smash your eyes, even though I am the hakim."

Protests are being made by Hindu groups and members of the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Society%20for%20Krishna%20Consciousness"&gt;International Society for Krishna Consciousness&lt;/a&gt; around the world in an attempt to halt any further demolition or other forms of alleged religious persecution. Groups within the UK have brought the issue to the attention of both &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, and the House of Commons.

One of the Indian political parties, &lt;a href="w%3ABharatiya%20Janata%20Party"&gt;Bharatiya Janata Party&lt;/a&gt; criticised the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20India"&gt;central government&lt;/a&gt; for keeping silence over the issue. The party is expected to follow the saffron brotherhood agenda in the &lt;a href="Rajnath%20re-elected%20as%20chief%20of%20Bharatiya%20Janata%20Party"&gt;second term of Rajnath Singh&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Canadian House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; will re-open the debate on &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; next Wednesday, December 6th, when it debates a resolution to reconsider the &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Marriage%20Act"&gt;Civil Marriage Act&lt;/a&gt; that was passed by the previous &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;-led parliament in 2005. In the intervening election, the victorious &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;s promised that if they were elected parliament would hold a &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20vote"&gt;free vote&lt;/a&gt; on whether to amend or repeal the Act. 

Several surveys have suggested that MPs in the &lt;a href="w%3Aminority%20parliament"&gt;minority parliament&lt;/a&gt; will overwhelmingly reaffirm support for same-sex marriage once a vote has held. The pro-same sex marriage group &lt;a href="w%3ACanadians%20for%20Equal%20Marriage"&gt;Canadians for Equal Marriage&lt;/a&gt; estimates that the motion will be defeated by at least 35 votes. This has prompted supporters of same-sex marriage to urge that a vote be held as soon as possible while opponents of gay marriage have been urging the government to delay the vote until the next election, expected early in 2007, in hopes of the election of a Conservative &lt;a href="w%3Amajority%20government"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; that would repeal the act. A number of Conservative MPs and strategists have supported an early vote, however, in the belief that the same-sex issue would hurt the Tories in an election campaign by emphasizing a social conservative agenda that is unpopular in urban areas and Quebec.

Traces of the radioactive substance, &lt;a href="w%3APolonium-210"&gt;Polonium-210&lt;/a&gt; have been found on two &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; planes. The airline was alerted late Tuesday evening by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; government that three of its planes were of interest in the investigation into the death of ex-KGB agent &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Litvinenko"&gt;Alexander Litvinenko&lt;/a&gt; from radiation poisoning.

Two planes are located at the &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, and one at the Russian &lt;a href="w%3ADomodedovo%20International%20Airport"&gt;Domodedovo International Airport&lt;/a&gt; in Moscow.

The two Heathrow planes were forensically examined Wednesday and the presence of traces of a radioactive substance were confirmed. A British team consisting of what are thought to be police experts is leaving for Russia to test the third plane, according to the ♡❤BBC♡❤.

The public health risk that passengers on the planes under investigation have been poisoned is very low. Up to 33,000 passengers are being urged to contact BA, NHS or their doctor if they have travelled on the 221 European flights which travelled all over Europe, including Russia as far back as "the end of October". Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA, said: "I am advised that the health risk is actually very low." 3,000 staff will also be checked out.

The Home Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reid%20%28politician%29"&gt;John Reid&lt;/a&gt; is expected to make a statement to Parliament concerning the ongoing investigation into the death of Alexander Litvinenko on Thursday.

All three planes are Boeing 767s used for short haul flight which were taken out of service when the government contacted BA on Tuesday night.

Traces of Polonium-210 have been found at other places that Mr Litvinenko visited in London, Britain.

Pat Troop, chief executive of Health Protection Agency, said: "What we have heard is that it's either traces or very low levels and what we have learnt so far in our investigation... is that where we have got these areas of low level radiation it doesn't seem to pose a significant health threat."

Armed Fijian soldiers took control of the streets of &lt;a href="w%3ASuva"&gt;Suva, Fiji&lt;/a&gt; just before dawn

In a show of force, the troops fired a mortar into the harbour and over Nukulau Island, where &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Speight"&gt;George Speight&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AFiji%20coup%20of%202000"&gt;Fiji Coup of 2000&lt;/a&gt;, is currently serving a term of life imprisonment for his role in the overthrow of the constitutional government. Most of the mortar rounds fell into the ocean.

Soldiers, travelling in a convoy of trucks, set up barricades on key roads that led into the central business district of Suva while others patrolled the city. 

Major &lt;a href="w%3ANeumi%20Leweni"&gt;Neumi Leweni&lt;/a&gt;, a military spokesman, said that the activity is not a military coup in disguise. "The exercise is in anticipation of any foreign intervention and the [Fiji military] is taking all precautionary measures." He pointed out to sea where an Australian black hawk helicopter had crashed and where three Australian warships were moored. Australian officials said the ships were there in case Australian citizens needed to be evacuated.

The black hawk helicopter that had crashed was attempting to land on the HMAS Kanimbla, and its passengers were Special Air Service soldiers. Referring to the crash, Major Leweni said: "[It] just confirms that there are other forces out there and that is exactly why we are doing this exercise".

Talks in New Zealand between &lt;a href="w%3ALaisenia%20Qarase"&gt;Laisenia Qarase&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Minister of Fiji, and , military commander &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Bainimarama"&gt;Commodore Frank Bainimarama&lt;/a&gt; concluded without an agreement. &lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Peters"&gt;Winston Peters&lt;/a&gt;, foreign minister for New Zealand, said the talks were "lengthy, serious and meaningful", but ultimately unsuccessful. Mr. Qarase said the three hour talks were not long enough to get to any conclusion, "...it was a good start and there is need for further consultations on some of the issues." 

Mr Qarase arrived at Nadi via a Royal New Zealand Air Force plane and then flew on an Air Chatham Islands plan to Suva. He was met by questioning media. Mr Qarase remained quiet. Commodore Bainimarama also said nothing to the awaiting media when he arrived in Fiji on a commercial flight.

Mr Qarase has requested that all regional foreign ministers come to a meeting being held in Sydney, Australia tomorrow that is related to the coup threats.

Countries that are part of the Pacific Forum are able to help other member countries, if the government asks for help.

Ambassadors from the United States of America, Australia and Britain have all met with Fijian military officers to seek insurances that there wasn't going to be a coup. Major Lewini responded angrily, "[It is] inappropriate for a civilian diplomat to visit a military camp and seek to speak directly to officers," he said.

"I'm not aware anyone's threatening foreign intervention. I can assure you New Zealand isn't," &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;, Helen Clark, Prime Minister of New Zealand, said.

At the same time, &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Hughes%20%28police%29"&gt;Andrew Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, police commissioner for Fiji, is currently on leave in Brisbane following threats. &lt;a href="w%3AMoses%20Driver"&gt;Moses Driver&lt;/a&gt; will now act as the police commissioner. 

The military has said they will "clean up" the government if the armed forces do not get three controversial bills passed and all investigations into senior military officers are dropped.

The military has said that they do not need police permission to conduct such exercises.

&lt;a href="w%3AEconomy%20of%20India"&gt;India's economy&lt;/a&gt; has grown by 9.2 percent in Q2 (July-September) of the fiscal year 2006-07, which was 8.4 percent last year for the same quarter.

The annual growth rate, of &lt;a href="w%3AEconomy%20of%20Asia"&gt;Asia's&lt;/a&gt; fourth-largest economy, for the quarter is also higher than that of the last quarter's (April-June), which was 8.9 percent. India's annual economic growth has been an average of 8 percent since past three fiscal years.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Statistical%20Organisation"&gt;Central Statistical Organisation&lt;/a&gt;, real estate and communications-led services recorded an unexpected increase of 13.9% in the quarter.

Manufacturing sectors, which contribute 17 percent in the GDP, have been recorded 11.9 percent growth comparing to last year's 11.3 percent for the same quarter.

&lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20India"&gt;Reserve Bank of India&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Reserve%20Bank%20of%20India%20hikes%20repo%20rate%2C%20keeps%20most%20key%20interest%20rates%20stable"&gt;hiked repo rate&lt;/a&gt; by 0.25 percent to 7.25 percent, keeping the reverse repo rate unchanged at 6% on October 31. Governor &lt;a href="w%3AY.%20Venugopal%20Reddy"&gt;Yaga Venugopal Reddy&lt;/a&gt; said that production capacity must match with demand pressure in the economy to prevent inflation flaring up.

Finance minister &lt;a href="w%3AP.%20Chidambaram"&gt;P. Chidambaram&lt;/a&gt; said that he was very worried about the higher inflation rate due to supply side constraints.

<h1>Warlords gang-rape a woman in Badakhshan province of Afghanistan</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Warlords%20gang-rape%20a%20woman%20in%20Badakhshan%20province%20of%20Afghanistan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A local commander and his 11 men are alleged to have gang-raped a 22-year-old woman in Shahre Buzurg district of the northeastern &lt;a href="w%3ABadakhshan"&gt;Badakhshan&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; on November 28. 

The crime was reported to have been committed in the Shah Dasht village by a local warlord called Mujtaba who belongs to &lt;a href="w%3AJamiat%20Islami"&gt;Jamiat-e-Islami Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; led by Burhanuddin Rabbani (now member of the parliament). 

Local villagers told journalists that they have complained a number of times about brutalities and lawlessness in their village by warlords but police and local officials took no action because these warlords were powerful and backed by &lt;a href="w%3ABurhanuddin%20Rabbani"&gt;Burhanuddin Rabbani&lt;/a&gt;, who himself is based in Badakhshan. 

Qari Jehangir, husband of the victim, says the armed men raped his wife and when his 2 children were crying, one of the assailants urinated in their mouths. The victim was warned that she would be killed if she registered a complaint with authorities. 

Brig. Sayed Habib Saeedkhili, the border police chief in Badakhshan confirmed the crime and told to the media that commander Mujtaba and his men are famous drug traffickers who succeeded to flee but his brother, Anayat, has been arrested. 

According to Pajhwok Afghan News, the director of the Women Affairs Department of Badakhshan, Zofanoon Natiq was not aware of the incident. She told the news agency that said no such incident had occurred in Badakhshan before.

The head of the Independent Human Rights Commission at northeast zone, speaking to Pajhwok Afghan News, said, "This is a crime, and will also stimulate anger of the people." He added that weakness of the local authorities was the main reason such cases recurred. 

Crimes against women are on the rise across Afghanistan but especially in Badakhshan province, which is the stronghold of Jamiat-e-Islami Afghanistan -- despite the Canadian-led occupying force. Tha Jamait has its armed militia and holds key government posts in the area. 

In April 2005, Amina, a 29 year-old woman was publicly stoned to death on the basis of a district court's decision in this province.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20lawsuit%20challenges%20church%20as%20polling%20place&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
At its official launch in Washington DC yesterday, the Appignani Humanist Legal Center (AHLC) announced its filing of a lawsuit in &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; challenging the use of a church as a polling place during the recent U.S. midterm elections. The AHLC is representing Jerry Rabinowitz and the action is against Arthur Anderson in his capacity as supervisor of elections for &lt;a href="w%3APalm%20Beach%20County"&gt;Palm Beach County&lt;/a&gt;. But the organization indicates that more lawsuits in other states are expected to follow—all being part of an effort to show that churches are improper polling places because they cannot be religiously and politically neutral and because their use is subject to widespread abuse. 

“Churches are currently the most common polling location in America” according to James Hurley, the lead attorney handling the case. Speaking at yesterday’s press conference, Hurley noted that while some churches cover or remove religious symbols in those parts of their facilities used as polling places, not all do so, nor is the practice required everywhere. “When asked, the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Office said there was no rule requiring removal of such religious icons,” Hurley added. 
Rabinowitz’s complaint is that, because he was assigned to vote at Emmanuel Catholic Church in Delray Beach, Florida, he found it necessary when entering the polling place to “walk past a church-sponsored ‘pro-life’ banner framed by multiple giant crosses before even entering the church” to vote. This caused him to be “extremely upset” regarding the religious setting of the polls. According to Hurley, “Rabinowitz observed many religious symbols in plain view” in the voting area. They were “surrounding the election judges and in direct line above the voting machines. These objects included a sign declaring that ‘Each of Us Matters to God,’ multiple crucifixes, a sign that says ‘God, I Make a Difference,’ a large copy of the Lord’s Prayer and a Hail Mary, and a large poster of the Ten Commandments.” When Rabinowitz objected and “asked election officials to remove or cover them for the remainder of the voting” officials allegedly refused to do so. 

“This is clearly a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,” Hurley concluded, because it “has the primary effect of advancing religion.” 

Also speaking at the press conference were the president and executive director of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Humanist%20Association"&gt;American Humanist Association&lt;/a&gt;, the organization behind the new legal center, and Heidi Bruggink, the center’s legal coordinator. Speaking of the AHLC in general, Bruggink reported, “Our attorney roster includes many accomplished and prominent nontheistic attorneys, including &lt;a href="w%3AVashti%20McCollum"&gt;Jim McCollum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWendy%20Kaminer"&gt;Wendy Kaminer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Newdow"&gt;Michael Newdow&lt;/a&gt;.” These three are the most famous members of a legal team that “now consists of twenty-seven committed lawyers supported by several law students” and others. 

The litigation challenging churches as polling places is a result of volunteer action nationwide by members of the American Humanist Association. “We put out a call to our members whose polling places were churches, asking them to report what they saw,” said the organization’s president, Mel Lipman. And this is what led to the Florida case and others that are expected to follow.

The U.S. government warned private financial services that &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Qaeda"&gt;al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; is planning a &lt;a href="w%3Acyber%20attack"&gt;cyber attack&lt;/a&gt; on the U.S. stock and bank accounts, officials said on Thursday.

Homeland Security spokesman &lt;a href="w%3ARuss%20Knocke"&gt;Russ Knocke&lt;/a&gt; says: "There is no information to corroborate this aspirational threat. As a routine matter and out of an abundance of caution, US-CERT issued the situational awareness report to industry stakeholders."

The officials said that the attacks are aimed at destroying the databases of U.S. banking and stock market web sites. The &lt;a href="w%3AHomeland%20Security"&gt;Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; group claims that the threat was for all of December. 

A U.S. official said that the threat was posted on an website and called for the attack to avenge the imprisonment of Muslims in the Guantanamo detention camp.

Fiji’s fourth coup in 20 years rose today as troops disarmed Fiji's only armed police unit. This is the first step in the long expected &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Fijian%20coup%20plot"&gt;military coup&lt;/a&gt;.

Fiji's president dissolved parliament on Tuesday and sanctioned the military to remove embattled Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, said New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark

Qarase, who is in his residence in Suva, said the military was staging a coup and he would not resign but would have to be forcibly removed from office.

"I am not going anywhere," Qarase told Reuters.

"I am the democratically elected prime minister of the people of Fiji. They will have to move me by force."

"I have been advised this morning that the president of Fiji has acted outside his constitutional powers and supported the removal of the democratic prime minister by the military," Clark said in a statement to the New Zealand parliament.

Acting Police Commissioner Moses Driver denied that any take over had occurred. He said soldiers arrived to inspect police weapons, and were waiting for approval for that inspection. Troops later surrounding the Nasova Police Academy in Suva demanding the handover of weapons, and occupied the main police station in Suva. No shots were fired when the police were locked out.

At a news conference inside the main Suva barracks, Commander Frank Bainimarama said that police weapons were confiscated so that "dissidents" did not use them against the military.

There are also reports that military checkpoints are been set up around the capital. There are approximately four roadblocks with 20 soliders at each.

Troops tried to arrest the Prime Minister of Fiji, &lt;a href="w%3ALaisenia%20Qarase"&gt;Laisenia Qarase&lt;/a&gt;, in the afternoon by setting up a roadblock between Suva and the province where Mr Qarase was attending a meeting, but he escaped in a helicopter, and has since been in hiding. The Prime Minister and his cabinet are understood to be in safe, secure places, and some of them separated for extra security. 

The army kept up the pressure on Mr Qarase when he was later summoned to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo's residence.

Mr Qarase drove to the estate, but was told by soldiers at a roadblock outside that he would have to walk the rest of the way. A witness inside the grounds said the prime minister, whose bodyguards were also disarmed by the military, refused and returned to his office.

Mr Qarase will make another attempt to meet President Iloilo on Tuesday morning.

Military chief Commander Frank Bainimarama had repeatedly threatened to remove Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase's government unless it drops several pieces of legislation, including a bill that would grant amnesty to those involved in a coup in 2000. Commander Bainimarama has laid allegations on PM Qarase of stalling his pledge of ditching of the controversial legislation. 

However Bainimarama is denying a coup is under way. "This is not a coup," Bainimarama said today. "Everything is normal. Nothing is going on." 

He had earlier imposed a deadline of noon (0000GMT) on Friday, December 1 but that deadline was extended to today as there was the annual rugby game between the police and the military. Commander Bainimarama is both an avid rugby fan and active church goer. The police won the rugby game. "I maintain my demands and the deadline still stands and I will make a commitment to my stand after the rugby match," he said.

Mr Qarase told Fiji radio on Monday morning that he remained in control and has called an emergency cabinet meeting for Tuesday.

Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs called for calm on Monday and for the military to return to negotiations with the government.

Local radio reported seven government vehicles used by ministers and parliament's Speaker had been confiscated by the military since Monday night.

World leaders have commended Commander Bainimarama actions. Including New Zealand which has banned Commander Bainimarama from entering New Zealand except if he is attending political crises talks. Helen Clark described the situation as "...it's a very disturbing situation." Some of Commander Bainimarama's close family live in New Zealand.

Conditions on the street of Fiji are said to be mixed, with some apprehension.

The United Nations might discontinue use of Fijian soldiers in peacekeeping operations of which is a large source of Fiji's income. Also the British army might not use Fijian soldiers. The International Community have said they will discontinue aid to Fiji which is worth millions annually. 

<h2>Past Fijian coups</h2>
Fiji has suffered three coups since 1987. 

On the morning of May 14, 1987, 10 masked, armed soldiers entered the House of Representatives.
Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka, dressed in civilian clothes and motivated by claims of racial discrimination against ethnic Fijians, approached Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra from the public gallery and ordered MPs to leave.
The bloodless coup was a success but subsequent talks proposed a government of national unity under the leadership of the governor-general, involving both the deposed government and the indigenous-supported Alliance Party.
Fearing the gains of the first coup would be lost, Mr Rabuka staged a second coup on September 25 that year.
This time he severed ties with the British monarchy, who held the title Queen of Fiji (Ilisapeci-Na Radi ni Viti kei Peritania, or interpreted Elizabeth- Queen of Fiji and Great Britain) and proclaimed a republic.
A new constitution ratified in 1990 guaranteed indigenous Fijians the offices of President and Prime Minister, along with two-thirds of the Senate and a substantial majority of the House of Representatives.
But these provisions were overturned by a constitutional review in 1997.
Hardline Fijian nationalists led by bankrupt businessman George Speight led a further coup in May, 2000, when they overthrew the nation's first Indo-Fijian prime minister Mahendra Chaudry, holding him hostage inside parliament for eight weeks along with most of his cabinet and many MPs and their staff.
Mr Speight declared himself Prime Minister, and ordered the President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara to step aside as president. Mr Mara refused to negotiate with the plotters, and decided instead to dismiss the kidnapped government and assume emergency powers himself. His move backfired, however. In what politicians called "a coup within a coup," Ratu Mara was whisked away on the naval ship Kiro on 28 May, where he was allegedly approached by a group of present and former military and police officers and ordered to suspend the Constitution. When he refused, ("If the Constitution goes, I go," he defiantly declared) the group, are alleged to have asked for, and possibly forced, Mara's resignation. 
Frank Bainimarama then declared martial law, abrogated the constitution and set up an interim government.

Commander Bainimarama was almost killed in a failed, bloody mutiny linked to the 2000 coup on the 2 November that year, when rebel soldiers mutinied at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks. The mutiny resulted in the death of four loyal soldiers, and blames Mr Qarase for being soft on those behind it.
He appointed Laisenia Qarase as prime minister before handing power to an interim administration headed by Ratu Josefa Iloilo as President.
Mr Speight was arrested on July 27 along with 369 supporters.
The government reneged on an agreement granting Speight immunity from prosecution, Commander Bainimarama saying the military had signed it "under duress".
Mr Speight remains in prison on an island off Suva.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has taken a one-nil lead in the &lt;a href="w%3A2006-07%20Ashes%20series"&gt;2006-07 Ashes series&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. The match finished during the fifth day, with Australia winning by 277 runs at the &lt;a href="w%3AGabba"&gt;Gabba&lt;/a&gt; ground in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

In its first &lt;a href="w%3Ainnings"&gt;innings&lt;/a&gt;, Australia made 602 runs for the loss of 9 wickets before &lt;a href="w%3Adeclaration%20and%20forfeiture"&gt;declaring&lt;/a&gt; (ie. 9-602 dec.) during the evening session of day two. Captain &lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Ponting"&gt;Ricky Ponting&lt;/a&gt; made 196 runs whilst &lt;a href="w%3Aall-rounder"&gt;All-rounder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Flintoff"&gt;Flintoff&lt;/a&gt; took 4 wickets for 99 runs (4-99).

In response, England made only 157, with &lt;a href="w%3AGlenn%20McGrath"&gt;Glenn McGrath&lt;/a&gt; taking 6-50. The only English batsmen to reach 50 runs was &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Bell"&gt;Ian Bell&lt;/a&gt;. 

Captain Ponting decided not to enforce the &lt;a href="w%3Afollow-on"&gt;follow-on&lt;/a&gt; despite Australia having a 445-run lead on the first innings aggregate. Australia's second innings was another resounding display, declaring a second time at 1-202 just before lunch on the fourth day. &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Langer"&gt;Justin Langer&lt;/a&gt; made 100 &lt;a href="w%3Anot%20out"&gt;not out&lt;/a&gt;. This set England a massive victory target of 648 runs. 

In England's second "dig", they managed to post 370 runs before being dismissed, falling 378 runs short of winning the match. &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Pietersen"&gt;Kevin Pietersen&lt;/a&gt; made 92 before being caught off the bowling of &lt;a href="w%3ABrett%20Lee"&gt;Brett Lee&lt;/a&gt; early on the fifth morning. His counterpart &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Collingwood"&gt;Paul Collingwood&lt;/a&gt; also lost his wicket in the "nervous 90's", falling on 96. &lt;a href="w%3ALeg%20spin"&gt;Leg spin&lt;/a&gt; legend &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Warne"&gt;Shane Warne&lt;/a&gt; took 4-124 during the innings.

This test match marked the return of Australian paceman &lt;a href="w%3AStuart%20Clark"&gt;Stuart Clark&lt;/a&gt;, who took 7-93 for the match. The second &lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test match&lt;/a&gt; beings in &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; on December 1.

The Sri Lankan Defence Secretary, Gothabaya Rajapakse narrowly escaped a suicide attack from suspected &lt;a href="w%3ALiberation%20Tigers%20of%20Tamil%20Eelam%20%28LTTE%29"&gt;Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)&lt;/a&gt; rebels. The attack took place in downtown &lt;a href="w%3AColombo"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, the Sri Lankan Capital at 10:30 a.m., as a convoy carrying the Defence Secretary and other officials was attacked by a suspected terrorist in a &lt;a href="w%3Athree%20wheeler"&gt;three wheeler&lt;/a&gt;. 

Early reports indicate that Gothabaya, brother of Sri Lankan President &lt;a href="w%3AMahinda%20Rajapakse"&gt;Mahinda Rajapakse&lt;/a&gt; and vocal critic of the LTTE, escaped unscathed, while at least 2 people have died and 14 others were injured, including 5 civilians. 

While the LTTE has yet to claim responsibility for the latest strike, the militant separatist group, proscribed as a terrorist organisation in countries such as the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AE.U."&gt;E.U.&lt;/a&gt;, has yet to do so for any of the suicide attacks attributed to them throughout their history. In 2006 alone the group has been accused of carrying out suicide attacks on unarmed Sri Lankan servicemen in Habarana and on a naval base in the tourist city of &lt;a href="w%3AGalle"&gt;Galle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as failed attempts on the lives of Lieutenant General &lt;a href="w%3ASarath%20Fonseka"&gt;Sarath Fonseka&lt;/a&gt; and Pakistani Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Bashir Wali Mohamed. 

The latest suicide attack comes just days following a declaration from LTTE leader, &lt;a href="w%3AVelupillai%20Prabhakaran"&gt;Velupillai Prabhakaran&lt;/a&gt;, that the &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; brokered ceasefire agreement with the Sri Lankan government was ‘defunct’.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Just over one month after the "Friday the 13th Snow Storm," Buffalo is preparing for another winter storm.

Forecasters at the &lt;a href="w%3ANOAA"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt; have issued several warnings including a high wind warning until 3:00 a.m. Saturday December 2 with the possibility of winds up to and exceeding 60 miles per hour. A lakeshore flood warning has also been issued for all Western New York residents and businesses on the &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Erie"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; shoreline from 6:00 p.m. tonight and remains in effect until Midnight. A Flash Flood watch is also in effect, though the NOAA does not state when it expires.

A flood warning has been issued for all of Erie County and the NOAA says that flooding is possible in "urban areas and small streams." The warning expires at 4:30 p.m. [EST]. As much as 2 inches of rain has fallen in many areas and "small streams are over their banks" in some areas of Erie County.

Severe storms are also causing problems for the area. Severe storm warnings were issued for Erie County, New York and Cattaragus County, New York until 1:45 p.m., but have since been cancelled. Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected throughout the day today before rain switches over to snow later in the evening, causing whiteout conditions as possibly damaging winds with blowing and drifting snow.

&lt;a href="w%3ACNET"&gt;CNET&lt;/a&gt; editor, former &lt;a href="w%3AFresh%20Gear"&gt;Fresh Gear&lt;/a&gt; contributor, and Lab analyst &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Kim"&gt;James Kim&lt;/a&gt; has been missing since Saturday. Police have opened a missing person investigations and called on those, especially from the &lt;a href="w%3AOregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; area, having any information on the whereabouts of the missing family to contact them. 

The information below is from the official investigation by the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Police%20Department"&gt;San Francisco Police Department&lt;/a&gt; (SFPD) - missing family members include: James, Kati, Penelope (age 4.5) and Sabine (6 months).

Overview: The Kim Family left &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; on November 17th on a road trip to the Pacific Northwest. They had Thanksgiving in &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt; with family and then drove to &lt;a href="w%3APortland%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt;. They were last seen by their friends in Portland whom they had brunch with on Saturday, November 25. According to their friends, their plans were to drive out to the town of Gold Beach on the Oregon Coast and then make their way back to San Francisco. James was expected back at work on Tuesday, November 28th. When no one had heard from him by Wednesday morning employees at the Kims' two stores and his colleagues at CNET began to make phone calls to his family and friends to inquire of his whereabouts. Presently, the SFPD is investigating the case.

The family was last heard from at around 5:45 PM on Saturday. A hotel clerk at the Tu Tu Tun lodge in &lt;a href="w%3AGold%20Beach%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Gold Beach, Oregon&lt;/a&gt; took a call from James. He said he was about five hours away. The hotel clerk said she would leave the keys out for them as the lobby would be closed after 10:00. The keys were still in the same place the next morning. The clerk believes James referred to being near &lt;a href="w%3ASalem%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Salem, Oregon&lt;/a&gt; at the time. They were driving a 2005 silver &lt;a href="w%3ASaab%209-2X"&gt;Saab 9-2X&lt;/a&gt; station wagon with California personalized plates of "DOESF".

More details and pictures of the family are available on CNET's Crave Blog.

If you know anything about James' whereabouts, you can contact the SFPD by calling 415-558-5508 during normal business hours and 415-553-1071 after hours.

&lt;a href="Stephen%20Hawking"&gt;Stephen Hawking&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned physicist known for having &lt;a href="w%3ALou%20Gehrig%27s%20Disease"&gt;Lou Gehrig's Disease&lt;/a&gt;, believes that the survival of the human race depends on whether or not we colonize other planets.

"The long-term survival of the human race is at risk as long as it is confined to a single planet," he said during a Thursday radio interview with &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. "Sooner or later, disasters such as an asteroid collision or nuclear war could wipe us all out. But once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future should be safe."

The idea of 'warp drive', popularized by science fiction writers and televised in the series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Trek"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, enables space ships to travel vast distances in a short time.

"Unfortunately, this would violate the scientific law which says that nothing can travel faster than light," said Hawking. 

By using a yet-to-be developed 'matter/anti-matter annihilation' propulsion system, space travel velocities could approach the speed of light, according to Hawking. The closest stars could be reached in 6 years. "It wouldn't seem so long for those on board," he said.

Media attention about a little noticed and month-old U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; report that international airline travelers in-and-out of the U.S. were being tracked via an &lt;a href="w%3AAutomated%20Targeting%20System"&gt;Automated Targeting System&lt;/a&gt; (ATS) has drawn renewed interest. 

The database system, started four years ago, accumulates information on overseas travelers and assigns a "&lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorist&lt;/a&gt; risk rank" to each individual. Such information may include nationality, flight patterns, motor vehicle driving records, and so on. Because ATS is exempt from many provisions of the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3APrivacy%20Act%20of%201974"&gt;Privacy Act&lt;/a&gt;, travelers cannot view or question their own rating.

The governmental branch, Customs and Border Patrol, is responsible for administration of the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P). The ATS-P received $28.3 million in funding this fiscal year, up $2.4 million from the previous year. The additional funding will be used to, "incorporate additional government and non-government databases for risk analysis utilizing ATS-P's rules based analysis" according to the Homeland Security 2006 fiscal year report.

International co-operation sought by the U.S. from European Union member states for information sharing on EU travelers was found to be illegal by the European Court of Justice in June this year. But a previously struck sharing agreement, dating from May 2004 between EU airlines and the U.S. became locked in legal complications. Maneuvering by the European Parliament rendered the court's ruling void.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Ministry%20of%20Agriculture%20and%20Forestry"&gt;New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF)&lt;/a&gt; is investigating how &lt;a href="w%3AGenetic%20engineering"&gt;genetically modified (gm)&lt;/a&gt; seeds of sweet corn was knowingly cleared to enter &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in October 2006.

The two consignments totaling 1,800 kilogram of gm sweetcorn originating from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; was cleared by the quarantine service run by MAF. Each consignment had a certificate that showed that the seeds had not been gm but there was documentation available that showed that the two consignments had a presence of gm. &lt;a href="w%3AJeanette%20Fitzsimons"&gt;Jeanette Fitzsimons&lt;/a&gt;, spokesperson for genetic engineering and the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Aotearoa%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, said: "I am absolutely shocked and angered that 1.8 tonnes of sweet corn seeds crossed our border, even though the accompanying testing documentation showed that it was contaminated with GE."

MAF said that the presence of any GM seeds is extremely low because of the combination of the two results.

The amount of seeds of sweetcorn that entered New Zealand could amount of 400 hectares of sweetcorn.

MAF is checking where the seeds were planted and will contact the affected parties. Conclusions from the discussions will determine the outcome of the seeds and or the plants.

Ms Fitzsimons said: "This is an indication that too many people in MAF still don't take the issue seriously. There needs to be a major shake up among the people who constitute our first line of defence."

MAF is also conducting an investigation on how they can increase border security so it never happens again. Ms Fitzsimons said: "It is extremely disturbing to learn that our border is still not secure against GE contaminated seeds. It is even worse that it has taken two months to discover that."

"Our markets still show no sign of accepting GE foods or GE contamination and it would be suicidal not to listen to them. Nor do New Zealanders want to eat GE foods," Ms Fitzsimons said.

&lt;a href="Michael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt; has been confirmed as the front-runner at the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Liberal%20Party%20leadership%20convention"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention&lt;/a&gt; following the release of the results of the first ballot. The former Harvard academic leads the field of eight contestants with 1,412 votes (29.3%). As expected, &lt;a href="Bob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt; is in second place with 977 vote (20.3%). &lt;a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt; did better than expected and is in a tight battle for third place with &lt;a href="Gerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; with Dion receiving 856 votes (17.8%) two more than Kennedy's 854 votes (17.7%).

Ignatieff, Rae, Dion and Kennedy are considered to be the only candidates with a realsitica possibility of winning this weekend's convention as the other four candidates finished with less than 5% support. 

80% of the delegates were committed to vote for specific candidates on the first ballot under the party's delegate selection process. In subsequent ballots, however, delegates will be free to vote for whomever they wish. 

The ex-officio delegates who are former Cabinet ministers, MPs and senior party officials, were free to vote as they wished on the first ballot providing an element of uncertainty. The results, however, closely mirrored the allocated vote of committed delegates, however, except for a stronger than expected showing for Dion who placed fourth in committed delegates elected at riding Delegate Selected Meetigns but who finished third in tonight's first ballot, edging out Kennedy, due to the support of ex-officio delegates.

Voting on the second ballot begins Saturday morning at 9am with subsequent ballots occurring throughout the day, as needed, until one candidate emerges with a majority of the vote. 

&lt;a href="w%3AMartha%20Hall%20Findlay"&gt;Martha Hall Findlay&lt;/a&gt; did better than expected by receiving 130 votes but still finished last on the first ballot and is therefore eliminated by the contest. Prior to the announcement of the results candidate &lt;a href="Joe%20Volpe"&gt;Joe Volpe&lt;/a&gt; announced that he would be withdrawing after the first ballot in order to throw his support to Bob Rae.

Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian's son and daughter-in-law, Chen Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching, returned to Taiwan Friday at 11:00pm Taipei time from New York.

Huang Jui-ching is pregnant, and politicians in Taiwan of all stripes have called on her to come home to give birth. President Chen had promised in September that his daughter-in-law would give birth in Taiwan and that his grandson would not be an American.

Politicians and media have speculated that the couple would give birth in the US. Chen Chih-chung stated that he and his wife had no intention of giving birth in the States.

Demonstrations calling for &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AFouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt; and his cabinet to resign lasted through Friday night and into Saturday.

The protest, mobilized by &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; and other opposition groups, has brought hundreds of thousands of demonstrators into the Beirut's Martyrs' Square and streets close to the government's headquarters. The demonstrators are imposing a blockade on the offices.

"I wish that our prime minister and his ministers were here among us today rather than hiding behind army tanks and barbed wire," Michel Aoun, an influential Christian leader and Hezbollah ally, told the protesters. "The one who has support of his people does not need barbed wire." He added: "I call on the prime minister and his ministers to resign."

The crowd cheered in response: "Saniora out! We want a free government!"

The organizers and demonstrators say they will not leave until the government resigns.

For its part, the government is signaling it has no intention of resigning, and the Mr. Siniora and several ministers are currently staying in the offices during the blockade.

Government supporters and opponents of Hezbollah vowed to wait out the demonstrations,with some accusing the demonstrators of attempting a coup.

While the situation appears stable at this point, there is fear the protests could escalate into sectarian violence or attacks on the government buildings.

The Chinese government has decided to allow foreign reporters freedom of movement and information in most of China, between Jan. 1, 2007, until Oct. 17, 2008 in order to better cover the Olympics. The Games will be held in August 2008.

Foreign reporters will also be able to report and interview without approval from government censors during the regulatory hiatus.

The freedoms will not apply to Tibet or Xinjiang, two sensitive territories. Nor will Chinese journalists be granted the same freedoms.

Following the announcement of the vote result Dryden released his delegates but threw his personal support to Bob Rae while Kennedy withdrew in order to support Dion.

Voting on the third ballot is now underway with results expected in mid-afternoon.

&lt;a href="Raul%20Castro"&gt;Raul Castro&lt;/a&gt;, the brother of &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;'s leader, &lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; and Cuba's defense minister, has asked that negotiations be reopened with the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; as long as the U.S. "accepts that we Cuba are a country." Raul took over the country's leadership after Fidel became ill in July.

"Let me take this opportunity to express our willingness to settle the long US-Cuba disagreement at the negotiating table. Of course, that is, as long as they accept that we are a country that does not tolerate any reduction of its independence, and based on the principles of equality, reciprocity, non interference and mutual respect," said Castro during a military parade in Cuba honoring Fidel's 80th birthday, which he failed to attend.

"Until that happens, after almost half a century, we are prepared to wait patiently for the moment when common sense takes root in the halls of power in Washington," stated Castro.

The U.S. has said that they would like to see a "democratic change" and that a "Castro dynasty" is "certainly not a solution that we think is viable," said a spokesman for the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20State"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;, Tom Casey.

"We think the Cuban people need to be given the opportunity to see and have democratic change. We believe that is what the Cuban people would like to have. The creation of some sort of Castro dynasty simply by transferring power to Raul Castro and having him continue to operate the same undemocratic, repressive policies as his brother is certainly not a solution that we think is viable," said Casey who also stated that the U.S. "is ready to help."

Raul was given the position of Cuba's leader on July 31, 2006.

The U.S. has not had any dialogue with Cuba and has had a trade embargo imposed on the country since 1962.

Dion now leads with 1,782 votes (37%) to Ignatieff's 1,660 votes (35.5%).

With 1,375 votes (28.5%) Rae was the last candidate on the ballot and has been eliminated by the contest. He has released his delegates and has decided not to announce his voting intention for the fourth and final ballot.

Former leadership contestants &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Volpe"&gt;Joe Volpe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Dryden"&gt;Ken Dryden&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom endorsed Rae after their withdrawal from the contest are now supporting Dion while &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Brison"&gt;Scott Brison&lt;/a&gt; who withdrew from the race last night to support Rae is now supporting Ignatieff. Former finance minister &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Goodale"&gt;Ralph Goodale&lt;/a&gt; who endorsed Rae earlier in the week has thrown his support to Dion. 

The results of the final ballot are expected to be announced around 5pm Eastern Time.

Pasadena, CA

The &lt;a href="UCLA"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; Bruins defeated the &lt;a href="USC"&gt;USC&lt;/a&gt; Trojans in the final game of the regular season for both teams, 13-9. With the loss, USC drops to 10-2 and will most likely not play for the BCS National Championship of 2006. UCLA ends its season at 7-5 and will accept an invitation to the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco. It is projected that the Trojans will be invited to the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.

With the loss, Ohio State University will likely play either Michigan or Florida in the BCS National Championship in Glendale, Arizona, on January 8th.

The chief of the Fijian military, &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Bainimarama"&gt;Commodore Frank Bainimarama&lt;/a&gt;, has claimed that he is now in control of Fiji without having to stage a military coup. Commodore Bainimarama said: "Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ALaisenia%20Qarase"&gt;Laisenia Qarase&lt;/a&gt; was no longer in control of the Government and unless he gives in to my demands he will have nowhere to live in Fiji."

There are predictions that the military will send out armed troops into the streets of Fiji's capital, &lt;a href="w%3ASuva"&gt;Suva&lt;/a&gt; in the afternoon (0300 GMT). Commodore Bainimarama said: "I assure him [Mr Qarase] that he will not be kidnapped or put under any form of house arrest. It will be a peaceful transition." According to the Fijian newspaper ♡❤Sunday Post♡❤, sources inside the government and the military have confirmed that there will be a government takeover tomorrow. Commodore Bainimarama will set up a interim administration.

Prime Minister Qarase, said that Commodore Bainimarama is "deranged and unstable." However Commodore Bainimarama responded to this, he said that they were "the action and words of a cornered rat."

The government and his cabinet are in hiding outside of Suva, Fiji, but the Prime Minister assures everyone that he is still in control of the government. Referring to the hiding, Commodore Bainimarama said: "Qarase had better come out of hiding because right now I'm in control of him."

"We want freedom to live within a democratically civil government, where the government is elected by the people. We do not want a dictator," Mr Qarase said in a nationally broadcast interview.

Mr Qarase said the he expects that he will be the Prime Minister for another four and a half years as he believes that the Fijian people do have confidence in him.

A classified memo written by US Secretary of Defense &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; two days before resigning calls for large changes to the Iraq War policy currently in place.

Says Rumsfeld, "In my view it is time for a major adjustment. Clearly, what U.S. forces are currently doing in Iraq is not working well enough or fast enough."

Titled "Iraq — Illustrative New Courses of Action", the memo discusses ideas for reduction in troop levels or redeployment. However, the former Sec. Def. does not recommend any particular strategy. The memo lists many options that he says warrant consideration, including reducing US combat troops and focusing on a support role. 

The document's veracity has been confirmed by &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; official Eric Ruff.

The memo has raised many eyebrows in Washington, because Rumsfeld staunchly defended his Iraq policy in public and because the White House has repeatedly rebuked many of the options Rumsfeld lists. It also seems to contradict previous assertions that troop levels were set according to the needs of commanders on the ground, and not by elected officials.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, National Security Advisor Stephen J. Hadley described the leaked memo as one part of a review being conducted by the president.

“What Secretary Rumsfeld did, I think very helpfully, was put together a sort of laundry list of ideas that ought to be considered as part of that review,” Mr. Hadley said on the ABC News program “This Week.

Bush is considering a variety of new options, including some previously rejected, because "things are not proceeding well enough or fast enough in Iraq," Hadley continued on "This Week." "We have to make some changes."

In an atmosphere of fun and excitement, the 4th annual Junior Eurovision Song Contest was held in Bucharest, Romania. The big winners of the night were twin duo Sisters Tolmatchevy with their song "Vesna" (Spring). Followed by Russia were pre-contest favorites Belarus (winners of the 2005 edition), and Sweden taking the second and third places respectively. Rounding out the top 5 were Spain and Serbia. 

The evening began with an introduction by 12-year-old co-hostess Ioana Ivan followed by an elaborate dance routine. Romanian reporter, Andreea Marin took to the stage to kick off the 15 performances from various European countries. Romania incorporated historic and modern elements in an interesting way that would appeal to children everywhere. Dracula was also present on stage, helping Ioana and Andreea present. The evening ran smoothly, but not without some surprises. At the end of the voting, most of the reactions expressed shock in the Portuguese and Macedonian results. These two countries could be found at the bottom of the scoreboard.

&lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Stelmach"&gt;Ed Stelmach&lt;/a&gt; has won the race to lead &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;'s governing &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Progressive Conservative party&lt;/a&gt; beating out former Treasurer &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Dinning"&gt;Jim Dinning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATed%20Morton"&gt;Ted Morton&lt;/a&gt;. Stelmach, now &lt;a href="w%3Apremier-Designate"&gt;premier-Designate&lt;/a&gt; of Alberta, will be sworn in as &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; of the Canadian province once outgoing leader &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Klein"&gt;Ralph Klein&lt;/a&gt; leaves office later this month.

Stelmach placed third on the first ballot of the &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta%20Progressive%20Conservative%20leadership%20election%2C%202006"&gt;party's leadership election&lt;/a&gt; last Saturday behind Dinning, the favourite, who was in first place and former university professor Morton who was in second place. The top three contenders in the eight candidate race proceeded to the second ballot vote which occurred yesterday. 

Stelmach was the surprise leader last night as the first choice of 51,764 voters (35.9%) to Dinning's 51,282 (35.6%). Morton placed third with 41,243 votes (28.6%) and was eliminated from the contest which then proceeded to counting the second choices cast by Morton's supporters on the &lt;a href="w%3Apreferential%20ballot"&gt;preferential ballot&lt;/a&gt;. Once the second choices of Morton's supporters were factored in Stelmach surged ahead to win a clear victory by a margin of over 20,000 votes in the &lt;a href="w%3Ainstant%20runoff"&gt;instant runoff&lt;/a&gt;. 

The vote was open to all Albertans who purchased a five dollar party membership including members of other political parties. Over 144,000 ballots were cast and reports indicate that a number of members of more moderate parties voted in order to prevent a victory by Morton, a &lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20conservative"&gt;social conservative&lt;/a&gt; and supporter of allowing private health insurance to compete with the province's public system of &lt;a href="w%3AMedicare%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; and has been portrayed as a "right-wing extremist" by his opponents. 

The Alberta Progressive Conservatives have ruled the western province continually since 1971. Stelmach will be the province's fourth successive Progressive Conservative premier.

&lt;a href="w%3AAljazeera"&gt;Aljazeera&lt;/a&gt; English is reporting a Taliban claim to have shot down the world's largest helicopter. 

The Russian helicopter is said to have been in use by &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; to supply Dutch troops deployed in Southern Afghanistan. 

NATO is reported as saying that the aircraft is missing; probably downed by bad weather. It is said to have crashed Saturday while en route from &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AUruzgan"&gt;Uruzgan&lt;/a&gt;. No NATO personnel were on board, said NATO spokesman. 

The helicopter, said to be Russia's largest cargo carrier, was named as Mi-25. The number of personnel and the nature of its cargo have not been disclosed. It is reported as being owned by &lt;a href="w%3ADynCorp"&gt;DynCorp&lt;/a&gt; International which provides "specialised mission-critical outsourced technical services to civilian and military government agencies". DynCorp has been engaged to train police forces and has also been active in anti-drug trading in Central America and elsewhere. 

Note: the world's heaviest and most powerful helicopter in production is the Russian eight-bladed &lt;a href="w%3AMil%20Mi-26"&gt;Mil Mi-26&lt;/a&gt;.

Former &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;an President &lt;a href="Augusto%20Pinochet"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt;, 91, has suffered a heart attack early this morning. His son, Marco Antonio, declared that his father had received his last rites from a Catholic priest and that "he is in the hands of God and the doctors". Pinochet underwent a bypass surgery in the Hospital Militar in Santiago and his condition is reported to be critical but stable. Doctors have reported he is also suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Apulmonary%20edema"&gt;pulmonary edema&lt;/a&gt;. 

Pinochet came to power in 1973 when the Chilean armed forces led a coup which deposed the left-wing president &lt;a href="w%3ASalvador%20Allende"&gt;Salvador Allende&lt;/a&gt;. Allende's rule had seen a growing polarization of Chilean society, economic crisis, and terrorist activity from far-left groups. Pinochet set about exterminating his opposition, mainly socalists and communists, and suspended the constiution. His neoliberal economic policies, carried out by the "&lt;a href="w%3AChicago%20Boys"&gt;Chicago Boys&lt;/a&gt;", a group of Chilean economists influenced by &lt;a href="w%3AMilton%20Friedman"&gt;Milton Friedman&lt;/a&gt;, were able to reduce the rampant hyperinflation and stabilize the economy. In 1981, a plebiscite approved a new constitution drafted by Pinochet's government. As the new constitution decreed, another plebiscite took place in 1988 to determine whether Pinochet should remain in power. The "No" option won and Pinochet stepped down. He remained as head of the army and senator until 1998, when he relinquished these positions. He was arrested that year in London for human rights violations, but was able to return to Chile. He is currently under investigation by Chilean officials over tax evasion and human rights violatons. He had recently accepted "responsibility" for "everything that was done" during his government, "which had no other goal than making Chile greater and avoiding its disintegration".

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Philippines"&gt;Philippine&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="Gloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; declared a state of national calamity Sunday in the wake of &lt;a href="w%3ATyphoon"&gt;Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATyphoon%20Durian"&gt;Durian&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the government to more rapidly release funds needed to bolster search and rescue efforts. Relief efforts in the Philippines faced delays Sunday for survivors, as fears grew of a rising death toll in the &lt;a href="w%3Aarchipelago"&gt;archipelago&lt;/a&gt; nation from last week's storm.

&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; officials recorded a death toll of at least 406, with 398 others missing and another 489 as injured, based on figures provided by mayors of devastated towns in the eastern Philippines, where Durian hit with 139 mph winds and torrential rains on Thursday.

Canada pledged $870,000 and the Netherlands Red Cross pledged $53,000 to help the country deal with the aftermath of the storm that triggered massive flooding and volcanic mudslides. The United States also promised an undetermined amount of aid. 

Many provinces lost power, making communication virtually impossible. In one of the worst hit provinces, Albay, two villages were buried by &lt;a href="w%3Avolcanic%20mudslides"&gt;volcanic mudslides&lt;/a&gt; and volunteers were working to recover bodies from the wreckage.

According to the Red Cross, rescue boats were used to survey the damage and take people to the 305 evacuation centers. The Red Cross estimated about 66,616 people were now homeless based upon the number of homes destroyed in the wake of Durian.

Earlier, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said 38,473 displaced people were in evacuation shelters.

<h3>Often hit by storms</h3>
The Philippines' location in the northwestern Pacific puts it right in the pathway of the world's top typhoon generator, according to meteorologists. Durian is the fourth devastating typhoon to strike the Philippines in the past four months, covering the Mayon volcano with so much wind and rain that ash and boulders cascaded down its slopes in walls of black mud that swamped entire villages Thursday.

Hemmed in by geography and poverty, the Philippines has tried to minimize the damage caused by the 20 or so typhoons that hit the sprawling archipelago every year. Nationwide in 2001-05, 2,892 people were killed and 909 others went missing in typhoons and other storms, which caused damage totaling US$521 million, says the National Disaster Coordinating Council.

Anthony Golez, the council's deputy chief, notes that the estimate doesn't include losses to employment and other economic opportunities, and that Filipinos should be "bombarded" with disaster information, including stories of the Indian Ocean tsunami two years ago and the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Southern%20Leyte%20mudslide"&gt;February 2006&lt;/a&gt; landslide in the central Philippine village of &lt;a href="w%3AGuinsaugon"&gt;Guinsaugon&lt;/a&gt; that killed more than 1,000.

Senator Richard Gordon, who heads the Philippine National Red Cross, said better planning is needed. "The big problem here in our country is we don't plan our communities. It's every man for himself."

The former &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chilean&lt;/a&gt; dictator, General &lt;a href="Augusto%20Pinochet"&gt;Augusto Pinochet&lt;/a&gt;, died yesterday in a military hospital in &lt;a href="Santiago%2C%20Chile"&gt;Santiago de Chile&lt;/a&gt;. 

Pinochet died at 2:15 p.m. (1715 &lt;a href="w%3AGreenwich%20Mean%20Time"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt;), surrounded by his family. A brief announcement by the hospital said Pinochet's condition had worsened suddenly following a heart attack on December 3. Earlier in the week he was reported to be recovering from the heart failure. 

In 1973 Augusto Pinochet took power in a &lt;a href="w%3AChilean%20coup%20of%201973"&gt;US-assisted coup against Chile's democratically elected president&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASalvador%20Allende"&gt;Salvador Allende Gossens&lt;/a&gt;, who died in the first hours of the military takeover. His rule of terror, which he maintained by silencing all opposition, lasted 17 years and produced a national trauma that has still not fully healed.

A few hours after the dictator's death, the Chilean government spokesman, Ricardo Lagos Weber, announced there would be no state funeral or national mourning. But the government authorized the flying of flags at half-mast on military buildings, and Pinochet's funeral will be performed with military honors. Chile's president, &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Bachelet"&gt;Michelle Bachelet&lt;/a&gt;, will not attend.

Within hours of the news yesterday, thousands of people gathered at Plaza Italia to celebrate the ex-dictator's death. There was a jubilant carnival atmosphere in the streets as people merrily waved flags, sang songs or drank champagne. Later on, there were reports of clashes with police firing water cannon and tear gas at the crowd. 

A smaller group of right-wingers mourned Pinochet's passing outside the Military Hospital, clutching pictures of the dead dictator. "It is very sad, because it is as if we were left orphans," one Pinochet supporter told the press.

But many of Pinochet's opponents are angry because of his impunity during his lifetime. "What saddens me is that this criminal has died without having been sentenced", said Hugo Gutierrez, a human rights lawyer.

During Pinochet's dictatorship, established in 1973 by means of a coup de état, and later maintained through the use of police and military forces, curfews and state terrorism, thousands were killed or disappeared, and in later years his image was further marred by reports that he had stolen large amounts of money held in foreign bank accounts and that he had been engaged in cocaine smuggling.

Accused of dozens of human rights abuses, the ex-dictator was never tried for these crimes on the pretext of his frail health, despite repeated international attempts to take him to court.
There are a number of ceremonies to be held at Santiago, Chile, on December 12th. And there have been a number of clashes between the "momios" (right-wing pro-dictator sectors of the nation) and anti-pinochet manifestants, however, violence has not escalated to a concerning degree

&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; has been elected as leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt; party by the party's caucus. His running-mate &lt;a href="w%3AJulia%20Gillard"&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/a&gt; was elected unopposed to the deputy leadership.

The vote was called on Friday after Kevin Rudd challenged former leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; for the leadership. Rudd won the leadership by a vote of 49-39.

Rudd becomes the party's third leader since the 2004 election, where the &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government won a fourth consecutive term in government.

Long-serving deputy leader &lt;a href="w%3AJenny%20Macklin"&gt;Jenny Macklin&lt;/a&gt; did not contest the deputy leadership following the defeat of Mr Beazley. Mrs Macklin has been deputy leader under three leaders since 2001.

The party will elect its shadow ministry in a separate ballot on Thursday.

Premier of &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; has said that the leadership change "will herald in a new period of stability for the party."

"It's important that if you have good policy and good government, it's important you also have stability in leadership," said Beattie. "I'd urge everyone to get behind Kevin - having a Queenslander as the alternative prime minister is good for the state and good for Australia."

Labor MP Dick Adams said even though he voted for Beazley to remain as leader, he supports the party's new leadership. "There'll be a lot more harmony and a lot more opportunity of ideas," he said. "I think the new ideas need to flow and I think if it's opened up, as some people have said, they want those ideas to come forward, but I think we'll have some interesting policy direction to take to the people."

Sharan Burrow, the president of the ACTU - the peak union body in Australia said Mr Rudd will be a strong leader. "I have no doubt that Kevin Rudd will say that these laws have to go, that they will be replaced by a policy that reinstates rights," Ms Burrow has told Sky News. 

Government MP, Christopher Pyne said that the new leadership was a poor choice for the party. "The combination of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard will have all the hallmarks of the mongoose and the cobra. It shows Labor is obsessed about leadership rather than policy and strategy," Mr Pyne said. 

In a poll released by Newspoll today, a Rudd-Gillard leadership team had 48 percent support of the public, compared to the outgoing Beazley-Macklin team's 27 percent.

There has been some speculation that Ignatieff would go back to &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and Rae would go back to his Toronto law practice. Ignatieff and Rae were in the first and second spots until &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Dion"&gt;Stephane Dion&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href="w%3Adark%20horse"&gt;dark horse&lt;/a&gt; in the election, surged past three other candidates to win on the fourth ballot.

Dion discussed with Liberals yesterday what they felt about the recent Liberal election and the future of the party. Rae, Ignatieff, and all the other Liberals said Dion is a good leader. "[Dion's] going to be a good leader," Ignatieff said on his way to the luncheon. "He's going to be the next prime minister of the country and I'm going to work real hard to make all that happen." According to Rae, the conversation was "candid and very direct and Mr. Dion set a great tone for the meeting."

The newly elected leader hopes to win the next federal election which is expected in 2007.

<h1>New Zealander fired for checking background information on girlfriends</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealander%20fired%20for%20checking%20background%20information%20on%20girlfriends&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Les Neilson is no longer a New Zealand emergency call operator on 111 in &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt; as he checked up on the background of his potential girlfriends. Mr Neilson said that he will take his case to the Employment Relations Authority as he claims that everyone is doing it and he is being made a scapegoat.

Mr. Nielson was fired in April of this year because of "inappropriate accessing and disclosure of police information."

Mr. Neilson said: "Many police regularly look up acquaintances and friends on the database. I've basically been screwed for doing something that's a common practice. I've used the information the same as everyone else has. If I'm socialising with people and I'm meeting new partners then I need to know the background of those partners because I don't want to put myself or the department in a compromising position." He did it "to protect himself and the organisation."

Mr. Neilson had worked with the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand police&lt;/a&gt; for 20 years and has used the background checker "...for the last 20 years."

However he never sold the information to third parties and never used it for personal gain. "I have not disclosed the information to anyone. I've given an explanation. If they investigate it they'll find out it's a very legitimate explanation."

"There's nothing that says I can't do that..."

Howard Broad, Police Commissioner, said: "Staff knew it was wrong to access the database for personal use. If they do, it's wrong and they would know that it's wrong. It's quite a clear breach."

Police can be sued for accessing police information which contain addresses, vehicle details, family, gang links, etc., according to Scott Optican, associate law professor at &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%20University"&gt;Auckland University&lt;/a&gt;, as it is private information. "The revelation was a significant breach of privacy and police could face lawsuits as well as formal complaints. Police had a duty to investigate how many people had accessed the database for personal use, and what they did with that information. If it looks like there were consequences [for the person who was looked up], they need to contact that person and find out what happened."

The information regarding name and address is said to be worth between &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;100 and $200 alone to private investigators and debt collectors.

Mr. Nielson is working as a private investigator in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand.

"How many of the general public would be upset that the local policeman or someone working for the police checks up on them, or who's in the street, or checks up on potential tenants for flats or aunts' and uncles' criminal histories?" Mr. Neilson said.

A spokeswoman for the police headquarters said: "The police organisation is intolerant of any abuses of information that is held. As this case illustrates, action will be taken against any staff member who seeks to use police information for purposes unrelated to their duties." She would not comment any further due to the case being before the Employment Relations Authority.

Greg O'Conner, president of the Police Association, said that their union had reminded members to be aware of their use of police information and facilities. "Operation Insider, which investigated the distribution of pornographic e-mails among police, had highlighted the importance of using such facilities appropriately."

"Quite frankly, I think the police should explain to members of the public exactly what happened here and what they'll do to make sure it doesn't happen again," Mr. Optican said.

On Monday, November 27, 2006 the Medical Health Officers of the &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Coastal%20Health"&gt;Vancouver Coastal Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFraser%20Health"&gt;Fraser Health&lt;/a&gt; recommended that the &lt;a href="w%3Aboil%20water%20advisory"&gt;boil water&lt;/a&gt; advisory that had been in effect for the &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;City of Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Vancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;North Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABurnaby%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Burnaby&lt;/a&gt; could now be lifted. Hospitals, care facilities, schools, food premises and the public are no longer being advised to boil drinking water or to use an alternate drinking water source. The boil water advisory for the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Vancouver%20Regional%20District"&gt;Greater Vancouver Regional District&lt;/a&gt; (GVRD) had been lifted days before but had remained in effect for the listed areas. 

Turbidity is on a downward trend but still remains above pre-storm levels. Water may continue to appear cloudy or discoloured for some time. The Medical Health Officers, monitoring and testing the water, at no point found the water un-safe, but felt the boil water advisory was justified as a safety precauction. It has been advised that people with comprised immune systems should continue to boil drinking water or drink filtered water.
