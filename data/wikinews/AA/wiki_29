&lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; will be adopting new passports standardized according to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization"&gt;International Civil Aviation Organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; guidelines. The passports, which are expected to be distributed at the beginning of next year, will have &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARFID"&gt;RFID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; chips embedded in them. These chips, loaded with the passport owner's private information, will be used in airport gates. To obtain a new passport, one will need only a national identity card.

RFID chips, sometimes called &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpychips"&gt;"spychips"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , are controversial, especially when loaded with personal information. For instance, one can scan the chip and obtain the private information in it from a distance without the information or consent of the individual carrying the chip. Currently, there seems to be no discussion about the controversies surrounding RFID chips in the Turkish media.

&lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; has been re-elected to a third term in office with a large margin over &lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20democrat"&gt;social democrat&lt;/a&gt; rival &lt;a href="w%3AManuel%20Rosales"&gt;Manuel Rosales&lt;/a&gt;. 

The latest report from CNE, National Electoral Council from Venezuela at 10:00 pm local time (UCT -4) gives the current president &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chavez Frias&lt;/a&gt; the victory with 61.35% of the total counted so far, 75.3%. His &lt;a href="w%3Asocial%20democrat"&gt;social democratic&lt;/a&gt; rival, &lt;a href="w%3AManuel%20Rosales"&gt;Manuel Rosales&lt;/a&gt;, received 38.39%.

Shortly after the partial results were given, Hugo Chávez appeared on the Balcón del Pueblo of the in the presidential palace to celebrate his victory and address his followers. Chávez announced that a new era has started in Bolivarian development, focused in the expansion of the &lt;a href="w%3ABolivarian%20Revolution"&gt;Bolivarian Revolution&lt;/a&gt;. Chavez' followers were already celebrating their victory with red flags in downtown Caracas.

The leftist president who has been a thorn in the side of the American government told his supporters "It's another defeat for the devil, who tries to dominate the world," referring to US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. "Today we gave another lesson in dignity to the imperialists, it is another defeat for the empire of Mr. Danger," Chavez continued. 

The US has accused Chavez of being dictatorial and a destabilizing influence in &lt;a href="w%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; which Chavez has accused the US of trying to dominate the region and of being behind an attempted coup to force him from power. 
Chavez' popularity is greatest amongst the Venezuela's poor who support his policy of using oil revenues to fund social programs. 

"Today a new era has started, with the expansion of the revolution," said Chavez to his supporters promising to continue with &lt;a href="w%3Asocialism"&gt;socialist&lt;/a&gt; policies. "Long live the socialist revolution, destiny has been written" said Chavez who added. "Nobody should be afraid of &lt;a href="w%3Asocialism"&gt;socialism&lt;/a&gt;... socialism is human, socialism is love... (today) begins a new age... Venezuela, we have proven it, is red" said Chavez in reference to the colors of his political party.

Chavez was first elected in 1998 and was re-elected to a six-year term in 2000. He also defeated a recall election prompted by his opponents in 2004. Chavez is the fourth left-wing leader to win an election in Latin America in the past five weeks.

UK Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; is at 3:30pm to present a &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Paper"&gt;White Paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; today indicating the Government’s plans to replace the &lt;a href="w%3ATrident%20missile"&gt;Trident missile&lt;/a&gt; system with a similar system but on a reduced scale. The speech is called : ♡❤Statement: Trident - The Future of the UK Nuclear Deterrent.♡❤

The Trident defence system was developed as Britain’s response to the &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; which ended with the collapse of the USSR in December 1991. The first Trident submarine went on patrol in December 1994. 

The present system consists of Trident ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads carried by four &lt;a href="w%3AVanguard%20class"&gt;Vanguard class&lt;/a&gt; nuclear powered submarines. The main issue is about the replacement of the submarine fleet.

There is to be debate about the proposals. Supporters who include the majority of the main opposition party, argue that because of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and threats from countries such as &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, Britain must have a nuclear defence capability. Opponents including at least one Cabinet Minister and several Labour back benchers, say that the system is an inappropriate response to the present threats to national security, terrorism, energy shortage and climate change and that there are better ways of spending the money. The Liberals advocate delay in making the decision. Fifteen &lt;a href="w%3AAnglican"&gt;Anglican&lt;/a&gt; bishops have denounced the possession of such a weapon as ‘evil’.

&lt;a href="Alex%20Salmond"&gt;Alex Salmond&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20National%20Party"&gt;Scottish National Party&lt;/a&gt; (SNP), said that although Scotland had no power to stop the replacment of the Trident weapons system, it had a host of powers to protect the environment. He promised that if the UK government went ahead with the Trident project, the SNP would propose to use those powers to stop it proceeding in Scotland. There are two establishments in Scotland, at &lt;a href="w%3AFaslane"&gt;Faslane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARosyth"&gt;Rosyth&lt;/a&gt;, providing services to the nuclear submarine fleet.

In an interview with BBC's Lyse Doucet, retiring Secretary General of the United Nations, &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, confessed to sadness at being unable to prevent the war against &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. He said that although &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; had been a brutal dictator, at least there had been peace in the streets and people were secure in their everyday lives. Saying the war had caused "killing and bitterness", he said that the situation is now "much worse than a civil war".

Mr Annan’s comments provoked the anger of Iraq's national security adviser, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMouwaffaq%20al-Rubaie"&gt;Mouwaffaq al-Rubaie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who said he was shocked by what Kofi Annan had said and, in turn, he accused the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; of failing in its duty to the Iraqi people. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , former &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Defence Secretary and one of the architects of the invasion of Iraq by USA and &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt;, admitted in a secret memorandum that the strategy in Iraq is not working properly. Just two weeks before his resignation he advocated a change in policy saying "Clearly, what US forces are currently doing in Iraq is not working well enough or fast enough".

Former U.S. Secretary of State &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Baker"&gt;James Baker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who heads up the study group commissioned by the President to advise on the situation in Iraq referred to Iraq as being "a helluva mess". On Wednesday, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColin%20Powell"&gt;Colin Powell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , former Secretary of State who was in post at the time of the invasion of Iraq, told a conference in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that Iraq was in a state of civil war. This was an opinion expressed in March by former Iraqi prime minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAyad%20Allawi"&gt;Ayad Allawi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Hillary%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt; has been holding discussions about and interviewing potential campaign staff for a White House bid in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2008%20United%20States%20Election"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Clinton met with Governor-elect &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEliot%20Spitzer"&gt;Eliot Spitzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sunday about support if she chooses to run.

"She said before the election that after the election she would be considering a presidential run," said senior Clinton advisor Howard Wolfson. "Part of that process is seeking the advice and counsel of her colleagues in New York."

One &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt;, who asked to not be named, said he was recently called by a senior Clinton team member. While it was not said that Clinton had chosen to run for president, "it was pretty clear."

New York senior Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Schumer"&gt;Charles Schumer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Clinton's Democratic colleague, told &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; (AP) he would be meeting with Clinton in the next week.

"She wants to sit down and talk next week, which we're going to do. It could be about legislation. I have no idea what it's about, and until we sit down and talk that's all I'm going to say about it. I think she'd make a very good president but let's wait and see. Everyone's sort of jumping the gun." 

Last week, &lt;a href="Iowa"&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; Governor Tom Vilsack announced he would seek the Democratic nomination. &lt;a href="Indiana"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; Democrat Senator Evan Bayh announced Sunday he is considering running for the White House. 

Clinton tops every national poll of likely Democratic candidates and had tried to keep private many of her overtures to supporters and new staff. The deliberations have started to become more public in the last week as the field of likely contenders has begun to expand. 

&lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, has attracted tremendous publicity around a possible run without committing himself. He has jumped to second place behind Clinton in many polls.

Obama's emergence as a potential contender has led some observers to suspect Clinton has stepped up her timetable for making a decision about a run. Her aides dismiss that notion, saying she is observing the timetable she has long planned.

Other likely candidates include 2004 nominee Senator John Kerry; his vice presidential running mate, former &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="John%20Edwards"&gt;John Edwards&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; Gov. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Richardson"&gt;Bill Richardson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; and Senators &lt;a href="Joe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Delaware"&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Christopher%20Dodd"&gt;Christopher Dodd&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Connecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>New Zealand runs low on 20 cent coins</h1>

The &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Reserve Bank of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; wrote to retails banks warning them that there will be a shortage on &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%2020%20cent%20coin"&gt;20 cent coins&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;0.20) leading up to Christmas. They have now announced that they have distributed 4.75 million new twenty cent coins in the past week alone "...close to the number issued in a typical year."

Ten million new coins are expected to arrive in the next few days.

The Reserve Bank is wondering where all the new coins went, just five weeks after the new design was first introduced. Brian Lang, currency manager for the Reserve Bank, said: "The pattern of demand for new coins has been markedly different to that for the old coins." He suggests that people are keeping them in jars, like the old design coins.

Some stores are already unable to give out twenty cent coins as they don't have any according to the &lt;a href="w%3ANewmarket%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Newmarket Business Association&lt;/a&gt;.

Mr Lang said: "To put this into perspective, by 30 November, the Bank had issued almost as many 20c coins (49.6m) as 10c coins (53.0m). In the past issue of 20 cent coins would normally have been about half the amount of 10 cent coins."

The head of Newmarket Business Association, Cameron Brewer, said: "...the Reserve Bank told us that they'd done a lot of work and that everything was going to be just fine. Well here we are just five weeks into the new coins and only days away from the Christmas rush, and the country's running out of its own currency."

Mr Lang said: "The Bank has sufficient supplies of 10c and 50c coins for several years' normal issues."

"...tens of millions of the old 20 cent pieces sit idle because they are no longer legal tender," Mr Brewer said referring to the old 'silver' coins that were used before the introduction of new coins. 

The Reserve Bank still doesn't know why the pattern of demand of twenty cent coins has changed.

"... such a staggering miscalculation by the Reserve Bank should never have happened," Mr Brewer said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has clinched a dramatic win in the second &lt;a href="w%3A2006-07%20Ashes%20series"&gt;2006-07 Ashes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test match&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;. In a massive swing of dominance and control, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20cricket%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; forfeited a huge advantage on the fifth and final day after controlling the Test for the first four.

England won the toss and batted first on the &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide%20Oval"&gt;Adelaide Oval&lt;/a&gt; wicket. After losing a couple of early wickets, they recovered to amass 6-551 dec. spanning the opening two days. &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Collingwood"&gt;Paul Collingwood&lt;/a&gt; scored a patient 206, whilst teammate &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Pietersen"&gt;Kevin Pietersen&lt;/a&gt; built an innings of 158 in a much more brief fashion.

In response, Australia began their first innings poorly, losing &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Hayden"&gt;Matthew Hayden&lt;/a&gt; before the close of play on day 2. On the morning of day 3, Justin Langer and Damien Martyn also fell cheaply. However, a captain's effort by &lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Ponting"&gt;Ricky Ponting&lt;/a&gt; (142) and support by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Clarke"&gt;Michael Clarke&lt;/a&gt; (124), as well as cameos by &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Gilchrist"&gt;Adam Gilchrist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Warne"&gt;Shane Warne&lt;/a&gt;, helped the Aussies to just shy of England's massive total. &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Hoggard"&gt;Matthew Hoggard&lt;/a&gt; was the shining light for the visitors, taking 7-109.

England resumed the fifth day at 1-59, and the match looked headed for a draw. However, with some magic from &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Warne"&gt;Shane Warne&lt;/a&gt;, Australia managed to roll England for just 129 in the last over before tea, setting up a thrilling final session run chase. Warne took 4-49, and was backed up well by &lt;a href="w%3AGlenn%20McGrath"&gt;Glenn McGrath&lt;/a&gt;, who took 2-15.

Requiring 168 to win off 35 overs, Australia came out firing, scoring quickly before losing both Hayden and &lt;a href="w%3AJustin%20Langer"&gt;Justin Langer&lt;/a&gt; early. &lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Ponting"&gt;Ricky Ponting&lt;/a&gt; was joined by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hussey"&gt;Michael Hussey&lt;/a&gt;, who was promoted to number four, and built a steady partnership before Ponting was dismissed for 49. &lt;a href="w%3ADamien%20Martyn"&gt;Damien Martyn&lt;/a&gt; then fell cheaply, and Hussey was joined by &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Clarke"&gt;Michael Clarke&lt;/a&gt; to complete the chase. The pair batted through to the total was reached, with Hussey scoring 61 not out. Australia reached the target with 19 balls to spare, at 6:45pm local time.

No team had lost after declaring on as high a total batting first as England did in more than 125 years of Tests. As a &lt;a href="w%3ANine%20Network"&gt;Nine Network&lt;/a&gt; commentator described it, ♡❤"Australia has just won the most extraordinary Test match; however, it was [a Test] that England should never have lost"♡❤. Prior to the start of play, bookmakers had a draw paying $1.02.

Australia now go into the third test at the &lt;a href="w%3AWACA"&gt;WACA&lt;/a&gt; ground in &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; knowing one more win will reclaim the Ashes urn which they lost for the first time in over a decade in England during 2005.

UK Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; flies tomorrow to meet &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt;. High on the agenda will be the situation in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. The No. 10 press office said yesterday that it was a happy coincidence that the report of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Study%20Group"&gt;Iraq Study Group&lt;/a&gt; would be published during his visit, but that he was not likely to meet&lt;a href="w%3A%20James%20Baker"&gt;James Baker&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Hamilton"&gt;Lee Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, the joint authors of the report.

Among the issues to be discussed will be relations with &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;. Blair had set out his position in a speech to the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20World%20Affairs%20Council"&gt;Los Angeles World Affairs Council&lt;/a&gt; August 1, 2006, saying "♡❤we need to make clear to Syria and Iran that there is a choice: come in to the international community and play by the same rules as the rest of us; or be confronted"♡❤

However a speech by Blair on World Affairs at the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Mayor%27s%20Banquet"&gt;Lord Mayor's Banquet&lt;/a&gt;, on November 13, 2006, gave rise to such conflicting reports about his position on Iran, that the White House felt it necessary to issue a “Setting the record straight” press release the next day. It said that whereas the London-based &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; reported that Blair had "♡❤Offered No Dramatic New Policy Proposals♡❤"; the Washington-based reporting by the same papers had claimed that “♡❤…Blair shifted his position♡❤”. The White House press office concluded that Blair’s position was not new and that it was similar to the President’s policy. Both leaders had expressed willingness to open talks with Iran provided it complied with &lt;a href="w%3AUN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; resolutions and verifiably suspended &lt;a href="w%3Auranium%20enrichment"&gt;uranium enrichment&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>NASA unveils plans for moon base</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has unveiled plans to set up a self-sustaining settlement at the South Pole of the &lt;a href="w%3AMoon"&gt;Moon&lt;/a&gt; by 2020.

The plan calls for four-person crews to begin the construction on a rotating basis with week-long stays, advancing toward a permanent presence by 2024. Initial infrastructure would be brought to the Moon from Earth; as work progressed, the settlement would provide hydrogen and oxygen mined from the lunar surface to make water and rocket fuel.

While NASA plans to use American astronauts in the construction and maintenance of the base, plans are underway for a multinational effort. Canada has been asked to provide astronauts for assistance, and NASA has since entered talks with the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;, Australia, China, France, Germany, England, India, Italy, Russia, South Korea, and Ukraine to see how those nations and space agencies may be able to contribute to costs, logistics and other efforts. NASA did not release figures on how much the settlement will cost to build and maintain, but have been searching for both public and private funding from around the globe. 

NASA says that the base will serve as part of a mission to learn about the Moon and places beyond. It is also seen as part of a long-range plan to send astronauts to &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;.

This will be the first manned mission to the moon since 1972.

Former &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; Senator and &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrats"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; Vice-Presidential Candidate &lt;a href="John%20Edwards"&gt;John Edwards&lt;/a&gt; took a major step in declaring candidacy for the 2008 U.S. Presidential election by naming former congressman David Bonior his campaign manager. David Bonior has close ties with labor organizations, something Edwards can relate to because he represented many labor unions during his career as a lawyer.

Bonior represented &lt;a href="w%3ADetroit"&gt;Detroit's&lt;/a&gt; northern suburbs for 26 years in the House, rising to be the No. 2 Democrat before stepping down in 2002 for an unsuccessful campaign for &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; governor.

Since leaving Congress, Bonior has been a professor of labor studies at Detroit's Wayne State University and chairman of American Rights at Work, which promotes employees' rights to unionize.

Bonior is currently the chair of American Rights at Work.

Texas Tech coach Mike Leach is reportedly interested in taking the vacant head football coaching job at the University of Miami, numerous sources have reported.

As early as Dec. 1, reports were filtering out that Leach was open to discussing the job. Over the weekend, message boards and blogs were openly discussing the possibility that the coach, known for his wide-open offenses while at Tech, will make the jump to the Hurricanes.

Leach, whose Red Red Raiders went 7-5 this season, is slated to coach in the Insight Bowl on Dec. 29.

&lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple Computers&lt;/a&gt; announced today that it's long awaited &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; store is available to New Zealanders. They also launched the online Apple Store New Zealand which provides Apple products, such as &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20mini"&gt;Mac minis&lt;/a&gt;, etc. New Zealand is number 22 on the number of countries who have the iTunes store and the tenth music download store in New Zealand.

The launch means that New Zealanders can now download music to transfer to their iPods, legally. However the music is only available to iPod's as converting the music to the &lt;a href="w%3AMP3"&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt; standard for other MP3 players is illegal in New Zealand. Some music download sites in New Zealand support MP3 formats, like Digirama which sell their music tracks for $1.75.

The New Zealand iTunes store provides the most digital music tracks in New Zealand at around two million and each song costs &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;1.79 or a music video costs $3.59 of which there around thousands, an album will usually cost about $17.99 and a game will cost $7.99. The music tracks also include New Zealand artists such as Brooke Fraser, Tim Finn, Fat Freddy's Drop, etc and also includes international exclusive albums such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ben Harper, etc.

Eddy Cue, vice president of Apple, said: "We're thrilled to bring the iTunes Store and the online Apple Store to our customers in New Zealand just in time for the holidays."

There were rumours surrounding the launch of a New Zealand iTunes store this week.

The &lt;a href="w%3APodcast"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; section on iTunes also covers a wide range of podcasts, equalling over 65,000. The New Zealand podcasts include such companies as &lt;a href="w%3ATelevision%20New%20Zealand"&gt;TVNZ (Television New Zealand)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARadio%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Radio New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and The Voice Booth.

It is commonly believed that the reason the store was halted until now was because Apple has to make separate contracts with each recording company in each country.

iTunes is likely to become the dominant music download store in New Zealand, following the trend of other countries.

The special edition iPod nano has also been released in New Zealand. The special edition is red in colour instead of the normal white and black colours. The special iPod is available only on the online store at the same price as the normal iPod nanos but some of the profit goes to help fight HIV/AIDS in Africa.

Renaissance is New Zealand's distributor of Apple goods and will still keep its contract despite Renaissance not being directly involved in both of the new online stores. Renaissance said: "New Zealand will now come under Apple's worldwide pricing model."

<h1>Australian MPs suggest Australia and New Zealand unification</h1>

A committee of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MPs&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that Australia and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; become a single nation in the future. The suggestion follows an investigation into harmonising the countries' legal systems.

The two countries are separated by 1900 km (1200 miles) of sea. Australia has a population of 20 million, while New Zealand has a population of 4 million.

Prior to 1901, New Zealand was considered one of the seven &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; colonies of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralasia"&gt;Australasia&lt;/a&gt;, six of which united to form Australia in 1901.

The committee, which had representatives from both sides of Australian politics found that there were close ties between the two countries. People are free to move between the two countries without visas and there is a high-degree of co-operation between governments. The committee's report said "While New Zealand ultimately chose not to join the federation, it is still included in the definition of the states in the Australian constitution.

"This historical context forms a backdrop to the closeness and breadth of the relationship between Australia and New Zealand today.

"While Australia and New Zealand are, of course, two sovereign nations, it seems to the committee that the strong ties between the two countries - the economic, cultural, migration, defence, governmental, and people to people linkages - suggest that an even closer relationship, including the possibility of union, is both desirable and realistic."

Chairman of the committee, Peter Slipper said Australia now wished for another committee to be established to look at integration between the two nations in the future. Such a committee would be poised to look at monetary and national union.

The committee acknowledged that despite legal harmonisation being relatively easy, the merger of the two countries could be difficult. "The committee is also mindful that the harmonisation of laws is very much the art of the possible. Thus the merger of Australia and New Zealand or the progression to a unitary system of government in Australia, however desirable, might not be easy to achieve," the committee's report said.

The suggestion has received a cold reception in New Zealand. New Zealand's citizens have regularly rejected suggestions that their country be part of Australia, a sentiment echoed by Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt;. Mrs Clark said she had no intention of placing the proposal on the government's agenda.

"It won't be on our agenda 105 years later", she said.

New Zealand's Foreign Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Peters"&gt;Winston Peters&lt;/a&gt; dismissed the proposal calling it a case of "parliamentary adventurism". He said despite the two countries close relationship, the two countries were too geographically separated. "New Zealand is 1200 miles (1900 km) away from Australia and that's 1200 reasons why I don't go along with that committee, nor will New Zealanders," Mr Peters said.

The six game match in Bonn, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; had a final result of 4-2 for the German-developed chess program which runs on readily available computer hardware.

The first match which concluded on November 25 was a draw, Kramnik lost the second game to the computer with some indications that he overlooked a mate in one win. Third through fifth matches were all draws.

Kramnik, whilst the current &lt;a href="w%3AClassical%20World%20Chess%20Championship%202000"&gt;world chess champion&lt;/a&gt;, is actually ranked third in the world. A contributory factor in this is his health problems. The world champion suffers from a rare form of arthritis which makes sitting playing in tournaments extremely painful for him.

The launch of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France's&lt;/a&gt; new 24 hour TV news channel, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%2024"&gt;France 24&lt;/a&gt;, saw the new jointly owned channel start by going online. A streaming broadcast became available on the internet from 19:29 &lt;a href="w%3AGreenwich%20Mean%20Time"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt; today. Future plans are to have the new channel available on cable and satellite with English and French reporting. Coverage in Arabic and Spanish is among the ambitious future plans for the channel.

Founded by a joint venture between private group &lt;a href="w%3ATF1"&gt;TF1&lt;/a&gt; and the public &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20T%C3%A9l%C3%A9visions"&gt;France Télévisions&lt;/a&gt; the new channel is managed by Alain de Pouzilhac, former &lt;a href="w%3AHavas"&gt;Havas&lt;/a&gt; head. Employing 170 journalists and a total of 380 people, France 24 is funded by 86 million &lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt; of public money.

The motto of the new freely-available international channel is "un regard français", aiming to promote a French world-view the channel was a project with the blessing of the country's president, &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;.

As a free channel streaming over the Internet and available by satellite the following are the carriers who have agreed to broadcast transmissions: Hot-Bird 7A, Astra 1KR, EuroBird (Europe), ArabSat, NileSat (Maghreb, Middle-east), NSS7 (bandeC) (Africa). In the United States it will be available on the Comcast network, and over the air into Washington D.C. A variety of government Internet sites such as the Department of State, and international entities will carry the channel's content. It is not known when it will be available in Canada.

The content sources will be from &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%202"&gt;France 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATF1"&gt;TF1&lt;/a&gt; desks, &lt;a href="w%3AAFP"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARFI"&gt;RFI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARFO"&gt;RFO&lt;/a&gt;.

The Iraq Study Group presented its report at 12.00 GMT today. It warns ♡❤No one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this point will stop sectarian warfare, growing violence, or a slide toward chaos♡❤.

The Report opens with plea for open debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States about the policy towards the Middle East.
The Report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the present policy of the Executive towards Iraq and it urges an immediate change of direction. First among its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq’s borders against hostile interventions and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbors. 

The Group points out that it is in the interest of its neighbors, that there should be stability in Iraq. To this end, it proposes the formation of an Iraq International Support Group to include not only those countries, but also key states in the region, the member states of the UN Security Council and other countries such as Germany, Japan and South Korea. The US contribution should be led at least by the Secretary of State or even the President himself. Urgent attention should be directed to establishing Arab-Israeli peace on all fronts.

The Study Group recognizes that the establishment of permanent US military bases in Iraq would be a major impediment to establishing stability in the country. The role of the armed forces should be redefined and between 10,000 and 20,000 troops (compared with 3,000 to 4,000 now) should be deployed to the task of developing the combat capability of Iraq armed forces. The aim should be to withdraw all US combat forces early in 2008.

The Report is critical of the US intelligence services and urges that more resources should be devoted to training those about to serve in the theatre in the language and culture of the region. It asserted that government is still largely ignorant of the insurgency in Iraq or of the role of the militias.

The Group considered, but rejected, options involving the partitioning of Iraq and asserted the importance of creating and maintaining a democratically elected government of Iraq as an independent sovereign state.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; voted overwhelmingly today to confirm &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , replacing outgoing Secretary of Defense &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The vote came a day after the Armed Services Committee voted unanimously to recommend Gates's confirmation.

Senators from both parties praised Gates for bluntly stating that the United States was not winning the war in Iraq, and that new strategies were needed. "Dr. Gates spoke with candor &amp;mdash; a candor that has been sorely missing from the Department of Defense under this administration," said Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20M.%20Kennedy"&gt;Edward Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;MA&lt;/a&gt;). "He recognized the high price that our troops are paying for the current policy." &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArlen%20Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; said that Senators saw "the possibilities of a new chapter ... but it is up to the commander in chief to structure a change in policy."

Gates was approved by a vote of 95-2, with dissenting votes coming from Republican Senators &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARick%20Santorum"&gt;Rick Santorum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of Pennsylvania and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Bunning"&gt;Jim Bunning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Kentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; named Gates, now aged 63, who had served as Director of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; under his father, President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20H.W.%20Bush"&gt;George H.W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the day after Democrats won control of both houses of the incoming 110th Congress in an election marked by frustration over the continuing war in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ACNET"&gt;CNET&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Kim"&gt;James Kim&lt;/a&gt; has been found dead in the southwestern &lt;a href="Oregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; wilderness after getting lost with his family on November 25. Kim, 35, was found at 12:00 noon Wednesday, half a mile away from the &lt;a href="w%3ARogue%20River%20%28Oregon%29"&gt;Rogue River&lt;/a&gt;.

His wife &lt;a href="w%3AKati%20Kim"&gt;Kati Kim&lt;/a&gt;, 30-years-old, and her two young children were found alive on December 4 after they waved an umbrella to a private helicopter. Kati and her two children were airlifted out of the area and transferred by ambulance to Three Rivers Community Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AGrants%20Pass%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Grants Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Kati suffered frostbite on two toes, but it is expected that she will be in good condition.

The Kim family left &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; on November 17 on a road trip to the Pacific Northwest. After, they planned to go back home to San Francisco but were stranded in a storm that led to their disappearance.

They stayed warm while they were stranded by using the car heater and then burned tires when they ran out of gas. Kim walked into the Oregon mountains Saturday to get help for his wife Kati and his children. Pieces of map and some clothing were found on the mountains Tuesday by rescuers. It is believed that Kim was marking his trail for them. The wet clothing included two gray sweat shirts, a red T-shirt, a sock, and a blue girl's skirt.

"They were laid out in a well defined area, in a pattern," Lt. Gregg Hastings of the &lt;a href="w%3AOregon%20State%20Patrol"&gt;Oregon State Patrol&lt;/a&gt; said.

Fog caused the police to wait till midday. "This is frustrating. We are so close," one rescuer said. "There are people pouring their heart and soul into this. We are not going to quit until we find him."

Kim's family is not yet available for comment.

At approximately 8:10 AM &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Standard%20Time"&gt;CST&lt;/a&gt; December 6, 2006 a factory owned by the &lt;a href="w%3AFalk%20Corporation"&gt;FALK Corporation&lt;/a&gt; exploded in &lt;a href="w%3AMilwaukee"&gt;Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;. 

The blast could apparently be felt up to thirty miles away. A plume of smoke was seen rising from the explosion site, and the area around the factory was reported to smell of burning wood.

The explosion apparently occurred when a container of 72,000 gallons of &lt;a href="w%3APropane"&gt;propane&lt;/a&gt; exploded, destroying the building. Three people are confirmed dead and forty-six injured, with one person suffering life-threatening injuries, according to a press conference with Milwaukee Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Barrett%20%28politician%29"&gt;Tom Barrett&lt;/a&gt; and Milwaukee Police Chief Nan Hagerty at 5:00 PM CST broadcast on &lt;a href="w%3AWTMJ-TV"&gt;WTMJ-TV&lt;/a&gt; in Milwaukee. Local news reports state that the three dead were aged 37, 49, and 38.

With a population of 596,000 (according to the 2000 Census), Milwaukee is the 19th largest city in the United States.

The factory had made industrial gears since the 1800s.

&lt;a href="w%3ATaco%20Bell"&gt;Taco Bell&lt;/a&gt; restaurants decided Wednesday to remove green onions from all 5,800 of its continental U.S. stores after a November 29 outbreak of &lt;a href="w%3AEscherichia%20coli"&gt;E.coli&lt;/a&gt; food poisonings caused the voluntary closing of 9 &lt;a href="w%3AMid-Atlantic%20States"&gt;mid-Atlantic states&lt;/a&gt; stores and led health officials to investigate the chain's regional supplier. As many as 66 people reportedly became ill in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Long Island, New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;.

The E.coli outbreak also caused &lt;a href="w%3ATaco%20Bell"&gt;Taco Bell Canada&lt;/a&gt; to recall green onions from all 182 locations across Canada. Officials with the Canadian branch said Wednesday evening that they would take precaution by removing green onions from all stores in Canada after hearing of the outbreak in the U.S.

Jon Prinsell, president of &lt;a href="w%3AYum%21%20Brands"&gt;Yum! Canada&lt;/a&gt;, which operates Taco Bell Canada commented:
The &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; are currently collecting samples of all non-meat items including cilantro, cheddar cheese, blended cheese, green onions, yellow onions, tomatoes, and lettuce.

A man from Pennsylvania became sick after eating at Taco Bell and sued the owner of Taco Bell headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3AIrvine%2C%20California"&gt;Irvine, California&lt;/a&gt;. Another one includes a 11-year-old boy who ate at Taco Bell, was hospitalized in New York, and also sued the owner.

Most of the E. coli related sicknesses occurred in the northeast USA. No related sickness have occurred in Canada.

Health officials investigating the source of the tainted green onions, also known as &lt;a href="w%3Ascallion"&gt;scallions&lt;/a&gt;, have traced the vegetable's food distribution chain to the Texas-based McLane Co., which in turn got them from &lt;a href="w%3AIrwindale%2C%20California"&gt;Irwindale&lt;/a&gt;-based Ready Pac.

The scallions were grown by Boskovich Farms Inc. of &lt;a href="w%3AOxnard%2C%20California"&gt;Oxnard, California&lt;/a&gt; said Steve Dickstein, the marketing vice president for Ready Pac. At what point in the food distribution chain the scallions became tainted remains under investigation.

<h1>NASA: Signs of liquid water found on surface of Mars</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%3A%20Signs%20of%20liquid%20water%20found%20on%20surface%20of%20Mars&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

"These observations give the strongest evidence to date that water still flows occasionally on the surface of Mars," said the head scientist for the Mars Exploration Program in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, Michael Meyer. 

The bright appearance of the deposits suggests that, at some recent period, the surface material in these gullies has either been heavily disturbed or covered over by new, different, material. Whilst it is not proven that this is the result of water activity&amp;mdash;it could be frost, for example, or the result of localized landslides&amp;mdash;it ties in with previous theories that suggest liquid water is locked below the surface of Mars, occasionally being released in short and violent local bursts.

"These fresh deposits suggest that at some places and times on present-day Mars, liquid water is emerging from beneath the ground and briefly flowing down the slopes. This possibility raises questions about how the water would stay melted below ground, how widespread it might be, and whether there's a below-ground wet habitat conducive to life." said Michael Malin of Malin Space Science Systems located in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego, California&lt;/a&gt;. Malin is the head investigator for the Mars Orbital Camera, the instrument which made these photographs, and is the author of the report about the discovery, published in the journal ♡❤Science♡❤.
One factor suggesting water is the shape of the deposits, which are sinuous and appear to "flow" downhill. "The shapes of these deposits are what you would expect to see if the material were carried by flowing water. They have finger-like branches at the downhill end and easily diverted around small obstacles," explained Malin. Scientists do not know how or why the water is making its way to the surface. "The big question is how does it happen, and does it point to a habitat for life?" said Meyer.

However, many in the scientific community stress possible alternative explanations for what has been seen, suggesting that the features could have been created by dust, sand or liquid carbon dioxide. Oded Aharonson of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) described the hypothesis of recent water activity on Mars as just one possible explanation and insisted further study was needed to determine whether the deposits could have been left there by the flow of dust rather than water.

Other scientists think it possible that the gullies were caused by liquid carbon dioxide. One reason is that computer models of the Martian crust indicate water could exist only at depths of several kilometers, but liquid carbon dioxide could persist much nearer the surface.

Contact was lost with Mars Global Surveyor in November, and has not yet been recovered. The spacecraft has been in orbit since 1997, operating over a lifespan which far exceeded the two-year mission originally planned. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, manages the Mars Global Surveyor mission for the NASA Science Mission Directorate located in Washington D.C..

An &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight from &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%2C%20Texas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt; was forced to land in &lt;a href="w%3ANashville%2C%20Tennessee"&gt;Nashville&lt;/a&gt; after a Dallas woman lit her &lt;a href="w%3AFlatulence"&gt;flatulence&lt;/a&gt; to disguise its odour; several passengers noticed a suspicious smell.

The Dallas woman, who had ignited her fart in the lavatory, had not been forthcoming about the burning smell noticed by other passengers. All passengers and crew were disembarked while the plane and luggage were searched.
A &lt;a href="w%3ABomb-sniffing%20dog"&gt;bomb sniffing dog&lt;/a&gt; located her spent matches and the woman admitted to lighting her fart to disguise odor after a "lengthy questioning" by the &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;. She said her flatulence was caused by a medical condition.

A spokeswoman for Nashville airport said "Since there was no malice involved and the incident was accidental, she was not charged with anything."

After the flight resumed, the woman was not allowed back on the plane.

The &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand Government&lt;/a&gt; has tabled the Therapeutic Products and Medicines Bill, despite unprecedented political opposition.

In 2003 the &lt;a href="w%3AAnnette%20King"&gt;Hon Annette King&lt;/a&gt; signed a Treaty with Australia agreeing to hand control of the natural health products sector over to an Australian regulatory body, however she needs to pass enabling legislation in New Zealand. "This will be a world-class joint scheme designed to regulate the safety, quality, effectiveness and promotion of therapeutic products in both New Zealand and Australia. That includes the regulation of complementary and alternative medicines, over-the-counter and prescription medicines, medical devices, blood and blood products and tissues and cellular therapies," Ms King said.

Twice the Bill has been thrown out by select committees, but the Government is determined to ram it through Parliament, according to the New Zealand Health Trust.

"Late tonight the Bill was finally tabled, with no announcement from the Minister," said Amy Adams, spokesperson for the Trust, "Clearly the Minister is keen to sneak it into Parliament under cover of the silly season, in the hope that she can keep it under the public's radar."

"I welcome the support of a majority of the House who want to see the Bill go to Select Committee where New Zealanders can have their say," Ms King said.

The NZ Health Trust conducted research earlier this year which showed 62% of New Zealanders used natural health products. "This Bill represents a massive and irreparable change to the way we make rules for New Zealand dietary supplements," Mrs Adams said.

"Under the proposed regime, well over a million New Zealand consumers would find the choice of products adversely affected, and experience cost increases. So you can see why the Government is trying to sneak this into the House without any fuss - they don't want the public to know."

All the political parties except Labour have pledged their opposition the proposal, despite some intense lobbying by Australian and New Zealand officials.

"It is a very serious thing to hand sovereignty over your country over to another nation," Mrs Adams said. "And all the other political parties see the sense in making sure the sector is regulated from New Zealand - not as a minor state of Australia."

Ms King said: "The Bill... ensures that New Zealand will have an equal say in the setting up and running of the new Authority and joint scheme." The new authority will be like a crown-owned entity and will have to provide an anuual report and a statement of intent to parliament each year.

&lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; theologians seek to change the Islamic position on &lt;a href="w%3Afemale%20circumcision"&gt;female circumcision&lt;/a&gt; at a conference at Cairo's &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Azhar%20University"&gt;Al-Azhar University&lt;/a&gt;. The theologians decided that female circumcision is forbidden by Sura 95, Verse 4 of the &lt;a href="w%3AKoran"&gt;Koran&lt;/a&gt;: "We have created man in the most perfect image."

It represents a major shift in the position of the Muslim religious community because many of the attending theologians are extremely powerful and respected, including Mahmoud Hamdi Saksuk, the Egyptian minister for religious charities, and Mohammed Sayyid Tantawi, the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar University.

A minority of liberal Muslim scolars had denounced the practice as early as 1998; however, hardliners continuned to endorse the practice. 

In 1994, the Egyptian Mufti Sheikh Jad Al-Hâqq 'Ali Jad Al-Hâqq issued a fatwa stating "Circumcision is mandatory for men and for women. If the people of any village decide to abandon it, the [village] imam must fight against them as if they had abandoned the call to prayer."

Al-Azhar University itself issued fatwas endorsing female genital mutilation in 1949, 1951 and 1981, which were only reversed by Dean Ahmend Talib in 2005.

The conference was organized and funded by the Target group of German adventurer Rüdiger Nehberg, who had travelled through Africa and collected video material on the practice. The Egyptian religious scholar and journalist Yusuf al-Qaradawi criticized the foreign influence and stated that the conference was "biased and presumptuous"; however, he ultimately accepted its conclusions.

<h1>Same-sex marriage reaffirmed in Canada</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Same-sex%20marriage%20reaffirmed%20in%20Canada&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;Canadian House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; has voted 175 to 123 to defeat a motion by the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aminority%20government"&gt;minority government&lt;/a&gt; to re-open the &lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; debate. If the motion had passed the government would have proposed a bill to restore the traditional definition of marriage as being exclusively a union between a man and a woman. The Conservative and Liberal parties did not &lt;a href="w%3Aparliamentary%20whip"&gt;whip&lt;/a&gt; the vote allowing their MPs a &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20vote"&gt;free vote&lt;/a&gt;.

The motion voted on read as follows: "That this House call on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages."

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, 47, made holding the vote a key promise in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20election%2C%202006"&gt;2006 federal election campaign&lt;/a&gt;.

About a dozen Conservative MPs, including several &lt;a href="w%3ACabinet%20of%20Canada"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt; ministers voted against the motion in the free vote while about a dozen &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aparliamentary%20opposition"&gt;opposition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt;s voted for the motion. No MPs for the opposition &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Quebecois"&gt;Bloc Quebecois&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; voted in favour the motion although two members of the BQ did not vote because they were paired and a third was absent from the vote.

"We made a promise to have a free vote on this issue; we kept that promise, and obviously the vote was decisive and obviously we'll accept the democratic result of the people's representatives," Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Thursday at a news conference in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; following the vote. "I don't see reopening this question in the future."

The Liberals said that even if a new law banning same-sex marriage was passed it would be struck down by the courts as &lt;a href="w%3Aunconstitutional"&gt;unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;. Constitutional lawyers say that the Tories would have to change the law by invoking the notwithstanding clause of the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Charter%20of%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms"&gt;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&lt;/a&gt;, which Harper opposes doing.

"It was the wrong move to question the rights of the people and to try to override the Charter of rights...He must not be very proud of that," said Liberal Leader &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;.

High profile &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Tory&lt;/a&gt; cabinet ministers &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20MacKay"&gt;Peter MacKay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Emerson"&gt;David Emerson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Baird%20%28Canadian%20politician%29"&gt;John Baird&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Prentice"&gt;Jim Prentice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Cannon"&gt;Lawrence Cannon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9e%20Verne"&gt;Josée Verne&lt;/a&gt; voted against the motion. &lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20Canadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House Speaker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Milliken"&gt;Peter Milliken&lt;/a&gt;, who is a Liberal, did not vote as the Speaker only votes to break a tie. 

Harper declared the matter closed, following the vote, ruling out the possibility of revisiting the issue. "I don't see reopening this question in the future," the prime minister told reporters when asked if his government would reintroduce the motion after the next election should the Conservatives win a &lt;a href="w%3Amajority%20government"&gt;majority government&lt;/a&gt;.

Same-sex marriage was legalized in 2005 by the former Liberal government lead by &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; after a series of court rulings legalized same-sex marriage across most of the country. The 2005 legislation made Canada the fourth country in the world to legalize gay marriage. Over 12,000 gay couples have married in Canada since &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20Marriage%20Act"&gt;Bill C-38&lt;/a&gt; passed.

&lt;a href="w%3ABelgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ANetherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; are currently the only countries that allow gay marriage.

&lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has scrubbed the launch of &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle"&gt;Space Shuttle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AOV-103"&gt;♡❤Discovery♡❤&lt;/a&gt; on mission &lt;a href="w%3ASTS-116"&gt;STS-116&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AISS"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; during the final stages of the countdown, after the weather conditions were considered unfavourable for launch, due to a low cloud ceiling and strong winds caused by a low front.

The launch, which was scheduled to be the third Shuttle launch this year, was to have occurred at 02:35 &lt;a href="w%3AGMT"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt;, Florida, however it has now been rescheduled. The next possible launch can occur at the same time on December 9.

The scrub occurred during an unscheduled hold in the countdown, 5 minutes before the launch was to have occurred.

The STS-116 mission is a flight to the International Space Station, to install a new truss segment, and deploy 4 nanosats. It will also perform a crew change. The mission duration is 12 days.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;New Zealand National party&lt;/a&gt; is asking state owned entity &lt;a href="w%3ATelevision%20New%20Zealand"&gt;TVNZ (Television New Zealand)&lt;/a&gt;, why they broadcast the coup threats the military commander, &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Bainimarama"&gt;Commodore Frank Bainimarama&lt;/a&gt;, made live to the world.

"The question that TVNZ must answer is was this a legitimate media conference, or were they acting under the instruction of Frank Bainimarama. Be it inadvertent or not, the New Zealand public broadcaster has become a tool of the coup leader," &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Brownlee"&gt;Gerry Brownlee&lt;/a&gt;, state owned enterprises spokesman for the National party, said.

"Television New Zealand news is run by professional journalists and has a duty to cover news of major significance," Andrew Little, national secretary of &lt;a href="w%3AEngineering%2C%20Printing%20and%20Manufacturing%20Union"&gt;Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union&lt;/a&gt; which represents journalists, said.

During question and answer time in Parliament on Thursday 8 December, Mr Brownlee asked &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Cullen"&gt;Dr Michael Cullen&lt;/a&gt; if the broadcasting was consistent with government public services policies. Dr Cullen did not answer the question as he said that there was no evidence or reports and Dr Cullen does not trust Mr Brownlee's word. 

"This is not a question about whether the Commodore's threats were news. They were. This is a question about whether, without TVNZ's satellite assistance, the Commodore would have been as effective in his campaign of fear," Mr Brownlee said.

"[The journalists] and they alone should decide what should be covered. The day that a politician decides what the state broadcaster covers will be a sad day for the integrity of New Zealand democracy," Mr Little said. The union seeking insurances “The union is seeking an assurance from the National Party that media censorship is not National Party policy.”

Mr Brownlee commented: "I for one don't want to see TVNZ becoming the &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; of the South Pacific..."

Two police officers working for the Buffalo Police Department in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; have been shot numerous times and still managed to apprehend the suspect, without firing a shot back at the suspect. Both officers were rushed to Erie County Medical Center for treatment.

Officer Patricia Parete, 41 was shot twice at close range and had to be revived by paramedics on the scene. Parete was shot in the jaw and the bullet severed her spinal cord. Parete already underwent one surgical procedure and her condition is "very grave," according to H. McCarthy Gipson, the Buffalo Police Commissioner. Her condition remains serious. Her condition was upgraded from critical to serious after surgery on December 6, 2006. A bullet proof vest stopped the first bullet from penetrating her chest area.

Officer Carl Andolina was shot twice, once in the left arm and once in the neck. The bullet piercing his neck is still stuck near his throat, and doctors cannot remove it until swelling around the area goes down. He has since been released from the hospital to recover at home before doctors remove the lodged bullet.

Both officers were shot by a .38-caliber revolver. At least 5 shots total were fired.

The two officers were responding to a call at about 9:00 p.m. on December 5, that a male and female were fighting inside a Valero gas station located on West Chippewa and Elmwood Avenues in Downtown Buffalo when one of the suspects, Varner Harris, 18 who lives in Buffalo fled police. When the officers began to chase Harris, he turned and fired several shots at the officers, wounding both of them. Despite being shot two times, Andolina still managed to give a short chase to apprehend the suspect, tackling him to the ground. Neither officer fired any shots.

"He [Harris] immediately opened fire. The officers never exchanged gunfire," said a spokesman for Buffalo's Mayor's office, Peter K. Cutler.

Harris is facing two counts of attempted murder.

<h1>Bush reacts to the Iraq Study Report</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%20reacts%20to%20the%20Iraq%20Study%20Report&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

When introducing the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Study%20Group%20Report"&gt;Iraq Study Group Report&lt;/a&gt; to a Senate Committee, former Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Baker"&gt;James Baker&lt;/a&gt; emphasized that all the 79 recommendations in the report complemented each other and had to be taken together. This was not a “fruit salad" from which one could pick and choose. Despite this, &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; is giving indications that he is going to do just that. While agreeing that the Report had some good points to make, he said that he had also asked the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt; and other government agencies to reflect on the Iraq situation and report their conclusions to him. 

The report proposes progressive changes to the role of the troops deployed in Iraq, from combat to the training of Iraqi forces and the withdrawal of all combat troops by early 2008, depending on local conditions. The President made it clear that matters concerning the deployment of troops were for the military to determine. A change of strategy is expected to be announced within the next few weeks. 

Bush has said that he will not talk with &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; unless they meet certain conditions. Syria would have to "stop destabilizing" the government of the &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. Iran must “verifiably suspend their nuclear enrichment program." In declaring these conditions, Bush and &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, prime movers in the invasion of &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, are in agreement. 

Tony Blair reflected that the report’s recommendations that settling the Arab/Israeli disputes in the area should be given priority. He has said that the key to solving the problems in Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere lay in settling the two-state disputes in Palestine. He announced that he would be visiting the region shortly. He would bring his experience in Northern Ireland to bear on the problem, indicating that persistence was needed to achieve reconciliation. President Bush said he supported this initiative.

Meanwhile, &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%E2%80%99s"&gt;Israel’s&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;, flatly rejected the notion that there was any connection between the problems in Palestine and the situation in Iraq. He stated that the time may not be right for Israel to be negotiating with Syria and he reiterated Israel’s absolute opposition to Iran’s development of nuclear weapons. &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Gates"&gt;Robert Gates&lt;/a&gt;, the new candidate US Secretary of Defense, asserted that Iran is surrounded by nuclear powers, including Israel. &lt;a href="w%3AShimon%20Peres"&gt;Shimon Peres&lt;/a&gt;, Israel’s deputy prime minister, refused to affirm or deny whether Israel had a nuclear weapons capability, saying that such uncertainty was a defense in itself.

<h1>Fiji suspended from Commonwealth</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fiji%20suspended%20from%20Commonwealth&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At an urgent meeting held today in London the &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20of%20Nations"&gt;Commonwealth&lt;/a&gt; has decided to suspend &lt;a href="w%3AFiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt;, following the military coup that took place in Fiji three days ago. The suspension is immediate.

The decision was made unanimously by the Ministerial Action Group. The group contained eight foreign ministers from Commonwealth countries, including United Kingdom. 

&lt;a href="w%3ADon%20McKinnon"&gt;Don McKinnon&lt;/a&gt;, secretary general of the Commonwealth, described the coup as a: "a serious violation of the Commonwealth's fundamental principles." Mr McKinnon said: "Fiji's military regime should forthwith be suspended from the Councils of the Commonwealth pending the restoration of democracy and the rule of law in that country. It would be our endeavour to obviously engage with the regime as soon as we can in order to do what we can to bring the country back to democracy."

The suspension results in Fiji not taking part in any Commonwealth meetings nor activities. However existing technical assistance will continue but no new assistance programmes will be started.

The military coup that took place a few days ago has already been condemned by Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Fiji's Council of Chiefs and religious groups. New Zealand has barred the military leader and president of Fiji, &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Bainimarama"&gt;Commander Frank Bainimarama&lt;/a&gt;, from visiting New Zealand where some of his family live and has also banned seasonal workers coming from Fiji to work in New Zealand.

Commander Bainimarama has sworn in &lt;a href="w%3AJona%20Senilagakali"&gt;Doctor Jona Senilagakali&lt;/a&gt; as the caretaker Prime Minster. Dr Senilagakali is an old military medic and relatively new at politics.

A group of African refugees complained to the &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki%20Citizens%20Assembly"&gt;Helsinki Citizen's Assembly&lt;/a&gt; (HCA) Refugee Support Program that they were taken under custody and that they were forced to work for the Turkish police. 

According to H.R.M., a 38 years old refugee from &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt; who has been in Turkey for the last 16 months, on November 30th, when the Pope was visiting &lt;a href="w%3AHagia%20Sophia"&gt;Hagia Sophia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASultan%20Ahmed%20Mosque"&gt;Sultan Ahmed Mosque&lt;/a&gt;, he and his twelve roommates decided not to go outside because of the rumours that blacks were being taken under custody by the Turkish police. However, when he ended up having to go outside to buy food at 10pm, he was taken under custody and put on a police car. H.R.M. claims to find himself in Sultanahmet area, where 
According to H.R.M.'s claims, this took about two hours, after which they were taken to a work site where they were made to empty the fences in the trucks. He tells:
He complains that he was treated like a slave by the Turkish police. He says:
Özlem Dalkıran, a spokeswoman for HCA Refugees Support Program told that they were receiving many reports of collective false arrests and forced labor and that they will be reporting these to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 

The İstanbul Police Office released a press statement that said they "do not think any response to the allegations would be appropriate". 

There are many illegal African immigrants in Istanbul seeking a way into Europe; which has led to conflicts with native Turks.

U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; told reporters that she would be prepared to meet the Iranian foreign secretary, at any time and anywhere. But &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; must stop its &lt;a href="w%3Auranium%20enrichment"&gt;uranium enrichment&lt;/a&gt; activities "so that they can't keep improving those enrichment capabilities while we talk." 

She said that, if it suited their interests, both Iran and &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; would stabilize Iraq without having to be asked to do so by the United States. If they wanted compensation to do so, that would be another matter and she would have to ask what it was they wanted.

She reiterated her commitment to trying to heal the rift in Arab/Israeli relations in &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;.

Interviewed by &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Frost"&gt;David Frost&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; television, &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Baker"&gt;James Baker&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Hamilton"&gt;Lee Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, joint author of the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Study%20Report"&gt;Iraq Study Report&lt;/a&gt; said that the President had been positive about the Report and that he had indicated willingness to talk with both Iran and Syria.

&lt;a href="w%3AMassoud%20Barzani"&gt;Massoud Barzani&lt;/a&gt; leader of the Kurdish region of Iraq and Iraq's President, &lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt;, also a &lt;a href="w%3AKurd"&gt;Kurd&lt;/a&gt;, agreed in the opinion that US Iraq Study Group report is "unrealistic and inappropriate". Mr Barzani was unconvinced by the idea of involving Iran and Syria in discussions aimed at pacifying Iraq. He complained that the Study Group had ignored the Kurds in the Northern region in their investigations.

On December 7, &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; reported a story about Dr &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Anderson%20%28computer%20scientist%29"&gt;James Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, a teacher in the Computer Science department at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Reading"&gt;University of Reading&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. In the report it was stated that Anderson had "solved a very important problem" that was 1200 years old, the problem of &lt;a href="w%3Adivision%20by%20zero"&gt;division by zero&lt;/a&gt;. According to the BBC, Anderson had created a new number, that he had named "nullity", that lay outside of the &lt;a href="w%3Areal%20number%20line"&gt;real number line&lt;/a&gt;. Anderson terms this number a "transreal number", and denotes it with the &lt;a href="w%3AGreek%20alphabet"&gt;Greek letter&lt;/a&gt; formula_1. He had taught this number to pupils at Highdown School, in &lt;a href="w%3AEmmer%20Green"&gt;Emmer Green&lt;/a&gt;, Reading. 
<h3>Reactions</h3>
The BBC report provoked many reactions from mathematicians and others.

In reaction to the story, Mark C. Chu-Carroll, a computer scientist and researcher, posted a &lt;a href="w%3Aweb%20log"&gt;web log&lt;/a&gt; entry describing Anderson as an "idiot math teacher", and describing the BBC's story as "absolutely infuriating" and a story that "does an excellent job of demonstrating what total innumerate idiots reporters are". Chu-Carroll stated that there was, in fact, no actual problem to be solved in the first place. "There is no number that meaningfully expresses the concept of what it means to divide by zero.", he wrote, stating that all that Anderson had done was "assign a name to the concept of 'not a number'", something which was "not new" in that the &lt;a href="w%3AIEEE%20floating-point%20standard"&gt;IEEE floating-point standard&lt;/a&gt;, which describes how computers represent floating-point numbers, had included a concept of "not a number", termed "&lt;a href="w%3ANaN"&gt;NaN&lt;/a&gt;", since 1985. Chu-Carroll further continued:
There have been a wide range of other reactions from other people to the BBC news story. Comments range from the humorous and the ironic, such as the &lt;a href="w%3AB1FF"&gt;B1FF&lt;/a&gt;-style observation that "DIVIDION BY ZERO IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE MY CALCULATOR SAYS SO AND IT IS THE TRUTH" and the &lt;a href="w%3AChuck%20Norris%20Facts"&gt;Chuck Norris Fact&lt;/a&gt; that "Only Chuck Norris can divide by zero." (to which another reader replied "Chuck Norris just ♡❤looks♡❤ at zero, and it divides itself."); through vigourous defences of Dr Anderson, with several people quoting the lyrics to &lt;a href="w%3AIra%20Gershwin"&gt;Ira Gershwin&lt;/a&gt;'s song "They All Laughed (At Christopher Columbus)"; to detailed mathematical discussions of Anderson's proposed axioms of transfinite numbers.

<h3>The reputation of the University of Reading</h3>
Several readers have commented that they consider this to have damaged the reputation of the Computer Science department, and even the reputation of the University of Reading as a whole. "By publishing his childish nonsense the BBC actively harms the reputation of Reading University." wrote one reader. "Looking forward to seeing Reading University maths application plummit." wrote another. "Ignore all research papers from the University of Reading." wrote a third. "I'm not sure why you refer to Reading as a 'university'. This is a place the BBC reports as closing down its physics department because it's too hard. Lecturers at Reading should stick to folk dancing and knitting, leaving academic subjects to grown ups." wrote a fourth. Steve Kramarsky lamented that Dr Anderson is not from the "University of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20three%20Rs"&gt;'Rithmetic&lt;/a&gt;".

<h3>BBC journalism</h3>
Several readers criticised the journalists at the BBC who ran the story for not apparently contacting any mathematicians about Dr Anderson's idea. "Journalists are meant to check facts, not just accept whatever they are told by a self-interested third party and publish it without question." wrote one reader on the BBC's web site. However, on &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; another reader countered "The report is from Berkshire local news. Berkshire! Do you really expect a local news team to have a maths specialist? Finding a newsworthy story in Berkshire probably isn't that easy, so local journalists have to cover any piece of fluff that comes up. Your attitude to the journalist should be sympathy, not scorn."

&lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Goldacre"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt;, author of the ♡❤Bad Science♡❤ column in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, wrote on his web log that "what is odd is a reporter, editor, producer, newsroom, team, cameraman, soundman, TV channel, web editor, web copy writer, and so on, all thinking it’s a good idea to cover a brilliant new scientific breakthrough whilst clearly knowing nothing about the context. Maths isn’t that hard, you could even make a call to a mathematician about it.", continuing that "it’s all very well for the BBC to think they’re being balanced and clever getting Dr Anderson back in to answer queries about his theory on Tuesday, but that rather skips the issue, and shines the spotlight quite unfairly on him (he looks like a very alright bloke to me).". 

From reading comments on his own web log as well as elsewhere, Goldacre concluded that he thought that "a lot of people might feel it’s reporter Ben Moore, and the rest of his doubtless extensive team, the people who drove the story, who we’d want to see answering the questions from the mathematicians.".

Andrej Bauer, a professional mathematician from Slovenia writing on the ♡❤Bad Science♡❤ web log, stated that "whoever reported on this failed to call a university professor to check whether it was really new. Any university professor would have told this reporter that there are many ways of dealing with division by zero, and that Mr. Anderson’s was just one of known ones."

Ollie Williams, one of the BBC Radio Berkshire reporters who wrote the BBC story, initially stated that "It seems odd to me that his theory would get as far as television if it's so easily blown out of the water by visitors to our site, so there must be something more to it." and directly responded to criticisms of BBC journalism on several points on his web log.

He pointed out that people should remember that his target audience was local people in Berkshire with no mathematical knowledge, and that he was "not writing for a global audience of mathematicians". "Some people have had a go at Dr Anderson for using simplified terminology too," he continued, "but he knows we're playing to a mainstream audience, and at the time we filmed him, he was showing his theory to a class of schoolchildren. Those circumstances were never going to breed an in-depth half-hour scientific discussion, and none of our regular readers would want that.".

On the matter of fact checking, he replied that "if you only want us to report scientific news once it's appeared, peer-reviewed, in a recognised journal, it's going to be very dry, and it probably won't be news.", adding that "It's not for the BBC to become a journal of mathematics &amp;mdash; that's the job of journals of mathematics. It's for the BBC to provide lively science reporting that engages and involves people. And if you look at the original page, you'll find a list as long as your arm of engaged and involved people.".

Williams pointed out that "We did not present Dr Anderson's theory as gospel, although with hindsight it could have been made clearer that this is very much a theory and by no means universally accepted. But we certainly weren't shouting a mathematical revolution from the rooftops. Dr Anderson has, in one or two places, been chastised for coming to the media with his theory instead of his peers &amp;mdash; a sure sign of a quack, boffin and/or crank according to one blogger. Actually, one of our reporters happened to meet him during a demonstration against the closure of the university's physics department a couple of weeks ago, got chatting, and discovered Dr Anderson reckoned he was onto something. He certainly didn't break the door down looking for media coverage.".

<h3>Mathematical analysis</h3>
 
Some commentators, at the BBC web page and at &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, have attempted serious mathematical descriptions of what Anderson has done, and subjected it to analysis. One description was that Anderson has taken the &lt;a href="w%3Afield%20%28mathematics%29"&gt;field&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3Areal%20number"&gt;real number&lt;/a&gt;s and given it complete &lt;a href="w%3Aclosure%20%28mathematics%29"&gt;closure&lt;/a&gt; so that all six of the common arithmetic operators were &lt;a href="w%3Asurjective%20function"&gt;surjective function&lt;/a&gt;s, resulting in "an object which is barely a &lt;a href="w%3Acommutative%20ring"&gt;commutative ring&lt;/a&gt; (with operators with tons of funky corner cases)" and no actual gain "in terms of new theorems or strong relation statements from the extra axioms he has to tack on".

Jamie Sawyer, a mathematics undergraduate at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Warwick"&gt;University of Warwick&lt;/a&gt; writing in the Warwick Maths Society discussion forum, describes what Anderson has done as deciding that formula_2, the so-called &lt;a href="w%3Aextended%20real%20number%20line"&gt;extended real number line&lt;/a&gt;, is "not good enough [...] because of the wonderful issue of what formula_3 is equal to" and therefore creating a number system formula_4. 

Andrej Bauer stated that Anderson's axioms of transreal arithmetic "are far from being original. First, you can adjoin formula_5 and formula_6 to obtain something called the &lt;a href="w%3Aextended%20real%20number%20line"&gt;extended real line&lt;/a&gt;. Then you can adjoin a &lt;a href="w%3Abottom%20element"&gt;bottom element&lt;/a&gt; to represent an undefined value. This is all standard and quite old. In fact, it is well known in &lt;a href="w%3Adomain%20theory"&gt;domain theory&lt;/a&gt;, which deals with how to represent things we compute with, that adjoining just bottom to the reals is not a good idea. It is better to adjoin many so-called partial elements, which denote approximations to reals. Bottom is then just the trivial approximation which means something like 'any real' or 'undefined real'."

Commentators have pointed out that in the field of &lt;a href="w%3Amathematical%20analysis"&gt;mathematical analysis&lt;/a&gt;, formula_3 (which Anderson has defined axiomatically to be formula_1) is the &lt;a href="w%3Alimit%20of%20a%20function"&gt;limit of several function&lt;/a&gt;s, each of which tends to a different value at its limit:
<ul>
BULLET::::- formula_9 has two different limits, depending from whether formula_10 approaches zero from a positive or from a negative direction.
BULLET::::- formula_11 also has two different limits. (This is the argument that commentators gave. In fact, formula_12 has the value formula_13 for all formula_14, and thus only one limit. It is simply &lt;a href="w%3Acontinuous%20function"&gt;discontinuous&lt;/a&gt; for formula_15. However, that limit is different to the two limits for formula_9, supporting the commentators' main point that the values of the various limits are all different.)
BULLET::::- Whilst formula_17, the limit formula_18 can be shown to be 1, by expanding the &lt;a href="w%3Asine"&gt;sine&lt;/a&gt; function as an infinite &lt;a href="w%3ATaylor%20series"&gt;Taylor series&lt;/a&gt;, dividing the series by formula_10, and then taking the limit of the result, which is 1.
BULLET::::- Whilst formula_20, the limit formula_21 can be shown to be 0, by expanding the &lt;a href="w%3Acosine"&gt;cosine&lt;/a&gt; function as an infinite &lt;a href="w%3ATaylor%20series"&gt;Taylor series&lt;/a&gt;, dividing the series subtracted from 1 by formula_10, and then taking the limit of the result, which is 0.

</ul>
Commentators have also noted &lt;a href="w%3Al%27H%C3%B4pital%27s%20rule"&gt;l'Hôpital's rule&lt;/a&gt;.

It has been pointed out that Anderson's set of transreal numbers is not, unlike the set of real numbers, a mathematical &lt;a href="w%3Afield%20%28mathematics%29"&gt;field&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Tatham"&gt;Simon Tatham&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="w%3APuTTY"&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt;, stated that Anderson's system "doesn't even ♡❤think♡❤ about the field axioms: addition is no longer invertible, multiplication isn't invertible on nullity or infinity (or zero, but that's expected!). So if you're working in the transreals or transrationals, you can't do simple algebraic transformations such as cancelling formula_10 and formula_24 when both occur in the same expression, because that transformation becomes invalid if formula_10 is nullity or infinity. So even the simplest exercises of ordinary algebra spew off a constant stream of 'unless x is nullity' special cases which you have to deal with separately &amp;mdash; in much the same way that the occasional division spews off an 'unless x is zero' special case, only much more often." 

Tatham stated that "It's telling that this monstrosity has been dreamed up by a computer scientist: persistent error indicators and universal absorbing states can often be good computer science, but he's stepped way outside his field of competence if he thinks that that also makes them good maths.", continuing that Anderson has "also totally missed the point when he tries to compute things like formula_26 using his arithmetic. The reason why things like that are generally considered to be ill-defined is not because of a ♡❤lack♡❤ of facile 'proofs' showing them to have one value or another; it's because of a ♡❤surfeit♡❤ of such 'proofs' all of which disagree! Adding another one does not (as he appears to believe) solve any problem at all." (In other words: formula_26 is what is known in mathematical analysis as an &lt;a href="w%3Aindeterminate%20form"&gt;indeterminate form&lt;/a&gt;.)

<h3>Not a Not a Number</h3>
To many observers, it appears that Anderson has done nothing more than re-invent the idea of "&lt;a href="w%3ANaN"&gt;NaN&lt;/a&gt;", a special value that computers have been using in &lt;a href="w%3Afloating-point"&gt;floating-point&lt;/a&gt; calculations to represent undefined results for over two decades. In the various international standards for computing, including the &lt;a href="w%3AIEEE%20floating-point%20standard"&gt;IEEE floating-point standard&lt;/a&gt; and IBM's standard for decimal arithmetic, a division of any non-zero number by zero results in one of two special infinity values, "+Inf" or "-Inf", the sign of the infinity determined by the signs of the two operands (&lt;a href="w%3Anegative%20zero"&gt;Negative zero&lt;/a&gt; exists in floating-point representations.); and a division of zero by zero results in NaN.

Anderson himself denies that he has re-invented NaN, and in fact claims that there are problems with NaN that are not shared by nullity. According to Anderson, "mathematical arithmetic is sociologically invalid" and IEEE floating-point arithmetic, with NaN, is also faulty. In one of his papers on a "perspex machine" dealing with "The Axioms of Transreal Arithmetic" (Jamie Sawyer writes that he has "worries about something which appears to be named after a plastic" &amp;mdash; "Perspex" being a trade name for &lt;a href="w%3Apolymethyl%20methacrylate"&gt;polymethyl methacrylate&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K..) Anderson writes:
In fact, the standard convention for distinguishing the two types of NaNs when writing them down can be seen in &lt;a href="w%3AISO/IEC%2010967"&gt;ISO/IEC 10967&lt;/a&gt;, another international standard for how computers deal with numbers, which uses "qNaN" for non-signalling ("quiet") NaNs and "sNaN" for signalling NaNs. Anderson continues:
"In other words," writes Scott Lamb, a BSc. in Computer Science from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Idaho"&gt;University of Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, "they are defined, but he doesn't like the definition.".

The main difference between nullity and NaN, according to both Anderson and commentators, is that nullity compares equal to nullity, whereas NaN does not compare equal to NaN. Commentators have pointed out that in very short order this difference leads to contradictory results. They stated that it requires only a few lines of proof, for example, to demonstrate that in Anderson's system of "transreal arithmetic" both formula_28 and formula_29, after which, in one commentator's words, one can "prove anything that you like". In aiming to provide a complete system of arithmetic, by adding extra axioms defining the results of the division of zero by zero and of the consequent operations on that result, half as many again as the number of axioms of real-number arithmetic, Anderson has produced a self-contradictory system of arithmetic, in accordance with &lt;a href="w%3AG%C3%B6del%27s%20incompleteness%20theorems"&gt;Gödel's incompleteness theorems&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>"Step 3: Profit!"</h3>
One reader-submitted comment appended to the BBC news article read "Step 1. Create solution 2. Create problem 3. PROFIT!", an allusion to the business plan employed by the &lt;a href="w%3AGnomes%20%28South%20Park%20episode%29"&gt;underpants gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of the comedy television series ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Park"&gt;South Park&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. In fact, Anderson does plan to profit from nullity, having registered on the 27th of July, 2006 a private limited company named Transreal Computing Ltd, whose mission statement is "to develop hardware and software to bring you fast and safe computation that does not fail on division by zero" and to "promote education and training in transreal computing". The company is currently "in the research and development phase prior to trading in hardware and software".

In a presentation given to potential investors in his company at the ANGLE plc showcase on the 28th of November, 2006, held at the University of Reading, Anderson stated his aims for the company as being:
<ul>
BULLET::::- To build a transreal computer.
BULLET::::- To derive &lt;a href="w%3AMaxwell%27s%20equations"&gt;Maxwell's equations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aclassical%20theories%20of%20gravitation"&gt;classical gravitation&lt;/a&gt; in transreal numbers so that they have no naked singularities (infinities affecting a neighbourhood of space).
BULLET::::- To collaborate with anyone who wants to unify &lt;a href="w%3Aquantum%20electrodynamics"&gt;Quantum Electro-Dynamics&lt;/a&gt; with gravitation.
</ul>
To investors, Anderson makes the following promises:
<ul>
BULLET::::- "I will help you develop a curriculum for transreal arithmetic if you want me to."
BULLET::::- "I will help you unify QED and gravitation if you want me to."
BULLET::::- "I will build a transreal supercomputer."
</ul>
He asks potential investors:
<ul>
BULLET::::- "How much would you pay to know that the engine in your ship, car, aeroplane, or heart pacemaker won't just stop dead?"
BULLET::::- "How much would you pay to know that your Government’s computer controlled military hardware won’t just stop or misfire?"

</ul>
The current models of computer arithmetic are, in fact, ♡❤already♡❤ designed to allow programmers to write programs that will continue in the event of a division by zero. The IEEE's Frequently Asked Questions document for the floating-point standard gives this reply to the question "Why doesn't division by zero (or overflow, or underflow) stop the program or trigger an error?":

Simon Tatham stated that there is a basic problem with Anderson's ideas, and thus with the idea of building a transreal supercomputer: "It's a category error. The Anderson transrationals and transreals are theoretical algebraic structures, capable of representing arbitrarily big and arbitrarily precise numbers. So the question of their error-propagation semantics is totally meaningless: you don't use them for down-and-dirty error-prone real computation, you use them for proving theorems. If you want to use this sort of thing in a computer, you have to think up some concrete representation of Anderson trans&lt;a href="w%3Ametasyntactic%20variable"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;s in bits and bytes, which will (if only by the limits of available memory) be unable to encompass the entire range of the structure. And the point at which you make this transition from theoretical abstract algebra to concrete bits and bytes is precisely where you should also be putting in error handling, because it's where errors start to become possible. We define our theoretical algebraic structures to obey lots of axioms (like the field axioms, and total ordering) which make it possible to reason about them efficiently in the proving of theorems. We define our practical number representations in a computer to make it easy to detect errors. The Anderson transfoos are a consequence of fundamentally confusing the one with the other, and that by itself ought to be sufficient reason to hurl them aside with great force."

Geomerics, a start-up company specializing in simulation software for physics and lighting and funded by ANGLE plc, had been asked to look into Anderson's work by an unnamed client. Rich Wareham, a Senior Research and Development Engineer at Geomerics and a MEng. from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Cambridge"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, stated that Anderson's system "might be a more interesting set of axioms for dealing with arithmetic exceptions but it isn't the first attempt at just defining away the problem. Indeed it doesn't fundamentally change anything. The reason computer programs crash when they divide by zero is not that the hardware can produce no result, merely that the programmer has not dealt with NaNs as they propagate through. Not dealing with nullities will similarly lead to program crashes."

"Do the Anderson transrational semantics give any advantage over the IEEE ones?", Wareham asked, answering "Well one assumes they have been thought out to be useful in themselves rather than to just propagate errors but I'm not sure that seeing a nullity pop out of your code would lead you to do anything other than what would happen if a NaN or Inf popped out, namely signal an error.".

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Netball%20Associations"&gt;International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA)&lt;/a&gt; has stripped the rights from Fiji to host the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Netball%20World%20Championships"&gt;World Netball Championships in 2007&lt;/a&gt; because of the military coup that took place on December 5.

The Netball Championships were to take place between 10 July and 21 July, 2007 at Fiji's capital, &lt;a href="w%3ASuva"&gt;Suva&lt;/a&gt;.

IFNA president, Molly Rhone, said: "It is deeply regretted that we have had to take this decision, recognising the hard work that has been done by the Organising Committee in preparing to host their first senior World Championships."

"We know that many supporters around the world were looking forward to this great sporting event in Fiji," Ms Rhone said.

Alisi Tabete, president of Fijian netball, said that today is a very sad day for sports and that they had wasted many years preparing to host the championships. "We had been working on this event from 1999 and right now I am trying to reason with myself as to why the championships has been lost and just thinking 'what if'."

"We have to think positive and am still thankful that we had been given a chance for the champs," Ms Tabete said.

The IFNA is yet to announce a replacement venue for the games. Ms Rhone said: "IFNA will now be working assiduously to find a new venue to host the Championships."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20House%20of%20Representatives%20passes%20India%20nuclear%20bill&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;United States House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; has passed the resolution seeking to implement the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement. The bill was passed with a huge margin in which representatives voted 330 in favour of the agreement and 59 against the agreement.

The resolution, in the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.rules.house.gov/109_2nd/text/hr5682/109_2ndhr5862cr.pdf"&gt;109-page compromise bill&lt;/a&gt;, based on high marginal support of the House-Senate conferees, will be sent directly to the &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt; which is also expected to also pass it unanimously by a voice vote today, before the Congress goes into Christmas recess.

The deal offers India US nuclear technology in exchange for inspectors' access to Indian civilian reactors. The accord is hailed as historic by many of the representatives, but critics said that it will damage &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anon-proliferation"&gt;non-proliferation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; efforts.

Democratic congressman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Lantos"&gt;Tom Lantos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said, "India is a state that should be at the very centre of our foreign policy and our attention." He added that a partnership with &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; would help in regulation of the peaceful and responsible spread of nuclear power.

Represenative from &lt;a href="Illinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20John%20Hyde"&gt;Henry John Hyde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who is the co-writer of the bill, argued that the conference report, titled "Henty J Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006", is a judicious balance of competing all priorities and accommodates the concerns of administration. He added that President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George Bush&lt;/a&gt; is expected to sign it into law in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ceremony on Monday, if the bill passed by Senate.

Representative from &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Crowley"&gt;Joseph Crowley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was instrumental in pushing the bill, said, "With the final version of this legislation approved for this historic agreement between India and the United States to move forward, the Congress has provided realistic parameters for the benefit of both our nations. Now the ball falls into the President's and the Indian government's court to move forward, and ensure a positive relation between India and the United States well into this century."

Representative from &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarbara%20Lee"&gt;Barbara Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who is from the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, opposed the bill and said that it would lead to problems by way of doing lasting damage to more than 30-years of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;non-proliferation policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The law will allow the nuclear cooperation between India and United States after more than 30 years. After the bill is passed, the &lt;a href="Government%20of%20India"&gt;Indian government&lt;/a&gt; will have to conclude a bilateral agreement with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and engage with the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (IAEA). India and the IAEA have already concluded an agreement requiring the application of IAEA safeguards in perpetuity in accordance with IAEA standards, principles, and practices (including IAEA Board of Governors Document GOV/1621 (1973)) to India's civil nuclear facilities, materials, and programs, as discussed in the Section 104 (b) (2) of the bill.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnder%20Secretary%20for%20Political%20Affairs"&gt;Under Secretary for Political Affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AR.%20Nicholas%20Burns"&gt;Nicholas Burns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who is visiting India, anticipated a very successful and supportive bill. Supporters of the compromise bill, backed by the United States are quite confident that the bill would be acceptable to India.

Blogger George Vaccaro is a customer from the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; who apparently purchased wireless network connection from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVerizon"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , thinking that he was getting a good deal. Instead, he says he was charged about 71 &lt;a href="US%20dollar"&gt;dollars&lt;/a&gt; instead of 71 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20cent"&gt;cents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; : 100 times more than what his bill should have been at the rate quoted. 

When he called the Verizon customer service, he said he also found out that several Verizon representatives think 0.002 cents is equal to 0.002 dollars. According to the phone conversation recording he posted to his blog, 
Vaccaro also posted on his blog the text of what he said was an e-mail reply from a Verizon Wireless customer service representative on December 8, stating:

When radio host &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Klein"&gt;Jerry Klein&lt;/a&gt; suggested that all Muslims in the United States should be identified with a crescent-shape tattoo,"the switchboard went from empty to totally jammed within minutes." Some callers agreed with Klein, one saying that, "Not only do you tattoo them in the middle of their forehead but you ship them out of this country ... they are here to kill us." Another caller added that America should, "set up encampments like during World War Two with the Japanese and Germans"

At the end of the show Klein revealed that that it had been staged as a hoax. "I can't believe any of you are sick enough to have agreed for one second with anything I said," he told his &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wmal.com/"&gt;AM 630 WMAL&lt;/a&gt; audience which covers Washington D.C., Northern Virginia and Maryland

"For me to suggest to tattoo marks on people's bodies, have them wear armbands, put a crescent moon on their driver's license on their passport or birth certificate is disgusting. It's beyond disgusting."

"Because basically what you just did was show me how the German people allowed what happened to the Jews to happen ... We need to separate them, we need to tattoo their arms, we need to make them wear the yellow Star of David, we need to put them in concentration camps, we basically just need to kill them all because they are dangerous."

Ex-President &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Carter"&gt;Jimmy Carter&lt;/a&gt; has decried the current Palestinian situation in his recent book ♡❤Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid♡❤ ( ). In this he compares the building of the barrier in the West Bank to the policy of apartheid (apartness) in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. There, the policy legalized the separation of races and ensured the domination of whites over all others.

Carter gave as examples of the ways in which the peoples of the territory are divided. He cited the concrete walls, fences and electronic devices erected by Israel to contain the Arab peoples and the roads that divided the occupied territories; roads that he said could not be used, sometimes not even crossed, by local Palestinians. But he referred to another barrier caused by the ignorance of the American populace and the absence of critical comment there about the behavior of those on both sides of the wall, the system of apartheid, the constant fear of terror and the failure to implement UN and US policy. 

Carter, a &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20prize"&gt;Nobel Laureate&lt;/a&gt;, claims that by using such a loaded term as “apartheid” he intended to provoke debate and deeper understanding of the problems in Palestine. He complains about a tremendous fear, even “intimidation” of individuals and the media in the United States that stifles information and discussion of Israel’s conduct. There will be no peace until Israel abides by the UN resolutions, retires from Arab lands and ceases to oppress the Palestinians.
The book provoked a bitter response from an erstwhile colleague, Ken Stein, an Emory University professor, who said it was utterly biased and superficial, and contained unsupported allegations, “glaring omissions and simply invented segments”.

Rep. &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Israel"&gt;Steve Israel&lt;/a&gt;, a New York Democrat, disagreeing with Carter’s account, said that the Palestinians had no one to blame but themselves. Their leaders had no regard for the quality of life of their people and no ability to keep law and order. He said that the book was only one man’s view, it did not reflect the opinion of the Democratic party.

Defending his work, Carter claims that it had been reviewed by staff at the Carter Centre but at least one employee resigned in disgust upon the publication of the book. He had been a monitor at Palestinian elections in 2005 and 2006. Carter has made peace making in the Middle East his most important commitment. However, many have argued his efforts are one-sided and he has refused to publicly debate &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Dershowitz"&gt;Alan Dershowitz&lt;/a&gt; over the views expressed in his work.

The UK's Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; has expressed his intention to address the peace process in the Middle East by visiting the region in the near future.

&lt;a href="w%3APolonium%20210"&gt;Polonium 210&lt;/a&gt;, a radioactive substance that killed ex-spy &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Litvinenko"&gt;Alexander Litvinenko&lt;/a&gt;, has been found inside two buildings located in &lt;a href="w%3AHamburg%2C%20Germany"&gt;Hamburg, Germany&lt;/a&gt;.

The radiation was found in the home of &lt;a href="w%3ADmitry%20Kovtun"&gt;Dmitry Kovtun&lt;/a&gt;'s ex-wife. Litvinenko and Kovtun met together at a &lt;a href="w%3Alondon%2C%20England"&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt; pub on November 1, 2006. Kovtun is now being treated at a hospital in Germany for radiation exposure, but his condition is not known. No radiation was found at Kovtun's apartment.

The second location in Germany to test positive for radiation is an apartment belonging to the ex-mother in law of Kovtun. Her home is located in &lt;a href="w%3APinneberg%2C%20Germany"&gt;Pinneberg, Germany&lt;/a&gt;.

Six Party talks between &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; are set to resume talks in regards to North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

"They [North Korea] have indicated they are interested in an end to what they call the U.S. 'hostile policy. We made very clear to them that we don't have a hostile policy to them. We have a hostile policy to their policies, including and especially their nuclear policies," said Christopher Hill, the assistant to the Secretary of State, according to the ♡❤United Press International.♡❤

The talks are scheduled to begin on December 16, 2006 in &lt;a href="Beijing%2C%20China"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;, China, but no country involved in the talks have confirmed the reports.

&lt;a href="w%3Aspace%20shuttle"&gt;Space shuttle&lt;/a&gt; mission STS-116 began today with its successful launch at 8:48pm EST (01:47 GMT). Liftoff was uneventful with no immediate problems. Last Thursday's launch attempt was scrubbed due to low, dense cloud cover. It is the first Space Shuttle night launch in over four years and the last mission planned for pad 39b.

In the complex mission &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Discovery&lt;/a&gt; will first dock with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. In three spacewalks the astronauts will install a segment of the station's integrated truss and replace the orbital laboratory’s power wiring system.

&lt;a href="w%3ARussia%20Today%20TV"&gt;Russia Today TV&lt;/a&gt;, Moscow's English-language satellite television channel, reported that Russian government officials are considering filing libel suits against international journalists over their reporting on the poisoning death of former Russian spy &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Litvinenko"&gt;Alexander Litvinenko&lt;/a&gt;. Litvinenko was a strong critic of Russian President &lt;a href="w%3AVladimir%20Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt; and shortly before he died in London from radiation poisoning in late November, Litvinenko accused Putin of ordering his assassination. Putin and other Russian officials strongly denied any prior knowledge of a plot to kill Litvinenko. 

According to a report posted late Friday on the Russia Today TV web site, the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Media is gathering publications worldwide to be studied for libelous and offensive comments against Russia in their coverage of the Litvinenko's case. Russia Today TV reported that the Russian government intends to file law suits for libel against international media if there is evidence of journalistic misconduct.

In a &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20of%20America"&gt;Voice of America&lt;/a&gt; interview shortly before he was poisoned by a radioactive substance &lt;a href="w%3Apolonium-210"&gt;polonium-210&lt;/a&gt;, former Russian spy Litvinenko had accused Putin of ordering the murder of Russian journalist &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Politkovskaya"&gt;Anna Politkovskaya&lt;/a&gt; to silence her and intimidate other independent journalists. She had been killed by an unknown assailant in Moscow in early October. 

Several senior Russian politicians have said that the deaths of Politkovskaya and Litvinenko were playing into the hands of Russia’s enemies and, therefore, could not have been authorized by Moscow. 

The Russian government's warnings aimed at international journalists follow Putin's largely successful efforts to bring major media outlets in Russia under government control and to limit media criticism of his policies. &lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, a Paris-based nongovernmental organization, has called Putin one of the world's top "Predators of Press Freedom."

&lt;a href="w%3AFreeMediaOnline.org"&gt;FreeMediaOnline.org&lt;/a&gt;, a California-based nonprofit organization which monitors media and supports press freedom worldwide, said that the latest warnings issued by the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Media would prove a major embarrassment for Putin and for Russia if they were carried out. An article on the FreeMediaOnline.org web site claims that even if there is no direct link between the two assassinations and the Kremlin, Putin is ultimately responsible for the climate of lawlessness and suppression of free media that may have contributed to these murders. 

FreeMediaOnline.org also noted that uncovering the truth about the murders of Politkovskaya and Litvinenko would be difficult because independent journalists in Russia have been either silenced or intimidated by President Putin's media advisors, government regulators, and security services. 

Putin insists he is a strong supporter of democracy and press freedom. In a speech to Russian television broadcasters in late November 2006, Putin said that the development of Russian state and society would be unthinkable without independent media, without the possibility of listening to different points of view, and without television. 

Putin's critics point out that he has successfully placed under the Kremlin's control all major nationwide television channels. According to FreeMediaOnline.org, journalists working for these channels no longer dare to offer any significant criticism of Mr. Putin's policies. The organization warned that restrictions on media freedom in Russia have emboldened criminal elements to engage in illegal activities.

Harry Doynhoven, minister for transport safety, has called for a ban on using &lt;a href="w%3AMobile%20phone"&gt;mobile phones (cellphones)&lt;/a&gt; while driving in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. The ban comes just days after a teenager was killed after allegedly driving while &lt;a href="w%3AShort%20message%20service"&gt;texting&lt;/a&gt; on their mobile phone.

Mr Duynhoven said that it is time to ban hand-held mobile phones in cars. "I would love to ban it. If I were a benign dictator, it would be gone by lunchtime." Mr Duynhoven believes that a campaign to educate the public is needed to combat the number of people who die while using their mobile phones while driving. One of the new ways to combat this is suspected to be new road safety measure. The new initiatives will be announced on Wednesday.

"I hope that sufficient parliamentarians who read the reports of another young person who obviously wasn't concentrating on her driving will say it's about time something was done," Mr Duynhoven said, "However such a ban would be very difficult to police."

A report, prepared by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Ministry%20of%20Transport"&gt;Ministry of Transport&lt;/a&gt;, will be shown to the government on the dangers of using a mobile phone while driving. Peter Burke, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, said: "There's no law against using a cellphone at the moment. There's the whole issue of driver distraction of which cellphone use is a part. But there's been no decision on it yet. Anyone who texts while you're driving is pushing the limits. I don't think anyone would condone texting while driving, it's a recipe for disaster."

Every year around four fatal crashes occur because the drivers are using their mobile phones while driving. Around 50 non fatal crashes occur each year for the same reason. However the police expect that the actual number is higher.

"A lot of drivers are unfortunately their own worst enemy - they're busy talking and texting on the phone and fail to pay attention to what's going on around them. The results can be, and often are, crashes which cause injury and death," Rob Lee, spokesman for the police, said.

Sharleen Lloyd, 16-years-old, was killed when she drove her car into a parked trailer after it left the road because she was allegedly texting (SMS) on her mobile phone. Her passenger and boyfriend, Matthew Smit, had non fatal injuries. Andrew Hicks died when he crashed into a powerpole as a result from using his cellphone while driving.

Many countries already have a ban in place of using a mobile phone while driving, including the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Mr Duynhoven said: "But in countries where they have bans, they still have people using cellphones while driving. The issue is changing behaviour."

However New Zealand does currently have a law which enables police to prosecute someone who doesn't give attention or care to driving.

"We are ecstatic!" and the "mother and sons are doing splendidly," reads a statement released by Krall and her husband, &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; musician &lt;a href="w%3AElvis%20Costello"&gt;Elvis Costello&lt;/a&gt;, best known for songs such as ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3APump%20It%20Up%20%28song%29"&gt;Pump It Up&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤ and ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3AAlison%20%28song%29"&gt;Alison&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤.

The twins are Krall's first children. Costello already has a child from an earlier marriage.

Costello, 52, and Krall, 42, shared the birth of their two sons on their third wedding anniversary.

"I have twins on my mother's side," Krall told &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20%28magazine%29"&gt;People magazine&lt;/a&gt; in September. 

Krall, born in &lt;a href="w%3ANanaimo%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Nanaimo, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, who is a &lt;a href="w%3AGrammy%20Award"&gt;Grammy award&lt;/a&gt; winner, and was named an officer of the &lt;a href="w%3AOrder%20of%20Canada"&gt;Order of Canada&lt;/a&gt; in 2005, released her latest album titled ♡❤"&lt;a href="w%3AFrom%20This%20Moment%20On%20%28album%29"&gt;From This Moment On&lt;/a&gt;"♡❤ in September.

The couple married three years ago in a ceremony held at &lt;a href="w%3AElton%20John"&gt;Elton John's&lt;/a&gt; mansion in &lt;a href="w%3ASurrey"&gt;Surrey, England&lt;/a&gt; in December 2003. &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20McCartney"&gt;Paul McCartney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APamela%20Wallin"&gt;Pamela Wallin&lt;/a&gt;, Canada's consul general to New York were invited among the 150 guests.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Home%20Secretary%20says%20about%2030%20major%20conspiracies%20threaten%20UK%20this%20Christmas&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reid%20%28politician%29"&gt;John Reid&lt;/a&gt;, UK Home Secretary, alerted the country to the very high risk of terrorist attack during the Christmas season. He said on &lt;a href="w%3AGMTV"&gt;GMTV&lt;/a&gt;’s Sunday programme, that he knew of approximately thirty conspiracies that were preparing to attack and that the level of alert on the MI5 web site now stands at the second highest level “severe”.

The &lt;a href="w%3AJoint%20Terrorist%20Analysis%20Centre"&gt;Joint Terrorist Analysis Centre&lt;/a&gt; (JTAC) reports that the most serious threat comes from &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Quaida"&gt;Al Quaida&lt;/a&gt; and similar networks of Islamist extremists. They are described by MI5 as “radicalised individuals who are using a distorted Islamic faith to justify violence. They are a very small proportion of the Muslim community in UK."

The scale of threat is described as “potentially increasing and not likely to diminish significantly for some years”. Mr Reid said that the threat is likely to “continue for longer than a generation”. He reminded the country that republican terrorism continued for thirty years. According to JTAC those who threaten the country at present include dissident republican Irish groups which will not accept the terms of the &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday%20Agreement"&gt;Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (April 1998).

A further threat arises from the proliferation of &lt;a href="w%3Aweapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;weapons of mass destruction&lt;/a&gt; (WMD) which include nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. In 2003-2004, the Security Services claim to have disrupted some 30 “proven or suspected attempts” to obtain materials or information related to WMD for other countries.

As part of the counter terrorist activity, trials have now started of the use of &lt;a href="w%3Abiometric"&gt;biometric&lt;/a&gt; identification at &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Heathrow%20airport"&gt;London Heathrow airport&lt;/a&gt; where passengers willing to submit their details are fast tracked through passport control.

Whereas MI5 points to Iraq as having become a "dominant issue for a range of extremist groups and individuals in the UK and Europe", Mr Reid referred to the &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli-Palestinian%20conflict"&gt;Israeli-Palestinian conflict&lt;/a&gt; saying that “it fuels &lt;a href="w%3Ainternational%20terrorism"&gt;international terrorism&lt;/a&gt;”. &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20Blair"&gt;Prime Minister Blair&lt;/a&gt; said at a recent press conference with President Bush that he is preparing to engage in peace talks with Israel and Palestine.

<h1>Japan opposes resumption of six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Japan%20opposes%20resumption%20of%20six-party%20talks%20on%20North%20Korea%27s%20nuclear%20program&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese official has stated that Japan is opposed to re-entering into six-party talks between the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; in regards to the N. Korean nuclear weapons program stating that N. Korea must "compromise."

"It's fine if North Korea can bring some contribution to peace, but simply starting talks is not meaningful," said the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council in Japan, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShoichi%20Nakagawa"&gt;Shoichi Nakagawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

"The situation has changed since the last six-party talks in September last year. North Korea has conducted missile test launches and undertaken a nuclear test. Talks shouldn't re-open without careful consideration," added Nakagawa. North Korea successfully tested a nuclear missile on October 9, 2006.

"[We expect] early and concrete results. We believe it is necessary for North Korea to show concrete actions toward the abandonment of all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs," said &lt;a href="Shinzo%20Abe"&gt;Shinzo Abe&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister of Japan.

Six-party talks are said to resume on December 18, 2006.

Stargazers in &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; will get a rare show on Sunday night, just before the local &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASunrise"&gt;Sunrise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The planets &lt;a href="Planet%20Mars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Planet%20Mercury"&gt;Mercury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Planet%20Jupiter"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; will line up and will be seen in clear skies at least 45 minutes before sunrise, and will be seen each morning until December 14, 2006.

"Jupiter will be very bright and it will look like it has two bright lights next to it, and they won't twinkle because they're planets. When I look at something like this, I realize that all the powers on Earth, all the emperors, all the money, cannot change it one iota. We are observers, but the wonderful part of that is that we are the only species on this planet that can observe it and understand it," said television show host of ♡❤Star Gazer,♡❤ Jack Horkheimer. He is also director of the Space Transit Planetarium in &lt;a href="Miami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

This will be the closest planet-lineup to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; until 2053. The previous closest viewing occurred in 1925.

&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;The Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt;, the official opposition party of Canada, is currently ahead of the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; according to a poll by &lt;a href="w%3AEKOS%20Research%20Associates"&gt;Ekos Research Associates&lt;/a&gt; published in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Star"&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal's&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Presse"&gt;La Presse&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ Saturday.

The Liberals lead with 40% and the Conservatives, who were elected in January, with 34%. Trailing both is the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; NDP with 10% and &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Green party&lt;/a&gt; each with 8%.

Support for the Liberals increased by eight points since October. This is the highest Liberal support in the 40 percent mark since former Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Chretien"&gt;Jean Chrétien&lt;/a&gt; stepped down as prime minister and party leader three years ago.

The &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Tories&lt;/a&gt; dropped down two points. The Conservative party, led by &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, received 36.3 per cent of the vote and 124 seats in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20House%20of%20Commons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt; when they were elected in January. This election ended 12 years of the Liberal government.

The Conservatives have 124 seats in the House of Commons, Liberals 102, Bloc Québécois 51, and NDP 29. There are now also two independent MPs in the House.

"What is troubling for the Conservatives is an underlying trend over many months of rising dissatisfaction with the direction of government, combined with utter disappointment with its efforts on the environment," Frank Graves, the polling firm's president said. "At the same time, the preoccupation with ethics and accountability that drove the Tories' success in January (when Prime Minister Stephen Harper won an election) has largely dissipated."

Four per cent of those surveyed said the Conservatives are the best party to deal with environment issues. The Green party were the most trusted with 35% and the Liberals in third with 31%.

"There is a shock result here for the NDP," Graves said. "Nationally, the Greens are within sight of the NDP...These are the first clear indications we have that the New Democrats could find themselves squeezed into irrelevance in a painful grind between the Liberals and the Greens."

When asked which leader who makes the best PM the poll found people preferred Harper over newly elected Liberal leader &lt;a href="w%3ASt%C3%A9phane%20Dion"&gt;Stéphane Dion&lt;/a&gt;. When asked "Who best understands the concerns of people like you?" residents in the Conservative &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Canada"&gt;Western Canada&lt;/a&gt; preferred Harper. Dion rated higher in &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic%20Canada"&gt;Atlantic Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Outside Quebec and Atlantic Canada, Harper is seen by Canadians as the leader with the "best vision for the future of the country."

In Ontario, the Liberals lead stands at a strong 46.9%. Conservatives at 37.4%, the NDP at 9.1% and the greens 6.6%.

The Liberals lead in every province except oil-producing &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, which is led by the &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;, and Quebec at 26.1%, where the separatist Bloc Quebecois is leading with 34.7%. The Conservatives have 18.3% in Quebec, the Greens have 12.1%, and the NDP 8.8%.

It is expected that the next federal election will be held in 2007.

An agreement signed between the &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand government&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrucor"&gt;Frucor Beverages Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3ACoca-Cola%20Amatil"&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil (New Zealand)&lt;/a&gt; has secured that both full sugar fizzy drinks and energy drinks that are made by those two companies will not be sold in secondary schools coming into effect 2009.

The agreement was completely voluntary and is a world first as it was directly negotiated with the companies and the government.

It has been estimated that the agreement will remove around 1,105,000 litres of fizzy drinks from schools. That amount of fizzy drinks has about 118,000 &lt;a href="w%3AKilogram"&gt;kilograms&lt;/a&gt; of sugar. When one secondary school in Auckland introduced healthier drinks they saw around half a &lt;a href="w%3ATonne"&gt;tonne&lt;/a&gt; of sugar removed.

&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Maharey"&gt;Steve Maharey&lt;/a&gt;, minister of education, said: "The agreement will see the removal of 1.1 million litres of full sugar beverages from schools over the next three years. I welcome the industry's recognition that action is needed on this issue. This agreement is a strong step forward that will support the work we are doing to ensure schools and communities can provide healthier alternatives for their students."

&lt;a href="w%3APete%20Hodgson"&gt;Pete Hodgson&lt;/a&gt;, minister of health, said that the agreement is what can happen when both government and industries work together. "I thank Coca Cola Amatil and Frucor for their leadership on this issue," Pete Hodgson said. "Today's agreement is a major step forward for the Food Industry Accord and shows once again what can be achieved when we reach for cooperative, rather than regulatory solutions."

Diet drinks will remain on sale that contain artificial sweetener, &lt;a href="w%3AAspartame"&gt;Aspartame&lt;/a&gt;. And in 2007 the government will recommend water and low-fat milk in early childhood centres and high schools. But there is a lot of &lt;a href="w%3AAspartame%20controversy"&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt; surrounding Aspartame which many consider to have serious long-term health effects. If there is only a choice between water, milk or soft-drink, nearly all kids would choose the latter.

The government has also announced a new programme called Mission-On that will promote nutrition and physical activity and will also try to improve the quality of food that children will be subject to in schools. It will also try to decrease the amount of advertising unhealthy food companies are given.

Mr Hodgson said: "This agreement forms only a small part of what will be necessary to address this challenge, but shows that the government and the food industry are serious about playing our part."

Mr Hodgson has confirmed that regulation will now not happen and has said that regulation would have been too costly and too slow to implement.

Frucor Beverages Ltd and Coca-Cola Amatil are the only companies that provide drinks to schools.

A 4-year old pre-kindergartener, attending La Vega Primary School in &lt;a href="w%3AWaco%2C%20Texas"&gt;Waco, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, was given an in-school suspension November 10 after hugging a teacher's aide and supposedly rubbing his face in her chest.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Vega%20Independent%20School%20District"&gt;La Vega school district&lt;/a&gt; sent a letter to the student's father, Damarcus Blackwell, who was upset after learning of his son's "inappropriate physical behavior interpreted as sexual contact and/or &lt;a href="w%3Asexual%20harassment"&gt;sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt;". He has since filed complaint against the district.

"When I got that letter, my world flipped," Blackwell said in a story in Sunday's editions of the Waco Tribune-Herald. 

Blackwell says that it is ridiculous that the aide would misinterpret a hug from a four-year-old. Blackwell wrote to administrators demanding that the incident and all paperwork related to the incident be expunged from his son's academic records on the basis that a four year old cannot understand the concept of sexual harassment, let alone commit sexual harassment. He also asked that the aide who reported his son's conduct apologize.

The record has since been changed to "inappropriate physical contact", though Blackwell's request to expunge all records concerning the incident was denied, as was his request for an apology from the aide involved in the incident. 

District employees state that there are no guidelines about student/teacher contact in the handbook; however, it does state that "inappropriate physical contact" will result in a discipline referral.

According 
The school district would not comment on specific details, citing student privacy laws.

A major purchase transaction is being prepared in the diamonds' industry: ♡❤♡♡❤Samuels Jewelers♡❤♡♡❤ started a discussion with a &lt;a href="w%3ASightholder"&gt;sightholder&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ADiamond%20Trading%20Company"&gt;Diamond Trading Company (DTC)&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is to acquire the majority part of retailer's shares.

There is still not much information about this particular sightholder, except for the fact that it is based in India. The present majority shareholder of Samuels Jewelers is ♡❤♡♡❤DDJ Capital Management♡❤♡♡❤. The representatives of the company do not give any information concerning the potential buyer.

Randy McCullough, the President and CEO of Samuels Jewelers, stated that it would be a great opportunity for the retailer to start a partnership with a DTC sightholder, thus Samuels would be able to re-capitalize its balance sheet, to acquire newer inventory and guarantee itself stable growth in the future.

As for Samuels Jewelers, which is officially called ♡❤"Samuels, Schubach and Samuels Diamonds"♡❤, possesses a network of 97 jewelry stores in 18 US states since October 1 this year. The incomes of the retailer at the end of the previous year are estimated to be around $100,000,000.

The current shareholder of Samuels Jewelers, DDJ Capital Management, is a company, which specializes itself in private equity and debt financings. This managing firm began its activity in 1996 and since then has grown to operate capitals of 79 institutional clients (estimated in approximately 3 billion dollars).

<doc id="56435" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=56435" title="Sun Unveils Java 6.0">
<h1>Sun Unveils Java 6.0</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sun%20Unveils%20Java%206.0&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Sun Microsystems released the latest installment in their popular Java programming language line today, Java Standard Edition 6.0. Though this release, codenamed "Mustang", is not as drastic a departure from its predecessors as version 5.0, Sun reports more features, and noticeably better performance. In addition, the new release promises to support easier databases, and has integrated its graphics rather seamlessly with both Windows and the GTK. 

Users of the pre-release versions have already reported substantial performance gains. Graeme Wallace, the CTO of FareCompare.com, reported that "The difference between Java SE 5 and Java SE 6 was startling. In terms of crunching through air fares, we are talking an increase in speed of 25% to 30%." Sam Berlin, senior engineer of Limewire LLC, commented that he has "really been pleased with the startup times," and Jim Adams, the principal Java architect at SAS, reported that, in using the version 6.0 pre-releases, he "was always impressed by the speed and memory improvement that [version 6] afforded me."

Microsoft has publicly endorsed the release due to its strong compatibility with the upcoming Windows Vista operating system. Said CEO Brad Goldberg, "We welcome the Java SE 6 release and its compatibility with Windows Vista because we want to see a good Java technology experience available for customers using Windows."

<h2>Major Features</h2>

A comprehensive features list was provided by Sun Microsystems. Some of the most notable improvements are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- The new version contains some much-anticipated database support (via Java DB). Dr. Barry Burd, author of ♡❤Java for Dummies♡❤, commented that "In my years of writing and teaching, I've always had to tiptoe around the quirks of various databases. While trying to describe underlying database principles, I would become tangled in descriptions of platform specific alternatives. Even the simplest examples involved distracting, unnecessary tweaks. But Java DB makes my job easy."
BULLET::::- A new API has been added to allow scripting in Java, including both languages like Python and Ruby as well as Mozilla's open-source JavaScript implementation. This will mark an unprecedented convergence between the two technologies, which have historically only been related in name, not in implementation.
BULLET::::- The garbage collection algorithms have been improved for multi-core and multi-threaded processing.
BULLET::::- A substantial number of visual changes have been implemented:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Java programs may now be placed into the System Tray of any operating system that has one.
BULLET::::- Sun has tweaked their text anti-aliasing features to provide for a better visual experience.
BULLET::::- Prior to this release, Java applications that ran in Windows operating systems did not appear the same as surrounding applications, with various color and toolbar incongruities. This release fixes those problems.
BULLET::::- Those who use GTK for graphics processing will find that Sun's code runs from GTK directly, emulating the look and feel exactly.
BULLET::::- Java applications may now have splash screens when starting.
</ul>
BULLET::::- Linux users may now use the command-line command "java", which had previously only been accessible on Linux and Windows.
BULLET::::- Input and output streams may now use the popular ZIP compression when transferring data.
BULLET::::- Java programs can now write to .GIF images.
BULLET::::- The Java Plug-in and Java Web Start software have both been improved for better usability and security. The Plug-in now officially supports Mozilla Firefox, a popular web browser.
BULLET::::- Graphical hardware acceleration in Microsoft's Direct3D has become more fully supported, allowing graphical applications to run faster.
BULLET::::- A special class has been added for handling input and output to a text console.
BULLET::::- Sun has added a new interface for a double-ended Queue, (a Deque) which allows programmers to add elements both to the beginning of a list and to the end of it. So far, this has only been implemented in their LinkedList class.

Annan went on to offer five lessons, every one of which led him to conclude that "such leadership is no less sorely needed now than it was sixty years ago". 

The lessons he had learned while in office were that the security of everyone is linked to that of everyone else and that we are all responsible for each other’s welfare; that security and development ultimately depend on respect for human rights and the rule of law; that governments must be accountable for their actions in the international arena, as well as in the domestic one; and that, only by working together through the United Nations, can security, welfare and development be achieved.

In the course of his speech, Kofi Annan referred to &lt;a href="w%3AAmerica"&gt;America&lt;/a&gt; as being in the vanguard of the global &lt;a href="w%3Ahuman%20rights"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; movement but he warned "that lead can only be maintained if America remains true to its principles, including in the struggle against &lt;a href="w%3Aterrorism"&gt;terrorism&lt;/a&gt;". 

He concluded his address saying "More than ever today Americans, like the rest of humanity, need a functioning global system through which the world’s peoples can face global challenges together. And in order to function, the system still cries out for far-sighted American leadership, in the Truman tradition. I hope and pray that the American leaders of today, and tomorrow, will provide it." 

Afterwards, he was asked why he had chosen in his farewell speech to make such a pointed attack on America. He replied, sharply, that "An appeal for cooperation and leadership should never be seen as an attack".

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; politician of the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; party &lt;a href="Dennis%20Kucinich"&gt;Dennis Kucinich&lt;/a&gt; plans to run for president in 2008 the five-term congressman's spokesman, Andy Juniewicz, said Monday. Kucinich ran in 2004 and was last in nearly every primary and caucus of that year. 

Kucinich began his political career as a Cleveland city councilman and later as the youngest person ever elected mayor of the Midwestern city.

The congressman made his decision to run, according to a written statement, because he felt his own party's leadership was not aggressive enough in opposing the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Kucinich, 60, is a staunch opponent of the Iraq war. He has advocated cutting off funds for the war, saying that voting for money to maintain or expand the war is incompatible with a position of opposition to it. 

He also co-chaired the Congressional Progressive Caucus and is a self-described "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Wellstone"&gt;Wellstone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Democrat." He has been praised as "a genuine progressive" by a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Nader"&gt;Ralph Nader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and in 2003, Kucinich was the recipient of the Gandhi Peace Award.

If elected, he would be the country's first &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Avegan"&gt;vegan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; president.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discovery"&gt;Space Shuttle Discovery&lt;/a&gt; docked with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; today at 5:12 p.m. ET. After a two-day journey, the space shuttle reached the space station for a week long stay to rewire the orbiting lab, install a new addition and rotate out a crew member. Astronaut &lt;a href="w%3ASunita%20Williams"&gt;Sunita "Suni" Williams&lt;/a&gt; will live for six months at the space lab, replacing German astronaut &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Reiter"&gt;Thomas Reiter&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Space%20Agency"&gt;European Space Agency.&lt;/a&gt;.

An hour earlier the orbiter did a slow back flip so that crew members at the international space station could photograph its mid section for any signs of liftoff damage. This has been a routine procedure since the Columbia tragedy in which the space shuttle Columbia sustained damage on liftoff leading to its disintegration in the atmosphere. There appeared to be no problems with the heat shield so commander Mark Polansky continued the docking process. 

As the space station came into view of Discovery, Williams told Mission Control: "It's beautiful."

Mission Control responded: "I don't know what kind of creature comforts you're going to have, but you're going to have a room with a view."

A $11 million extension will be put into place on Tuesday during the first of the mission's three spacewalks. Astronauts plan to rewire the space lab, switching it from a temporary power source to a permanent one, during the two other spacewalks.

Two male models (known as &lt;a href="w%3ATyler%20Denk"&gt;Tyler Denk&lt;/a&gt;, 29, and &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Branaman"&gt;James Branaman&lt;/a&gt;) have won the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Amazing%20Race%2010"&gt;tenth season&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;CBS'&lt;/a&gt; hit show ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Amazing%20Race"&gt;The Amazing Race&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. The models were awarded &lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD$&lt;/a&gt;1 million. Each received USD$500,000. Both are recovering addicts and are friends in the modeling scene, they reconnected after going through rehab.

The models competed in a race around the world against people from around the United States. After arriving at France's &lt;a href="w%3ACaen%20Airport"&gt;Caen Airport&lt;/a&gt;, one member of each team was required to &lt;a href="w%3Askydive"&gt;skydive&lt;/a&gt;. After the task was finished, teams had to design clothes at a shop in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;. 

When they were finished, teams had to get a flight to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, Rob and Kimberly told the manager that they had to win $1 million, he gave them a seat. Tyler and James also got on the same flight. 

When the teams arrived in New York their first stop was at the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20News"&gt;Daily News&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ building. The last stop was at &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAstor%20Park"&gt;Astor Park&lt;/a&gt; were they got their final clue. Tyler and James quickly got into a taxi cab and arrived at &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Basil%20Academy"&gt;St. Basil Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGarrison%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Garrison, New York&lt;/a&gt;, they ran to the finish line were the host &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Keoghan"&gt;Phil Keoghan&lt;/a&gt; with all eliminated twelve teams waited for the winner. &lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Diaz"&gt;Rob Diaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKimberly%20Chabolla"&gt;Kimberly Chabolla&lt;/a&gt; were in second and &lt;a href="w%3ALynn%20Turk"&gt;Lynn Turk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKarlyn%20Harris"&gt;Karlyn Harris&lt;/a&gt; were in last.

"For James and I, we've been through so much together as a friendship and in our lives that, first, to accomplish yet another thing — that's gravy on top of the mashed potatoes," said Tyler Denk. "Another gift of life."

"We live our lives with such gratitude already that this was just one of those experiences that we would only get through sobriety," James Branaman said.

The Amazing Race &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Amazing%20Race%2011"&gt;season 11&lt;/a&gt; is expected to start next year.

&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; is poised to become the first &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; state to require convicted sex offenders to report e-mail addresses and on-line identities to the state’s sex offender registry.
Attorney General &lt;a href="w%3A%20Bob%20McDonnell"&gt;Bob McDonnell&lt;/a&gt; said Monday that he supports new reporting requirements of a legislative proposal expected to be introduced by Senator Ryan McDougle (&lt;a href="w%3A%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3A%20Hanover%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Hanover County&lt;/a&gt;) for consideration by the Virginia General Assembly when it convenes in January. The legislation would help on-line social networking communities popular among youth groups, such as &lt;a href="w%3AMySpace"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFacebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, prevent sex offenders from using their sites.

"This legislation is an important recognition that the Internet has become a community as real as any other neighborhood and is in need of similar safeguards," officials of MySpace said in response to the announcement. Chief security officer Hemanshu Nigam of the 125-million-user MySpace site said the law would be "a landmark moment in the history of Internet safety."

A U.S. national &lt;a href="w%3Ablacklist"&gt;blacklist&lt;/a&gt; will be used by MySpace to ban registered sex offenders. A database called "Sentinel Safe", under development by Sentinel Tech Holding Corp., will be used to check national and state records. Nigam said, "Sentinel Safe will allow us to aggregate all publicly available sex offender databases into a real-time searchable form making it easy to cross-reference and remove known registered sex offenders from the MySpace community."

<h1>New Zealand ex-politician gives valedictory speech</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%20ex-politician%20gives%20valedictory%20speech&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Brash"&gt;Doctor Don Brash&lt;/a&gt; has today given his valedictory speech in parliament on his departure from &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand politics&lt;/a&gt;.

Dr Brash had only been in politics for four and a half years and in that time he had risen to the ranks of leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National party&lt;/a&gt; and only participating in one election as leader, narrowly becoming the opposition.

Dr Brash described being a member of parliament (MP) as: "...A great privilege." And he said that "...I've had a fantastic opportunity..." "...I've had a lot of fantastic opportunities..."

He admits that he took a while to get the hang of the processes of parliament and the proceedings. He gave two examples, one when he went tried to get a haircut but was asked by his secretary, Anne Small, if he had gotten permission from the &lt;a href="w%3AWhip%20%28politics%29"&gt;whips&lt;/a&gt;. And the other when he was confused why his office was located so far apart from that of the leaders even though he was ranked third in the party.

Dr Brash left his position as the Governor of the &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Reserve Bank&lt;/a&gt; and entered politics because he was worried about the direction the country was heading in, "...or perhaps more accurately not getting to." Dr Brash said: "Keeping inflation under control was very important, but it was not enough to lift living standards and prevent the exodus of tens of thousands of Kiwis across the Tasman and across the world." Dr Brash then listed a number of reasons on why he left the reserve bank for politics including the problems of: the welfare system, the schooling system, the hospital system, safety and property issues and law equality, "And those were the things that desperately needed to be done."

Dr Brash said that over his political careers he had regrets that he "...never made it into government [and] I didn't change a single law."

"I made some mistakes," Dr Brash said. Those mistakes included: "...like remaining silent when the National Party caucus decided, under previous leadership, that, had National been in Government, we would've supported Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States in the invasion of Iraq, even though I had serious misgivings about the wisdom of that course of action."

Dr Brash said: "When I was approached to stand in the 2002 election, one of the people I talked to was &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Caygill"&gt;David Caygill&lt;/a&gt;. He encouraged me to stand. He warned me that National was likely to lose the 2002 election, but he said that even in Opposition I might have some influence on the national discussion, on the national debate. And so it has proved to be."

"I even take some satisfaction on issues where I demonstrably failed."

Dr Brash announced: "Madam Speaker, I want to thank all those who've helped me over the last four and a half years."

Dr Brash then went on to thanks all those involved with his campaign and his colleagues. "I'm not sure whether I want to thank members of the Press Gallery or not! Sometimes I think I do, but at other times I'm not so sure! But I certainly respect most members of the Gallery, and have developed a lasting friendship with several," he said. He also gave thanks to his family and friends, he said that without their help and support he wouldn't have "survived."

Dr Brash left parliament by saying: "Let me end by wishing my successor, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Key"&gt;John Key&lt;/a&gt;, and his team every success in promoting those policies that will be of lasting benefit to all New Zealanders."

The newly appointed leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, the main opposition party in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; has urged his supporters to "take a cold shower" after the release of a Newspoll showing a jump in support for the ALP.

The poll showed that the ALP's two-party preferred vote has risen to 55 percent compared to the incumbent government's 45 percent. Mr Rudd is also gaining support as potential &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; with his figures in a "preferred prime minister" poll published by ♡❤The Australian♡❤ being only 3 points behind &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; at 36 percent. In the prior Newspoll, Mr Rudd's predecessor &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; had only 25 percent support.

Speaking during his "listening" tour in the &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3ATownsville"&gt;Townsville&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Rudd said that the poll indicated a protest vote against the Howard government and was not an endorsement for him or the ALP.

"I think what you're seeing in these polls today is really a protest vote against Mr Howard about becoming more and more out of touch," Mr Rudd said. "I don't think at this stage the process represents an entrenched vote for me, or for the Labor Party.".

Mr Rudd conceded that he would need to "work hard over the next nine months to earn the electorate's respect". The next election is expected to be held in late-2007 and will be called by the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General%20of%20Australia"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt; at the request of the Prime Minister.

Mr Howard said he expected for the ALP to lead polls for months as the new leader goes through a "honeymoon period". Speaking on Southern Cross Radio, Mr Howard said "I knew that Labor would get a bounce in the polls. That was going to happen and it doesn't surprise me in the least bit. When you have a new leader, the new leader has a honeymoon. I would expect Labor to be comfortably ahead in the polls for several months and it won't be until well into next year that we'll get a better fix on how the Government and the Opposition are going."

<h1>International response to demolition of Hare Krishna property in Kazakhstan</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=International%20response%20to%20demolition%20of%20Hare%20Krishna%20property%20in%20Kazakhstan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Embassy"&gt;US Embassy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Kazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; has condemned the destruction by Kazakh riot police of eleven homes within a &lt;a href="Hare%20Krishna"&gt;Hare Krishna&lt;/a&gt; village. The destruction took place on November 21st in the central Asian republic of Kazakhstan and has been termed unjust treatment of the religious group. 

"The forceful eviction of homeowners in freezing temperatures and the destruction of their possessions contradicted principles of due process and fairness," the US Embassy said in a December 7 statement.

The Embassy further urged authorities to cease "further aggressive actions" and instead seek a peaceful conclusion to ongoing legal disputes with Hare Krishnas concerning the land.

Officials from the &lt;a href="International%20Society%20for%20Krishna%20Consciousness"&gt;International Society for Krishna Consciousness&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. had previously called for an international response to the November 21 demolition of 13 homes, and a range of groups have condemned it, including the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Parliament"&gt;British Parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The US State Department's 2005 International Religious Freedom Report cited instances of "continued local government and police harassment" reported by Hare Krishnas in Kazakhstan. It reported that over 50% of the country's population is historically Muslim but the republic includes congregations of Russian Orthodox, Baptists and other Christian and religious groups.

Ironically the original demolition of the Hare Krishna homes occurred on the same day President &lt;a href="Nursultan%20Nazarbayev"&gt;Nursultan Nazarbayev&lt;/a&gt; was in London for a meeting with British Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; seeking his support for Kazakhstan's bid to be the OSCE chairman-in-office in 2009. In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , some 10,000 members of Britain's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHinduism"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; community protested the demolition of the Hare Krishna property in Kazakhstan. 

This was not the first time Kazakh authorities have attempted to confiscate the Hare Krishna community's land. In April 2006, Kazakh authorities had tried to bulldoze the homes, but retreated in the presence of journalists.

In an official statement issued after the demolition event, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent federal agency, expressed concern about the treatment of Hare Krishnas.

"Recent steps against the Hare Krishnas and members of other religious communities indicate that the government of Kazakhstan, regrettably, is moving in the wrong direction with regard to respecting the universal right to freedom of religion or belief," said Felice D. Gaer, chair of the Commission.

<h1>US Congress may re-establish the Luxury Tax</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=US%20Congress%20may%20re-establish%20the%20Luxury%20Tax&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

There are suppositions that the &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="US%20Congress"&gt;Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; may re-establish the &lt;a href="w%3Aluxury%20tax"&gt;luxury tax&lt;/a&gt;es, which were already once introduced in the 1990s. The suppositions resulted in the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Association%20of%20Watch%20and%20Clock%20Collectors"&gt;National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors&lt;/a&gt; commissioning a report on various tax issues. 

Material goods such as jewelry, watches, expensive furs, jet planes, boats, yachts, and luxury cars had already been subjected to additional taxes back in 1990. After 3 years these taxes were repealed, though the luxury automobiles tax was still active for the next 13 years. 

Rodderick A. DeArment, a representative of law firm and lobbyist &lt;a href="w%3ACovington%20and%20Burling"&gt;Covington and Burling&lt;/a&gt;, guided the report. The report outlined the fact that, in 1993, the Congress did not collect as much money from the luxury taxes as it had predicted. It also stated that although its ravaging effect on employment in several industries was sensible, "the turnover that occurred in Congress made it possible for the new group to learn the same lessons again".

The luxury tax could produce unpredictable effects for the watch industry and the report was meant to inform the members of this branch about the effects of these taxes on this luxury goods' industry.

Shane Halligan, a 16-year old student in 11th grade, is dead after he shot himself once with an &lt;a href="w%3AAK-47"&gt;AK-47&lt;/a&gt; at Springfield High School located north of &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;. Police searched the grounds for possible explosives and say a bag carried by the shooter tested positive for traces of explosives.

Halligan walked into the school and began to fire shots from his rifle into a hallway ceiling then shot himself according to the Springfield Township Police Chief, Randall Hummel. No other injuries to students occurred and all students were safely evacuated to a middle school not far from the location of the shooting.

"[He died of an] apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound," said Hummel. Authorities located a suicide letter in Halligan's pocket, but have not released its contents

The school does not have metal detectors, but according to Roseanne Nyiri, the superintendent of the high school, security at the school will "now be reviewed." Security cameras are on school grounds and police say they have video of the boy firing the gun into the hallway ceiling.

"We're all very much aware that even metal detectors have not deterred students from bringing guns into schools in the past," added Hummel.

According to Michael Delaurentis, 18 a witness and senior attending the school, the student was a "nice kid" and Delaurentis's father, also named Michael, described the student's family as "wonderful." 

"It just makes you a little in fear of the future, and not just at this school, any school, because I don't think any school is 100 percent secure," said Delaurentis's father.

"I was walking to my class. I just hear 'Get down.' I heard shots fired into the ceiling and I saw smoke," said Delaurentis.

According to police reports, Halligan committed suicide because of his parents threatening to cut back on his after school activities due to poor performance in school. According to Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce L. Castor Jr., "The picture that's emerging is he was despondent over (the fact) that his grades were down, his parents were taking appropriate steps to limit extracurricular activities to get the grades up, and he saw the things that he felt were important in his life being taken from him." but this is not the first time a weapon was brought onto school grounds.

Back in September, at the same school, a student brought a gun to show-off to other fellow students causing the entire school to be locked down.

The bodies of five women within the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; have been found in or around the county of Suffolk in the east of England. The latest victims were found on 12 December 2006 in a rural area a few hundred meters apart, and one body discovered within 40 minutes of the other.
Detectives investigating the murders have confirmed that the last body discovered was that of 29 year old Annette Nicholls. Five women have been found dead within 10 days and authorities face an "unprecedented" murder investigation. 

Britain's infamous historical serial killers are the 19th century murderer known as "Jack the Ripper", who was responsible for the deaths of five prostitutes in east London in 1888 but was never found and Peter Sutcliffe the "Yorkshire Ripper" who murdered 13 women, mainly those who worked in prostitution, over a period of five years in northern England. 

Suffolk Police have cited prostitutes to stay off the streets and women have been advised not to go out unaccompanied.

<h1>New Zealand local loop unbundled</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%20local%20loop%20unbundled&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand government&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the Telecommunications Amendment Bill, which will make &lt;a href="w%3ATelecom%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Telecom&lt;/a&gt; unbundle the 'local loop', has passed in parliament only six months after it was introduced. The bill was passed under urgency on the last sitting day of the year. 

The bill was opposed by two members of parliament from the &lt;a href="w%3AACT%20New%20Zealand"&gt;ACT party&lt;/a&gt; and supported by 119 votes. The ACT party voted against the bill to prevent a split of the company into three divisions: retail, business and network.

Unbundling the local loop means that Telecom, New Zealand's telecommunications monopoly company, will open its lines to competitors and provide "naked DSL", which some say will lead to equal and fair competition in the Internet sector. The decision to unbundle the local loop occurred earlier this year when a mole leaked the proposal and the government had to make the announcement earlier than planned.

The bill will also enable minister of communications Cunliffe and the Commerce Commission the powers to split Telecom into the three divisions, after public consultation. The Telecommunications Commissioner will also have more power to implement the changes and monitor the implementation.

The bill will ensure that consumers do not have to purchase a phone account when signing up for an Internet account; before the bill was passed, a NZ$10 fee was added to the bill if the phone account was not with the Internet service provider.

The Honourable &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Cunliffe"&gt;David Cunliffe&lt;/a&gt;, minister of communications, said that "We now have a clear, firm mandate from the people of New Zealand. Kiwis are demanding fast, 'all you can eat' broadband, which this legislation is designed to deliver."

Hon Cunliffe said that history has been made with the new bill as it will bring New Zealanders faster and better broadband. "What some people said couldn't be done is being done. What some people said wouldn't work is being given the opportunity to work with an overwhelming majority. The bill equips New Zealand for the new digital age— an age where the smart use of technology will determine our continued prosperity as a country and make economic transformation a reality."

The Antiquorum‘s auction that took place on 6th and 7th of December in &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the sale of some new and old timepieces. The sales achieved a total of more than $ 7,250,000. 396 timepieces were sold at the auction. This was the Antiquorum USA's second best auction. 

About 83% of both vintage and contemporary timepieces were purchased by various collectors worldwide. The estimate resulting of all the watches and clocks that were sold at New York's Antiquorum was 115%. The most active bidding was the telephone and in-house ones. There were also 284 international bidders that registered themselves on the Internet. 

The most competitive bidders were from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

The International Watch Company (IWC) is organizing an on-line auction to take place in the period from December 13 to December 20, 2006. The proceeds of the auction will be used for offering support to a charitable organization - Association Vol de Nuit/Vuelo Nocturno. The main task and responsibility of the association lies in taking care of Buenos Aires children who live in reduced circumstances. 

Association Vol de Nuit/Vuelo Nocturno, a humanitarian institution, was established in 2003. The Foundation has built close cooperation with the city's schools, homes and other organizations helping street children. The proceeds of the IWC on-line auction are to be benefited to the major projects carried out by the Foundation. 

Da Vinci is the name of a rarity timepiece chosen by the IWC to be put for auction. The watch itself was developed back in 1990 as a part of a limited edition of just 110 pieces. It represents a stainless steel model featuring a white dial in English which is provided with a perpetual calendar function. The exclusive watch is on the list of the most sought-after items among connoisseurs of High Horology. 

This is the ninth time the IWC is holding an auction for charitable purposes and every time dozens of watch collectors and enthusiasts take part in the event. The bidders are invited to visit the &lt;a href="https%3A//www.iwc.ch/index-en.asp"&gt;official site of the Company&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Johnson%20%28South%20Dakota%29"&gt;Tim Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Democratic Senator from &lt;a href="South%20Dakota"&gt;South Dakota&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly suffered a stroke at about 11:30 this morning. However, subsequent tests revealed that the senator did not suffer a stroke or a heart attack. He was transported to &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Washington%20University%20Hospital"&gt;George Washington University Hospital&lt;/a&gt; by ambulance, where he was diagnosed with a congenital &lt;a href="w%3Aarteriovenous%20malformation"&gt;arteriovenous malformation&lt;/a&gt; and underwent brain surgery. He is currently "recovering without complications" and "appropriately responsive to both word and touch" but it still in critical condition and being monitored. Additional surgery may be required.

Currently, the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt; is controlled by the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt;; however, when the Senate reconvenes after the recent midterm elections the Democrats will have a one senator majority. Under the 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, state legislatures can give their governor the power to appoint someone else to take over, but this power can only be used in cases where the senator vacates his seat. Historically, this applies to death or resignation, but serious illness does not count.

Should Johnson die or resign, the Republican governor, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Rounds"&gt;Mike Rounds&lt;/a&gt;, will likely appoint a Republican in Johnson's place. This would bring the Senate to a 50-50 tie for organizational purposes and give &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Vice President Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; the tie-breaking vote, thus letting the Republicans control the Senate. This appointment would last until the end of Johnson's term, in 2008.

If he does not recover the senate has the power to force him out, but historically the senate has not done so. On Nov. 23, 1969, GOP Sen. &lt;a href="w%3AKarl%20Earl%20Mundt"&gt;Karl Mundt&lt;/a&gt; of South Dakota, who previously held Johnson's seat, had a debilitating stroke. He later endured months of speech and physical therapy at his Washington home. Mundt's wife, Mary, refused to vacate the seat despite pressure from the state's Republicans. Mund remained formally in his seat until his term expired in 1973.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-johnson-mundt%2C1%2C7241723.story%3Fcoll%3Dsns-ap-politics-headlines"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In the past multiple other senators have become incapacitated for months or even years and kept their seat, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-te.johnson15dec15%2C0%2C4665999.story%3Fcoll%3Dbal-home-headlines"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but party control of the senate was not involved.

Canadian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Canada"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; has proposed a bill that would allow &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadians&lt;/a&gt; to vote for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20of%20Canada"&gt;Senators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Such a change requires an amendment the &lt;a href="Constitution%20of%20Canada"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt;, however, the government believes that Harper's proposal bypasses the need for constitutional change.

Traditionally, the Prime Minister advised the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20General%20of%20Canada"&gt;Governor General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on who to appoint to the upper house. The Senate reform bill, however, would allow citizens in a province or territory to vote in a preferential ballot which would advise the Prime Minister on whom to recommend for appointment to the Senate. 

Senators would campaign like any other politician. Voters in their province that has a Senate vacancy would cast ballots for their favorite candidate at the same time as a vote in a general election.

The only provinces that actually has had Senate elections are &lt;a href="Alberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="British%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. In 1989, then Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Mulroney"&gt;Brian Mulroney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; appointed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStan%20Waters"&gt;Stan Waters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the Senate after he was elected in an Alberta-wide vote to fill a vacancy in the upper house. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Alberta Premier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; designate &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Stelmach"&gt;Ed Stelmach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says he agrees with Harper's proposal.

"I believe what Prime Minister Harper is doing is opening up consultation in terms of how to bring about Senate reform and we're going to work with him," said Stelmach in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdmonton"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the capital of Alberta. "We have been supportive of Senate reform for many, many years and will continue to do so. I'm awaiting the details of his proposals."

&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;"&gt; ♡❤Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Harper has already introduced a bill which will attempt to limit the terms of senators to eight years. The 105-member Senate is currently dominated by the Liberals.
"Many Albertans I'm sure will share my view that it will not be good for the province to have an elected Senate as long as we don't have a constitutional change on the number of senators by province," &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Dion"&gt;Stephane Dion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said.

If the bill fails, Harper is expected to campaign on the issue in the next federal election, which is expected next year.

Veteran &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Karkos"&gt;Don Karkos&lt;/a&gt; was impaired in the December 7, 1941 &lt;a href="w%3AAttack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor"&gt;attacks on Pearl Harbor&lt;/a&gt; when the tanker USS Rapaden exploded, sending shrapnel into his face, above his right eye.

Don Karkos awoke in a military hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AIceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;. The doctors told him that he would not be able to see out of that eye again. Life was extremely difficult with the loss of peripheral sight and depth perception. Common results of this impairment include difficulty in navigating through every-day obstacles such as doors or walls.

Three years ago Don Karkos was told he would not be able to restore his vision, even with the current advances in medicine. A few months ago, while tightening the harness of Chimo, a racehorse at the &lt;a href="w%3AMonticello%20Raceway"&gt;Monticello Raceway&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMonticello%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Monticello, New York&lt;/a&gt;, Don Karkos was hit in the head by Chimo close to the location of his shrapnel injury. That evening while rubbing his good eye, Don Karkos realized he could once again see through the disabled eye. 

Don Karkos plans to visit a doctor after the holiday season.

<h1>Yahoo!7 creates joint venture with Xtra</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Yahoo%217%20creates%20joint%20venture%20with%20Xtra&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AXtra%20%28ISP%29"&gt;Xtra&lt;/a&gt;, owned by New Zealand telecommunication monopoly company &lt;a href="w%3ATelecom%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Telecom&lt;/a&gt;, has created a joint venture between themselves and &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo%217"&gt;Yahoo!7&lt;/a&gt;, creating Yahoo Xtra. Yahoo!7 is the joint venture between &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt; and Australian network, &lt;a href="w%3ASeven%20Network"&gt;Seven&lt;/a&gt;.

The join venture replaces the current and long-lasting partnership between Microsoft and Xtra, called XtraMSN. The current partnership's contract will expire at the end of this year. Telecom chose to change the partnership because Yahoo! has worked together with &lt;a href="w%3ABT%20Group"&gt;BT Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVerizon%20Communications"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARogers%20Communications"&gt;Rogers Communications&lt;/a&gt;.

The new site, along with new online content will go online on around March 1, 2007.

The partnership will result in Yahoo!7 taking 51% control of the partnership and Xtra taking the remaining 49%.

Kevin Kenrick, chief operating officer of Telecom, said that they will now be able to target the underdeveloped online advertising community. "We see there is a fantastic opportunity to grow online advertising and the share of the online market. Online advertising in New Zealand is getting to a tipping point of growth where there is a critical mass of online connections, broadband connections and an increase in the amount of time people are spending online."

When the new site is launched, it will include a range of news, sport, weather, enhanced e-mail spam and virus protection, photo sharing, and internet radio.

Theresa Gattung, chief executive of Telecom, said: "The Yahoo Xtra joint venture will provide New Zealanders with access to the world's best online services in a localised way."

Ian Smith, chief executive of Yahoo!7, said: "The company was achieving market growth of online advertising of between 50 and 60 per cent a year in Australia and believed it could do the same in New Zealand." He said that the partnership will give them a great opportunity to showcase its tools, technology and platforms in New Zealand.

Mr Kenrick said that the reason they had gotten a partnership with Yahoo!7 was that it is very difficult for a small player to develop its services in a New Zealand size market.

One other online company Xtra had considered for the partnership was Google, among others. The reason they chose Yahoo!7 over other companies was because Yahoo!7 has the top position in big fields such as TV and video. Mr Kenrick said: "The whole area of content management is one we thought would benefit from others with greater expertise and more scope."

Telecom manages 80% of the telecommunication market.

<h1>Fictional documentary about Flemish independence causes consternation in Belgium</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fictional%20documentary%20about%20Flemish%20independence%20causes%20consternation%20in%20Belgium&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Belgian French-speaking public television channel &lt;a href="w%3ARTBF"&gt;RTBF&lt;/a&gt; interrupted its programming last night for a special news bulletin reporting that the &lt;a href="w%3AFlemish%20Parliament"&gt;Flemish Parliament&lt;/a&gt; had suddenly created an independent Flemish state &lt;a href="w%3ASeparatism"&gt;separate&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. However, during the broadcast it became clear that the report was actually a documentary meant to stir up the debate on the position of the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunities%20and%20regions%20of%20Belgium"&gt;states and regions in the federal country Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Walloon Minister of Media Fadila Laanan said that the message "this is fiction" appeared only at her request, after she had received several "panic" calls and text messages.

During the report, &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20II%20of%20Belgium"&gt;King Albert II of Belgium&lt;/a&gt; was alleged to have left the country to show his disagreement with the unilateral &lt;a href="w%3AFlanders"&gt;Flemish&lt;/a&gt; decision. Several politicians (&lt;a href="w%3AJean-Marie%20Dedecker"&gt;Jean-Marie Dedecker&lt;/a&gt;, Jean-Marie Happart, &lt;a href="w%3AHerman%20De%20Croo"&gt;Herman De Croo&lt;/a&gt; etc.) contributed in the making of the program, giving their reaction to the news and explaining some of their views on &lt;a href="w%3AFlemish%20movement"&gt;Flemish independence&lt;/a&gt;. There were images of thousands celebrating in &lt;a href="w%3AAntwerp"&gt;Antwerp&lt;/a&gt; and flag-waving independence supporters in front of the Royal Palace in Laken, but also trams stuck at the "new border", and traffic jams in the direction of &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels%20Airport"&gt;Brussels Airport&lt;/a&gt;. After a while more comedy entered the report; two Flemish policemen where shown to be called into action to patrol the border, and Guy Vanhengel (&lt;a href="w%3AFlemish%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats"&gt;VLD&lt;/a&gt;) was interviewed inside the &lt;a href="w%3AAtomium"&gt;Atomium&lt;/a&gt;, the monument symbolic of Belgium, where he spoke of a "monumental" mistake. The report was followed by a debate on the subject of the Flemish independence movement.

The head of news at RTBF reacted: "We obviously scared many people - maybe more than we expected," and this was indeed the case. A spokesman of Belgian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Verhofstadt"&gt;Verhofstadt&lt;/a&gt; stated late last night that the newspaper &lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Monde"&gt;♡❤Le Monde♡❤&lt;/a&gt; had already called them, and that &lt;a href="w%3ACNBC"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; already thought it was not fictional. Several embassies reported the news to their countries, and a Belgian representative in the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; reported "consternation". A survey by the RTBF shows that 89% of spectators admit being fooled by the report, with even 6% continuing to believe it after the fiction notice appeared.

Leaders on both sides of the country spelled out their appall: &lt;a href="w%3AElio%20Di%20Rupo"&gt;Elio Di Rupo&lt;/a&gt; said it is "...unacceptable to play with the institutions and the stability of the country.", while &lt;a href="w%3AYves%20Leterme"&gt;Yves Leterme&lt;/a&gt;, Minister-President of the &lt;a href="w%3AFlemish%20government"&gt;Flemish government&lt;/a&gt;, regretted that some of the Flemish demands were caricatured. Pro-independence politicians such as &lt;a href="w%3AFilip%20Dewinter"&gt;Filip Dewinter&lt;/a&gt; and Bart De Wever didn't hide their approval of the fake news report. Several politicians have criticized the method used by the RTBF, and expect that this will reflect badly on the credibility and reputation of the channel. The usual RTBF news studio and anchorman were used to make the fictional report.

The incident is headline news in Belgium. The report comes at a time of a growing discussion on the topic of granting Flanders more independence from Belgium, one year before the elections in Belgium. Only last week, the pro-Flemish political parties &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20and%20Flemish"&gt;CD&amp;V&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew-Flemish%20Alliance"&gt;NVA&lt;/a&gt; announced that they would demand a major constitutional change during the next federal negotiations.

Professor &lt;a href="Stephen%20Hawking"&gt;Stephen Hawking&lt;/a&gt; today concluded his eight-day visit to Israel and &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20Palestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;. The visit was organised by the British Embassy and the British Council. The world-famous scientist and best-selling author of ♡❤A Brief History of Time♡❤ embodies the UK's scientific excellence and his visit has promoted Britain as the international partner of choice in science and technology collaboration. 

&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Hawking"&gt;Professor Hawking&lt;/a&gt; met with teenage scientists in an event organised by the British Council at the Bloomfield Museum of Science in Jerusalem on Sunday 10 December. Also on that day, Professor Hawking met the Prime Minister of Israel &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;. 

This evening, December 14, Professor Hawking gave a public lecture to over 1,000 people at the &lt;a href="w%3AHebrew%20University%20of%20Jerusalem"&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; on "The Origin Of the Universe."

In between he met other &lt;a href="w%3AAmyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis"&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)&lt;/a&gt; patients and gave them courage.

He also visited the Jewish/Arab joint village of &lt;a href="w%3AOasis%20of%20Peace"&gt;Neve Shalom/Wāĥat as-Salām&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv%20University"&gt;Tel Aviv University&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWeizmann%20Institute%20of%20Science"&gt;Weizmann Institute of Science&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ABirzeit%20University"&gt;Birzeit University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ARamallah"&gt;Ramallah&lt;/a&gt; (in Palestine).

<h1>Ed Stelmach sworn in as new Alberta premier</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AEd%20Stelmach"&gt;Ed Stelmach&lt;/a&gt; was officially sworn in as the 13th &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Premier of Alberta&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. He was officially sworn in by &lt;a href="w%3ALieutenant-Governors%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Lt. Gov.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANorman%20Kwong"&gt;Norman Kwong&lt;/a&gt; in a public ceremony at the &lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Alberta legislature&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AEdmonton"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt;, Alberta's capital.

"Alberta is in an enviable position," Stelmach said. "We have the means to build a strong province and future."

Born and raised in &lt;a href="w%3ALamont%20County%2C%20Alberta"&gt;Lamont County, Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, the 55-year-old Ukrainian farmer grew up on a farm as the youngest of five children. He raised his four children on the farm his grandfather established in Alberta. Stelmach was elected leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta"&gt;Alberta Progressive Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; on December 3, 2006.

Stelmach replaced former Alberta premier &lt;a href="w%3ARalph%20Klein"&gt;Ralph Klein&lt;/a&gt;, who was Alberta's premier since 1992 and former &lt;a href="w%3AMayor%20of%20Calgary"&gt;Mayor of Calgary&lt;/a&gt;. "I have the greatest respect for my predecessor, Ralph Klein," Stelmach said to the crowd of about 1,000 people. "For all that he has done for me as a member of his team, for the government, and for all Albertans."

"What Albertans can expect from me is to keep my word and to keep an open mind. And I promise an open, inclusive Alberta government that puts Albertans first. A government for all Albertans, both urban and rural, young and old, north and south," he said.

Due to Alberta being a major producer of oil and natural gas, it allowed Klein to get rid of the $23-billion debt.

After the microphone amplified Stelmach blowing his nose he apologized to the chuckling crowd.

High winds and heavy rains have left 4 people dead, and much of the &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle"&gt;Seattle, Washington&lt;/a&gt; area is without electrical power. A number of large trees have been downed and heavy rains have caused minor flooding in many areas of the city. According to first-hand reports as many as 1 million people and several large organizations such as &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; are without power this morning.
Flood, storm, and strong wind watches were in effect last night as a rare thunderstorm system moved into the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Northwest"&gt;Pacific Northwest&lt;/a&gt; region, hitting areas from Seattle to &lt;a href="w%3APortland%2C%20Oregon"&gt;Portland&lt;/a&gt; with high winds and heavy rains. Interstate 5 through Seattle was closed at its intersection with Mercer Street due to standing water. The State Route 520 floating bridge, a major conduit across Lake Washington to the technology-rich Eastside was closed and its drawspan opened to protect it from storm damage well into Friday. Local roads throughout the region were strewn with debris, especially evergreen branches and leaves. Authorities advised people to stay off the roads.

Four deaths were reported in connection with the storm as of Friday. A Seattle woman died in the basement of her home after floodwaters caused the basement door to close and jam shut. Two others died in outlying areas after tall Northwest evergreens fell on their vehicles, and a man in &lt;a href="w%3AGrays%20Harbor%2C%20Washington"&gt;Grays Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, near the Pacific coast, died in his sleep after a tree fell on his mobile home. KOMO news reported a caller saying a 100-foot evergreen had fallen into his house. 

Downed trees and high winds also brought down powerlines throughout Western Washington. Seattle City Light, the municipal electric utility for the city, reported a peak of 175,000 customers without power, most in the north and south ends of the city, as well as the east edge of town and the Green Lake area. 

&lt;a href="w%3APuget%20Sound%20Energy"&gt;Puget Sound Energy&lt;/a&gt;, the electric utility for much of the Seattle metro area, reported 700,000 customers (over 66%) without power, with the area around Seattle the worst hit. PSE, which had already enlisted additional powerline workers from neighboring states, did not send crews out until mid Friday morning due to continued high winds. Estimates for power restoration were anywhere from a few days to over a week. &lt;a href="w%3AIsland%20County%2C%20Washington"&gt;Island County&lt;/a&gt;, at the mouth of Puget Sound, was completely without power.

Schools in Seattle and throughout its suburbs were closed Friday, many due to power outages. The city of &lt;a href="w%3AMercer%20Island%2C%20Washington"&gt;Mercer Island&lt;/a&gt;, connected to the mainland only by Interstate 90, is reportedly inaccessible.

The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20Post-Intelligencer"&gt;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ failed to print due to power failures at the printing facility, which had redundant power feeds from both the Seattle utility as well as PSE. It is the first time in 70 years that the paper has not been printed. The ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASeattle%20Times"&gt;Seattle Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a competing paper under a joint operating agreement, managed to print only 13,000 copies of its regular circulation of over 200,000. The papers located alternate facilities to print a reduced version of their Saturday editions, and their joint Sunday issue was also expected to be reduced.

At Sea-Tac Airport, three terminals were shut down overnight due to the storm. Concourse A and the South Satellite terminal lost power, and a blown-out window caused Concourse C to also close. All terminals were back in working order by midday Friday. Many flights were delayed or cancelled. Likewise, in &lt;a href="w%3AOregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, Portland International Airport reported at least 40 flights cancelled. At Seattle's &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20Field"&gt;Boeing Field&lt;/a&gt;, winds flipped a private plane over, colliding with another plane.

The Seattle Seahawks vs. San Francisco 49ers football game was delayed 15 minutes. A pre-game power surge temporarily took the Qwest Field's video displays offline. The gridiron was plagued by standing water, as the stadium's loudspeakers played "Who'll Stop The Rain?" shortly before kickoff.

Thursday night's storm comes after a previous regional storm in the Seattle area earlier in the week, in which trees in a few Seattle suburbs fell onto roads, powerlines, and two school buses. In those incidents no one was hurt, and there were a few spotty power outages.

This is the second serious storm to hit the Northwest since Thanksgiving, In late November, record-setting snowfall had a similar disabling effect on the region.

&lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; has warned, in a letter to its military, that &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; may test at least "two or three" more nuclear bombs if they feel that they have been "provoked."

"We have to be thoroughly prepared to counter the possibility of a second or third nuclear test by North Korea and a possible hostile act by it in the process of negotiations over its nuclear weapons program," said Kim Jang Soo, the South Korean Defense Minister in a letter addressed to their military. At least 130 commanders of South Korea's military held a special meeting before sending out the letter to the rest of the military personnel.

Six-party talks regarding North Korea's nuclear program are set to resume next week on Monday, December 18, 2006.

The letter also says that North Korea may try to "provoke [the South Korean's]" ahead the six-party talks and Soo has asked the military to be prepared for such an act and also warned that a nuclear strike is not off the table.

"[We have] a clear contingency plan against North Korea's nuclear threat ... by strengthening our monitoring and intelligence, our ability to conduct precision strikes and our nuclear defense," said Soo on Wednesday while reading from a 2007 report on South Korea's top priorities on policy.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Court%20of%20Appeal"&gt;Ontario Court of Appeal&lt;/a&gt; yesterday has &lt;a href="w%3Areaffirmed"&gt;reaffirmed&lt;/a&gt; Ontario's right to negotiate with &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Nations%2040%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Six Nations&lt;/a&gt; protesters on the disputed Douglas Creek Estates, a housing development, which was bought by the province, in &lt;a href="w%3ACaledonia%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Caledonia, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

The decision says that the attorney general and the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;OPP&lt;/a&gt; will decide if new proceedings will be launched against the protesters. The court decision also allows the protesters to continue occuping the land. It said Six Nations protesters are no longer occupying the land illegally because the Ontario government now owns the land and will let protesters continue, and that talks with both levels of government have "restored a measure of peace to the community."

"Ontario is content to permit the peaceful occupation of its property," the decision reads. "It has the right to do so. As a property owner it has the right to use its own land as it sees fit."

Caledonia Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMarie%20Trainer"&gt;Marie Trainer&lt;/a&gt; said the decision shows that aboriginals are above the law. Mayor Trainer also said that she hoped the court of appeal would upheld a lower court order to halt negotiations with the province and federal government until protesters cleared the disputed land.

"It shows two rules of law -- you and I couldn't stay there illegally but they [the aboriginals] apparently can. That's what's irritating for everyone," Trainer said. "It's frustrating, especially when it's illegal."

Premier &lt;a href="w%3ADalton%20McGuinty"&gt;Dalton McGuinty&lt;/a&gt; said he was glad that the court reaffirmed the province's right to continue talks with protesters. He also added that the dispute is a federal issue.

"We are now waiting for the federal government to bring a substantive proposal to the table that would involve a number of aspects related to this land claim, including the use of this specific parcel," McGuinty said.

The &lt;a href="w%3ACaledonia%20land%20dispute"&gt;Caledonia land dispute&lt;/a&gt; has been going on since February 28 and still has not been resolved. The native protesters occupied the Douglas Creek Estates, southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the property belongs to them.

<h1>Allegations New Zealand prison guards accept bribes from prisoners</h1>

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Department%20of%20Corrections"&gt;New Zealand Department of Corrections&lt;/a&gt; is currently investigating allegations at the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20Correctional%20Facilities%20in%20New%20Zealand%23Rimutaka%20Prison"&gt;Rimutaka prison&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. The prison guards have allegedly accepted monetary bribes from prisoners in exchange for drugs and cellphones.

Two former officers, Ingrid and Mark Rijniers, have handed over a collection of documents on their encounters while working at Rimutaka prison. The pair, who were transferred from &lt;a href="w%3AHolland"&gt;Holland&lt;/a&gt;, claim that Rimutaka prison is run by gang members who dominate the prison guards. They also claim that if the gang members don't get what they want they will intimidate and threaten the guards with their lives. However, Ingrid Rijniers is refusing to co-operate with the department because they refused to give her the money to return to Holland.

The New Zealand Corrections Department says it is taking these claims seriously but has not yet found sufficient evidence to back up the claims.

&lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Power"&gt;Simon Power&lt;/a&gt;, justice and corrections spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National party&lt;/a&gt;, said that the allegations are appalling and reflect heavily on the Corrections Department. Mr Powers said that Barry Matthews, chief executive of the Department of Corrections, does not know what is happening in his prisons. "That means the Minister, &lt;a href="w%3ADamien%20O%27Connor"&gt;Damien O'Connor&lt;/a&gt;, will be equally clueless."

Twelve percent of 1,043 prisoners who were tested for drugs from the start of this year until June, tested positive for drugs. Most of the drugs taken was marijuana while fourteen tested positive for "P". In addition, a teenage prisoner, Liam Ashley, was recently strangled to death in a prison van by a much older adult prisoner. Mr Power said that with all these new claims emerging, Mr O'Conner should resign as the minister of corrections.

&lt;a href="w%3AHewlett-Packard"&gt;Hewlett-Packard&lt;/a&gt; (HP), the world's largest information technology corporation, is in trouble in France due to alleged &lt;a href="w%3AMonopoly"&gt;monopolist&lt;/a&gt; behavior. 

In France and abroad, the corporation commonly bundles its PCs with &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AWindows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aoperating%20system"&gt;operating system&lt;/a&gt;, without giving the consumer the choice of an alternative operating system, such as the
'free' operating system &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt;. 

Union Fédérale des Consommateurs-Que Choisir, a French consumer group, along with two French retailers, sued HP, alleging that it was violating a French law that prohibits linking the functionality of a product to another product. The group insisted:
The legal affairs director of HP France responded by stating that a PC without Microsoft Windows is not a product because it does not work. 

In the meantime, Microsoft is in trouble in Europe due to the anti-trust laws of the &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. On July 12, 2006, EU announced a 280.5 million euro fine against Microsoft and threatened new penalties of 3 million euros ($3.82 million) a day beginning July 31.

<h1>Toronto team-led research on Type 1 Diabetes 'groundbreaking'</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Toronto%20team-led%20research%20on%20Type%201%20Diabetes%20%27groundbreaking%27&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A Toronto team of scientists have discovered a trigger for &lt;a href="w%3ADiabetes%20mellitus%20type%201"&gt;Type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, a breakthrough that could lead to the overall prevention of the common disease.

The team discovered that abnormal nerve endings in the &lt;a href="w%3Apancreas"&gt;pancreas'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Ainsulin"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;-producing cells (Islets of Langerhan) initiated a chain reaction that caused Type 1 diabetes in lab mice. However, when they removed the nerve cells, the mice did not develop the disorder.

According to Dr. Hans Michael Dosch, a senior scientist at &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHospital%20for%20Sick%20Children"&gt;Hospital for Sick Children&lt;/a&gt; and the study's lead investigator, this indicates the diabetes may be a disease of the nervous system, not just an autoimmune disease.

Traditionally, research has primarily been concentrated on the immune system and the reasons why it attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, which are grouped in islets.

But Dosch, working alongside colleagues at Sick Kids, the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Calgary"&gt;University of Calgary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt; and Maine's Jackson Laboratory, identified a control circuit between islet cells and their associated sensory nerves.

Disruption of this circuit led to inflammation around the islets and eventually to their destruction. Without these cells, the mice were unable to produce insulin.

"This control circuit is the real cause of diabetes," Dosch said.

Experts agree the findings, reported yesterday in the journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACell%20%28journal%29"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, will dramatically change the foundations of diabetes research.

"It really is a breakthrough for the diabetes community," said Pam Ohashi, a professor of immunology at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Toronto"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt; and a senior scientist at the Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research.

Dosch plans to move quickly in transferring his tests on lab mice to human subjects. He plans to launch a clinical trial in January to figure out if human patients who have a high risk of Type 1 diabetes have the same sensory nerve abnormalities displayed by the mice.

"If they do, then we have fantastic new therapeutic strategies," said Dosch, who is also a professor of pediatrics and immunology at U of T (University of Toronto).

Michelle Wing knows the toll diabetes takes on a family. Her 8-year-old daughter Marielle has the disorder, and her two young sons, ages 4 and 18 months, are considered high risk for developing it. Diabetes runs every aspect of their lives, she said, explaining how the family is bound by an extensive and relentless routine of blood tests, insulin injections and strict meal times. Dosch plans to invite the family to participate in the clinical trial.

Wing said she was moved to tears when she learned that researchers may have found a way to one day prevent Type 1 diabetes.

"Seeing what Marielle goes through every day of her life, to prevent other children from going through that," Wing said. "To prevent other parents in the middle of the night worrying their child will go into a diabetic coma," she mused. "It's fantastic that there could be a prevention of this for other children."

More than 200,000 Canadians suffer from Type 1 diabetes, which mostly develops in childhood or in the teen years. It is not to be confused with the more common &lt;a href="w%3AType%202%20diabetes"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, where the body doesn't make enough insulin or use the existing insulin efficiently.

Insulin is a hormone produced by the islet cells that stabilizes blood sugar levels in the body. Sufferers of Type 1 diabetes have to take regimented daily insulin injections and continuously monitor their blood sugars. The injections are not a cure, and many patients still develop side-effects of the disease like stroke, blindness, heart attack, and kidney failure.

More research will be put in motion quickly to see if the same treatment applied to the lab mice will be effective in humans for preventing Type 1 diabetes, or better still, if it will shed new light on treatment methods for Type 2 sufferers, according to Dosch.

Also, in a surprising twist, the researchers also found that injecting substance P, a chemical secreted by nerve cells, into the mice who had damaged or inflamed islet cells, not only eliminated the inflammation process, but reversed it.

"The blood glucose normalizes overnight and it stays low for weeks to months — this is with a single shot," Dosch said.

"We now have 4-month-old mice that are non-diabetic that used to be diabetic," he added.
Dr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at &lt;a href="w%3ADalhousie%20University"&gt;Dalhousie University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AHalifax%20Regional%20Municipality"&gt;Halifax, Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; and chair of the clinical and scientific division of the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Diabetes%20Association"&gt;Canadian Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt; cautioned that the research is still in its early days. Like some other experts, he is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured, noting that these findings have no relevance to people who already have Type 1 diabetes.

"We have a whole new target for therapy," he said. "It's always been the pancreas or the immune system. Now we have a new player."

Still, he knows that the discovery of nerves controlling pancreatic functions is a major step towards developing more efficient treatment for the millions affected worldwide.

After finding out that he will not have to service a troublesome brand of British-made planes, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARJ-100"&gt;RJ-100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , at the airport, Şükrü Can, the manager of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATurkish%20Airlines"&gt;Turkish Airlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; maintenance service, decided to slaughter a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acamel"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; right on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atarmac"&gt;tarmac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Istanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAtaturk%20Airport"&gt;Ataturk Airport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Airport manager Vedat Muftuoglu was quoted to say:
Turkish minister of transportation Binali Yildirim has characterized the sacrifice an "example of tactless behavior."

After the managerial staff at the airport heard about the incident, Can's sacrifice claimed his job. 

Animal slaughter is not a rare incident in Turkey. Sheep and other animals are frequently slaughtered, especially during the Islamic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEid%20ul-Adha"&gt;Sacrifice Feast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . However sacrificing a camel is highly unusual in Turkey, and not a common practice.

&lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Gilchrist"&gt;Adam Gilchrist&lt;/a&gt; has compiled the second fastest &lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test match&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACentury%20%28cricket%29"&gt;century&lt;/a&gt; in history during the second innings of the third &lt;a href="w%3A2006-07%20Ashes%20series"&gt;2006-07 Ashes Test match&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AWACA%20Ground"&gt;WACA ground&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; reached 100 runs in 57 balls, second only to &lt;a href="w%3ACaribbean"&gt;West Indian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AViv%20Richards"&gt;Viv Richards&lt;/a&gt;. Richards scored his record century off 56 balls back in the 1985-86 series against England, in the Caribbean city of &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20John%27s%2C%20Antigua%20and%20Barbuda"&gt;St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda&lt;/a&gt;.

The now-third fastest century was off 67 balls by fellow Australian &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Gregory"&gt;Jack Gregory&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; 85 years ago.

Gilchrist reached his half-century off 40 deliveries, and then proceeded to quicken the scoring rate, including hitting English left-arm orthodox &lt;a href="w%3ASpin%20bowling"&gt;spinner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMonty%20Panesar"&gt;Monty Panesar&lt;/a&gt; for 24 runs in one over - a record for the most runs scored in one &lt;a href="w%3AOver%20%28cricket%29"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; in an &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Ashes"&gt;Ashes&lt;/a&gt; test.

With centuries from compatriots &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hussey"&gt;Michael Hussey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Clarke%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Michael Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, and large contributions from &lt;a href="w%3AMatthew%20Hayden"&gt;Matthew Hayden&lt;/a&gt; (92) and &lt;a href="w%3ARicky%20Ponting"&gt;Ricky Ponting&lt;/a&gt; (75), Australia declared their innings late on day three at 5-527, a lead of 556. 

England require 557 to win, or need to bat for two-and-a-bit days to salvage a draw; a win to Australia will give the Ashes back to Australia after they lost them in England &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Ashes%20series"&gt;during 2005&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Melbourne Victory clinch A-League premiership</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Victory"&gt;Melbourne Victory&lt;/a&gt; has won the &lt;a href="w%3AA-League%202006-07"&gt;2006-07 A-League&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20%28soccer%29"&gt;football (soccer)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20A-League%20champions%23A-League%20Premiers"&gt;premiership&lt;/a&gt; after defeating &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Knights%20FC"&gt;New Zealand Knights&lt;/a&gt; 4-0 at &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20Park%20Stadium"&gt;Olympic Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;.

The win takes Melbourne to 41 points, 13 ahead of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20FC"&gt;Sydney FC&lt;/a&gt; in second place, with only four games remaining in the regular season. This makes it mathematically impossible for the Victory to be caught.

The regular season consists of 21 home-and-away rounds, with each team playing each other team three times. Each match sees the winning team awarded three competition points, or in the case of a draw, the teams receive one point each. The club at the top of the ladder - with the most points - is crowned &lt;a href="w%3AA-League"&gt;A-League&lt;/a&gt; premiers, whilst the winner of the &lt;a href="w%3AA-League%23Finals%20series"&gt;Grand Final&lt;/a&gt; is crownded &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20A-League%20champions%23A-League%20Champions"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;. 

Melbourne Victory have also led the competition in crowd numbers during the 2006-07 season, with an average attendance of 26,512 at the end of Round 17 - 10,698 more than the next-highest, &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20Roar%20FC"&gt;Queensland Roar&lt;/a&gt;. The Victory's attendance of 50,333 at &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra%20Dome"&gt;Telstra Dome&lt;/a&gt; when they played Sydney FC on December 10, 2006 set a new national record for a domestic football (soccer) match in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

Victory's premiership also gives them a spot in the &lt;a href="w%3AAFC%20Champions%20League"&gt;AFC Champions League&lt;/a&gt;, the premier club tournament for &lt;a href="w%3AAsian%20Football%20Confederation"&gt;Asian Football Confederation&lt;/a&gt; countries. &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20Federation%20Australia"&gt;Football Federation Australia&lt;/a&gt; become a member of the AFC in January 2006, after moving from the &lt;a href="w%3AOceania%20Football%20Confederation"&gt;Oceania Football Confederation&lt;/a&gt; on January 1, 2006.

Melbourne have been the runaway leaders of the 2006-07 competition, a huge improvement on the seventh-placed finish that they achieved during the &lt;a href="w%3AA-League%202005-06"&gt;2005-06 season&lt;/a&gt;. Their &lt;a href="w%3AStriker"&gt;striking&lt;/a&gt; combination of &lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Allsopp"&gt;Danny Allsopp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20national%20football%20%28soccer%29%20team"&gt;"Socceroo"&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArchie%20Thompson"&gt;Archive Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazilian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHelbert%20Frederico%20Carreiro%20da%20Silva"&gt;Fred&lt;/a&gt; has yielded more goals than any other this campaign.

&lt;a href="w%3AFlorida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; Governor &lt;a href="w%3AJeb%20Bush"&gt;Jeb Bush&lt;/a&gt; has halted signing all execution warrants in the state after a medical examiner revealed an error had occurred in a &lt;a href="w%3ALethal%20injection"&gt;lethal injection&lt;/a&gt; recently.

Doctor William Hamilton, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, has released a statement saying the execution of prisoner Angel Nieves Díaz, from &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;, took 34 minutes and required a second dose of lethal chemicals. This was caused by the error in that the needles were inserted straight through his &lt;a href="w%3AVein"&gt;veins&lt;/a&gt; and into the flesh in his arms, causing the chemicals to leak out.

The 34 minute time frame is twice as long as usual, however Dr. Hamilton refuses to comment whether Diaz died painfully. He stated ♡❤"I am going to defer answers about pain and suffering until the autopsy is complete,"♡❤ noting that the results were preliminary.

However, Doctor J. Kent Garman, an emeritus professor of anesthesia at the &lt;a href="w%3AStanford%20University"&gt;Stanford School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, did comment on the possible pain endured, saying ♡❤"[missing a vein when administering would cause] both psychological and physical discomfort, probably pretty severe."♡❤

Dr. Jonathan Groner, an &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; surgeon who has studied and written extensively about lethal injection, also commented, saying Díaz's execution ♡❤"amounts to death by torture."♡❤

Jeb Bush has established a commission to report on the state's lethal injection process after the circumstances of Diaz's case, and he suspended the signing of any more death warrants until the commission panel completes its final report, scheduled in March 2007.

Only a matter of hours later, a federal judge ruled that the lethal injection system in &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; may violate the &lt;a href="w%3AEighth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Eighth Amendment&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;United States Constitution&lt;/a&gt; which prohibits "&lt;a href="w%3Acruel%20and%20unusual%20punishment"&gt;cruel and unusual punishment&lt;/a&gt;."

The chemicals used in Florida, California and 35 other US states are all slightly different, but follow a general formation, as follows:-
<ul>
BULLET::::- The first is a &lt;a href="w%3ABarbiturate"&gt;barbiturate&lt;/a&gt; to force the person into a state of unconsciousness
BULLET::::- The second is a paralyzing agent that makes the person unable to speak, move or breathe
BULLET::::- The third is &lt;a href="w%3APotassium%20chloride"&gt;potassium chloride&lt;/a&gt;, which stops the heart of the person.

Two men were arrested today by the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;Ontario Provincial Police&lt;/a&gt; (OPP) at a Caledonia rally at about 12:00 p.m. ET after entering the disputed land in &lt;a href="w%3ACaledonia%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Caledonia, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; waving &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Canada"&gt;Canadian flags&lt;/a&gt;. One was &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20McHale"&gt;Gary McHale&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond%20Hill%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Richmond Hill, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; man who entered the occupied land in Caledonia, Ontario to organize a rally against the ongoing aboriginal occupation. Mark Vandermaas of &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20Ontario"&gt;London, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; was also arrested. Vandermaas was forced to the ground by police officers, who ripped the flag out of his hand when he crossed the police line. There were approximately 100 protesters rallying with McHale.

According to news reports, McHale intended to put the Canadian flag across the street from DCE (Douglas Creek Estates) where the aboriginal occupation has been ongoing for 10 months. Back in late October the aboriginals had already put up their flags across from the DCE property and the OPP made no attempt to stop them. However, on Dec. 2 residents of Caledonia attempted to put up Canadian flags with Yellow ribbons in various areas in Caledonia. When they tried to put up a Canadian Flag across from DCE property the OPP sent in 100 officers to stop them.

Mr. McHale called for people to gather on Dec. 16 to try to put up Canadian Flags across from DCE property on the same hydro poles that Natives already had put up their flags. Mr. McHale stated, "I have asked 2 dozen OPP officers why it is legal to have a Native Flag up along the highway but illegal for a Canadian Flag to be up and I have never received an answer."

"The OPP set up a line just about a hundred yards away from that site and several people were able to cross that line. They got through a farmer's field on far left side of where I'm standing here," said CTV reporter Joel Bowey. "We're hearing that Mr. McHale got in the middle of the street and put a flag down there, and that's when he and the other man from London, Ont. were arrested. So far all we know is that those two men have been arrested and there are no other arrests at this point."

The OPP said the men were arrested for "breaking the peace" and noted that it is not a criminal offence. Police had warned them about crossing into the disputed land before.

"I've now said that Mr. McHale's plans were counterproductive and potentially dangerous to what we've been trying to do there, and that is to reach a peaceful settlement," said &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Ramsay"&gt;David Ramsay&lt;/a&gt;, Ontario's &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Aboriginal%20Affairs"&gt;minister of aboriginal affairs&lt;/a&gt;. "I've twice now offered Mr. McHale the opportunity to protest at &lt;a href="w%3AQueen%27s%20Park%2C%20Toronto"&gt;Queen's Park&lt;/a&gt; [the site of the &lt;a href="w%3ALegislative%20Assembly%20of%20Ontario"&gt;Legislative Assembly of Ontario&lt;/a&gt; building]. In fact, I said I would sponsor his rally and set up a platform and a microphone, a PA system for him."

Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMarie%20Trainer"&gt;Marie Trainer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AHaldimand%20County%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Haldimand County&lt;/a&gt;, were Caledonia is located, said: "The next meeting or two will be wasted on frivolous stuff again instead of getting down to business." Trainer also says that he should not be entering the town and did not specify what side she is on or if she is not taking any side.

This was not the first time Gary McHale entered the disputed land. On October 15, 2006, McHale with approximately 2000 (as reported by local newspapers) participants rallied in Caledonia, but the OPP blocked the entrance to the occupied site.

"Our fight is not with the natives, we're just trying to be equal in a democratic Canada," said Christine McHale, wife of Gary McHale.

"When a native commits a serious crime or any crime, they stand by and watch the crime take place and will not do anything to stop the crime. When a resident does the simplest thing, even putting up a Canadian flag or drinking a coffee in a lawn chair across some magic line, they will send in scores of officers to arrest the person," said Gary McHale. "We have to take a stand and say to police forces that there is one set of laws for all citizens." 

"Police have one set of policies for natives and another set of policies for non-natives," he said before the rally. "It's against our Charter of Rights, that clearly says there's not to be any discriminations based on their religion, beliefs, race or their skin colour."

McHale has been long critical of the Ontario Provincial Police over the land claim saying that they treat aboriginals differently. McHale and his wife operate a website called &lt;a href="http%3A//www.caledoniawakeupcall.com"&gt;Caledonia Wake Up Call.com&lt;/a&gt;, were they detail what they describe as police bias.

&lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; winner Professor &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20J.%20Crutzen"&gt;Paul J. Crutzen&lt;/a&gt; has stated he has data to support his controversial claim that injecting &lt;a href="w%3ASulfur"&gt;sulfur&lt;/a&gt; into the atmosphere would negate the &lt;a href="w%3AGreenhouse%20effect"&gt;greenhouse effect&lt;/a&gt;.

The data is intended to quiet critics of the theory he first discussed in the scientific journal ♡❤Climatic Change♡❤ in August, 2006.

The 1995 Nobel Prize winner in &lt;a href="w%3AChemistry"&gt;chemistry&lt;/a&gt; stated ♡❤"Our calculations using the best models available have shown that injecting 1 million tonnes of sulfur a year would cool down the climate so the greenhouse effect is wiped out."♡❤

The theory uses the idea that an added layer of sulfates in the &lt;a href="w%3AStratosphere"&gt;stratosphere&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 16 kilometres above the earth, would reflect sunlight back into space and reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.

Critics have shown that the earth has struggled for decades to reduce sulfur pollution, and how it is a component of &lt;a href="w%3AAcid%20rain"&gt;acid rain&lt;/a&gt; that kills plantlife and animals.

A large-scale experiment would be impossible to conduct, however scientists have noticed that massive &lt;a href="w%3AVolcano"&gt;volcanic&lt;/a&gt; eruptions have had similar effects on the earth. The 1991 eruption of &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Pinatubo"&gt;Mount Pinatubo&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt; lowered temperatures around the world for two years, according to data taken at the time.

Crutzen resparked discussion on the topic, a theory which has been dismissed up until now as dangerous. ♡❤"Until August this was a taboo issue. But the paper I published really set off some movement in this area. It never hit the level of seriousness which it has taken in the past months,"♡❤ Crutzen said.

Environmental groups are skeptical but agree the idea should be investigated. ♡❤"This idea should be examined and as a last resort it can buy us a few decades,"♡❤ said Steve Sawyer, a policy adviser for &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace International&lt;/a&gt;.

On the 16th of December, 35 years ago, 90,000 Pakistani troops deployed in Bangladesh surrendered unconditionally following a successful campaign by Indian troops and the guerilla outfit &lt;a href="w%3AMukti%20Bahini"&gt;Mukti Bahini&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href="w%3AYahya%20Khan"&gt;Yahya Khan&lt;/a&gt; regime in East Pakistan. 

&lt;a href="w%3ADefence%20Minister"&gt;Defence Minister&lt;/a&gt; A. K Antony, along with the three Service Chiefs laid wreaths at the Eternal Flame at India Gate, in honour of the country's matyrs. A programme presented by the National Cadet Corps was followed by a Tri-Service Band performance at the National Stadium. 

General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Army's Sringar-based 15 Corps, Lt. Gen. A S Sekhon paid tribute to India's war-heroes saying, "Vijay Diwas is dedicated to the memory of soldiers who laid down their lives for the country since independence and is an echo of remembering the war martyrs." He also commended the 1971 operation as one the Indian military's most magnificent achievements.

Set to hit newstands in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, the annual news feature by &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20%28magazine%29"&gt;TIME magazine&lt;/a&gt; pictures on its glossy front page an Apple iMac-styled computer keyboard and monitor with a reflective monitor surface that reflects &lt;u&gt;YOU&lt;/u&gt; as the most influential ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APerson%20of%20the%20Year"&gt;Person of the Year&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, for "community and collaboration on a scale never seen before." 

"For seizing the reins of the global media, for founding and framing the new digital democracy, for working for nothing and beating the pros at their own game, Time's Person of the Year for 2006 is you," &lt;a href="w%3ALev%20Grossman"&gt;Lev Grossman&lt;/a&gt;, Time's technology writer, wrote. The magazine claims that those who contribute content to the web are the ones driving the information age, instead of mainstream media.

"It's about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change the way the world changes," said Grossman.

Magazine editor &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Stengel"&gt;Richard Stengel&lt;/a&gt; said, "If you choose an individual, you have to justify how that person affected millions of people. But if you choose millions of people, you don’t have to justify it to anyone.”

26 “People Who Mattered” are listed in the magazine, ranging from &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;'s president &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Jong%20Il"&gt;Kim Jong Il&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Stengel, if the magazine had to choose an individual the choice was likely to have been &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s president &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;.

Stengel however seemed uneasy about naming Ahmadinejad. “It just felt to me a little off selecting him,” said Time's editor.

There has been a "Time Person of the Year" since 1927 and the special issue has become a catalyst for speculation every year. In the past there have been controversies with &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Hitler"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt; named in 1938 and &lt;a href="w%3AAyatollah%20Khomeini"&gt;Ayatollah Khomeini&lt;/a&gt; named in 1979. According to the magazine, the person of the year are those who affected the news and our lives both positively and negatively over the past year.

It is not the first time the magazine has departed from naming an actual person as Person of the Year. In 1966 the magazine named people under 25, in 1975 it named American women, and in 1982 it named the computer.

<h1>Wikinews interviews Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikinews%20interviews%20Florence%20Devouard%2C%20chair%20of%20the%20Wikimedia%20Foundation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Florence Devouard has been a contributor to the French Wikipedia since 2002. In October, 2006, she was nominated to be the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, which manages and hosts several popular wikis, including Wikipedia, a multilingual, collaboratively-written, free encyclopedia. She is also a member of the Wikimedia Foundation's Communications Committee, and is one of four community representatives to the board.

<h3>Questions</h3>

♡❤♡&lt;u&gt;Wikinews&lt;/u&gt;:♡❤♡ What were you thinking when Jimmy nominated you to become the new Chair?

&lt;u&gt;Florence Devouard&lt;/u&gt;: It was not really a surprise. It had been discussed already for a while, so I had time to collect my thoughts already as to what I intended to do as a chair, thoughts I gave on the Foundation mailing list a few days later. When Jimbo nominated me chair, my thoughts were mostly oriented toward the desire that the change happens smoothly, with no wrong perception of the community or in the press. The fact I became chair is first the sign the organisation is maturing.

This said, it is *difficult* to become the chair after Jimbo. Not internally, as all board members were in agreement and happy with the switch. Jimbo is also very helpful. The main difficulty is rather due to the perception from outside parties that Jimbo still is the chair, or if they are informed he is no more, with their belief he is still in charge anyway. It will take time :-)

♡❤♡&lt;u&gt;WN&lt;/u&gt;:♡❤♡ What do you consider your greatest achievement on the Wikimedia projects themselves?

&lt;u&gt;FD&lt;/u&gt;: Very difficult to say. I was probably an average editor on the French and English wikipedia. My achievement is probably rather in my involvement in community building. When I joined Wikipedia, the project was essentially monolingual, and it took a lot of dedication to really make it multilingual, with recognition of the importance of cultural diversity. As an admin on several projects, steward for over 3 years now, meta-oriented person, I was hopefully one of these "glue people" who helped to develop the global side of our projects.

♡❤♡&lt;u&gt;WN&lt;/u&gt;:♡❤♡ When did you first join the Wikimedia projects?

&lt;u&gt;FD&lt;/u&gt;: February 2002 as an anonymous on the English wikipedia. I later created my pseudonyme, Anthere, and joined the embryo of French community (less than 10 people) in may 2002. 

♡❤♡&lt;u&gt;WN&lt;/u&gt;:♡❤♡ What is your view on the annual 'pranking' of Wikipedia on April 1st?

&lt;u&gt;FD&lt;/u&gt;: I... never participated to the annual pranking of the English Wikipedia on April 1st? However, I was more than once the author of "jokes" which were sometimes appreciated, sometimes not so much appreciated... I especially loved changing the logo. I created false articles. And did some moves I will not publicly revealed as not so proud of them. But overall, I like fun; the fun may stay within reasonable limits of course, and April joke did not always...

♡❤♡&lt;u&gt;WN&lt;/u&gt;:♡❤♡ Wikimedia Commons recently reached 1 million files. What is your impression of this?

&lt;u&gt;FD&lt;/u&gt;: Fabulous job ! I receive more and more phone calls of people willing to use an image from the Commons, which is for me a good measure of this site success. On another note, this project is specifically dear to my heart, because it is one where all languages mix. It is the true Babel Tower (which Wikipedia is not), where people work together, sometimes not sharing even one language. The current state is fabulous. And there is much left to do.

♡❤♡&lt;u&gt;WN&lt;/u&gt;:♡❤♡ If you could describe yourself in one word, what would it be, and why?

&lt;u&gt;FD&lt;/u&gt;: I often sign "ant", mostly because of a wiki I participated to several
years ago, where providing a real name was mandatory; I cheated, and called myself AntHere. The ant is a social insect. The ant is very industrious. The ant is never alone, it dies if alone. The ant lives with others in an anthill. And the head of the anthill is a Queen :-) (the Queen essentially being a mother actually).

So, Anthere or AntHere is just THE word.

♡❤♡&lt;u&gt;WN&lt;/u&gt;:♡❤♡ Considering past donations, and the rate we are going at now, do you think we will meet our goal by the deadiline of our current fundraiser?

&lt;u&gt;FD&lt;/u&gt;: That is a very good question. I do not know. I can only hope, because the more money we'll make, the more we'll be able to make the suitable investments for the future of the projects. According to our Executive Director, Brad Patrick, our basic operations right now, cost around 75 000 dollars per month. This does not count the investments in hardware, which should be around $1,670,000 before June, nor the additional costs in terms of hosting, and bandwidth, due to the ever growing traffic. Add to this the much delayed need to hire more staff and project specific expenses. An insufficient fundraiser at this point would mean we'll have to organise a new one in the next few months; However, we are currently exploring other ways to collect money, now possible thanks to the completed audit. So let's be optimistic.

♡❤♡&lt;u&gt;WN&lt;/u&gt;:♡❤♡ Wikinews gives people credentials (excuse my spelling) which allow us to report in the field. I, myself am not accredited, but what's your view on this? 

&lt;u&gt;FD&lt;/u&gt;: I understood this was extremely helpful to approach candidates for interviews and participate to special events. I trust the Wikinews community to be careful in giving these credentials.

♡❤♡&lt;u&gt;WN&lt;/u&gt;:♡❤♡ If you were explaining Wikipedia to someone who has never heard of Wikipedia (I know, impossible), what would you say?

&lt;u&gt;FD&lt;/u&gt;: In the shortest way, an encyclopedia, which aims to bring knowledge to the largest number of people on Earth. Which means 1) lower the financial barrier to access (it's free of charge), 2) lower the linguistic barrier (we work in over 200 languages), 3) lower the barrier of use (it is under a free licence which allow anyone to reuse the content). On top, an oddity, it is a collective work, with open access and multiauthoring.

&lt;a href="w%3ARFID"&gt;RFID&lt;/a&gt; chips, the major component of &lt;a href="w%3ABiometric%20passport"&gt;e-passports&lt;/a&gt;, emit radio signals that can be read at a short distance by an electronic reader. 

Lukas Grunwald and Christian Bottger realised that they could clone an identical and undetectable e-passport. They downloaded the data from their own &lt;a href="w%3Apassport"&gt;passport&lt;/a&gt; using an RFID reader (available from &lt;a href="w%3AeBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;) and then onto a blank chip thanks to a software they have developed, called &lt;a href="w%3ARFDump"&gt;RFdump&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so, they were able to clone an e-passport in less than five minutes. 

Ironically, a spokesman from the UK Home Office said: 
A European Union funded network of IT security experts has come out against the e-passport scheme. The experts said that it is not too late to roll back and rethink the ePassport.

Wikinews previously reported that Turkey, where there seems to be no discussion about the controversies surrounding RFID chips, is switching to e-passports towards the middle of next year.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has reclaimed &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Ashes"&gt;The Ashes&lt;/a&gt; after defeating &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; in the third &lt;a href="w%3A2006-07%20Ashes%20series"&gt;2006-07 Ashes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATest%20cricket"&gt;Test match&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The win gives Australia an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the five-match series. 

Australia lost The Ashes for the first time since 1987 in the &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Ashes%20series"&gt;2005 Ashes series&lt;/a&gt;, when England won the series 2-1, with the other two tests drawn.

Australia won the toss and batted first on the &lt;a href="w%3AWACA%20Ground"&gt;WACA ground&lt;/a&gt; wicket. The English bowling dominated, dismissing Australia for 244 off 71 overs. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hussey"&gt;Michael Hussey&lt;/a&gt; was the only Australian to build an innings, scoring an unbeaten 74. Recalled left-arm orthodox &lt;a href="w%3ASpin%20bowling"&gt;spinner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMonty%20Panesar"&gt;Monty Panesar&lt;/a&gt; claimed 5-92, and teammate &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Harmison"&gt;Stephen Harmison&lt;/a&gt; took four wickets. 

England went in to bat late on day one, and lost two wickets for 51 runs before the close of play. On the resumption of play on day two, the wickets continued to fall, and they were eventually bowled out for 215. &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Pietersen"&gt;Kevin Pietersen&lt;/a&gt; made 70 for the visitors, whilst &lt;a href="w%3AStuart%20Clark"&gt;Stuart Clark&lt;/a&gt; took 3-49 for the home team.

The second innings of Australia was a vast improvement. They lost one wicket before stumps on day two, and resumed at 1-119 on day three. They proceeded to dominate England in 40&lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;+ temperatures, with three Australians - &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Clarke%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Michael Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Hussey"&gt;Michael Hussey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Gilchrist"&gt;Adam Gilchrist&lt;/a&gt; - scoring centuries. Gilchrist's century was the second-fastest in history, reaching 100 in 57 deliveries. Australia declared their innings closed late on day three at 5-527.

England required 557 to win in their second innings, or needed to bat for two-and-a-bit days to salvage a draw and keep the 2006-07 series alive. They were 1-18 by the close of play on day three. On day four, English batsman &lt;a href="w%3AAlastair%20Cook"&gt;Alastair Cook&lt;/a&gt; scored his first Ashes test century, stalling Australia's roll towards victory. He was assisted by teammate &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Bell%20%28cricketer%29"&gt;Ian Bell&lt;/a&gt;, who made 87.

Cook was dismissed by paceman &lt;a href="w%3AGlenn%20McGrath"&gt;Glenn McGrath&lt;/a&gt; on 116 in the third last over of day four, sparking an English batting collapse; the visitors were 5-265 at stumps on day four, after losing three quick wickets. Day five saw England bat well for an hour, before collapsing after losing captain &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Flintoff"&gt;Andrew Flintoff&lt;/a&gt; to be all out for 350 two balls after lunch. &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Warne"&gt;Shane Warne&lt;/a&gt; finished with 4-123 in the second innings, whilst Pietersen was unbeaten on 59.

Michael Hussey was named Man of the Match for his two innings of 74 not out and 103.

The fourth test will begin on &lt;a href="w%3ABoxing%20Day"&gt;Boxing Day&lt;/a&gt; (December 26) at the &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Cricket%20Ground"&gt;Melbourne Cricket Ground&lt;/a&gt;. Warne requires just one wicket to be the first bowler in history to reach 700 Test wickets.

<h1>Minimum wage to be increased in New Zealand</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Minimum%20wage%20to%20be%20increased%20in%20New%20Zealand&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The minimum wage in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; will be increased by 9.8% on 1 April, 2007, the biggest increase in New Zealand for seven years.

The announcement was made today by Labour minister, &lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Dyson"&gt;Ruth Dyson&lt;/a&gt;, and will make the current minimum wage for workers over 18-years NZ$11.25 per hour, an increase $1.00 from the current wage of $10.25. Youth workers and youth workers being trained aged 16-years and 17-years will see an increase of $0.80 to $9.00, remaining at 80% of the adult minimum wage.

Ms Dyson said: "The boost in the minimum wage will ensure that lower paid workers share the benefits of economic growth, encourage people to join the workforce and provide protection for some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable workers."

The &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Aotearoa%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has welcomed the announcement. &lt;a href="w%3ASue%20Bradford"&gt;Sue Bradford&lt;/a&gt;, spokesperson for the Greens' Industrial Relations, said: "There is no better time than during a strong economy for New Zealand to boost the current poverty level minimum wages."

Ms Bradford said: "The rise announced today is not overly generous. When cost of living adjustments are taken into account, the $12 an hour minimum wage level called for by the Greens during the 2005 election campaign, has now moved to just over $13 per hour. If one applied the European Union social standard - which sets the minimum wage at two thirds of the average wage - we would be setting New Zealand's minimum wage at $13.66."

However HealthCare Providers New Zealand is criticising the wage increases as currently the difference in minimum wage and the average caregiver wage rate is 10% ($10.25 and $11.33 respectively). Martin Taylor, chief executive officer, said: "If more funding is not made available then the government is agreeing to caregiving becoming a minimum wage occupation."

Mr Taylor said: "We believe caregiving is an important job that deserves better wages, but you cannot pay out more than you are funded for. This sector is depended on government funding and we have already been waiting 9 months for DHBs to agree to our funding claim for the last minimum wage increase."

The government believes that the change will benefit 110,000 adults of which the majority are woman, and 9,200 youth workers.

"With four months till the changes come into effect, businesses will have time to prepare. The date of 1 April was chosen to reduce compliance costs for businesses as it will coincide with the implementation date of four weeks’ annual holidays," Ms Dyson said.

The government wishes that by the end of 2008 they will be able to increase the minimum wage of adults to at least $12.00 per hour, however the government will be keeping a close eye on the economy.

Ex- &lt;a href="w%3AFormula%20One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;a href="w%3AClay%20Regazzoni"&gt;Clay Regazzoni&lt;/a&gt; has died after being involved in a road accident with a lorry. He was sixty seven.

Regazzoni was victorious five times during his F1 career, most notably his last win at the &lt;a href="w%3A1979%20British%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;1979 British Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; where he won the first of over 100 wins for the &lt;a href="w%3AWilliamsF1"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt; team. 

His career ended in 1980 after crashing his &lt;a href="w%3AEnsign%20%28racing%20team%29"&gt;Ensign&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href="w%3A1980%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix%20West"&gt;United States Grand Prix West&lt;/a&gt; due to a brake failure. The crash left the Swiss paralyzed from the waist down.

Williams team owner &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Williams"&gt;Frank Williams&lt;/a&gt;, described Regazzoni as "gentleman" and "a pleasure to have with us in the team".

Regazzoni was also famous for his moustache and his relaxed personality.

The &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABritish%20police"&gt;British police&lt;/a&gt; have arrested a man in connection with the murder of 5 prostitutes in the Ipswich area. Tom Stephens, 37, was arrested at his home in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ATrimley"&gt;Trimley&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AFelixstowe"&gt;Felixstowe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASuffolk"&gt;Suffolk&lt;/a&gt; at 7:20 a.m. Police are also examining a phone and laptop confiscated from Mr Stephens earlier in the week and checking Mr Stephens mother's house.

Stephens is currently in police custody at an unnamed station in Suffolk awaiting questioning.

All five of the women were found dumped naked in the countryside near &lt;a href="w%3AIpswich"&gt;Ipswich&lt;/a&gt; over a period of 11 days. The murders were compared by the media to the ninteenth century killer &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20the%20Ripper"&gt;Jack the Ripper&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite these developments police are still stressing that the investigation is ongoing and are continuing to advise prostitutes in the area to remain off the streets. 

In total there are currently 412 detectives, uniformed officers and police staff working on the case.

Shortly after nine PM last night a gunman walked into the T.G.I. Friday’s on University Drive in &lt;a href="w%3AHuntsville%2C%20Alabama"&gt;Huntsville, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; and opened fire on a table where Tanqueray Beavers, Thurston Turner, Autora Rogers, and William Reliford sat. The suspect was reported fleeing the scene in a 1970’s era black Chevelle with silver racing stripes and chrome wheels. Huntsville Police stopped a car matching this description and took the driver, Jamal Woods, into custody for questioning.

It has been confirmed that one of the victims, identified by friends and family at the scene as Tanqueray Beavers, died at the scene. The three others wounded in the attack were taken to Huntsville Hospital and are listed to be in critical condition.
Investigators are not releasing any information regarding a motive for the shooting, but Huntsville Police have charged Jamal Woods with murder.

A state of emergency was declared Sunday for the U.S. state of &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; by governor &lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Gregoire"&gt;Christine Gregoire&lt;/a&gt;, as additional reports of storm-related casualties surfaced. The state National Guard has been deployed to aid in distributing supplies.
Thousands were still without power in the coastal and &lt;a href="w%3APuget%20Sound"&gt;Puget Sound&lt;/a&gt; regions, though most urban areas were back with power as late as Sunday afternoon, and outages were mostly contained to rural and unincorporated areas. Puget Sound Energy reported that roughly 500,000 energy customers out of the 700,000 who lost power were back in service by Sunday evening. Seattle City Light, the city's independent municipal utility, reported only 18,000 customers still without power as of Monday morning, down from a peak of 175,000.

Four additional deaths related to the post-storm power outage had been reported as of Monday, bringing the total number of casualties to eight. A man in &lt;a href="w%3AGig%20Harbor%2C%20Washington"&gt;Gig Harbor&lt;/a&gt; was electrocuted by a downed power line while walking his dog. Another man in Spanaway died when an unattended candle caused a house fire.
Two died from &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20monoxide"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt; poisoning in separate incidents related to use of combustion devices indoors. Roughly a hundred additional cases of non-fatal carbon monoxide poisoning were reported from people using generators or grills indoors. News radio stations and authorities warned the public to stay away from downed power lines and not to use grills indoors. Dr. Neil Hampson at Virginia Mason's hyperbaric unit, where a number of victims were being treated, warned it could be "the worse case of carbon monoxide poisioning in the country".

On Monday, four new carbon-monoxide deaths were reported in a family of five in &lt;a href="w%3ABurien%2C%20Washington"&gt;Burien&lt;/a&gt; due to an indoor generator. In Canada, which had some damage from the week's storms, two southern &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; carbon monoxide deaths were also reported. Despite continued warnings, hospitals are still seeing cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, including a family in &lt;a href="w%3AShoreline%2C%20Washington"&gt;w:Shoreline, Washington&lt;/a&gt; which was taken to the hospital after they reported symptoms due to their indoor grill. Neighbors of the Burien family suggested that noise concerns are leading people to place noisy generators indoors.
The massive power outage left many stores and gas stations unable to operate. Some businesses opened with the help of backup generators, conserving power by foregoing heat and refrigeration, exterior lighting, and half the interior lighting. Most stores had run out of "D" size batteries, the most common size for flashlights, as well as firelogs and other essentials. Gasoline shortages were reported throughout the area, with one man selling excess fuel for as high as $15 per gallon, over 5 times the average retail price. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; set up shelters throughout King and other affected counties for those without power or food. Hotels reported no vacancies as whole families took shelter in powered hotels, especially in Seattle. Restaurants also reported brisk business as people sought out a hot cooked meal. Tons of perishable food were expected to have become unsafe after the prolonged outage disabled refrigerators and freezers both in homes and stores.
Many of those without power visited nearby friends and family living where power had been continued or restored, while others traveled out of the area to places that had not been affected. The widespread outage made long-distance traveling treacherous on some major routes, with roadway lighting, cellular towers, and services disabled by the outage.

Most major roadways which were closed during the storm were reopened on Friday. The 520 Floating Bridge over Lake Washington, a major conduit to the technology-rich Eastside, sustained minor damage. Amtrak, which had halted its Cascades service, resumed Saturday evening. Sea-Tac Airport resumed operations with a reduced flight load, after a transient power outage on Friday disabled the airport radar and caused all planes to be grounded until it was repaired.

During a heavy thunderstorm at around 19:00 GMT, a plane crashed into a block of flats in the suburb of &lt;a href="w%3AYeoville"&gt;Yeoville&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AJohannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;.

The pilot was killed on impact. No one on the ground was injured.

The plane is believed to be a &lt;a href="w%3APiper%20Cherokee%20140"&gt;Piper Cherokee 140&lt;/a&gt; that was probably heading towards &lt;a href="w%3ALanseria%20Airport"&gt;Lanseria Airport&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20w.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; signed the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States-India%20Peaceful%20Atomic%20Energy%20Cooperation%20Act"&gt;United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act&lt;/a&gt; which provides for cooperation between the US and India in civilian nuclear matters. 

The deal would also open 14 of India's nuclear plants to international inspection while leaving eight military nuclear sites closed to outside access.

Critics say that the deal will undermine pre-existing nuclear non-proliferation treaties, embolden other nuclear and near nuclear powers and erode American credibility when dealing with proliferation issues with other countries such as &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. 

In India, the deal has also come under criticism with the oppostion asserting that the deal primarily acts to limit India's nuclear capabilities.

The &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; government has formally launched the country’s first policy on renewable sources of energy. The policy offers attractive incentives to investors willing to exploit this environment-friendly but largely unexplored sector especially for power generation. The ‘Policy for Development of Renewable Energy for Power Generation – 2006’ has already been approved by the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet.

The Honourable &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Dunne"&gt;Peter Dunne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand Member of Parliament&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AOhariu-Belmont"&gt;Ohariu-Belmont&lt;/a&gt; and leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Future"&gt;United Future party&lt;/a&gt;, has today released a list of the worst-behaved MPs in Parliament for 2006.

&lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Smith%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;Nick Smith&lt;/a&gt;, MP for the &lt;a href="w%3A%20New%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;New Zealand National party&lt;/a&gt;, is listed as the worst-behaved on the list. Dunne said: "The winner by a country mile this year is National's Nelson MP, Dr Nick Smith, who is consistently among the worst-behaved MPs."

The list awards one point if the &lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20of%20the%20House"&gt;Speaker of the House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Wilson"&gt;Margaret Wilson&lt;/a&gt; asks an MP to retract and apologise for a statement, and three points if he is asked to leave the House.

Smith was first on the list as he had 21 points, six retractions and five for being forced from the House. Smith was placed second equal in 2002, third in 2003, first in 2004 but didn't register on the list last year, 2005.

The Honourable &lt;a href="w%3ATau%20Henare"&gt;Tau Henare&lt;/a&gt; is second with 14 points. He had to retract and apologise for five statements and was asked to leave the house three times.

&lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Brownlee"&gt;Gerry Brownlee&lt;/a&gt; is ranked third both on the worst behaved list and the National party list. Mr Brownlee had twelve points because he had to retract and apologise for twelve statements. Mr Brownlee appeared on the list in 2004 in second place and in 2005 was placed fourth equal.

The leader of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20First"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt; and MP Right Honourable &lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Peters"&gt;Winston Peters&lt;/a&gt; appears on the list this year at fourth place with 11 points, from having to retract two statements and being asked to leave the House three times. Peters has been improving his behaviour every year, appearing on the list in first place in 2002 and 2003, fourth in 2004 and third in 2005.

Honourable &lt;a href="w%3ATrevor%20Mallard"&gt;Trevor Mallard&lt;/a&gt; is fifth place this year with nine points. Six points for having to apologise for a statement and three points for being asked to the leave the House. He appeared third on the list in 2004 and fourth equal in 2005.

Hon &lt;a href="w%3ADover%20Samuels"&gt;Dover Samuels&lt;/a&gt; was expelled from the House twice and had to withdraw and apologise for three statements and because of that he is sixth on the list this year.

Recently the deputy leader of National and seventh on the bad MP list is Hon &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20English"&gt;Bill English&lt;/a&gt; for six statements requiring retraction, and being expelled from the House once. Dunne described him as a person to watch.

&lt;a href="w%3ARodney%20Hide"&gt;Rodney Hide&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the ACT party, didn't appear on the list this year even though he was first place last year. Also Honourable &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Carter%20%28politician%29"&gt;Chris Carter&lt;/a&gt; didn't appear on the list, despite placing second last year.

Canadians will see a new change in the federal cabinet early next month. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; is expected to shuffle his cabinet in the new year.

It is speculated that &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Indian%20Affairs%20and%20Northern%20Development%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Indian affairs minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Prentice"&gt;Jim Prentice&lt;/a&gt; will be replacing Environmental Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARona%20Ambrose"&gt;Rona Ambrose&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Van%20Loan"&gt;Peter Van Loan&lt;/a&gt;, who is &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Intergovernmental%20Affairs%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Intergovernmental Affairs minister&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to replace Prentice as Indian affairs minister. Ambrose is also expected to replace Van Loan as Intergovernmental Affairs minister.

Ambrose struggled to sell the &lt;a href="w%3AClean%20Air%20Act%23Canada"&gt;Clean Air Act&lt;/a&gt; and Tory insiders said it did not meet heightened expectations.

The PM promises to have a fresh focus on the environment in the expected spring 2007 federal election. When asked about his plans for Prentice he said he wasn't prepared to speak on the issue yet.

"The impression I got was that she didn't do her homework. But I have to offset that by saying it doesn't matter if you've done your homework if someone switches the books first thing the next morning," said a senior government source. "At the last minute, they gave her new stuff or didn't give her information. It's not entirely her fault by any means." 

Prentice denied rumors saying that Ambrose will be replaced.

"You guys all want to speculate. Go ahead and speculate. You didn't get it from me," he said. "As you know there are rumours on every street corner in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, that's part of the charm of the place."

Part of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20route%20E6"&gt;E6&lt;/a&gt; main road near &lt;a href="w%3AMunkedal"&gt;Munkedal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABohusl%C3%A4n"&gt;Bohuslän&lt;/a&gt; in the west of &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; has collapsed in a landslide. The first report was received by emergency services at 19.17 CET. 26 people were involved in the incident, when the road collapsed under them in a landslide. About 500 &lt;a href="w%3Ametre"&gt;metres&lt;/a&gt; of the road slid down a slope into a small stream alongside, leaving a crater 200 metres wide and two to three metres deep. Both sides of the road (which in this area is single carriageway) have collapsed and the road has now been closed by the emergency services between Saltkällan and Torp.

Police spokesperson Thomas Fuxborg said to &lt;a href="w%3ASveriges%20Television"&gt;SVT&lt;/a&gt; that "it is a very large accident". So far no fatalities have been reported, and SVT news programme &lt;a href="w%3AAktuellt"&gt;Aktuellt&lt;/a&gt; reports that all the people involved in the accident have been rescued and have only suffered minor injuries (&lt;a href="http%3A//svt.se/svt/play/video.jsp%3Fa%3D726176"&gt;video of news broadcast&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http%3A//svt.se/svt/play/video.jsp%3Fa%3D726203"&gt;video showing the scene of the accident&lt;/a&gt;). On the morning of 21 December SVT reported that all 26 people involved in the incident had been rescued. Though none of them had major injuries 13 people were taken to hospital, of which all but one had been discharged by the morning of 21 December. The injuries consisted of "some broken arms and legs and back pains, and many shocked of course," according to Lars-Göran Eskilsson, deputy head of rescue services in Uddevalla.

The site of the landslide is the most recently opened section of the E6, which has been undergoing rebuilding work. The cause of the landslide is not known, but there is speculation that the unusually heavy rain that has recently hit the area could have undermined the road. Geologists have warned that there may be further landslides, so the safety cordons are being moved back. "Work is currently underway to move the cordons back to secure the area," said Leif Larsson, head of rescue services in Uddevalla, on the night of 20 December. Two properties nearby have been evacuated because of the risk for further landslides.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AG%C3%B6teborgs-Posten"&gt;Göteborgs-Posten&lt;/a&gt;, the Bohusbanan railway line (which runs parallel with the E6 road) has also been affected. The landslide reportedly cut an electricity line leaving the railway without power. A passenger train on its way from Munkedal was stopped only 600-700 metres from the scene of the landslide. SVT reports that 300 metres of the railway embankment has collapsed.

The E6 is the main road between &lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city of &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AGothenburg"&gt;Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;, so the landslide is expected to cause major disruption to traffic. The 15,000 vehicles that pass the collapsed section of road every day will be rerouted on minor roads via &lt;a href="w%3ADals-Ed"&gt;Dals-Ed&lt;/a&gt;. Vehicles coming from the south will have to leave the E6 before the Uddevalla bridge and follow roads 174, 166 and 164 before returning to the &lt;a href="w%3Amotorway"&gt;motorway&lt;/a&gt; at Skee. "There will be very big diversions, about 50-60 &lt;a href="w%3Akilometres"&gt;kilometres&lt;/a&gt;. We will have long queues because it involves many vehicles and much smaller roads," said Tomas Andersson, crisis manager at the &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish%20National%20Road%20Administration"&gt;Swedish National Road Administration&lt;/a&gt;. More information is available on the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.vv.se/"&gt;Swedish National Road Administration website&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Corzine"&gt;Governor Jon Corzine&lt;/a&gt; announced a bill that would provide $270 million to &lt;a href="w%3AStem%20cell"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; research. He announced, "I don't want New Jersey to join the crowd of stem cell research states, I want New Jersey to lead it."

&lt;a href="w%3ABusinessWeek"&gt;BusinessWeek&lt;/a&gt; reports that the announcement came two days after Corzine announced that the state will give out $10 million in research grants next year, including $7 million for stem cell research.

Below is a summary of the fund allocation.

Soon, Eritrea will be one of the world's first nations to protect its entire coastline. In an ambitious plan to protect it's extensive (over 1,300 km) mainland coast and over 300 islands.

The Minister of Fisheries, Ahmed Hajj Ali, revealed that a National Policy regarding the coastline of Eritrea, and its sustainable development had been formulated with the input of partners and experts.

"Eritrea will be the first country in the world to declare its entire coastline a protected area," said Dr Michael Pearson, a specialist in environmental management. The plan requires a corridor of sustainable development 100 m.

Apart from the beaches and desert coasts of Eritrea the project will include protection for the hundreds of kilometres of coral reefs and mangrove forests while simultaneously protecting inland watersheds.

It is also suggested within the policy that this will lead to the creation of new National Parks and Reserves as well as well as permanently protected coastal and marine areas.

Officials working on finding the two missing climbers on &lt;a href="w%3AOregon"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AMount%20Hood"&gt;Mount Hood&lt;/a&gt; have sadly given up the search for the two men, Brian Hall (age 37) and Jerry Cooke (age 36). Over ten feet of snow has fallen on Mt. Hood since the search began, and "...weather conditions can be unforgiving this time of year" according to local sheriff Joe Wampler.

Another man, Kelly James (age 48) was found earlier in a snow cave on the mountain. Results from tests and an autopsy showed that James had died of &lt;a href="w%3Ahypothermia"&gt;hypothermia&lt;/a&gt;, a condition which results from prolonged exposure to cold and wind. Authorities report that James may have dislocated his shoulder sometime during the climb.

Sheriff Wampler was continually working on the case, although several volunteers had returned to their normal jobs and lives. When Wampler made the announcement, he added, "I feel good about what I did. I wanted to do what I could for the family. You start something you want to finish it."

A statement expressed by the &lt;a href="w%3AGreek"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; Public Order Minister, ♡❤♡Byron Polidoras♡❤♡, during a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; had as a result political turbulence between the government and political parties of the Left. More specifically, Polidoras blamed indirectly the &lt;a href="w%3ASynaspismos"&gt;Synaspismos&lt;/a&gt; leftist party for covering rallies by &lt;a href="w%3Aanarchists"&gt;anarchists&lt;/a&gt; and called Synaspismos' leadership to make clear whether or not approves violence from the side of leftist and anarchist groups which take part in big anti-governmental rallies. Moreover, the Greek Public Order Minister blamed &lt;a href="w%3APASOK"&gt;PASOK&lt;/a&gt;, today's leading opposition party, for being fully responsible for not doing something in order to break down the teams of anarchist groups during its 20 years of governance.

The answers from the side of PASOK and Synaspismos were immediate and blamed Mr.Polidoras for being exposed and for trying to manipulate citizens, making references to the past of Greek politics. Furthermore, in a short debate between Polidoras and PASOK's parliamentary representative, Petros Efthemiou on &lt;a href="w%3AALPHA%20TV"&gt;ALPHA TV&lt;/a&gt;, the second called Minister to apply those policies that would eliminate violence in demonstrations instead of blaming political parties and former governments. Addressing to the Greek Parliament later, Byron Polidoras clarified his statement saying that he fully respects all parties and that he didn't mean to blame the opposition as supporters of anarchist groups.

According to recent official data, criminal cases and more specifically juvenile violence has been increased during the last year in &lt;a href="w%3AGreece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;. The issue came back on focus, after a 10-year old boy was arrested during violent clashes between police and anarchists, outside &lt;a href="w%3AAristotle%20University"&gt;Aristotle University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;.

British author &lt;a href="w%3AJ.K.%20Rowling"&gt;J.K. Rowling&lt;/a&gt; has revealed the title of the seventh and final book in the &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; series in an online game on her official website. Contenders would click on items to reveal a chamber, then they would use the clues given and guess the title. After fans played a game they were rewarded with the title of the book which is to be called ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Deathly%20Hallows"&gt;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. She also revealed that Harry had been taking place in her dreams and she was returning to writing in cafes, as she did 13 years ago.

"One character got a reprieve but I have to say that two die that I didn't intend to die," Rowling, 41, said June 27 on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20%26amp%3B%20Judy"&gt;Richard &amp; Judy&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a television show run in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt;

The book is first published in the U.K. by London-based &lt;a href="w%3ABloomsbury%20Publishing"&gt;Bloomsbury&lt;/a&gt; and then sent to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3AScholastic%20Corporation"&gt;Scholastic Corp&lt;/a&gt;.

"I'm writing scenes that have been planned, in some cases, for a dozen years or even more," Rowling wrote on her website. "I don't think anyone who has not been in a similar situation can possibly know how this feels: I am alternately elated and overwrought. I both want, and don't want, to finish this book (don't worry, I will)."

The &lt;a href="w%3Afilm"&gt;film&lt;/a&gt; version of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Phoenix"&gt;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the fifth book in the series published June 21, 2003, is still in production and will be released in July 2007.

Rowling was inspired to write after her mother died from &lt;a href="w%3AMultiple%20sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; in 1990 and after a marriage breakdown. She started writing in &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; cafés. Whenever her daughter Jessica fell asleep she would put her in a carriage beside her and stroll her to the closest café. 300 million books worldwide have been sold and the series has been translated into 47 languages.

No publication date has been set.

President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANiyazov"&gt;Niyazov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Turkmenistan"&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt; had declared himself to be "President For Life" in 1999 after his last elected victory in 1992 and had not selected a successor. His reign in Turkmenistan led to 21 years of relative peace within the country, but was not welcoming of diverse opinions and viewpoints throughout the culture. 

Most opponents to his regime left the country over the last two decades as President Niyazov centralized his authority over the nation. His rule over Turkmenistan came after years of service in the Communist Party of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSSR"&gt;USSR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (c.f. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm%3FID%3D17080"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).

A blizzard hit &lt;a href="w%3AColorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; and the plains dumping more than two feet of snow in &lt;a href="w%3ADenver"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt;, rising to five feet in some areas north of Denver. Over 2500 flights stand canceled as |Denver International Airport, the fifth-busiest airport in the US, shut down on Wednesday. The airport is not expected to open until noon of Friday. Thousands of travelers have been stranded during the busy Christmas season.

Snow started to fall in Denver at dawn on Wednesday, and did not let up until Thursday afternoon. Sustained winds blowing at 20 miles per hour and gusts up to 50 mph created snow drifts reaching up to 5 feet in some places in Denver, especially in the northern suburbs. Long stretches of I-70, I-25, and I-76 were closed as it was impossible to plow through the blizzard.

The weather system led to school shutdowns in New Mexico because of the heavy snow and freezing rain, before moving across Colorado, which was the worst hit. Some mountain regions received up to 4 feet of snow, not counting the drifts. The system slowly moved northeastward and dumped fairly large amounts of snow in southeastern Wyoming, the Dakotas, and Kansas.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; government has announced that the new minimum purchasing age to buy fireworks in New Zealand is 18-years instead of the current age of 14-years. Also the amount of time fireworks are available for sale during &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Fawkes"&gt;Guy Fawkes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been restricted to three days before &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Fawkes%20night"&gt;Guy Fawkes night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; instead of ten days. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Fire%20Service"&gt;New Zealand Fire Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has welcomed the new restrictions despite them calling for a complete ban.

The Environment minister, Honourable &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Benson-Pope"&gt;David Benson-Pope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said: "This aims to restrict young teenagers from purchasing these potentially harmful explosives, and to make the Guy Fawkes season less taxing for the Fire Service and Police. We want to see fireworks users behaving responsibly, being aware of and avoiding fire risk, guarding the personal safety of themselves and others, and being aware of the effect the noise has on animals." 

Further restrictions have also been announced which will ban the separate sale of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASparkler"&gt;sparklers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Sparklers will only be available for purchase in packs contained with other fireworks. This restriction is to try and prevent the dangerous, home-made "sparkler bombs."

Mike Hall, chief executive of the New Zealand Fire Service, said that he is pleased with the new restrictions around the sale of fireworks. "I met with the minister in November and expressed the Fire Service’s concerns, and it’s good to see that some action has come out of that."

In response to why the government had not banned the complete sale of fireworks, Hon Benson-Pope said: "I have listened to the various groups that do want a ban, and I am still open to that possibility in the future, but I believe the best approach at this stage is to tighten up the laws around sale."

The government has asked the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Risk%20Management%20Authority"&gt;Environmental Risk Management Authority&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to investigate the fireworks available for purchase in regards to the style, design and the construction of the various fireworks. "...and next year government will consult with industry about new regulations in this area," Hon Benson-Pope said.

Mr Hall said: "Obviously we won’t know whether or not the measures Mr Benson-Pope has introduced will go far enough until the Guy Fawkes period in 2007, but we certainly hope they will limit the chaos we have seen in the past couple of years."

Hon Benson-Pope said: "Guy Fawkes is a fun event for thousands of families, and fireworks-related damage is caused by a small group of mostly young people. I don't feel it's fair on New Zealanders to ban fireworks sales at this stage because of the actions of a minority." 

"I understand the frustration the Police and Fire Service teams feel when faced with problems over Guy Fawkes, and I hope these new restrictions will send a message that deliberate harm or damage is criminal and is being clamped down on," Mr Benson-Pope said.

The next Guy Fawkes day is November 5, 2007.

♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARolling%20Stone"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, one of the music industry's foremost publications, has found itself reporting false news gleaned from a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; article.

The online edition of the magazine's ♡❤Rock &amp; Roll Daily♡❤ released an article entitled "♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHalle%20Berry"&gt;Halle Berry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Set to Ruin Reputation...♡❤" on December 11, reporting on the news that the actor had announced her intentions to release a musical album.

The story was quickly picked up by ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, ♡❤All Headline News♡❤, and other news agencies eager to report on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Awards"&gt;Academy Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -winning actress' foray into the musical world.

The only trouble is, according to one of the album's alleged producers, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Storch"&gt;Scott Storch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , there is no such album...and he definitely hasn't produced three songs for it.

A Wikipedia editor known only as "Ciii" registered on the site on December 1, and then quietly updated the actress' article on the free encyclopaedia, to include mention of a fictitious interview allegedly given in the December issue of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A%E2%99%A1%E2%9D%A4Ebony%E2%99%A1%E2%9D%A4%20magazine"&gt;♡❤Ebony♡❤ magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in which Berry allegedly was quoted saying ♡❤"I've always loved to sing and this album will show people that I can do more than act."♡❤

Travellers in many parts of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; face chaos after thick fog enveloped major parts of the southern UK. London's Gatwick and Heathrow international airports have been severely affected and all British Airways domestic flights from Heathrow have been cancelled. On Thursday 350 flights from Heathrow were cancelled.

Road travel has also been affected as visibility in some areas dropped down to less than 50 feet. Fog has caused several road accidents across the UK, there was one death when an accident caused a four lorry pile-up on the M40 motorway near Banbury in between junctions 11 and 10. This caused traffic chaos across the town as traffic was diverted onto much smaller roads towards Oxford.

Weather reports suggest that the fog will slowly move north-west over the weekend. 

Gatwick Airport re-opened on Friday, while Heathrow flights are still affected. Three hundred flights have been cancelled so far and 3,000 people have been transported to their UK destinations by coach.

BA has said that it aims to fly 95% of passengers in and out of Heathrow as planned tomorrow, Saturday.

The railways have become congested coping with the number of passengers both trying to get home and to domestic destinations, but most tickets are sold out.

There were, however, no cancellations at London's third airport, Stansted.

&lt;a href="w%3ATodd%20Shriber"&gt;Todd J. Shriber&lt;/a&gt; has been fired as the communications director for &lt;a href="w%3ADenny%20Rehberg"&gt;U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Republican%20Party"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AMontana"&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt;), after it was disclosed that he attempted to hire people associated with the website attrition.org to hack into his former university, Texas Christian University, to have his GPA grades raised. Once his superiors learned of the scandal, he was immediately fired. "He just wasn't exhibiting the kind of veracity that we need and demand out of our employees," said Erik Iverson, Rehberg's chief of staff.

Shriber's opening email shows considerable naivety, assuming the attrition security site is run by hackers he can employ.

A brief exchange of email messages confirms that Shriber is completely unaware that not all hackers will perform illegal acts, on August 9 he said in email to the "security curmudgeon" of Attrition, "OK here it is: I need an adjustment to my college GPA.
Is this an absurd request?". The response leads Schriber into believing that he has found someone to carry out the job for him. Security Curmudgeon warns Shriber that he is soliciting the commission of a federal offense, and requests personally identifying information that would be required for the break in plus "picture of a squirrel or pigeon on your campus. One close-up, one with background that shows buildings, a sign, or something to indicate you are standing on the campus."

The exchange continues, up until Shriber reveals college details such as his student ID, username, and password. A second member of the attrition team, Lyger, coaxes date of birth and social security details from Shriber also telling him, "we still have to
take unique precautions in order to be successful. Please mention this project to absolutely nobody, even your closest friends. The smallest leak could lead to compromise."

Smattering messages with comical jargon, Lyger convinces Shriber that they are in fact breaking into Texas Christian University for him. He tells them he will be unavailable for some time and will ready a list of changes he'd like made to his GPA. This is followed by Lyger deciding to end the game, "we are SO busted... i've already been called twice by my isp asking about unusual activity...stuff that finally got me access all goes back to your login sorry". Lyger advises Shrieber to "duck and run", telling him never to visit the attrition.org site again. The email messages were then published on the site.

<h1>New Zealand secures hosting rights of World Netball Championships in 2007</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%20secures%20hosting%20rights%20of%20World%20Netball%20Championships%20in%202007&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Netball%20Associations%20%28IFNA%29"&gt;International Federation of Netball Associations&lt;/a&gt; announced the decision today that &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has secured the rights to host the &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20World%20Netball%20Championships"&gt;World Netball Championships in 2007&lt;/a&gt; after Fiji were stripped of the rights following their military coup this year.

Kareyn Smith, vice president of the IFNA, said: "New Zealand was really the only viable option, and participating nations will just have to accept it. One big issue which will have to be looked at is the number of people who had already booked to travel to Fiji for the tournament in July, including more than 1,000 New Zealanders."

New Zealand has been given extra time to prepare for the two week event, with the postponement of the championship's start from July to November. Ruth Aitken, coach of New Zealand's netball team, the &lt;a href="w%3ASilver%20Ferns"&gt;Silver Ferns&lt;/a&gt;, said that the time they have to prepare is usually when the team has its rest period. However she is delighted that New Zealand is the host.

Netball New Zealand has not yet announced the venue where the championships will be played but have announced that it will be either Auckland or Christchurch. Don Mackinnon, chair of the Netball New Zealand board, said that other venues are not being considered because it would become too difficult because of the time constraints. The decision will be announced within the next couple weeks.

New Zealand are the current world champions since winning the last championships held in Jamaica. New Zealand also held the championship in 1999.

Australia was unable to host the championships as they could not prepare in the allocated time. Jamaica and England both showed interest in hosting the championships.

On December 22, 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has announced that it has extended its warranty for all &lt;a href="w%3AXbox%20360"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; video game consoles to one year in the United States. While this one year warranty applies to all Xbox 360 software as well, Xbox 360 accessories will still carry their original 90 day warranty.

According to a statement by Microsoft:

"Customers that experience hardware issues with their Xbox 360 within one year of purchase will have their consoles repaired at no cost. Moreover, the new warranty policy is retroactive, so consumers that may have already paid for out-of-warranty Xbox 360 repair within one year of the console's purchase will be eligible for reimbursement of their console repair charges."

This extension should help ease customers' minds who have been concerned with the Xbox 360's reputation for hardware failures. A partial list of hardware issues can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems

People who have paid for Xbox 360 repair will be automatically distributed a reimbursement check in about 10 weeks from the present date.

Previously in September, 2006, Microsoft had waived the cost for repairs on all Xbox 360 consoles made before January 1, 2006, and refunded any fees already paid.

A full description of the updated warranty can be found here: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/systemsetup/xbox360/resources/warranty.htm

Probably the most unusual massive anti-war demonstration was held yesterday, on December 22nd. The event was called ♡❤Global Orgasm for Peace♡❤. 

It implied that everyone in the world who wanted to contribute to peace around the globe could take part in the event by achieving orgasm on the 22nd of December. 

According to the Global Orgasm for Peace organizers (Donna Sheehan and Paul Reffel) a person experiences feeling of peace both while experiencing orgasm and after it. They believe that synchronized orgasm, being a very large surge of human energy can "effect positive change in the energy field" of our planet. 

The organizers welcomed every adult person to register for participating and together with thousands of people around the globe achieve orgasm through whatever way and in whatever place. Approximately 26,000 people had shown interest in the initiative, by November 21, although it is unknown how many formally participated in the event.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMullah%20Akhtar%20Mohammad%20Osmani"&gt;Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Osmani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who was an associate of Taliban head &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMullah%20Omar"&gt;Mullah Omar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was killed on Tuesday following a U.S. air strike in the &lt;a href="Helmand%20Province"&gt;Helmand Province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. He is the highest ranking Taliban official to have been killed or captured since the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2001%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2001.

Colonel &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Collins"&gt;Tom Collins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; claims that this is a "big loss" for the Taliban, although they will be able to find a replacement. US and Afghani officials claim this is a big victory; it may even disrupt the planning of an attack by the Taliban.

Taliban spokesman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQari%20Yousef%20Ahmadi"&gt;Qari Yousef Ahmadi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , however, claims that Osmani is "alive and is in Afghanistan." Collins rebutes this claim by stating that breaking the news of his death was intentionally delayed to confirm it was indeed Osmani. According to the U.S., "various sources" were used to confirm Osmani's identity.

Osmani played the role of handling military operations in Helmand, as well as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Associated Press also claims he has been involved in the destruction of Buddha statues and the "trial" of Christian aid workers.

EuroNews reports that this is the bloodiest year of fighting in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Analysis%20reveals%20that%20New%20York%20City%20tunnels%20are%20susceptible%20to%20attacks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to a security analysis of the &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Authority%20Transhudson"&gt;PATH&lt;/a&gt; tunnels as requested by Police Commissioner &lt;a href="Raymond%20Kelly"&gt;Raymond W. Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, the tunnels are more susceptible to attacks than once thought: if an explosive were to blow a 50 square foot hole in the wall, then over one million gallons of water per minute would flood in. This information has not been shared with other government agencies yet.

Commissioner Kelly considers this to be a "cause for concern," but still believes the trains are safe. Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman of the &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Authority%20of%20New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Port Authority&lt;/a&gt;, claims that security has stepped up and bag checks will be increased.

This report comes five months after arrests were made overseas of people who were conspiring to bomb the PATH tunnels.

The four tubes of PATH trains, which connect &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, are used by 230,000 people each weekday. These tunnels are made of cast iron and only one-fourth of the length is reinforced with concrete or brick. Should a hole be punctured in one of those tunnels, that tunnel would flood in six minutes and the rest of the system would be overwhelmed in a matter of hours.

The analysis was funded by the US government and was done by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The study has since been leaked to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; by an official.

The disappearance of the island of &lt;a href="w%3ALohachara"&gt;Lohachara&lt;/a&gt;, part of &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bengal"&gt;West Bengal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASundarbans"&gt;Sundarbans&lt;/a&gt; and once home to over ten thousand people, is a milestone in some of climate scientists' darker predictions.

The first uninhabited islands recorded to have disappeared were part of the Pacific atoll nation of &lt;a href="w%3AKiribati"&gt;Kiribati&lt;/a&gt;, and were submerged over eight years ago. However, the disappearance of Lohachara and the displacement of its ten thousand residents was unprecedented.

Refugees from Lohachara and the nearby island of Ghoramara fled to Sagar, an island that has already lost 7500 acres of land to the sea. Ghoramara is presently about two thirds submerged. A total of a dozen islands, home to seventy thousand people, are projected to be submerged by the rising seas during the next fourteen years.

During each monsoon season almost all the Bengali delta is submerged, much of it for half a year. A 1990 study noted that "There is no evidence that environmental degradation in the Himalayas or a 'greenhouse'-induced rise in sea level have aggravated floods in Bangladesh."

Following the stabbing of Ryan Milner at a Canadian nightclub parking lot, &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; police posted a 72-second video clip of a surveillance cam on &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, a popular video sharing website, with hopes that witnesses would come forward. While no additional witnesses turned up, about two weeks later, 24-year-old George Gallo turned himself in.

Police had thought that the extra attention brought to the case is what made Mr Gallo surrender; indeed, the video had been viewed 34,000 times. Additionally, the video had been seen from as far away as Singapore. Hamilton Police believes this is the first time YouTube has been used in an investigation, and they are considering using YouTube for future investigations.

Detective Sergeant Jorge Lasso claims that he got the idea when he noted that the same people who attended the concert are the same people who are his children's ages. "My own children are in that age category, and they spend all their time on the Internet; they do not watch mainstream media," he stated.

A unanimously passed &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; resolution imposing sanctions on &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has been dismissed by Iranian president &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; as a "piece of paper." Ahmadinejad said that it is in "the best interest of the West" to have a "nuclear Iran" and that Iran will not stop enriching &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Ahmadinejad also goes on to say that anyone who "backs" the U.N. resolution will "soon regret" their acts. He also added that in "February, Iranians will celebrate" the nation becoming a nuclear power.

"This resolution will not harm Iran and those who backed it will soon regret their superficial act. Iranians are neither worried nor uncomfortable with the resolution ... we will celebrate our atomic achievements in February," added Ahmadinejad.

The U.N. also said that Iran must suspend all uranium enrichment and that the sanction would be lifted if the country complies with the U.N..

"Unanimously adopting &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aresolution%201737"&gt;resolution 1737 (2006)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; under Article 41 of the Charter’s Chapter VII, the Council decided that Iran should, without further delay, suspend the following proliferation sensitive nuclear activities: all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development; and work on all heavy-water related projects, including the construction of a research reactor moderated by heavy water. The halt to those activities would be verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)."

The U.N. also stated that "specifically, all States [countries] should prevent the supply, sale or transfer, for the use by or benefit of Iran, of related equipment and technology, if the State determined that such items would contribute to enrichment-related, reprocessing or heavy-water related activities, or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. The Council decided it would terminate the measures if Iran fully complied with its obligations, or adopt additional ones and possible further decisions if the country did not."

Iran also said that beginning on "Sunday morning, we [Iran] will begin activities at Natanz" which has "3,000 centrifuges" which they "will drive them with full speed" in response to the U.N.'s resolution.

"From Sunday morning, we will begin activities at Natanz, the site of 3,000-centrifuge machines, and we will drive it with full speed. It will be our immediate response to the resolution," said Ali Larijani, the top nuclear negotiator for Iran.

The U.N. will review the resolution and Iran's activities in 60 days.

&lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of Wikipedia, has announced that &lt;a href="w%3AWikia%2C%20Inc."&gt;Wikia&lt;/a&gt; will be providing a new search engine that will be based on user input. This future search engine will differ from other search engines which use automatic indexing and ranking. It is based on the idea that because automated search engines can be manipulated, a search engine based on human judgment would be better. An initial launch is expected in early 2007.

"Google is very good at many types of search," notes Wales in an interview with UK newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Times"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "but in many instances it produces nothing but spam and useless crap. Try searching for the term 'Tampa hotels', for example, and you will not get any useful results."

The search engine has widely been reported as being called "Wikiasari", but Wales has stated this is a misconception.&lt;a href="http%3A//lists.wikia.com/pipermail/search-l/2006-December/000000.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That name refers to an old codebase for a similar, abandoned project, and according to a large notice placed on search.wikia.com, the project is not affiliated with Amazon, A9, or Wikipedia. The name "Wikiasari" was derived from "wiki," a &lt;a href="w%3AHawaiian%20language"&gt;Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt; term meaning "quick," referring to &lt;a href="w%3Awiki"&gt;wiki software&lt;/a&gt;, and "asari," which is &lt;a href="w%3AJapanese%20language"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; for "rummaging search."

&lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopian&lt;/a&gt; Fighter jets have attacked several towns in &lt;a href="w%3ASomalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt; and for the first time, Ethiopia acknowledged the presence of its troops in Somalia fighting in support of Somalia's &lt;a href="w%3ATransitional%20Federal%20Government"&gt;transitional government&lt;/a&gt; against the forces of the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Courts%20Union"&gt;Islamic Courts Union&lt;/a&gt;. 

"After too much patience, the Ethiopian Government has taken a self-defensive measure and has begun counterattacking the aggressive extremist forces of the [Islamic council] and foreign terrorist groups. Our &lt;a href="w%3Amilitary%20of%20Ethiopia"&gt;defence force&lt;/a&gt; has been forced to enter a war to defend (against) the attacks from extremists and anti-Ethiopian forces and to protect the sovereignty of the land," said Solomon Abebe, the Foreign Affairs spokesman for Ethiopia.

The Prime Minister of Ethiopia, &lt;a href="Meles%20Zenawi"&gt;Meles Zenawi&lt;/a&gt; has also stated that the country has been "forced to enter a war" and went on television to make the announcement that the country was at war with Somalia.

The Islamic movement inside Somalia has stated that the Ethiopian government are "cowards" and that any Ethiopian plane spotted will be shot down.

"They are cowards. They are afraid of the face-to-face war and resorted to air strikes. I hope God will help us shoot down their planes," said a leader with the Islamic Movement, Sheik Mohamoud Ibrahim Suley.

There is no word on how many people may have been injured or killed in the airstrikes.

&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Brown"&gt;James Brown&lt;/a&gt;, often referred to as ♡❤the Godfather of Soul♡❤, died in Atlanta due to congestive heart failure, combined with &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;. His death at age 73 was announced by his agent. After his dentist noticed something unusual with him, Brown was told to visit a doctor immediately. He was taken into the hospital yesterday for treatment of his pneumonia until his death at around 1:45 AM (6:45 AM GMT). It is not known whether he received a pneumonia vaccination, as recommended for people of his age.

He was born in 1933 and grew up in poverty until he formed James Brown &amp; The Famous Flames. His influence on 20th century music, from &lt;a href="w%3Afunk"&gt;funk&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3Ahip%20hop"&gt;hip hop&lt;/a&gt; was profound.

Before he died, he scheduled a New Year's Eve concert series in New Jersey and New York that would help kick off a 2007 tour.

A &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Hengchun%20earthquake"&gt;strong earthquake struck&lt;/a&gt; off the southern tip of &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt; at 12:26 UTC, triggering a warning from &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan's&lt;/a&gt; Meteorological Agency that a 3.3 foot &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt; could be heading towards &lt;a href="w%3ABasco"&gt;Basco&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. The head of the earthquake monitoring agency in the Philippines disputed the Japanese agency's warnings, however.

Conflicting reports have placed the magnitude of the quake between 6.7 and 7.2 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20Scale"&gt;Richter Scale&lt;/a&gt;, with the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau marking it at 6.7, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; estimating it at 7.1, and the Japan Meteorological Agency putting the magnitude at 7.2.

Despite the Japanese Meteorological Agency's warning of a tsunami threat to the Philippines, Renato Solidum, the director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, denied that a tsunami is headed towards the Philippines, saying that the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; in Hawaii had not released any tsunami advisory. Nevertheless, Solidum said that residents in low-lying areas in the Philippines should, as a precaution, move to higher ground.

In the aftermath of the quake, news agencies have aired reports of collapsed houses, hotel guests being trapped in elevators, and telephone outages due to severed lines across Taiwan. Two people were reported killed and 42 injured.

The earthquake has damaged six submarine fiber-optic communications cables, restricting internet access to millions of users in Asia and Australia.

Home users are experiencing severe connection issues, with &lt;a href="w%3Atimeout"&gt;timeouts&lt;/a&gt; becoming very common. The &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Storm%20Center"&gt;Internet Storm Center&lt;/a&gt; is reporting a 100% packet loss on certain routers. A sample &lt;a href="w%3Aping"&gt;ping test&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; to Wikinews came up with a 380 millisecond average round trip at 50% packet loss.

The financial markets are facing an even more alarming situation, with financial news and stock quotes from the U.S. and Europe not being able to reach Asian markets.

Repairing the lines "is not a matter of days," says Hong Seoung-Yong, a ministry official from South Korea handling the problem. 

Taiwan's internet capacity has dropped to 40%, and consequently the networks there are jammed. Service providers may choose to bypass those lines in favour of European ones, say a spokesman for Japanese telecoms firm KDDI Corp, Satoru Ito.

The quake took place exactly two years from the day that the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20Earthquake"&gt;2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake&lt;/a&gt; struck, devastating Southeast Asia. That 2004 earthquake registered as a magnitude 9.1, and caused a tsunami with waves reaching as high as 33 feet.

According to the Tribunal spokesman Raed Jouhi, the Iraqi High Tribunal's appeals court in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; confirms the sentence of death against the former &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i President &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, after a month and a half of trial review. 

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, no sentence has been notified to Saddam Hussein yet.

On November 5, Hussein was sentenced to death for his role in the &lt;a href="w%3ADujail%20massacre"&gt;Dujail massacre&lt;/a&gt; in 1982, in which 148 Shiites died.

According to Iraqi laws, Hussein would be hanged within 30 days, and there is no chance of pardon.

Reports say that hundreds of people are dead after a gasoline pipeline exploded in the northern suburbs of &lt;a href="w%3ALagos%2C%20Nigeria"&gt;Lagos, Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. 

"Some of the bodies were so burnt that it would be difficult to recognize them as those of human beings," said one Red Cross official, Kingsley Amori.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; says that many of the victims can only be identified by looking at the remains of their skulls. Estimates suggest that 200-900 people were killed, and another 60 people received medical treatment.

"The bodies are scattered over the ground. We can't get close enough because the fire is still burning. We cannot confirm how many hundreds were killed." said secretary-general of the Nigerian Red Cross, Ige Oladimeji.

The explosion is believed to have been caused by vandalization in the pipeline. Reports say that thieves used a drill to punch a hole in the pipeline in order to steal gasoline, which is sold on the &lt;a href="w%3Ablack%20market"&gt;black market&lt;/a&gt;.

Fuel was being pumped into the pipes to be distributed for consumer use when it exploded. The pipeline is operated by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which is owned by the State of Nigeria. Workers have stopped pumping fuel through the pipelines.

The High Island Pipeline began to leak on Sunday and was immediately shut down when a pressure loss was detected. The pipeline is owned by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APlains%20All%20American%20Pipeline"&gt;Plains All American Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who state that the incident is "under investigation" and that officials are working to "minimize the impact of the incident."

"A medium crude oil pipeline ruptured 30 miles southeast of Galveston, Texas, and leaked approximately 21,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico Sunday, December 24," said a press release by Coast Guard.

"There's a 60-yard-wide oil sheen that extends for about half a mile. It is still leaking slowly, about 80 to 400 gallons a day," added the Coast Guard.

Reports say that the oil is traveling away from any shoreline and that remaining oil is being suctioned out of the pipeline. Ships in the area have not been diverted.

"All appropriate agencies have been notified. Plains, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Texas General Land Office are working within a unified command system consisting of Federal and state agencies and oil spill response organizations to manage and mitigate this incident. In addition, Plains has activated its spill response plan to contain and clean up the spill. At present, Plains has mobilized Airborne Support, Inc., Clean Gulf Associates and other additional resources in an effort to minimize the consequences of the incident," said a press release by the Plains oil company.

So far, no injuries have been reported.

National security adviser for &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Mouwafak al-Rubaie, has confirmed that &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; is to be executed within 30 days of losing his appeal at the High Tribunal Court. Mr. al-Rubaie said: "The appeals court approved the verdict to hang Saddam." Following the announcement, approximately 20 people were killed and 12 people injured in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, in a bomb explosion and a mortar attack.

The decision requires ratification by the Iraqi president, Jalal Talabani who personally opposes the death penalty. However President Talabani has given legal permission for one of Iraq's two vice-presidents to sign death orders.

Mr. Hussein was first sentenced to death on November 5 when he was convicted of murdering 148 Shi'ite's in Shi'ite village, Dujail, following an assassination attempt. Mr. Hussein claims that those killed were found guilty in an Iraq court of law. Others who were involved will also be hanged, those people include Mr. Hussein's half-brother and chief of intelligence, &lt;a href="w%3ABarzan%20Ibrahim%20al-Tikriti"&gt;Barzan Ibrahim&lt;/a&gt; and head of the Revolutionary Court in Iraq who issued the death orders against the Shi'ites, &lt;a href="w%3AAwad%20Hamed%20al-Bander"&gt;Awad Hamed al-Bander&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ATaha%20Yassin%20Ramadan"&gt;Taha Yassin Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;, former vice-president of Iraq, had been given life imprisonment but an appeals court found that was lenient and have asked the High Tribunal Court to give Mr. Ramadan the death sentence.

Scott Stanzel, spokesman for the White House, said that the decision was an "important milestone in the Iraqi people's efforts to replace the rule of a tyrant with the rule of law. The Iraqis deserve praise for continuing to utilise the institutions of democracy to pursue justice. Saddam Hussein has received due process and legal rights that he denied the Iraqi people for so long, so this is an important day for the Iraqi people."

Raed Juhi, spokesman for the High Tribunal Court, said: "The Iraqi judicial system would ensure that Saddam is executed even if Talabani and the two vice presidents do not ratify the decision. We'll implement the verdict by the power of the law."

In December 2003, Mr. Hussein was found hiding in a hole north of Baghdad with a pistol which hadn't been fired.

During the trial, which was televised all throughout Iraq and the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. Hussein was kicked out of the courtroom for repeatedly giving harangues. The others also given the death sentence showed up during the trial with only underwear on and sat with their backs to the judges. Also during the trial, three lawyers acting on behalf of the defense and one witness were murdered.

The alleged Russian spy who called himself Paul William Hampel was deported out of Canada on Tuesday. It is believed by &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Service"&gt;CSIS&lt;/a&gt;, the Canadian intelligence agency, that Hampel was part of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service.

Justice Pierre Blais, who took his case, ordered the alleged Russian spy's deportation on December 4th. &lt;a href="w%3ACustoms%20Canada"&gt;Customs Canada&lt;/a&gt; sent the man to the airport at 11:00 p.m. on Christmas Day. The man arrived in the Russian capital at 7:35 the next day.

Public Safety Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStockwell%20Day"&gt;Stockwell Day&lt;/a&gt; said that Russia provided papers to allow the man to return to his home country. 

"He was closely monitored the whole time," Day told the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Press"&gt;Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. "We didn't think he was a risk to flee but the usual procedures were in place." 

"As this case demonstrates, individuals who do not respect our laws and threaten the safety of our communities are not welcome in Canada."

Day also said the incident would not ruin Canada's relations with Russia. 

"We understand that these things go on in the world, the Russians understand that also."

The man, when he was in Montreal's federal court, said that he is a Russian citizen that is in Canada illegally. The judge, who took his case, allowed Hampel's true identity to remain secret. When Hampel was arrested he was carrying more than $7,800 in many currencies and three mobile phones.

Hampel stayed in Canada for about 10 years.

Following a bill, which was passed with approximately 81% by the 207 MPs attending, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Iran"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wants Iran to review its compliance with the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first time since the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20Revolution"&gt;1979 revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that a bill was passed in five minutes. This bill was given double-urgency status, making it a higher priority over everything else. This passage occurs after the UN implemented sanctions against Iran for continuing its nuclear program; the new law permits for Iran to continue its program against the UN's wishes.

This new law allows President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; to take action about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20program%20in%20Iran"&gt;the use of nuclear energy in Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , including establishing conditions of inspections by the &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt;. However, the bill does not authorize the complete end of inspections.

The UN's atomic agency's governors may meet in January to consider imposing more sanctions if Iran does not end its nuclear program 60 days after the sanctions imposed on Saturday by the &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;.

Iran is considering withdrawing from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

José Luis García Sabrido, the chief surgeon at Gregorio Marañón hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt; who treated 80-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AFidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; last week, announced that the intestinal bleeding which led to surgery was not caused from cancer. Rather, he had a "benign illness" with a series of complications. He is currently recovering from a serious operation. When asked if Castro had cancer, Sabrido responded, "From what I know, I absolutely deny it."

Sabrido refuses to declare which caused Castro's illness, keeping in the Cuban government's wishes, however ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ says &lt;a href="w%3Adiverticulitis"&gt;diverticulitis&lt;/a&gt; is a common, non-cancerous cause of intestinal bleeding.

US politicians still believe that Castro is seriously ill; there is speculation in and among Cuban exiles that Castro has &lt;a href="w%3Acolon%20cancer"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20D.%20Negroponte"&gt;John D. Negroponte&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Director%20of%20National%20Intelligence"&gt;United States Director of National Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, told ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Washington%20Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ that Castro is "terminally ill" and will be dead in "months, not years."

Fidel Castro transferred his position to his brother Raul on July 31 due to intestinal surgery. The Cuban government has since kept his health situation relatively secret; this is the first time a medical expert outside the Cuban government has commented on his health since he dropped from the public view in July.

According to recent reports, Castro will be healthy enough to be President of Cuba again.

A &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20airways"&gt;British airways&lt;/a&gt; flight from &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%2C%20Florida"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt; containing British prime minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; has missed a taxiway at Miami airport. The &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20747-400"&gt;Boeing 747-400&lt;/a&gt; plane hit lights as it was turning off the runway onto a taxiway &lt;a href="w%3Ataxiing"&gt;taxiing&lt;/a&gt; at 1815 local time on Tuesday evening (2315 GMT).

The pilot couldn't see the correct taxiway due to poor lighting, said British Airways spokesman John Lampl.

Prime minister Tony Blair, with his family, was on his way to stay with &lt;a href="w%3ABee%20Gees"&gt;Bee Gees&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a href="w%3ARobin%20Gibb"&gt;Robin Gibb&lt;/a&gt; at his house in Miami Beach when the incident occurred. The plane and all 343 passengers onboard were not damaged or hurt.

A U.S. safety board has said that it's now investigating the incident.

The president of &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; has sent a letter to &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; which was delivered by the &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Iran%29"&gt;Iranian Foreign Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AManouchehr%20Mottaki"&gt;Manouchehr Mottaki&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AVatican%20City"&gt;Vatican City&lt;/a&gt; has not released the contents or details of the letter, but news agencies in Iran report that the letter contains a discussion about the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; resolution against Iran, which imposes sanctions.

In a statement, the Pope said that he "reaffirms the role that the Holy See intends to carry out for world peace, not as a political authority but as a religious and moral one ... so that peoples' problems will always be solved in dialogue, mutual understanding and peace."

Ehsan Jahandideh, a spokeperson for the President of Iran's office, states that the letter "is completely non-political. The president has emphasized in the message that cooperation of divine religions will help resolving problems of mankind."

There is no word on whether or not the contents of the letter will be released to the public.

A telescope designed to find earth-like planets outside our solar system was launched on a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20launch%20vehicle"&gt;Soyuz rocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; inside the country of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The project, which is known as ♡❤♡&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACOROT"&gt;COROT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤♡ or COnvection ROtation and planetary Transits, is led by the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;.

"Our Corot satellite has been put into orbit today perfectly by a Soyuz rocket," said president of National French Space Studies Center, Yannick d’Escatha.

The telescope will remain in space for at least 2 years to hunt down and find other planets. The telescope will begin to first monitor the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMilky%20Way"&gt;Milky Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . After approximately 150 days of monitoring, the telescope will then begin to watch the constellation &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrion"&gt;Orion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Every 150 days the telescope is expected to monitor a new area of space.

The telescope will take images of light that a star puts off and then watch for the brightness of that star to dim, which usually means a planet has crossed in front of the star. Scientists hope to find at least 10-40 planets, and additional gas giants.

"Such planets would represent a new, as yet undiscovered, class of world that astronomers believe exists. With Corot, astronomers expect to find between 10-40 of them, together with tens of new gas giants," said a spokesman for the E.S.A..

The telescope contains a camera, equipment to communicate with the scientists, direction controls and temperature detection.

"Corot will be able to find extra-solar planets of all sizes and natures, contrary to what we can do from the ground at the moment. We expect to obtain a better vision of planet systems beyond the solar system, about the distribution of planet sizes. And finally, it will allow us to estimate the likelihood of there existing planets resembling the Earth in the neighbourhood of the sun or further away in the galaxy," said one researcher on the project, Claude Catala.

The telescope weighs nearly 1,500 pounds.

Some pieces of the luggage have name tags and Clark states that "we're trying to reach whoever we need to let them know the bags are there."

Officers with the Houston Police Department are in charge of the investigation. The luggage was found by individuals who own the pet store.

The &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; has stated that the bags do not pose any danger.

"Today the Interior Department's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to list polar bears as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. We are making this proposal because a scientific review of the species by the Fish and Wildlife service found that populations may be threatened by receding sea ice, which polar bears use as a platform for many activities essential to their life cycle, including hunting for their main prey, Arctic seals," said Dirk Kempthorne, the Secretary of the Interior in the U.S.

"[Polar bears are] one of nature's ultimate survivors, but we are concerned the polar bears' habitat may literally be melting," added Kempthorne.

"[We have never had a species] listed with such a close correlation to climate change as this one," said an attorney with Natural Resources Defense Council, Andrew Wetzler.

"Global warming is the single biggest threat to polar bears' survival, and this will require the government to address the impacts on the polar bear," added Wetzler.

The "threatened" category encompasses "vulnerable," "endangered," and "critically endangered." Currently, polar bears are listed as "vulnerable" under the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Conservation%20Union"&gt;World Conservation Union&lt;/a&gt;.

Although the United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service makes no formal mention of increasing or decreasing polar bear population within US borders or worldwide, it is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 25,000 polar bears living&lt;a href="http%3A//www.polarbearsinternational.org/bear-facts/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some 4,700 are living in the state of Alaska&lt;a href="http%3A//www.fws.gov/home/feature/2006/polarbear.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and about 15,000 live in Canada&lt;a href="http%3A//www.churchillscience.ca/index.php%3Fpage%3Dab_attrac_bears"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.polarbearsinternational.org/bear-facts/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Speed skater &lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Klassen"&gt;Cindy Klassen&lt;/a&gt; was voted as the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3ABobbie%20Rosenfeld%20Award"&gt;Bobbie Rosenfeld Award's&lt;/a&gt; female athlete of the year, on Wednesday. Her second time winning the honour, she was given the award for winning five medals at the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;2006 winter Olympic games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATurin%2C%20Italy"&gt;Turin, Italy&lt;/a&gt;, in February.

Klassen had 131 of 144 first-place ballots in voting by sports editors and broadcasters. The editors and broadcasters were surveyed by the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Press"&gt;Canadian Press&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcast%20News"&gt;Broadcast News&lt;/a&gt;. She finished at 412 points in the Canadian Press award voting. &lt;a href="w%3AClara%20Hughes"&gt;Clara Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, of Winnipeg, was second with 104 points and three first-place votes.

&lt;a href="w%3AHayley%20Wickenheiser"&gt;Hayley Wickenheiser&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href="w%3AShaunavon%2C%20Saskatchewan"&gt;Shaunavon, Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt;, had five first-place votes and finished third with 83 points. Wickenheiser helped the Canadian women's hockey team win Olympic gold in Turin.

"There were so many good moments," Klassen said. "I just had so much fun with my team at the Games."

Klassen will also be racing in the &lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;2010 winter Olympic games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; and in nearby &lt;a href="w%3AWhistler%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Whistler, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, a popular snow skiing destination.

"It's such a tremendous opportunity, to be able to race in your home country and have the home crowd," Klassen said. "You have such a huge advantage." 

"I'll be 30 then. I hope I get stronger and that I'll be peaking at that age," she said. "As I've seen with a lot of speed skaters, your career goes up and down. I'll just keep trying and hope for the best."

Klassen, a &lt;a href="w%3AWinnipeg%2C%20Manitoba"&gt;Winnipeg, Manitoba&lt;/a&gt; native, was also awarded the &lt;a href="w%3ALou%20Marsh%20Trophy"&gt;Lou Marsh Trophy&lt;/a&gt; this year. Her five medals made her Canada's most decorated Olympian. She also won the &lt;a href="w%3Abronze%20medal"&gt;bronze medal&lt;/a&gt; in the 3,000 at &lt;a href="w%3ASalt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; gold-medalist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMyriam%20B%C3%A9dard"&gt;Myriam Bédard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is facing a January 5 extradition hearing from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, after she was arrested and charged with abducting her 12-year old daughter Maude. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABiathalon"&gt;Biathalon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; athlete is arguing she should be allowed to return to Canada on her own.

Bédard had taken her daughter to &lt;a href="Washington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; with her new husband, Nima Mazhari, on October 2, violating the terms of her divorce settlement from Biathalon coach Jean Paquet. Mazhari, who is a sculptor, was charged with the unrelated theft of $100,000 worth of paintings last year.

Paquet filed a report with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQuebec%20Provincial%20Police"&gt;Sûreté du Québec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on December 8, stating that Bédard had violated the divorce terms, and an international &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aarrest%20warrant"&gt;arrest warrant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was issued.

On December 20, the case was brought to the attention of &lt;a href="Interpol"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt;, and two days later the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Marshals%20Service"&gt;United States Marshals Service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; announced her arrest in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AColumbia%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, at a hotel celebrating Maude's 12th birthday. Maude was taken into the custody of the Marshals Service for three days, before being returned to her natural father.

Defence attorney John Pepper is arguing that the United States should be obligated to release Bédard on bail as she hasn't been formally charged with any crime, pending her extradition to Canada, where she faces two charges, child abduction and violating a custody order.

Pepper is also arguing that the three-time Olympic medalist was seeking refuge from "bureaucratic terrorism" in Canada, a claim that Bédard made in a letter she sent to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; and US ambassador &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Wilkins"&gt;David Wilkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; explaining why she was leaving Canada.

Bédard gave testimony during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASponsorship%20scandal"&gt;Sponsorship scandal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where she stunned the courts by alleging that advertising firms had been engaged in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anarcotics"&gt;narcotics trafficking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , that her current husband was responsible for the decision not to send the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Forces"&gt;Canadian Forces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href="Formula%20One"&gt;Formula One&lt;/a&gt; driver &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Villeneuve"&gt;Jacques Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had been paid $12 million to wear a Canadian flag, claims that were not verified by other sources.

Bédard is facing growing doubts about her mental state, which her attorney says are attempts to "belittle" her, due to personal grudges and her role in the scandal.

&lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Pannella"&gt;Marco Pannella&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Parliament"&gt;European Parliament&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt;) and leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ANonviolent%20Radical%20Party"&gt;Nonviolent Radical Party&lt;/a&gt;, started a thirst and hunger strike to protest the death sentence against former &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i leader &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;.

"The Iraqi government would commit a horrible act, of the same level as those committed by Saddam Hussein himself," Pannella said yesterday in a statement on the &lt;a href="http%3A//coranet.radicalparty.org/pressreleases/press_release.php%3Ffunc%3Ddetail%26amp%3Bpar%3D8158"&gt;party's Web site&lt;/a&gt;.

Granting clemency to the former Iraqi leader would be "an extraordinary occasion, to make literally explode in the hearth of the Middle East and in the world, an immense act of peace and a debate among the peoples and consciences, the scandal of nonviolence as an alternative to dictatorships and to the war; a war that now, more than ever, is impending on humanity".

"In 2003", he said, "despite the vote by a large majority of the Italian Parliament calling for the exile of Saddam Hussein as an alternative to the war, and for a free Iraq, both the Italian Government and the parliamentary opposition, did not follow up to that vital decision. Saddam Hussein was aware of our initiative. He could remember it now with gratitude and regret for not accepting it. A living Saddam Hussein, could become an essential and unique instrument to pacify and deligitize the 'army', made up of gangs of assassins, which is continuously committing massacres against the Iraqi people".

&lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Pannella"&gt;Marco Pannella&lt;/a&gt;, aged 76, has been at the forefront in Italy of the promotion of important reforms regarding narcotics, facing incarceration on various occasions for his civil disobediences. 
Engaged in the defence of civil rights in Eastern European countries, in 1968, he was arrested in Sofia for having distributed leaflets against the Communist regime. He is one of the first promoters and founders of the “Green” and “ecologist” political movements in Europe.

On August 12, 2006, as reported by news agencies, Marco Pannella made a bold new proposal for World Peace, composed of three elements:

A New Zealand doctor has taken a "stupid step" as he has started smoking in protest of a three-day strike being held by &lt;a href="w%3ARadiography"&gt;radiographers&lt;/a&gt;.

Doctor Chris Wynne, clinical director of radiation oncology at &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20hospitals%20in%20New%20Zealand%23Canterbury"&gt;Christchurch Hospital&lt;/a&gt; and a senior cancer treatment specialist, has described his actions as stupid but has said that this was the only action he could take to highlight that around 250 cancer patients are going to suffer during the strikes. Dr Wynne said: "I've tried everything sensible so now I am doing something stupid. Appealing to common sense hasn't solved these strikes."

The national secretary of the radiation therapists union sympathises with Dr Wynne. Deborah Powell, said: "I agree with him [Dr Wynne] that this situation is stupid and I can understand his feelings of frustration because we are frustrated too."

The strike is over pay disputes and is due for January 9, 2007 and will last for three days. But Dr Wynne disagrees that the strikes are over pay because: "The doctors have said if they tell us what the difference is in the money we will make it up, so it isn't even about the money any more." Dr Wynne said that no one responded to the offer.

Ms Powell said: "However, the problem is the DHBs &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20Health%20Board%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;District Health Board&lt;/a&gt;s&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and their offer. We are losing staff to Australia because pay and working conditions are better and we need to change that. If this doctor [Dr Wynne] wants to help he should be sitting on Gordon Davies' [chief executive of the &lt;a href="w%3AState%20sector%20organisations%20in%20New%20Zealand%23District%20Health%20Boards%20.28DHBs.29"&gt;Canterbury DHB&lt;/a&gt; and national DHB spokesman] doorstep and asking him about money."

"The union and management are so close but they don't seem to be able to resolve this," Dr Wynne said.

Dr Wynne said that he had smoked as a teenager. But despite that he is still going to smoke until the pay disputes are over, "as long as it takes."

Sneha Paul, spokeswoman for &lt;a href="w%3AAction%20on%20Smoking%20and%20Health"&gt;Action on Smoking and Health&lt;/a&gt;, said: "Smoking is the single largest cause of preventable deaths, so we would recommend he found another way to express his concern. Every cigarette does you damage."

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AA-League"&gt;A-League&lt;/a&gt; club &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20FC"&gt;Sydney FC&lt;/a&gt; has been docked three competition points by &lt;a href="w%3AFootball%20Federation%20Australia"&gt;Football Federation Australia&lt;/a&gt; (FFA) after it was found guilty of breaching the Player Contracting Regulations.

The FFA stated that the offences warranted a &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;A$&lt;/a&gt;259,000 fine as well as a three-point deduction, however it considered ♡❤"the cooperation and full disclosure provided by the current Sydney FC Board and Management to the FFA"♡❤ during the investigation process, and reduced the penalty to a A$129,000 fine plus two competition points deducted.

However, this most recent breach also activated a one-point &lt;a href="w%3ASuspended%20sentence"&gt;suspended penalty&lt;/a&gt; issued to Sydney FC in August 2006 for previous breaches of the salary cap, increasing the total points lost during this case to three.

This latest breach also incurred a suspended penalty of a one-point deduction which will automatically be activated for any breaches during seasons &lt;a href="w%3AA-League%202006-07"&gt;2006-07&lt;/a&gt; or 2007-08.

In a &lt;a href="http%3A//a-league.com.au/default.aspx%3Fs%3Dnewsdisplay%26amp%3Bid%3D6486%26amp%3Bpageid%3D11"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released on the official A-League website, ♡❤"the [FFA] Board determined that the following breaches had occurred: an undisclosed payment made to a player; pre-payments from the Club to players; and payments made by the Club to agents of the players"♡❤.

Sydney FC, the &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20A-League%20champions"&gt;defending champions&lt;/a&gt; of the A-League, will not be deducted the competition points immediately and has one week to appeal. If Sydney decides not to appeal the FFA decision, the points will be removed on &lt;a href="w%3AJanuary%205"&gt;January 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2007"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Sportal, the club has notified the FFA it intends to appeal the decision, however no formal confirmation has been published. Sydney FC have said in a &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DSydney_FC_loses_competition_points%26amp%3Baction%3Dedit"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on their website that ♡❤"the club will consider its options regarding the decision before issuing a further statement"♡❤.

Sydney is currently sitting in second position on the &lt;a href="w%3AA-League%202006-07%23League%20table"&gt;2006-07 A-League table&lt;/a&gt; and the three-point reduction would see it fall to third place.

A &lt;a href="w%3ATrain"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; has crashed into a &lt;a href="w%3ABus"&gt;bus&lt;/a&gt; in a suburb of &lt;a href="w%3AMexico%20City"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The bus and train slid along the &lt;a href="w%3ARail%20tracks"&gt;track&lt;/a&gt; for more than 100 &lt;a href="w%3AYard"&gt;yards&lt;/a&gt; (approx. 90 &lt;a href="w%3AMetre"&gt;metres&lt;/a&gt;), according to witnesses.

The collision has killed at least 24 people and injured 12 more, according to &lt;a href="w%3APolice"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; and other Mexican authorities.

Another department spokesman, Octavio Campos, said that 19 bodies had been recovered from the wreckage of the bus, and that two of the 12 people initially listed as injured later died in the hospital.

The incident occurred as the bus headed north on a highway in &lt;a href="w%3ACuautitl%C3%A1n"&gt;Cuautitlán&lt;/a&gt;. The bus collided with the 36-&lt;a href="w%3ARailroad%20car"&gt;carriage&lt;/a&gt; train as it crossed the tracks in the industrial area.

The bus driver apparently misjudged the speed at which the train was traveling, thinking he could beat it across the &lt;a href="w%3ALevel%20crossing"&gt;level crossing&lt;/a&gt;.

The bus driver was &lt;a href="w%3AArrest"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; following the crash, and according to officials, was trying to flee the scene. The train conductor was also detained for questioning. The train was pulling 36 empty wagons at the time on the incident.

Juan Carlos Herrera, an emergency worker at the scene, said the casualties were all from Mexico.

Several companies that designed the encryption system for &lt;a href="w%3ADVD"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt;s with a &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20definition%20television"&gt;high definition&lt;/a&gt; are currently analyzing the claim of a hacker, who said to have cracked the code protecting new generation DVDs from illegal copying. This was stated by a representative of one of the companies on Thursday, December 28.

Muslix64 is the name of the hacker that announced the details of the process he performed in order to unlock the encryption. The purpose of the Advanced Access Content System (&lt;a href="w%3AAdvanced%20Access%20Content%20System"&gt;AACS&lt;/a&gt;) is to prevent pirate copying. It is supposed to restrict the devices that are able to play the DVDs. 

Such companies like &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Walt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt; Co., &lt;a href="w%3AIntel%20Corporation"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; Corp., &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; Corp., &lt;a href="w%3AToshiba"&gt;Toshiba&lt;/a&gt; Corp. and &lt;a href="w%3ASony"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; Corp. were the ones to create the encryption so to defend the high-definition formats. The latter encompass ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AHD%20DVD"&gt;HD-DVD&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ format developed by Toshiba, with a series of other corporations, and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABlu-ray%20disc"&gt;Blu-ray&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ format developed by Sony and its partners in this enterprise.

The hacker launched on a famous hacker website his decryption codes and posted a short film on a video site. The film displayed the process of copying several films, like "&lt;a href="w%3AFull%20Metal%20Jacket"&gt;Full Metal Jacket&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Bros."&gt;Warner Bros&lt;/a&gt; and "&lt;a href="w%3AVan%20Helsing"&gt;Van Helsing&lt;/a&gt;" brought by &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Studios"&gt;Universal Studios&lt;/a&gt;. 

Muslix64 also mentioned that he is going to post some more source codes on the second day of the New Year. According to his words the codes will allow copying a wider variety of titles.

The inability of companies to protect their production could find themselves in a difficult situation. This concerns especially those that have the goal of boosting their revenues. They are aware of the fact that the standard DVD format is not as popular as it was. The sales of DVD movies in 2005 gained around 24 billion dollars for the industry of movie making.

The technology expert Adrian Kingsley-Hughes wrote on the ZDNet.com (tech-site) that the decryption code developed by Muslix64 looks quite genuine. He also mentioned that the decryption code for HD-DVD might give some advantages for those that look forward to backup discs. However in general none of the rival formats will be in advantage of this possible hack.

Saddam Hussein is reported by BBC to be already executed, at around 6:05 Baghdad time today.

10:22PM EST, CBS broke into Friday night coverage to report Saddam was executed.

As of 10:00PM EST, the nation of Iraq was awaiting word of Saddam's execution. 

The custody of &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; has been turned over to the Iraqi government and a judge, who is to be present during the execution of the former Iraqi dictator, says that the execution will take place no later than Saturday.

One of Nouri al-Maliki's advisers has stated that the execution will be carried out by 6 a.m. on Saturday (10 p.m. Friday EST).

"A few minutes ago we received correspondence from the Americans saying that President Saddam Hussein is no longer under the control of United States forces," said a statement by Hussein's lawyers.

At least one judge has stated that the execution could take place as early as "today."

"Saddam will be executed today or tomorrow. All the measures have been done," said Munir Haddad, an appeal's court judge who upheld the vedict to have Hussein executed. Mr. Haddad is expected to be present during Hussein's execution.

"I am ready to attend and there is no reason for delay," added Haddad.

Not everyone agrees that Hussein should be executed. The Prime Minister of &lt;a href="w%3AYemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt; is trying to urge U.S. President George W. Bush to stop the execution from taking place.

"The Yemeni government urges [Bush] to intercede to prevent this sentence from being carried out ... as it would lead to more internal strife and suffering for the Iraqi people," said a letter to Bush from Yemeni P.M., &lt;a href="w%3AAbdul-Qader%20Bagammal"&gt;Abdul-Qader Bagammal&lt;/a&gt;.

He is expected to be hanged on a custom-made gallows that has been kept in Camp Cropper, a U.S. military prison at Baghdad airport where Hussein has been imprisoned.

Real estate tycoon &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAnderson%20Cooper%20360%C2%B0"&gt;Anderson Cooper 360&lt;/a&gt; reacted to &lt;a href="w%3ARosie%20O%27Donnell"&gt;Rosie O'Donnell's&lt;/a&gt; comments about him on the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20View"&gt;The View&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. 

"Rosie has some real problems," Trump said on Anderson Cooper 360. "Rosie's a loser. She's been a loser always."

It started when &lt;a href="w%3AMiss%20USA"&gt;Miss USA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATara%20Conner"&gt;Tara Conner&lt;/a&gt; was caught under age drinking. Trump, the owner of the Miss Universe Organization, gave her a second chance. Rosie O'Donnell called him a "Pimp" on her personal blog and said he has no right to be "the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America" on ♡❤The View♡❤, which she co-hosts.

"Rosie got mentally beaten up by me," Trump told The Post yesterday, "because she's a mental midget, a low-life." 

"It's too bad a degenerate is able to get away with things like that," Trump said yesterday. "I met Tara the night of the pageant and didn't see her again until she got into trouble."

Trump said that he would sue her over her comment.

"It will never end on my behalf because I've exposed Rosie for what she is: a very dumb human being," Trump told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. "She's got no intelligence, but I've known that for a long time. Unfortunately, Rosie's pulled the wool over the public."

When CNN contacted O'Donnell, one of her representatives said she was unavailable for comment. CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 also said that she is welcome to comment anytime.

<h2>Blog post</h2>

O'Donnell's blog post is read as follows:

♡❤"a young girl in nyc
&lt;br&gt;meets a pimp
&lt;br&gt;he cons her into a life of illusion
&lt;br&gt;she works for him
&lt;br&gt;no fun — no f******g — no future
&lt;br&gt;she is owned
&lt;br&gt;when she sneaks out on her own
&lt;br&gt;to party the night away
&lt;br&gt;he freaks
&lt;br&gt;he roughs her up a bit
&lt;br&gt;shames her in front of the others
&lt;br&gt;teaches her to behave
&lt;/br&gt;for his own benefit"♡❤

<h1>Ice shelf breaks free in Canadian Arctic</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ice%20shelf%20breaks%20free%20in%20Canadian%20Arctic&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AAyles%20Ice%20Shelf"&gt;Ayles ice shelf&lt;/a&gt;, which is more than 11,000 football fields in size and is located just south of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Pole"&gt;North Pole&lt;/a&gt;, has broken free in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Arctic"&gt;Canadian Arctic&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists say that global warming has played a "major" role in the break.

The entire 41 square miles of the shelf broke away from &lt;a href="w%3AEllesmere%20Island"&gt;Ellesmere Island&lt;/a&gt; at least 16 months ago, and the break was discovered when a satellite took pictures of the region recently.

"This is a dramatic and disturbing event. It shows that we are losing remarkable features of the Canadian North that have been in place for many thousands of years. We are crossing climate thresholds, and these may signal the onset of accelerated change ahead," said Warwick Vincent, a &lt;a href="w%3AUniversit%C3%A9%20Laval"&gt;Laval University&lt;/a&gt; scientist who studies conditions in the Arctic.

Higher temperatures are believed to have played a significant role in the break, and all 6 shelves in the Canadian Arctic have become at least 90% smaller since they were discovered in the early 1900's.

"It [the break] is consistent with climate change. We aren't able to connect all of the dots, but unusually warm temperatures definitely played a major role," added Vincent.

&lt;a href="w%3ASeismograph"&gt;Seismographs&lt;/a&gt; detected the break and collapse of the shelf in August of 2005. The short amount of time it took for the event to occur has come as a surprise to scientists.

"What surprised us was how quickly it happened. Even 10 years ago scientists assumed that when global warming changes occur that it would happen gradually, so that perhaps we expected these ice shelves just to melt away quite slowly. It's pretty alarming," said head of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Ottawa"&gt;University of Ottawa's&lt;/a&gt; global ice lab, Luke Copland.

United States &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; announced that cloned meat and milk from specific animals was "...as safe as the food we eat every day." An FDA spokesperson also added that there where "No unique risks for human food consumption...".

Coming after a lengthy study, the move is likely to meet with opposition from U.S. consumers, despite the final decision having still to be made.

Consumer groups have met the announcement with caution. Carol Foreman, a spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Consumer%20Federation"&gt;Consumer Federation&lt;/a&gt;, was quoted as calling the move "a very bad decision".

Exiled Chechen emissary &lt;a href="w%3AAkhmed%20Zakayev"&gt;Akhmed Zakayev&lt;/a&gt; revealed that although dissident Russian ex-spy &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Litvinenko"&gt;Alexander Litvinenko&lt;/a&gt; had converted to Islam on his deathbed, he had been considering such a move for a long time. &lt;a href="w%3AFreeMediaOnline.org"&gt;FreeMediaOnline.org&lt;/a&gt; reported that Mr. Zakayev comments on Mr. Litvinenko's conversion to Islam were made in an interview for the &lt;a href="w%3AVoice%20of%20America"&gt;Voice of America&lt;/a&gt; (VOA) Russian program which aired Friday.

Mr. Zakayev said that Mr. Litvinenko grew up in the North Caucasus among Muslims and was always interested in their religion. According to Mr. Zakayev, Mr. Litvineko was ashamed of Russia's actions in the Chechen war and this also influenced his conversion. Mr. Zakayev told VOA that Mr. Litvinenko wanted to show that not all Russians behave the same way as those responsible for atrocities in Chechnya.

Mr. Zakayev was granted political asylum in Great Britain and the British government has refused Moscow's requests for his extradition. The Russian authorities accuse Mr. Zakayev of foreknowledge of terrorist attacks and other crimes involving hundreds of killings and captures of Russian servicemen during the separatist wars in Chechnya. He has denied these accusations.

Alexander Litvinkenko died in 2006 after a three-week struggle with effects of radiation poisoning. Before his death, Litvinenko accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of ordering his death. Since then, British and Russian investigators have found numerous traces of a rare radioactive element that caused Litvinenko's death, although no connection to Putin has been found.

Exiled Russian businessman and President Putin's critic &lt;a href="w%3ABoris%20Berezovsky"&gt;Boris Berezovsky&lt;/a&gt; dismissed the latest accusations by Moscow in the Litvinenko poisoning case as moving beyond absurd into the realm of science fiction.

Mr. Berezovsky was reacting to the Russian Prosecutor-General’s Office announcement on Wednesday that it suspected Israel-based former Russian oil billionaire &lt;a href="w%3ALeonid%20Nevzlin"&gt;Leonid Nevzlin&lt;/a&gt; might be involved in the death of &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Litvinenko"&gt;Alexander Litvinenko&lt;/a&gt;, who died in a London hospital on November 23 from exposure to the highly toxic radioactive substance polonium-210.

Mr. Nevzlin dismissed allegations by Moscow and said he had co-operated with the British authorities investigating the London murder of the dissident Russian ex-spy. The Russian government has unsuccessfully sought Mr. Nevzlin's and Mr. Berezovsky's extradition on charges of fraud. The Russian authorities have also accused Mr. Nevzlin of involvement in contract killings. Both men dismissed these accusations as politically motivated. Mr. Nevzlin, who lives in Israel, is now believed to be on a visit to the United States. Mr. Berezovsky received political asylum in Great Britain. 

In the Voice of America interview, Mr. Berezovsky said that the US government would not have allowed Mr. Nevzlin into the country if Washington gave the slightest credence to Moscow's accusations. "I know him personally, and these accusations have absolutely no basis in fact," Mr. Berezovsky told VOA.

After being driven out of &lt;a href="w%3AMogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;n troops, the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Islamic%20Courts"&gt;Council of Islamic Courts&lt;/a&gt; continues to struggle for power over . Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, the executive leader of the group, told the media that the Council of Islamic Courts has no intention of fleeing the country. "We will not run away from our enemies," he said. "We will never depart from Somalia. We will stay in our homeland."

On the same day, Ali Mohamed Gedi, Somalia's Prime Minister entered Mogadishu in an armoured 22-car convoy, for the first time in more than six months. "We were fighting for our political survival but with the will and the support of the people we are the winners," Gedi told the press. "We are here to start our work." Gedi greeted the crowds as he drove through the city, but some citizens did not have a warm welcome for him. In the north end of the city, protesters filled the streets and threw rocks at Ethiopian army vehicles.

Certain analysts fear a "&lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghan&lt;/a&gt; scenario", with a central government encircled by a nebula of independent armed Islamic groups. This situation could also attract foreign fighters from other parts of the Muslim world to join the Council of Islamic Courts in the conflict.

&lt;a href="w%3AMcDonald%27s"&gt;McDonald's&lt;/a&gt; is asking everyone who ate at a McDonald's restaurant located in &lt;a href="w%3AGreenlane"&gt;Greenlane, Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, in December 15, 2006, to go to their doctor after a worker tested positive for &lt;a href="w%3AHepatitis%20A"&gt;Hepatitis A&lt;/a&gt;.

Doctor Greg Simmons, medical officer of health in Auckland, said that it is possible for the food handler worker to have passed on the disease during 7:00 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;(NZDT)&lt;/a&gt; and 2:00 a.m. as he would have been in the most infectious stage of Hepatitis A and was not wearing gloves. According to a spokeswoman from McDonald's, Joanna Redfern-Hardisty, food handlers are not required to wear gloves but are required to have thoroughly washed their hands with antimicrobial soap. However Dr Simmons says that the infected worker usually wore gloves.

The shift the worker worked was the only one the worker handled food when he was infectious with Hepatitis A.

It is unknown how many people could have come into contact with food that the infected worker had prepared as Friday night is usually a busy night, according to Ms Redfern-Hardisty.

Dr Simmons says that if someone has been infected with Hepatitis A then they will currently be showing early symptoms. Those symptoms include being tired, no appetite, nausea and skin and eyes will show a yellowish colour. 

Ms Redfern-Hardisty, spokeswoman for McDonald's, confirmed that no more risk is being posed to customers. She said that it is currently unknown where the worker caught Hepatitis A but has stated that it was from an external source.

The worker has been suspended from work.

If you ate at the McDonalds located in Greenlane, Auckland, on late December 15, early December 16, then please either visit your doctor or ring the Auckland Regional Public Health Service on 096234600.

<h1>Saddam Hussein executed by hanging</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Saddam%20Hussein%20executed%20by%20hanging&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;, deposed president of Iraq, was executed shortly after 6:00 a.m. Saturday morning local time (0300 GMT) after he was &lt;a href="w%3ACapital%20punishment"&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; by an &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; court for &lt;a href="w%3ACrimes%20against%20humanity"&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt; 

Three Iraqi television channels first reported that Saddam Hussein was executed by hanging as ordered after a U.S. judge refused to stop the execution in a last-ditch attempt by the defendant late Friday. 

Saddam had been found guilty of killing more than 148 members of the &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; population. Witnesses to the execution gathered at the execution site, Baghdad’s "Green Zone." BBC News 24, however, has reported that the execution took place outside the "Green Zone", at a building known to the US Army as "Camp Justice".

"Saddam's body is in front of me," said an official in the prime minister's office. "It's over." The witness reported that celebrations broke out after Hussein was dead and that there was "dancing around the body."

Iraqi state television has shown Saddam going to his death and then his lifeless body after his death.

The executions of Hussein's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim Tikriti and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, president of the Revolutionary Iraqi Court, were postponed to a later date. Iraqi National Security Adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie announced this move, saying, "We wanted to have this day to have a historic distinction."

On CNN, Saddam's &lt;a href="w%3ADefence%20attorney"&gt;defence attorney&lt;/a&gt; alleged that the trial was "unfair" and that he and his co-counsel would fight for justice in Iraqi courts. 

&lt;a href="w%3ATikrit"&gt;Tikrit&lt;/a&gt;, the town Saddam hid out in until his capture in late 2003 is under lockdown for 4 days due to the threat of violence. Coalition forces within Iraq are on high alert for possible retaliation attacks. On Sunday, Hussein was buried in the village of Ouja right outside of Tikrit.

US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; released a statement commemorating the former dictator's death but also warned that roadside bombs and other routine acts of violence will not suddenly end with his execution: "Bringing Saddam Hussein to justice will not end the violence in Iraq but it is an important milestone on Iraq's course to becoming a &lt;a href="w%3Ademocracy"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt; that can govern, sustain, and defend itself, and be an ally in the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terror"&gt;War on Terror&lt;/a&gt;."

Meanwhile, many European nations appreciated Hussein facing justice but deplored the death penalty. "The &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; has a very consistent stand... on opposing the death penalty and it should not have been applied in this case either, even though there is no doubt about Saddam Hussein's guilt over serious violations against human rights," said Erkki Tuomioja, Finnish Foreign Minister and the current President of the European Union. Britain, France, Germany, and Russia, among others, also voiced a similar sentiment. The Vatican said that capital execution is always tragic news, even if it is about a person who has been guilty of grave crimes.

Around 9:00 a.m. local time (0800 UTC) today, an explosion occurred at &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid%20Barajas%20International%20Airport"&gt;Barajas International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;. 

A car bomb exploded in the Level-D Parking Garage of the recently completed Terminal 4. A Spanish official declared that the police first received a telephone call warning them about the bomb, and then a second call with the type of vehicle. The second caller claimed the attack for the &lt;a href="w%3ABasque%20nationalism"&gt;Basque nationalist&lt;/a&gt; group &lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the telephone call, the police could evacuate most of the area. One man is reported missing after the explosion, and 26 people including two police officers were reported to be injured in the blast. The terminal sustained serious damage, and the situation in the airport became chaotic on one of the busiest days of the year.

&lt;a href="w%3AArnaldo%20Otegi"&gt;Arnaldo Otegi&lt;/a&gt;, spokesman of ETA's political wing &lt;a href="w%3ABatasuna"&gt;Batasuna&lt;/a&gt;, did not condemn the attack, but said the peace talks are not interrupted by the explosion. The Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba condemned the attack, saying that it "breaks nine months without violence on the part of ETA, which breaks the permanent ceasefire." Only in June, the Spanish President &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt; announced peace talks with ETA. But tonight, Zapatero ordered the suspension of all dialogue, because "with violence, there can be no kind of dialogue."

&lt;a href="w%3AKiritimati"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Kiritimati, is preparing for the new year while only hours are left. The island, which is home to about 5,100 people, is the first country in the world to welcome the new year.

Christmas Island will kick off the new year at UTC+14 (05 am ET). Just 15 minutes later, clocks on &lt;a href="w%3AChatham%20Island"&gt;Chatham island&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; will hit midnight.

&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Samoa"&gt;American Samoa&lt;/a&gt; is the last country to enter 2007. That will happen at UTC-11 (6 am ET, Monday morning).

At least seven bomb blasts occurred early on New Year's Eve in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;. Two people were killed and dozens injured.

Four explosions went off almost simultaneously in different parts of &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s capital city, at around 6:00 p.m. local time (1100 GMT).

The first blast was in a bus-stop shelter at &lt;a href="w%3AVictory%20Monument%20%28Bangkok%29"&gt;Victory Monument&lt;/a&gt;, which is a busy hub for public transportation. Another blast occurred nearby. Five people were injured, and one of them died later at a hospital.

Another fatal attack was in the &lt;a href="w%3AKhlong%20Toei"&gt;Khlong Toei&lt;/a&gt; port district near the Na Ranong intersection, where a bomb hidden in a trash can near a Chinese spirit shrine exploded and injured seven people, one of them a 10-year-old girl. Another was a 61-year-old man who later died at a hospital. The blast caused a secondary explosion to some nearby cooking-gas cylinders.

Seventeen people were wounded in a blast at a police box near a Big C supermarket at the Saphan Kwai intersection. A witness there said a man dropped a grenade from a pedestrian bridge.

Another blast was at a police box on &lt;a href="w%3ASukhumvit%20Road"&gt;Sukhumvit&lt;/a&gt; Soi 62. There were no injuries.

A blast was reported at a police box in &lt;a href="w%3ANonthaburi%20Province"&gt;Nonthaburi Province&lt;/a&gt; on the northern outskirts of Bangkok. There was another explosion at a &lt;a href="w%3ATesco%20Lotus"&gt;Tesco Lotus&lt;/a&gt; store in Prachachuen, while another was planted in a trash bin at &lt;a href="w%3ASeacon%20Square"&gt;Seacon Square&lt;/a&gt;, a shopping mall in suburban Bangkok's &lt;a href="w%3APrawet"&gt;Prawet&lt;/a&gt; district. A bomb squad was able to defuse the device without mishap. 

Other suspicious packages are being investigated by police at locations throughout the capital, the iTV network in Thailand has reported. The New Year's countdown at &lt;a href="w%3ACentralWorld"&gt;CentralWorld&lt;/a&gt; was held at around 9:00 p.m. with police and Bangkok Governor &lt;a href="w%3AApirak%20Kosayothin"&gt;Apirak Kosayothin&lt;/a&gt; then urging the thousands of gathered revelers to "go home and stay in peace."

The attacks are unprecedented in Bangkok. However, Thailand has had a turbulent year, with a &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Thai%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat"&gt;coup d'état&lt;/a&gt; on September 19 in which the military ousted prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, there have been a number of schools burnt by suspected Thaksin sympathizers in various parts of the country.

There is also the ongoing violence by Muslim separatists in the , which has left 1,900 people dead since 2004.

It was not immediately clear if the bombings had anything to do with the coup or the southern insurgency.

<h1>World reacts to execution of Saddam Hussein</h1>

The execution of &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; elicited critical statements by governments from around the world and also by non-governmental organisations.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href="Poland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; politicians saw positive effects of the execution. &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said it was a "milestone" on the way to a democratic Iraq. Also, many Iranian politicians think that the execution was a "victory for the Iraqi people". The Polish foreign minister said he was an opponent of death penalty, but would make an exception in this case. Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer referred to the death of Saddam Hussein as an "important step" on the way towards a historical judgement of Hussein's "tyrannous regime". He thinks that it will lead to an opportunity to strengthen the process of reconciliation.

Other European countries were at odds with this response. These include the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;U.K.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Vatican%20City"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, which stand for the worldwide abolition of the death penalty. The main reason given by them was that even incredibly heinous crimes do not justify execution. The Vatican's spokesperson, Federico Lombardi, said that there was "the risk that it would incite people to seek revenge and produce more violence". Germany's minister of state in the Office for Foreign Affairs, Erler, said that Saddam Hussein's crimes could not be doubted, but the German government would stay with its general attitude of rejecting death penalty.

&lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; also expressed regret for the execution. An official of the Russian Office for Foreign Affairs, Michail Kamynin, warned against an intensification of the military and political situation in Iraq and against a rise of ethnical-confessional tensions. &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; ordered a three-day national mourning. Head of state Ghadhafi stopped all celebrations and ceremonies for the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEid%20al-Adha"&gt;Eid al-Adha&lt;/a&gt; half-masting all flags on governmental buildings. The &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; foreign minister criticised the execution, too. There had often been disagreements, but nevertheless, the execution had been wrong, he said.

The organisation "&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;" criticised the proceedings against Hussein as having "shown severe deficiencies". The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AWorld%20Council%20of%20Churches"&gt;World Council of Churches&lt;/a&gt; expressed its critical attitude towards the execution of Saddam Hussein: "Every time a person's life is taken it is part of a big tragedy." &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAmnesty%20international"&gt;Amnesty international&lt;/a&gt; very much criticised the proceedings: the execution was apparently a foregone conclusion. The appeal court had only created the impression of legitimacy in flawed proceedings, they said.

The &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACouncil%20of%20Europe"&gt;Council of Europe&lt;/a&gt; condemned the execution and called on Iraq to abolish the death penalty.

Meanwhile, at 4:00 a.m. this morning local time (1:00 a.m. (GMT)), the former leader's remains were buried in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAl-Awja"&gt;Awja&lt;/a&gt;, close to &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ATikrit"&gt;Tikrit&lt;/a&gt;, the home town of Hussein, as reported by CNN.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Space%20Agency"&gt;French Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; will publish its UFO archive online by late January or mid-February. Most of the 6,000 reports have been filed by the public and airline professionals. Jacques Arnould, an official for the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Space%20Agency"&gt;French Space Agency&lt;/a&gt;, said that the data had accumulated over a 30 year period and that they were often reported to the &lt;a href="w%3AGendarmerie"&gt;Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt;.

Two &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, part of the UN peacekeeping force in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, were wounded Friday after stepping on a cluster bomb during a mine-clearing operation in southern Lebanon. One of the two soldiers stepped on a cluster bomb while clearing a minefield near the village of Majdel Silim. Their injuries were "serious but not life-threatening", a &lt;a href="w%3AUNIFIL"&gt;UNIFIL&lt;/a&gt; spokesman said, however this was denied by the cabinet of the Belgian Minister of Defence, &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Flahaut"&gt;André Flahaut&lt;/a&gt;. One soldier was wounded at the neck, the second was wounded at the foot. 

One of the deminers has already left the hospital and was repatriated to Belgium on Saturday. He was first transported to the military hospital at Neder-over-Heembeek, but was later allowed to return home. The other soldier was taken to the hospital of &lt;a href="w%3ASaida%2C%20Lebanon"&gt;Saida&lt;/a&gt; for further examination. He will have to undergo surgery to stabilise his condition before he can be repatriated early next week, minister André Flahaut stated.

The wounded soldiers are part of the units from Meerdaal and Poelkappele, but their identities were not revealed.

There are 374 Belgian soldiers serving with the UN force, known as UNIFIL, stationed near Tibnin in southern Lebanon, 12 kilometers from the Israeli border. Their main tasks are demining, medical support and reconstruction.

The Iowa Hawkeyes (6-6) came into the Alamo Bowl as underdogs to the Texas Longhorns (10-3), 18th-ranked and defending national champions. It probably came as a surprise to the entire Alamo Bowl record crowd of 65,875 as Iowa ran out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter. Iowa almost extended their lead to 21-3 just before the half, but for a touchdown pass called back for an illegal receiver who lined up on the Iowa line of scrimmage. 

Texas quarterback Colt McCoy, who began the season as a red-shirt freshman, capped the Texas comeback in the 3rd quarter with a 72-yard pass to tailback Jamaal Charles to take the lead at 20-14.

Tate connected again with Brodell to put Iowa back in the lead, 21-20. Brodell led the Hawks in offence with 6 receptions for 159 yards. 

In the fourth quarter, Selvin Young capped a Texas drive by rushing 2 yards to make it 26-21, as the Longhorns failed to make the 2-point conversion. Iowa then marched downfield and Kyle Schlicher kicked a 38-yard field goal to pull Iowa within two points at 26-24 with 11 minutes left in the game. 

With just a field goal needed and nearly five minutes to go, Iowa was given a gift when a short 19-yard punt put Iowa in possession near midfield. Iowa coach Kirk Fernetz then tried a bit of trickery which doomed Iowa's hopes. Texas safety Marcus Griffin tackled Dominique Douglas for a 9-yard loss on a reverse wide-receiver pass on first down. Iowa could not convert and had to punt three plays later, and Texas successfully ran out the clock to win the game.

Coach Ferentz immediately claimed the blame for the risky play call. "It's totally my fault. I'm sick over it," Ferentz said. "Guys competed that long and that hard and that put us in a bad situation."

More bombs went off just after midnight (0500 GMT) on New Year's Day in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt;, injuring eight people near a shopping mall where hours before a New Year's Eve countdown was cancelled due to a string of six bombings earlier in the evening.

The first bomb exploded at a seafood restaurant on the &lt;a href="w%3AKhlong%20Saen%20Saeb"&gt;Saen Saeb Canal&lt;/a&gt; near Pratunam Pier just seconds after midnight.

Three foreigners and two Thais were injured. One of the foreigners had her legs amputated by the blast, according to television and local newspaper reports. The foreign tourists were having dinner at the restaurant.

Police said the bomb was hidden in a tire at the pier.

A second bomb exploded in a telephone booth near a pedestrian bridge at &lt;a href="w%3ACentralWorld"&gt;CentralWorld&lt;/a&gt;, where thousands of people had gathered earlier in the evening for a countdown party and had been urged by authorities to leave the area and go home. Several foreigners were injured and rushed to hospitals.

Another bomb was found and disposed of without incident at &lt;a href="w%3ASuan%20Lum%20Night%20Bazaar"&gt;Suan Lum Night Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, another late-night venue for tourists.

A possible bomb was investigated at Buddy Bar, a popular music venue on &lt;a href="w%3AKhaosan%20Road"&gt;Khaosan Road&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out to be a false report. Police had earlier closed the venue and other bars on the street frequented by backpackers, urging people to return to their hotels and guesthouses.

Earlier in the evening, bombs had gone off at six locations across the city, from about 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Twenty-five people were injured and three later died at hospitals from their injuries. The biggest toll was at &lt;a href="w%3AVictory%20Monument%20%28Bangkok%29"&gt;Victory Monument&lt;/a&gt;, where 17 people were injured, two of them dying from their injuries. Other targets were a police booth at Saphan Kwai intersection, where two people were injured, and a market in &lt;a href="w%3AKhlong%20Toei"&gt;Khlong Toei&lt;/a&gt;, where three people were injured, one fatally. At &lt;a href="w%3ASeacon%20Square"&gt;Seacon Square&lt;/a&gt; shopping mall, a bomb was found in a trash can inside the mall and taken to the parking lot, where it exploded without injuring anyone. Police booths on &lt;a href="w%3ASukhumvit%20Road"&gt;Sukhumvit&lt;/a&gt; Soi 62 and in suburban &lt;a href="w%3ANonthaburi%20Province"&gt;Nonthaburi&lt;/a&gt; were also hit, but there were no injuries. 

After the bombings, Bangkok Governor &lt;a href="w%3AApirak%20Kosayothin"&gt;Apirak Kosayothin&lt;/a&gt; had ordered the cancellation of the countdown celebrations at Central World and &lt;a href="w%3ASanam%20Luang"&gt;Sanam Luang&lt;/a&gt; and other smaller ones.

"Due to several bomb explosions in Bangkok and for the sake of peace and security, I would ask all of you to return to your homes now," Apirak told a crowd of around 5,000 people at CentralWorld. Most of the crowd dispersed quickly and calmly.

&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Thai%20Army"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; Commander-in-Chief General &lt;a href="w%3ASonthi%20Boonyaratglin"&gt;Sonthi Boonyaratglin&lt;/a&gt; ordered soldiers deployed around the capital. Security was intensified on the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Metro"&gt;Metro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Skytrain"&gt;Skytrain&lt;/a&gt; rail systems. The Skytrain cancelled plans to run all night and closed at midnight as usual. Department stores closed early.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Surayud%20Chulanont"&gt;Surayud Chulanont&lt;/a&gt; visited victims at a local hospital. He appeared on television looking tense, telling reporters he didn't know who was responsible for the attacks.

Surayud was appointed premier after a &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Thai%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat"&gt;coup d'état&lt;/a&gt; on September 19 in which the military led by Sonthi ousted prime minister &lt;a href="Thaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt;.

♡❤The Nation♡❤ newspaper quoted a "security source" as saying "the old power clique" was behind the bombing.

However, there is also the ongoing violence by Muslim separatists in the , which has left 1,900 people dead since 2004.

A crowd of approximately 1 million has welcomed the new year in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; overnight. Many of the crowd had camped out since 6 AM &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEDT&lt;/a&gt; (7PM UTC) to ensure they had the best vantage point for the fireworks displays at 9 PM and 12 AM. Earlier predictions of rain failed to dampen enthusiastic revellers and fortunately did not eventuate.

According to police, vantage points were &lt;a href="w%3ACirqular%20Quay"&gt;Circular Quay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Opera%20House"&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/a&gt; closed around 7 PM.

This year's theme was "A diamond night in Emerald City" and celebrated the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Harbour%20Bridge"&gt;Sydney Harbour Bridge's&lt;/a&gt; diamond anniversary of 75 years which will fall in March.

As usual, the bridge became the centre piece of Sydney's celebrations with a question mark turning into a coat hanger during the 9 PM fireworks show before a diamond appeared at 11 PM.

Entertainment was held in the city throughout the day, culminating in a spectacular fireworks display at midnight. Revellers counted down the final seconds of 2006 with numbers on the side of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

The festivities are estimated to have cost &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; $4 million and organisers claim their fireworks display is "the largest in the world". Sydney's celebrations were broadcast on television live around the world as other countries prepared their New Year's Eve celebrations.

Despite the large crowd, police made only 58 arrests for offences including offensive conduct, stealing, assaulting police, goods in custody, assault, drink driving and affray.

Ambulance officers were called to 1,139 incidents in Sydney with another 900 in country areas.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%20MP%20to%20be%20present%20at%20state%20funeral%20of%20Gerald%20Ford&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

New Zealand member of Parliament (MP), minister of ethnic affairs, conservation, and housing, the &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Carter%20%28politician%29"&gt;Honourable Chris Carter&lt;/a&gt; is to represent &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; at the state funeral of the late United States President, &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Ford"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt; held in &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;.

The state funeral will include the family of President Ford, foreign representatives and senior politicians from America. The funeral is to be held in the Washington National Cathedral in Washington DC, on the morning of January 2, 2007. 

Hon Carter, said: "The prime minister [ &lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; ] considers it important ... to show at a time of national mourning in the US that we are prepared to send someone in the middle of our summer holidays, when our parliament is not sitting, because we value the relationship."

MP Honourable &lt;a href="w%3ATrevor%20Mallard"&gt;Trevor Mallard&lt;/a&gt;, who made the announcement, said: "President Ford won respect for the decent, down to earth qualities that he brought back to government after assuming the Presidency in 1974 in the difficult circumstances of the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and the resignation of former President &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Nixon"&gt;Richard Nixon&lt;/a&gt;."

The announcement of Hon Carter representing New Zealand overseas is strange because the Right Honourable &lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Peters"&gt;Winston Peters&lt;/a&gt; is the minister of foreign affairs for New Zealand.

After the funeral on the national day of mourning, Hon Carter should meet America's secretary of state, &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;. 

Hon Mallard, said: "The United States is a fundamentally important partner for New Zealand. It is appropriate that we mark our respect for the strength of US democracy and the many other enduring values that we share in common with the United States in this way."

Hon Carter left for America last night (&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;NZDT&lt;/a&gt;), December 31, 2006.

President Ford was in office for only two years, 1974 - 1976. President Ford took over from President Nixon following the &lt;a href="w%3AWatergate%20scandal"&gt;Watergate scandal&lt;/a&gt;. President Ford was 93-years-old when he passed on.

The &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; announced the death of US Army Spc. Dustin R. Donica on the last day of the year, bringing the number of US troop fatalities in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; since the onset of war in 2003 to 3000. 

Donica, 22, was killed in small arms fire Thursday while serving in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;.

In a statement from Donica's family, Dustin's father David Donica said, "Dustin had a tremendous sense of duty, both to his family, and his country. He will be missed by his family, and all those that knew him."

While 3000 is a small number compared to most other US military conflicts, this milestone highlights the growing sectarian violence in Iraq and the state of coalition soldiers caught in the middle of it. The War in Iraq faces strong domestic opposition due to military fatalities, a financial cost of more than $350 billion, widespread international opposition, and criticisms of the &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration's handling of the war.

“The most painful aspect of the presidency is the fact that I know my decisions have caused young men and women to lose their lives,” said Bush in his final press conference of the year.

Donica, from Spring, Texas, was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 4th Airborne Brigade Combat team, 25th Infantry Division in Fort Richardson, Alaska. Among his likes were soccer, rock and vocal trance music, and ham-and-pineapple pizza with &lt;a href="w%3ADr.%20Pepper"&gt;Dr. Pepper&lt;/a&gt;.

Today the National Archives of Australia released most of the 1976 Cabinet papers of the &lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Fraser"&gt;Fraser&lt;/a&gt; government revealing a plot by Palestinians to assassinate the then Israeli Ambassador to Australia and prominent supporters of Israel. 

Countering attacks in the 1976 papers was seen to require "specialist elements of the Defence Force" to be trained as police forces were seen as inadequate to the emerging threats. Reform of the Australian intelligence community was also recommended as it was seen as "fragmented, poorly coordinated and haphazardly organised."

Cabinet papers are released to the public after 30 years through the National Archives on the 1st of January.

Last night, 1 million people filed into &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the 31st Annual &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Night%20celebration"&gt;First Night celebration&lt;/a&gt;. The people who attended the First Night celebration enjoyed live musical performances, ice sculptures, and finally, fire works.

Tonight was a great night for the ice sculptures and the people, as temperatures where around 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius).

At City Hill Plaza, Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AThomasn%20Menino"&gt;Thomasn Menino&lt;/a&gt; made an appearance and held a countdown to noon for younger people who might not be able to stay up for the festivities that were to happen later in the night.

First Night celebrations were also held in Chatam, Fall River, New Bedford, and other towns and cities.

On January 1 2007, &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt; officially joined the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEurozone"&gt;Eurozone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and adopted the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aeuro"&gt;euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as its new official currency. At the same time, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASlovenian%20euro%20coins"&gt;Slovenian euro coins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which were available as a "starter kit" from December 15, became legal tender everywhere in the Eurozone.

A period of dual circulation, when both the former currency, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASlovenian%20tolar"&gt;tolar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the euro will be accepted, will only last until January 14. All banks are going to exchange tolars into euros at the official rate of 239.64 SIT per 1 EUR at no commission until March 1, 2007. After that date it will be possible to exchange tolar banknotes (unlimited) and coins (until 2016) only at the Bank of Slovenia.

Most &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAutomatic%20teller%20machine"&gt;ATMs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; already dispense euro banknotes with the rest to follow in the following days. Commercial banks automatically converted all tolar accounts into euros and online banking systems will be accessible to their users again on January 3. Even though January 1 and 2 are non-working days in Slovenia, many banks will be opened from 10:00 to 14:00 on both days, available only for one service: exchanging tolars to euros and larger euro banknotes into smaller units.

On the 2nd of January, relatives waiting for news about the Adam Air jetliner broke down in tears after learning that senior Indonesian officials erroneously reported the Boeing 737's charred wreckage had been found and that a dozen people may have survived. 

A &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20737"&gt;Boeing 737-400&lt;/a&gt; flying for low-cost carrier &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air"&gt;Adam Air&lt;/a&gt; has crashed into the mountains of Indonesia's Sulawesi missing during its flight from &lt;a href="w%3ASurabaya"&gt;Surabaya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJava"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AManado"&gt;Manado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASulawesi"&gt;Sulawesi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; amid bad weather. The plane serving as flight number &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Air%20Flight%20574"&gt;KI-574&lt;/a&gt; was carrying 96 passengers and a crew of 6. 

The domestic flight disappeared and vanished off late Monday about an hour before the intended landing time. The captain managed to send out two distress signals, but contact was then lost. Before the ill-fated planed vanished from radar, Singapore's satellite had picked up a distress signal from the plane.

According to airline spokesman Hartono, there are now plans to evacuate the survivors to &lt;a href="w%3AMakassar"&gt;Makassar&lt;/a&gt;. "The plane is in ruins," said First Air Marshal Eddy Suyanto. "The plane was found around 20 kilometers from Polewali, in the mountains." Later, the statement was rebutted by Marshall Eddy Suyanto himself and the Minister of Transportation Hatta Radjasa.This statement was an erroneously reported. Government had apologized to the public for this statement. This have been made an anguish to the relatives and family members.

Six days after plane crashed, wreckage of the ill-fated plane has still not been found. Indonesia has widened the hunt around Sulawesi Island. Indonesian rescuer was assisted by US satellite and Singapore Air Force.

Police are still looking for the suspect that killed &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%20Broncos"&gt;Denver Broncos&lt;/a&gt; cornerback &lt;a href="w%3ADarrent%20Williams"&gt;Darrent Williams&lt;/a&gt;, 24, in a drive by shooting January 1. Williams was killed by a single gunshot wound to the neck.

Police say there was a disagreement at a nightclub birthday party for &lt;a href="w%3AKenyon%20Martin"&gt;Kenyon Martin&lt;/a&gt;, a forward with the &lt;a href="w%3ADenver%20Nuggets%20National%20Basketball%20Association"&gt;Denver Nuggets National Basketball Association&lt;/a&gt; team, and Williams and his two friends left. His two friends, a man and a woman, were hit along with him.

The suspect was in a white 1998 &lt;a href="w%3AChevrolet%20Tahoe"&gt;Chevrolet Tahoe&lt;/a&gt;. Police said earlier they where looking for a Tahoe or Suburban with dark-tinted windows.

Williams teamates honoured him at a memorial service today.

"We'll have a memorial service on Wednesday with our players and coaches and Darrent's family," Broncos coach &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Shanahan"&gt;Mike Shanahan&lt;/a&gt; said at a press conference on Tuesday. "I don't think he had a guy that wasn't his friend," added Shanahan. "That's the way he lived life. He always had a smile on his face."

"[Receiver Javon Walker] just went through a tragic experience," Shanahan said about one of the other injured passengers. "A lot of times when somebody has that happen to them, they wonder why it (wasn't them). That's just human nature and obviously the counselors are talking with him about that. It's a process. It takes some time."

The entire Denver Broncos will attend the funeral service for Williams on Saturday in his hometown of &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Worth%2C%20Texas"&gt;Fort Worth, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, according to Shanahan.

The investigation remains ongoing.

Ban, the eighth &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; Secretary-General, is also the first Asian to serve in this office in 35 years.

Ban, 62, grew up on the Korean peninsula in the midst of the &lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20War"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt; that divided the region. He promises to bring peace to the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20North%20Korean%20nuclear%20test"&gt;North Korean nuclear conflict&lt;/a&gt;. 

Along with North Korea, Ban faces a litany of difficult issues including the genocide in Darfur, tensions in the Middle East, an international campaign against AIDS and poverty in line with his predecessor Kofi Annan's Millennium Goals, a push to increase the size of the Security Council, and calls for ethics reform within the United Nations.

In his inaugural address, Ban said, "My first priority will be to restore trust."

"The United States will rely on his leadership to help steer the UN organization through the reforms already underway," said White House spokesman Scott Stanzel on Sunday, "and to propel it even further on the path of reform."

Ban will temporarily reside in a hotel in New York City until renovations on his official residence are completed as part of a modernization plan approved by the UN General Assembly.

A Pakistani boy got his older sister to hang him &lt;a href="w%3AExecution%20of%20Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;in the same manner&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;.

Mubashar Ali, 9, hanged himself, while re-enacting Hussein's hanging with the help of elder sister, 10, after tying a rope to a ceiling fan and his neck in his home in the Punjab &lt;a href="w%3ARahimyar%20Khan%20District"&gt;district of Rahimyar Khan&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, said a local police official. 

The father of the deceased boy said that his children had been watching the video of Saddam Hussein's execution on television and attempted to imitate the hanging as other family members thought they were playing in another room. 

"My wife and sister rushed to rescue Mubashar when children cried for help from the adjoining room, but he died due to hanging," said Alamgir Paracha, father of Mubashar. 

Police said that the death was accidental and a case of parental negligence. 

"It was an accident which happened due to carelessness of parents," said district police chief Sultan Ahmad.

Sunnis upset over the hanging of former Iraqi dictator &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; began protesting Monday, the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reported.

A mob in Samara, a town in the &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Islam"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt;-dominated region of Iraq, tore off pieces of a bombed-out &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20Islam"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; shrine, called the Golden Dome, which was attacked by extremists 10 months ago. They also carried a mock coffin and photos of Hussein, a Sunni who was executed by the majority-Shiite government on Saturday.

Many were angered by a three-minute video, apparently shot on a cellphone and making its way around the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;, that showed Hussein taunted by his Shiite executioners moments before he dropped to his death.

In the video, those gathered to witness Hussein's execution could be heard chanting, "Muqtada! Muqtada! Muqtada!" for Muqtada Sadr, whose radical Shiite militia has been known to hunt down Sunni Arabs and kill them.

At least one photo taken by the Associated Press showed a protestor Monday with a hand covered in red, made to look like blood.

The protest followed Hussein's burial the day before in his birthplace of Al Auja, where mourners also expressed outrage for the hanging. "Today they proved themselves that the trial and the execution were mere retaliation and not justice," one mourner told the Los Angeles Times. "It is clear now against whom we should retaliate."

A 21-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealander&lt;/a&gt;, who has not been named, was sexually assaulted by another man early yesterday morning (&lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;NZDT&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand police&lt;/a&gt; have described the sexual attack as "prolonged and terrifying".

The man was first threatened with a weapon at a shopping center located in Riddiford Street, &lt;a href="w%3ANewtown%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Newtown&lt;/a&gt;, Wellington and was then forced into a dark and isolated carpark where the sexual attack occurred.

Detective Sergeant Zane Smith, said that they have been given a very good description of the attacker and with that description have released an &lt;a href="w%3AFacial%20composite"&gt;identikit&lt;/a&gt; picture. The attacker is a male &lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori"&gt;Māori&lt;/a&gt; aged between mid-20s and early 30s, measures around 1.8 metres and has a solid build. The most identifiable feature is a Māori tattoo located on his chin. The attacker was also wearing a '&lt;a href="w%3A50%20Cent"&gt;50 Cent&lt;/a&gt;' green hooded top, faded black baggy jeans and was wearing sneakers coloured red and white.

The attacker has still not been found and police are asking for anyone who may have been in the Riddiford Street shopping centre between 2:00 a.m. and 3:30 a.m.

&lt;a href="w%3AClosed-circuit%20television"&gt;CCTV (closed-circuit television)&lt;/a&gt; cameras are being examined.

On Friday, U.S. officials asked Iraqi Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt; to delay the hanging of former dictator &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; for two weeks, &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reported on its website Tuesday.

The story, which CNN posted at 1:27 a.m. EST, cited "a member of the Iraqi parliament close to the prime minister." The account has so far not been verified by other news agencies.

Saddam, a &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Islam"&gt;Sunni Muslim&lt;/a&gt;, was executed before dawn on Saturday.

American officials reportedly asked for the delay, fearing the execution could be perceived as "more about &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20Islam"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; retribution and less about justice."

Nouri al-Maliki, a Shiite, saw Saddam as his arch-nemesis and did everything he could to ensure the execution went off without a hitch, the &lt;a href="w%3AWall%20Street%20Journal"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; reported on its front page Tuesday. Al-Maliki was sentenced to death in 1980 by the government of Sadam because of his activism in the Dawa party. Since then, he lived in exile in Iran, and later in Syria.

U.S. Senator &lt;a href="Barack%20Obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20name"&gt;family name&lt;/a&gt; may sound similar to that of the &lt;a href="w%3AGiven%20name"&gt;given name&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3A"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;. 

According to prominent American left-wing online &lt;a href="w%3ABlog"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Kos"&gt;Daily Kos&lt;/a&gt;, which was the first to report it, &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; mixed the two up on Monday, leading into a segment on bin Laden with the title, "Where's Obama?" on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Situation%20Room"&gt;The Situation Room&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a show hosted by pundit &lt;a href="w%3AWolf%20Blitzer"&gt;Wolf Blitzer&lt;/a&gt;. The blog posted a photo of the mistake. The author of the blog called it "character defamation." 

CNN has called the mistake "a bad typographical error". &lt;a href="w%3ASoledad%20O%27Brien"&gt;Soledad O'Brien&lt;/a&gt; and Blitzer apologised separately during CNN's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Morning"&gt;American Morning&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on Tuesday.

"We want to apologize for that bad typo," Mr Blitzer said. "We also want to apologize personally to Senator Barack Obama. I'm going to be making a call to him later this morning to offer my personal apology."

Mr Obama's press secretary said the apology was accepted. He also added that he appreciated the online blogs who brought the error to light.

"Though I'd note that the 's' and 'b' keys aren't all that close to each other, I assume it was just an unfortunate mistake, and don't think there was any truly malicious intent," said Tommy Vietor, Obama's press secretary.

Only one provider of high-speed Internet access operates in Qatar, and this provider has configured its network such that all its users share the same single IP address. In most cases, a single IP address corresponds to one user or a small group of users in one building or school. Because of this single-address configuration, Wikipedia was not able to implement its usual countervandalism solution, the blocking of individual IPs or user accounts. Wikipedia said that the action was taken after 200 repeated vandalism edits of the articles on sex, the United States, and the birthday of the prophet Muhammad.

A spokesperson for Wikipedia, said: "Qatar has not been banned from Wikipedia. Apparently Qatar basically has only one ISP, and nearly all of its traffic shows as coming from a single IP address."

&lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, the Wikipedia founder, emphasized the temporary nature of the block, saying, "This IP number was temporarily blocked for less than 12 hours, and a block of an entire nation would go absolutely against Wikipedia policy."

At 21:26 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; (5:26 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;ET&lt;/a&gt;) a Wikipedia admin unblocked the IP address with the reason given as: ♡❤"This IP is the address for the entire nation of Qatar; it should not be blocked."♡❤

Qatar only has around 219,000 Internet users, and much less of that number would actually be affected by the block.

&lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary, Alberta&lt;/a&gt; and the southern Alberta city of &lt;a href="w%3ALethbridge%2C%20Alberta"&gt;Lethbridge&lt;/a&gt; became the eighth and ninth cities in Canada to ban smoking in bars and restaurants.

On October 18, 2006, &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary%20City%20Council"&gt;Calgary City Council&lt;/a&gt; approved of the bylaw that bans smoking in public areas.

Exemptions were put in place for bingos, casinos, and establishments with smoking rooms until January 1, 2008. First time offenders will pay $200 in fines. A city bylaw boss said people who deliberately go against the law could pay $3,500 or more.

"Obviously, I am ecstatic about it," said Robyn Hauck back in October, who is an anti-smoking activist. "For us to be going smoke free Jan. 1, with a few exceptions, I couldn't be happier."

However, the smoking ban which came into effect on &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Years%20Day"&gt;New Years Day&lt;/a&gt; didn't have much effect on some smokers.

"I don't ever tell anyone else how to live so they [the politicians] shouldn't tell me how to live," said resident Doug Baum, who was surprised that he could still light up at the local pub. "Pubs like this one are the last places you can still go to have a smoke and enjoy yourself."

Another bar allowed customers to smoke.

"Absolutely we'll keep smoking because it's not fair the exemptions make it discriminatory," said Chris Daskas, who owns Filo's Restaurant.

A phone video has surfaced in various Arab media outlets and also on video sharing websites such as &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; that shows Saddam's hanging uncensored. The video contained audio of some witnesses taunting Saddam with chants of "Muqtada" and of the former leader responding that his tormentors were being unmanly.

The taunts referred to &lt;a href="w%3AMuqtada%20al-Sadr"&gt;Muqtada al-Sadr&lt;/a&gt;, the radical &lt;a href="w%3AShia%20Islam"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; cleric who is a main backer of Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ANouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;, the Shiite leader who pushed for a quick execution of Saddam. The prime minister on Tuesday ordered an investigation into the conduct of Saddam Hussein’s execution in a bid to learn who among the witnesses taunted the former Iraqi leader in the last minutes of his life and leaked a cell phone video. 

Sadiq al-Rikabi told &lt;a href="w%3AAlhurra"&gt;Al-Hurra television&lt;/a&gt; that he does not know who leaked the video and that such an act “is wrong and should be investigated, and I agree that cellular telephones were taken from witnesses before they boarded the helicopter” to the execution site. 

“I am full of hope that the results of the investigation will be announced, and the person who did this act should pay a price,” he said. 
Munqith al-Faroon, a witness to Saddam's execution said: "two top officials ... had their mobile phones with them” and also that “I am certain that the chanting at the moment of the execution was not organized, and that those chanting were not being ordered to do so. The guards made a decision to do so by themselves. This is the truth. I shouted at them and ordered them to keep silent, my voice is very clear in the recording.” 

In the leaked video one voice called: “Allah, bless those who pray for &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; and his descendants. Allah, pray for Muhammad and his descendants and may they bring us their help soon and curse their enemies and back their son Muqtada, Muqtada, Muqtada.” 

Saddam then asked, “Is this manly?” 

A voice responded, “To hell.” 

Another voice called out, “Long live &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20Baqir%20al-Sadr"&gt;Mohammed Baqir al-Sadr&lt;/a&gt;” — a reference to the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Dawa%20Party"&gt;Dawa Party&lt;/a&gt; founder and Shiite cleric who was executed along with his sister by Saddam in 1980. 

Then, a voice purportedly belonging to al-Faroon said: “Please no, this man is being executed, please no, I beg you no.” 

&lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Islam"&gt;Sunni Muslims&lt;/a&gt; have taken to the streets in mainly peaceful demonstrations in Sunni enclaves across the country. They are outraged by the video and do not think that Saddam should have been taunted by the guards.

A cell phone video has surfaced in various Arab media outlets and also on video sharing websites such as YouTube that shows Saddam Hussein's hanging uncensored. The video contained audio of some witnesses taunting Saddam with chants of "Muqtada" and of the former leader responding that his tormentors were being unmanly.

Also in Iraq...

The city of Baqubah, just northeast of Baghdad, seems to have collapsed under insurgent control. In October, U.S. forces in the area began to pull back, handing security largely over to Iraqi forces. Now, The Los Angeles Times reports the capital city of the Diyala province has become one of Iraq's most-troubled areas. Iraqi forces are abusive and neglectful, according to U.S. and Iraqi officials. Insurgents have been seen on video pulling Shiite families from their homes, killing them, U.S. officials said.

<h3>&lt;a href="New%20Zealand%20holiday%20road%20toll%20at%2026-year%20low"&gt;New Zealand holiday road toll at 26-year low&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
New Zealand

The New Zealand Christmas holiday road toll has been the lowest it has ever been in 26-years, with nine deaths. The annual road toll is also the lowest it has ever been since 1963, with 387 deaths for the whole of 2006.

An infectious superbug spreading in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; is to "emerge in force" in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, doctors fear. The bacteria have been reported popping up in day care centers and locker rooms across the U.S. Usually elderly or very ill hospital patients get the disease.

More than 2 million U.S. residents are infected every year, the &lt;a href="w%3ACenters%20for%20Disease%20Control"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; estimates. 

An article in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Medical%20Association%20Journal"&gt;Canadian Medical Association Journal&lt;/a&gt; (CMAJ) on Tuesday said that &lt;a href="w%3AMethicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus"&gt;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/a&gt; (MRSA) are "spreading with alarming rapidity." The bacteria can cause boils, pimples, or in extreme cases, flesh-eating disease, and more.

"The resistant bacteria is an old foe with new fangs: a pathogen combining virulence, resistance and an ability to disseminate at large," wrote Dr. John Conly, medical professor and an infectious disease specialist at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Calgary"&gt;University of Calgary&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASaskatchewan"&gt;Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AManitoba"&gt;Manitoba&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; are the provinces which already have had MRSA in hospitals. 

A 30-year-old &lt;a href="w%3ACalgary"&gt;Calgary, Alberta&lt;/a&gt; man died last year of lung abscesses associated with the infection, as well as a three-month old toddler in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Blue%20Jays"&gt;Toronto Blue Jays&lt;/a&gt; outfielder &lt;a href="w%3AAlex%20Rios"&gt;Alex Rios&lt;/a&gt;, last summer, suffered from an infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus in his leg. Pitcher &lt;a href="w%3ATy%20Taubenheim"&gt;Ty Taubenheim&lt;/a&gt; had a similar infection on his foot.

Doctors are currently investigating some Calgary residents, who could be one of the first Canadian reports of MRSA outside of a hospital setting.

<h2>Prevention</h2>
In their article in the CMAJ, experts say that doing the following steps will help to prevent the disease:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Basic hand washing techniques using soap or alcohol gels
BULLET::::- The use of disposable aprons and gloves by hospital staff, reducing skin-to-skin contact
BULLET::::- Covering sneezes and coughs to prevent respiratory spread.

Two co-defendants who were scheduled to hang with former &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i dictator &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; will instead be executed Thursday, according to an Iraqi government official.

Details still need to be worked out with the American military, but the two are expected at the gallows after Islam's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEid%20al-Adha"&gt;Eid al-Adha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; holiday, which ends today.

Saddam was hanged before dawn Saturday, before Eid, for the same crimes.

Since then, Saddam loyalists and Sunni Muslims have expressed outrage at the way in which he was killed. A three-minute video shot on a cellphone and leaked to the Internet shows witnesses and the executioners taunting Saddam before his death.

The Iraqi government launched an investigation into the video and on Wednesday arrested one of the guards believed to have shot it.

Reaction to the hanging has been mixed around the world. Even in the U.S., the State Department has condemned the taunting, while President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; hailed Saddam's death "a milestone."

Toxic chemicals were found in four &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; politicians after they volunteered to have their blood tested as part of &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Defense"&gt;Environmental Defense's&lt;/a&gt; report titled ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AToxic%20Nation"&gt;Toxic Nation&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20Hill"&gt;Parliament Hill&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The federal politicians that were tested are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Environment Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARona%20Ambrose"&gt;Rona Ambrose&lt;/a&gt;,
BULLET::::- Health Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Clement"&gt;Tony Clement&lt;/a&gt;,
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt; Leader &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Layton"&gt;Jack Layton&lt;/a&gt;, and
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; Environment Critic &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Godfrey"&gt;John Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
Godfrey at number 55 had the highest total number of pollutants followed by Health
Minister Tony Clement and Jack Layton at 54 and Environment Minister Rona Ambrose at 49.

They were tested for a total of 103 chemicals, which are related to cancer, developmental problems, respiratory illnesses, and nervous system damage. The chemicals found in them were mainly from household items which can cause cancer. In total, 54 carcinogens, 37 hormone disruptors, 16 respiratory toxins, 54 reproductive or developmental toxins, and 33 neurotoxins were found within the four politicians.

According to Dr. Rick Smith, Environmental Defence's executive director, the politicians are more contaminated than the ordinary citizens tested last year.

"Our tests show that pollution affects everyone. From &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Canada"&gt;Parliament Hill&lt;/a&gt; to kids in &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20John%2C%20New%20Brunswick"&gt;Saint John&lt;/a&gt;, harmful pollutants are contaminating the bodies of Canadians no matter where they live, how old they are or where they work, play or go to school," said Dr. Rick Smith. "I don't know why that is. Maybe it has to do with their strange lifestyle — eating out a lot and a high-stress existence," he said.

"Maybe its attributable to the unique lifestyles these guys lead," Mr. Smith said. "Politicians have a very strange, very stressful lifestyle that results in them grabbing a bite to eat when they can and eating a lot of junk food."

All four politicians were more polluted than child and adult volunteers that participated in a survey released last June for pollutants in families.

The blood was tested in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; for pollutants that fall under seven broad groups which are the following:

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3APolychlorinated%20biphenyl"&gt;PCBs&lt;/a&gt; (polychlorinated biphenyls),
BULLET::::- Stain repellents and non-stick chemicals (known as &lt;a href="w%3APerfluorocarbon"&gt;PFCs&lt;/a&gt;, or perfluorinated chemicals),

The Iraqi government has shut down the &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; studios of a privately-owned satellite TV station for "inciting sectarian violence" because it broadcast images of people mourning &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AExecution%20of%20Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;the execution of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;.

The press-freedom organization &lt;a href="Reporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday condemned the interior ministry's decision to shut down the Al-Charkiya station, which follows the earlier closures of the al-Zaura and Salah-Eddin TV stations for showing footage of Iraqis protesting Saddam's death sentence.

"We are very concerned by the attitude of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nuri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; government which is imposing more and more restrictions on the press," a statement issued by the Paris-based &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANGO"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; read, adding that "&lt;nowiki&gt;[t]&lt;/nowiki&gt;he authorities should show more restraint..."

Despite the closure of their Iraqi bureau, Al-Charkiya continues to broadcast from their Dubai and Amman offices. 

Saddam was hanged Saturday for the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASummary%20execution"&gt;summary executions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of 148 Iraqi residents of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADujail"&gt;Dujail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , following an unsuccessful assassination attempt in 1982.

Police in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; have seized 1,900 litres of &lt;a href="w%3AMDP2P"&gt;3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical known as "liquid &lt;a href="w%3AEcstacy"&gt;ecstacy&lt;/a&gt;" during a raid in the North-Western Sydney suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ACastle%20Hill%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Castle Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Authorities estimate the chemical could be used to make up to two tonnes of ecstacy with an estimated street value of &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AU&lt;/a&gt;$540 million (over $400 million).

Police claim the bust is one of the largest in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; history.

The operation was carried out by &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANugget"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt;.

Police are yet to make an arrest and are continuing their investigations.

In what is becoming an annual phenomenon in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, 400 cars were set ablaze during the New Year's night. Authorities say this is lower than the usual amount.

In 2006, an average of 112 cars a day were torched across France. There were 15 attacks per day on police and emergency services. Almost 3,000 police officers were injured in clashes with residents. In four separate ambushes, officers were badly injured in the Paris suburbs since September. Police speak of open war with youths who are bent on more than vandalism.

The Iraqi government has shut down the Baghdad studios of a privately-owned satellite TV station for "inciting sectarian violence" because it broadcast images of people mourning the execution of Saddam Hussein. The press-freedom organization Reporters Without Borders on Tuesday condemned the interior ministry's decision to shut down the Al-Charkiya station, which follows the earlier closures of the al-Zaura and Salah-Eddin TV stations for showing footage of Iraqis protesting Saddam's death sentence.

U.S. Senator Barack Obama's family name is very similar to the given name of the most wanted Osama bin Laden. According to American online blog Daily Kos, which was the first to report it, CNN mixed the two up on Monday, leading into a segment on bin Laden with the title, "Where's Obama?" on The Situation Room, a show hosted by Wolf Blitzer.

An infectious superbug spreading in the United States is to "emerge in force" in Canada, doctors fear. An article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal on Tuesday said that Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are "spreading with alarming rapidity." Usually elderly or very ill hospital patients get the disease. Experts say that basic hand washing using soap or alcohol gels and other techniques could help to prevent spreading of the disease.

Police are still looking for the suspect that killed Denver Broncos cornerback Darrent Williams, 24, in a drive by shooting on January 1. Williams was killed by a single gunshot wound to the neck.

&lt;a href="w%3ABicycle"&gt;Bicycle&lt;/a&gt; sales in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; have recorded record sales of 1,273,781 units for 2006, exceeding &lt;a href="w%3AMotor%20vehicle"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; sales by 32 percent. It is the fifth year in a row that the bicycle industry has sold more than one million units, a figure yet to be realised by car manufacturers.

The Cycling Promotion Fund (CPF) spokesman Ian Christie said Australians were increasingly using bicycles as an alternative to cars. Sales rose nine percent in 2006 while the car market stalled. Mr Christie said people were looking to cut their fuel costs and improve their fitness.

Mr Christie said organisations were beginning to supply bicycles as a company vehicle. “There is an emerging trend towards people using bikes as their official company-supplied vehicle in place of the traditional company car,” he said.

“Some of Australia’s biggest corporations now have bicycle fleets, and when you add in government organisations, we now know of at least 50 organisations which operate fleets of bikes."

“Although the company bicycle is a long way from taking over from the company car, it’s an important trend when you consider that nearly half of all cars sold are to company fleets.”

The CPF claims most commutes to work are less than 5 kilometres (3 miles) making bicycle travel a viable alternative.

Canadian PM &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; will shuffle his cabinet today at 11:00 a.m. ET. The replacing cabinet ministers will be sworn in at a ceremony in &lt;a href="w%3ARideau%20Hall"&gt;Rideau Hall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor%20General%20of%20Canada"&gt;Governor General's&lt;/a&gt; official residence in &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, the nations capital.

Harper is scheduled to make a statement at 12:30 p.m today at &lt;a href="w%3A24%20Sussex%20Drive"&gt;24 Sussex Drive&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Ministers residence.

The suffle could involve five (some sources say seven) cabinet ministers.

Environment minister &lt;a href="w%3ARona%20Ambrose"&gt;Rona Ambrose&lt;/a&gt; will likey be replaced. The Canadia media speculated that Treasury Board President &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Baird"&gt;John Baird&lt;/a&gt; will replace her. Earlier it was said that &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Indian%20Affairs%20and%20Northern%20Development%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Indian affairs minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Prentice"&gt;Jim Prentice&lt;/a&gt; would be replacing her but Prentice denied rumors. Ambrose, then, could be minister of &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Intergovernmental%20Affairs%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Intergovernmental affairs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Flaherty"&gt;Jim Flaherty&lt;/a&gt; is expected to keep his job as Finance Minister.

The Canadian media says that the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; government, who were elected on January, 23, 2006, could have an election in spring 2007.

Canadian PM Stephen Harper has shuffled his cabinet today.

The major change with this shuffle is &lt;a href="w%3ARona%20Ambrose"&gt;Rona Ambrose&lt;/a&gt;, Minister of Environment, being replaced by Treasury Board President &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Baird%20%28Canadian%20politician%29"&gt;John Baird&lt;/a&gt;. When a reporter asked her earlier if she would be replaced she replied, "Yes -- very excited." Ambrose is the new intergovernmental affairs minister.

&lt;a href="w%3AVic%20Toews"&gt;Vic Toews&lt;/a&gt;, the justice minister, is now President of the Treasury Board. &lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Nicholson"&gt;Rob Nicholson&lt;/a&gt;, who was house leader, is now justice minister. &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Van%20Loan"&gt;Peter Van Loan&lt;/a&gt;, who was intergovernmental affairs minister, is now house leader. &lt;a href="w%3AMonte%20Solberg"&gt;Monte Solberg&lt;/a&gt;, the immigration minister, replaces &lt;a href="w%3ADiane%20Finley"&gt;Diane Finley&lt;/a&gt; as Minister of Human Resources and Social Development. Diane Finley, loses the Human Resources portfolio and gets the Citizenship and Immigration ministry.
Six MPs were appointed "Secretary of State" roles, they are junior cabinet ministers. Secretary of States do not make part of the cabinet. These new Secretary of States are :
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="w%3AHelena%20Guergis"&gt;Helena Guergis&lt;/a&gt;, MP for Simcoe—Grey, Secretary of State (Foreign Affairs and International Trade) (Sport);

She is the first female House speaker in United States history. The opening of the Congress in 2007 marks the first time in a dozen years that the Democrats have control of the entire Congress.

In her speech she said it was time for a new America: "Now it is our responsibility to carry forth that vision of a new America. A new America that seizes the future and forges 21st century solutions through discovery, creativity, and innovation, sustaining our economic leadership and ensuring our national security. A new America with a vibrant and strengthened middle class for whom college is affordable, health care accessible, and retirement secure. A new America that declares our energy independence, promotes domestic sources of renewable energy, and combats climate change. A new America that is strong, secure, and a respected leader among the community of nations," said Pelosi in her speech.

She finished her speech by calling all the children, including her own grandchildren, to the microphone and declaring "For all of America's children, the House will be in order."

Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Boehner"&gt;John Boehner&lt;/a&gt; of Ohio was named the new Republican minority leader.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Navy"&gt;United States Navy&lt;/a&gt; has been ordered to the &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;n coastline in an attempt to stop members of the &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Courts%20Union"&gt;Union of Islamic Courts&lt;/a&gt; from escaping the country.

Naval forces have been boarding ships searching for fighters who might be hiding on them to escape Somalia. 

"We...are going to be working closely with states in the region to ensure that these individuals aren't able to transit those borders and exit Somalia," said a spokesman for the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20State"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McCormack"&gt;Sean McCormack&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; is also expected to help with the fleeing militants by providing peacekeepers for Somalia, but Uganda's parliament must first approve the request.

"The troops are ready but I have to consult the speaker of parliament. As soon as parliament approves, they will be sent to Somalia," said Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni. If Uganda's Parliament approves, between 1,200 and 2,000 peacekeepers will be deployed inside Somalia. The force, with approval, could be ready in at least a month.

Currently, no U.S. troops are engaged in fighting inside Somalia.

Great Britain has paid off the last of the loans it received to rebuild the country after &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;, sixty years ago. The last payment of US$83.25 million was transferred electronically to the United States on the last business day of 2006, along with an additional US$22.7 million to clear a similar debt owed to Canada.

The original loan of US$4.34 billion, equivalent to about $27 billion in today's dollars, was negotiated in 1945 by &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Maynard%20Keynes"&gt;John Maynard Keynes&lt;/a&gt; to protect the country from bankruptcy. Canada contributed US$1.2 billion, or an equivalent of about $7.5 billion today.

The loan was required after the U.S. terminated grants in aid to Britain under the &lt;a href="w%3ALend-Lease"&gt;Lend Lease Act&lt;/a&gt;, signed by then-President &lt;a href="w%3AFranklin%20D.%20Roosevelt"&gt;Franklin D. Roosevelt&lt;/a&gt; in 1941. On 2nd September 1945, with the decision to terminate aid, some of the goods were still in transit and it was necessary for Britain to arrange new loans to finance reconstruction.

The loan was negotiated at a 2% interest rate, payable over 50 years starting in 1950. The final payment was actually six years late, the British Government having suspended payments due in the years 1956, 1957, 1964, 1965, 1968 and 1976 because of financial difficulties at those times.

"At the time we first announced it, we were like, 'Well, we think these are probably lakes,’ but that was about our level of confidence. I would say at this point, we've analyzed the data to the extent that we feel very confident that they are liquid-filled lakes," said University College London and Caltech and Cassini team member, Ellen Stofan.

The rivers and lakes are likely to contain &lt;a href="w%3Aethane"&gt;ethane&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Amethane"&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt; in a liquid form, but the liquids are said to "act like water" and are "clear" like water. Both ethane and methane are organic gases on &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;. 

"Dark surfaces are smooth and most likely liquid, rock, ice or organics. More than 75 radar-dark patches or lakes were seen, ranging from 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) to more than 70 kilometers (43 miles) across. Some lakes appear partly dry, while others seem liquid-filled. Some of the partly filled lakes may never have filled fully, or may have partly evaporated at some point in the past. The dry lakes have margins or rims and a radar brightness similar to the rest of the surrounding terrain, making them appear devoid of liquid," said a statement by &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; on their website.

"It's going to behave like water. It's transparent just the way water is. So if you were standing by the shoreline, you would be able to see down to whatever pebbles or gunk that was on the bottom. As far as we know, there is only one planetary body that displays more dynamism than Titan, and its name is Earth," added Stofan.

Cassini will be performing at least 22 more flybys of Titan. The next flyby is expected to take place this month.

♡❤♡Australia♡❤♡

During a raid in the Sydney Suburb of Castle Hill, police found 1,900 litres of "liquid ecstacy". This bust, one of the largest in Australia's history, netted $549AUS million. Police have yet to make any arrests.

A record number of bicycles were sold in Australia during the 2006 year, totalling 1,273,781 sold units, which exceeded car sales by 32%. The short commute, rising gas prices, and better fitness have made the bicycle worth the investment.

Saddams' co-defendates are to be excuted Thursday. At press time, details still need to be worked out with the American military, but the two are expected to be at the gallows by the end of the day. In related news, Saddam Huissen was hang for the same charges earlier this week. An unauthorised video of the excutation made its way to the internet.

Former U.S. Chief Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Rehnquist"&gt;William Rehnquist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; suffered paranoid delusions in 1981 during withdrawal from a dependence on prescription painkillers, according to his recently-released &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; file.

The late head of the U.S.'s top court began taking the drug &lt;a href="w%3APlacidyl"&gt;Placidyl&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1970s for insomnia and back pain while he was an associate Supreme Court justice. His dependence on the drug was first made public when he was hospitalized for symptoms related to it in 1981, but the delusions were only revealed in the release of the file this week.

A doctor who treated Rehnquist told an FBI investigator the justice had "bizarre ideas and outrageous thoughts. He imagined, for example, that there was a CIA plot against him." Another doctor said Rehnquist "had also gone to the lobby in his pajamas in order to try to escape."

Rehnquist had been taking nearly three times the recommended maximum daily dosage of the drug. His delusions came when doctors at George Washington University Hospital took him off it. Eventually, they put him back on Placidyl and weaned him off slowly until he was cured of his dependence.

The FBI conducted an extensive investigation into Rehnquist's drug dependence at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee during his 1986 confirmation hearings to become chief justice.

Rehnquist's file was released to media and lawyers this week as part of a public records request. Rehnquist died in September 2005 and because his privacy could no longer be violated, the FBI OK'd its release.

The FBI was also asked to investigate Democrats who were set to testify against Rehnquist at the 1986 hearing, the file showed. The Democrats were set to testify Rehnquist intimidated minority voters in the early 1960s as a Republican Party official in Arizona.

It's not clear if the bureau ever did investigate the Democrats, however a memo in the file shows then-Assistant Attorney General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Bolton"&gt;John Bolton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the most-recent &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; Ambassador for the U.S., approved the investigation and said he would "accept responsibility should concerns be raised about the role of the FBI."

Rehnquist first took his seat as associate justice in 1972 and served on the court until his death.

The idea lies in implementing a long-term international cooperation plan that concerns suppressing the activity of criminals and other groups that use World Wide Web for promoting their interests.

Abdel Aziz Seif el-Nasr stated that soon Egypt will take necessary steps to present the idea on the international arena. He also outlined the fact that the plan for fighting &lt;a href="w%3Acybercrime"&gt;cyber-crime&lt;/a&gt; stipulates the introduction of new rules for Internet users.

<h1>Ethics debate surrounds surgery to stunt disabled girl's growth</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ethics%20debate%20surrounds%20surgery%20to%20stunt%20disabled%20girl%27s%20growth&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An ethical controversy has surged in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere around nine-year-old Ashley X (her family name has not been released). The disabled girl was operated upon at the request of her parents, to prevent her from growing, menstruating and developing breasts. The parents, who wish to remain anonymous, explain their situation on a blog entitled &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Ashley%20Treatment"&gt;The "Ashley Treatment"&lt;/a&gt;. There have been over 1000 reactions on the blog so far.

Ashley suffers a condition termed ♡❤static &lt;a href="w%3AEncephalopathy"&gt;encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; with marked global developmental deficits of unknown &lt;a href="w%3AEtiology"&gt;etiology&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, which means brain damage of unknown cause leading to a kind of static condition. She can make sounds, move her arms and kick her legs, but she cannot change her position, eat, walk, talk etc. Many of these children are in poor health and die young, but Ashley is in good health. For all of these functions she depends on her caregivers. Most of the day she passes watching her surrounding, lying on a pillow. Her parents call her their "Pillow Angel", "since she is so sweet and stays right where we place her—usually on a pillow."

Ashley's parents want to keep her at home and care for her themselves, and they want to guarantee their daughter's quality of life. To this end, they say, Ashley underwent several surgical procedures and medical treatments during a period of three years. To attenuate her growth, Ashley was given high doses of the hormone &lt;a href="w%3AEstrogen"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt;. Ashley now measures 4ft 5 (1m 35cm) and weighs around 75 lbs (34 kg), which is below her expected length and weight. Her low body weight and size would improve her comfort, and at the same time facilitate the work of her caregivers.

Surgery to remove her uterus (a procedure called a &lt;a href="w%3Ahysterectomy"&gt;hysterectomy&lt;/a&gt;) and breast buds were performed, so Ashley does not menstruate and will not develop breasts, both of which parents think only would cause her discomfort. Since high estrogen levels can cause menstrual bleeding and breast development, the surgery was also meant to limit these effects. She also underwent surgery to remove her &lt;a href="w%3AVermiform%20appendix"&gt;appendix&lt;/a&gt;, because it would be difficult to diagnose &lt;a href="w%3AAppendicitis"&gt;appendicitis&lt;/a&gt; given Ashley's low communication possibilities.

<h2>The case report</h2>
Dr. Gunther, an endocrinologist, and Dr. Diekema, a pediatrician ethicist, from the Department of Pediatrics, &lt;a href="w%3AChildren%27s%20Hospital%20and%20Regional%20Medical%20Center%20%28Seattle%29"&gt;Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle&lt;/a&gt; published a case report on her treatment in the October 2006 issue of the medical journal &lt;a href="w%3AArchives%20of%20Pediatrics%20%26amp%3B%20Adolescent%20Medicine"&gt;Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. They suggest that "after proper screening and informed consent, growth-attenuation therapy should be a therapeutic option available to these children should their parents request it". In the paper, they refer to the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Academy%20of%20Pediatrics"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, which holds the belief that "most parents desire to raise their children with special health care needs at home", and "that all children, regardless of the presence of a disability, belong in families." Ashley's parents were quoted to fear that without an intervention, their daughter would be "put in the hands of strangers."

Ashley has two siblings, and the medical report notes that "Despite her severe disability, she clearly is an integral, and much loved, member of the family." The treatment was approved by a local multidisciplinary ethical committee consisting of 40 members. The committee noted that "although justified in this patient, growth attenuation should be considered in future patients only after careful evaluation of the risks and benefits on a case-by-case basis." 

In the case report discussion, the physicians recognize that surgical removal of the uterus in disabled girls "is controversial and invariably associated with the negative connotations and history of forced '&lt;a href="w%3ASterilization%20%28surgical%20procedure%29"&gt;sterilization&lt;/a&gt;.'" Indeed, some reactions on the internet accused the parents of practices bordering &lt;a href="w%3AEugenics"&gt;eugenics&lt;/a&gt; and "perversity". The hysterectomy eliminates the need for &lt;a href="w%3ACombined%20oral%20contraceptive%20pill"&gt;contraceptive hormone treatment&lt;/a&gt; in a population with "no realistic reproductive aspirations". Estrogens carry a theoretical risk for &lt;a href="w%3Athrombosis"&gt;thrombosis&lt;/a&gt;, but the clinical importance in this setting remains unknown. There seems to be a risk of &lt;a href="w%3Aseizures"&gt;seizures&lt;/a&gt; in a population with a predilection for &lt;a href="w%3Aepilepsy"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;.

In their paper, the authors also discuss the fact that Ashley's small stature could cause caregivers to continue treating her like a nine-year-old, even if she becomes older. But they do not believe that such "infantilization" will harm the child, because they believe her intellectual capacities are at about the same level, so such an approach may be in fact appropriate.

In an editorial by Dr. Brosco, Department of Pediatrics, &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Miami"&gt;University of Miami&lt;/a&gt;, he discusses the fact that there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that keeping a disabled person small allows them to be cared for at home for a longer period. He rejects the argument of interfering with nature too much, since it is not uncommon practice to treat girls who grow taller than what is normally accepted with estrogens. He argues that a small gesture alone might induce some intuitive ethical concern, but that shouldn't stop us "if we truly believe that the worth of a person goes deeper than his or her physical appearance."

Dr. Brosco also draws attention to a broader social context, indicating that the burden for the family is higher in a society that fails to provide adequate support. He notes that when the child enters the adult medical and social system, parents tend to get less access to often expensive care aids and devices. "As a society, we do a pretty rotten job of helping caregivers provide what's necessary for these patients," was the comment of another medical ethicist, Dr. Joel Frader of Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital.

In bioethical issues, where benefits and risks are weighed, "&lt;a href="w%3APrimum%20non%20nocere"&gt;do no harm&lt;/a&gt;" is one of the governing principle for doctors, who swear it in the &lt;a href="w%3AHippocratic%20oath"&gt;Hippocratic oath&lt;/a&gt;. Arthur Caplan, a biomedical ethicist at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Pennsylvania"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; that "Puberty, growth (and) aging happen to all of us and there are plenty of people out there who will require help from family or society... The solution isn't to take every person who is &lt;a href="w%3Aschizophrenia"&gt;schizophrenic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Aautism"&gt;autistic&lt;/a&gt; or behaviorally disoriented and keep them in a child-like state." He further warns of the &lt;a href="w%3ASlippery%20slope"&gt;slippery slope&lt;/a&gt; implications this kind of thinking might have.

For the third time in a row, Team Canada has won the gold medal at the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Junior%20Hockey%20Championships"&gt;IIHF World Junior Hockey Championship&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships"&gt;This year's tournament&lt;/a&gt; took place in &lt;a href="w%3ALeksand"&gt;Leksand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. Canada clinched gold in a 4-2 victory over Russia. The Canadian team held a perfect 6-0-0 record for the third straight year.

Canada's first three goals were all scored in the first period in a span of just under two and a half minutes. Scoring the goals for Canada were &lt;a href="w%3AAndrewCogliano"&gt;Andrew Cogliano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABryan%20Little"&gt;Bryan Little&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Toews"&gt;Jonathan Toews&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ABrad%20Marchand"&gt;Brad Marchand&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the third year in a row that Canada and the Russians have met in the gold medal game.

Canadian coach &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Hartsburg"&gt;Craig Hartsburg&lt;/a&gt; was quoted as saying after the game that "It's hard to describe. It's unbelievable", and that "I'm so proud of these kids. It's tough to come over here and win this thing."

Earlier in the day, the United States beat the hosts Sweden 2-1 in the bronze medal game. The Most Valuable Player Award for the tournament, along with the top goalkeeper award were given to &lt;a href="w%3ACarey%20Price"&gt;Carey Price&lt;/a&gt;, Canada's goalkeeper. &lt;a href="w%3AErik%20Johnson"&gt;Erik Johnson&lt;/a&gt; of the US received the top defenceman award, and Russia's &lt;a href="w%3AAlexei%20Cherepanov"&gt;Alexei Cherepanov&lt;/a&gt; got the top forward award.

The inflatable roof covering &lt;a href="w%3ABC%20Place%20Stadium"&gt;BC Place Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver, British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; was intentionally collapsed in a "controlled deflation" on Friday after a section of the dome was ripped open. As the seven-metre tear became caught in the wind, it began to make loud noises, which one stadium worker described as similar to "elephants running through your living room". The venue was evacuated and no one was reported injured. Windy weather conditions are blamed for the damage. Officials have not yet indicated when roof repairs can be completed to allow the facility to re-open.

BC Place Stadium was opened in June 1983 and is scheduled as a key venue for the &lt;a href="w%3A2010%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;2010 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. The roof costs $300,000 per year to maintain.

The avalanche started at 10:30 AM, starting about 12 miles off Interstate 70, and taking three different paths down the mountain before coming to a stop.

"Our crews said it was the largest they have ever seen. It took three paths," said a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, Stacey Stegman.

All eight (7 adults, 1 minor) have been taken to the St. Anthony Central Hospital in Denver. According to a hospital spokeswoman, all of the victims suffered minor injuries. Seven patients were released on Saturday. There were no casualties.

U.S. route 40 is currently closed to traffic. According to Winter Park spokesman Matt Sugar, there are no plans to close the ski hills. "We've gotten calls from all over the country asking if the resort is closed," he said, "and the answer is no."

This is the third snow storm to hit the Denver area in three weeks.

Scientists say that the rock that fell through the roof of a house in &lt;a href="w%3AFreehold%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey"&gt;Freehold Township, New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; this week was a &lt;a href="w%3Ameteorite"&gt;meteorite&lt;/a&gt; and was likely over a billion years old. The meteorite is currently owned by the same family whose house it hit; the names of the family members have not been released and no one inside the home was injured. 

The meteorite is named "Freehold Township" after the township it landed in. Although scientists have not yet been able to take samples of the rock, they have looked at it and say the rock is likely made of &lt;a href="w%3Airon"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; due to its "density, magnetic properties, markings and coloration", and probably a piece of a much larger asteroid. The rock weighs approximately 13 ounces (about .37 kilograms), which is little more than the weight of a can of soup.

"It's a pretty exciting find," said one scientist who has examined the rock, Jeremy S. Delaney. "It's a good candidate for the core of an asteroid," added Delaney.

Global warming has caused oceans around the world to rise in temperature making it increasingly difficult for fish to breathe, say scientists at &lt;a href="w%3AAlfred%20Wegener%20Institute%20for%20Polar%20and%20Marine%20Research"&gt;Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.

In the past 50 years, temperatures in the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltic%20Sea"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt; have risen causing &lt;a href="w%3Aoxygen"&gt;oxygen&lt;/a&gt; levels in the water to decrease.

"When you say I get less oxygen in, then I have less oxygen available for aerobic energy and I have less energy for the diverse tasks that a species needs to fulfill in an ecosystem, such as being ready to prey, grow, move and reproduce. It's a general weakening of the individual once it is going beyond its thermal limitation", said Hans Pörtner, an animal physiologist and ecologist.

Although the study only focused on the eelpouts, scientists say that the problem affects all fish and overfishing could occur.

"There is relatively strong evidence that the cod in the North Sea find it too warm to maintain high productivity. When the fishing industry maintains the same high fishing pressure—that has not been a problem before—with the lower productivity, this turns into overfishing," added Pörtner.

Scientists also state that the declining numbers in the eelpouts and fish does not mean that they will become extinct.

"It doesn't mean that the species will go extinct necessarily, but it means they will move. If temperatures are going to change in [the] future, then it will have a major impact on the distribution of animals," said a zoophysiologist at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Aarhus"&gt;University of Aarhus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, Tobias Wang.

Recently, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Interior"&gt;Department of Interior&lt;/a&gt; announced that they may add the &lt;a href="w%3Apolar%20bears"&gt;polar bears&lt;/a&gt; to the list of threatened species. Also recently, a &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; Arctic &lt;a href="w%3Aice%20shelf"&gt;ice shelf&lt;/a&gt; broke away from &lt;a href="w%3AEllesmere%20Island"&gt;Ellesmere Island&lt;/a&gt;. Both issues are said to have been caused by global warming.

<h1>Sunday Times says Israel is planning nuclear strike against Iran</h1>

According to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sunday%20Times%20%28UK%29"&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; is planning to use &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20bunker%20buster"&gt;nuclear bunker busters&lt;/a&gt; to destroy &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20program%20of%20Iran"&gt;nuclear facilities&lt;/a&gt;. The newspaper cites several Israeli military sources.

The report says that Israeli airforce squadrons at &lt;a href="w%3AHatserim%20Israeli%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Hatzerim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Nof%20Israeli%20Air%20Force%20Base"&gt;Tel Nof Airbase&lt;/a&gt; are training to use low-yield nuclear "bunker-busters". Some of Iran's facilities have been built underground and would thus be difficult to hit using conventional weapons. Targets would include the &lt;a href="w%3Auranium%20enrichment"&gt;uranium enrichment&lt;/a&gt; facilities of &lt;a href="w%3ANatanz"&gt;Natanz&lt;/a&gt;, a site near &lt;a href="w%3AIsfahan"&gt;Isfahan&lt;/a&gt; where gas for the enrichment process have been stored underground, and a &lt;a href="w%3AHeavy%20water%20reactor"&gt;heavy water reactor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AArak%2C%20Iran"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;.

"As soon as the green light is given, it will be one mission, one strike and the Iranian nuclear project will be demolished." said a source. The tactical nuclear weapons would only be used if conventional weapons were "ruled out" and if the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; "declined to intervene", the article continues, based on "senior" military sources.

Military analysts say that disclosure of the plans could be intended to put pressure on Iran to halt enrichment (which Iran says is for peaceful purposes), prod the United States into action or soften up world opinion in advance of an Israeli attack, according to the report. On December 24, Iranian president, &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; dismissed a resolution passed by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; imposing sanctions on Iran, calling it a "piece of paper". The Iranian Ambassador to the UN responded to the sanctions saying "A nation is being punished for exercising its inalienable rights." accusing the council of acting at the "behest of a dangerous regime with aggression and war crimes as its signature brand of behavior.", referring to Israel.

Most members of the Israeli government and military refused to comment on the report. Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev denied the plans for a military intervention, saying that Israel is supporting diplomatic efforts. Ephraim Kam, a strategic expert at Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Strategic Studies and a former senior army intelligence officer, also dismissed the report. "No reliable source would ever speak about this, certainly not to the Sunday Times," Kam told the Associated Press.

The &lt;a href="w%3AICANN"&gt;Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)&lt;/a&gt; announced Friday that its vote in May last year was not to reject the creation of &lt;a href="w%3A.xxx"&gt;'Triple X'&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ASponsored%20top-level%20domain"&gt;top-level domain (sTLD)&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, the corporation voted "not to approve the agreement as proposed, but did not reject the application".

A revised proposal for the .xxx domain is open to public comment until February 5. The revised proposal appears to have hinged on efforts by ICM, proponents of a voluntary adult top-level domain, to promote enforcement in the following areas: 
<ol>
BULLET::::1. Prohibit child pornography
BULLET::::2. Require clear labeling
BULLET::::3. Support development of user empowerment technology
BULLET::::4. Ensure that the child advocacy and free expression communities are involved in policy development for the sTLD.

</ol>
Who, or what, ICM is remains unclear. The home page of ICM states that, "The .xxx top-level domain will create a clearly identifiable area of the Internet so that Internet users can be more informed when choosing to select or avoid adult entertainment sites." 

The estimated $12 billion per year in revenues generated by on-line pornography could come under the scrutiny of unknown ICM, to whom ICANN proposes delegating responsibility to an organization, or individual, that has nothing more to say about themselves on their website than the background of their leaders.

<h1>Inventor of instant noodles passes away</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Inventor%20of%20instant%20noodles%20passes%20away&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The inventor of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Ainstant%20noodles"&gt;instant noodles&lt;/a&gt; has died in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 96. Momofuku Ando suffered from &lt;a href="w%3Aheart%20failure"&gt;acute heart failure&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, said &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANissin"&gt;Nissin Food Company&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3AMomofuku%20Ando"&gt;Momofuku Ando&lt;/a&gt; was born as Wu Bai-fu (吳百福) in &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AChiayi"&gt;Chiayi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, on March 5, 1910. He founded &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ANissin"&gt;Nissin&lt;/a&gt; in the year 1948 from a humble family operation. Japan faced food shortages during the post-&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; period and Ando thought a quality, convenient noodle product would help feed the masses. He brought out the Chicken Ramen, the first noodle product in the year 1958. The chicken-flavored dried noodle cake could be served in minutes by pouring hot water over it in a bowl. He started exporting it to the US during 1970.

The Cup Noodle concept was born in 1971. Ando said, he was inspired when he saw people lining up to buy bowls of hot ramen soup at a black market stall during this period. Its taste and ease of preparation made it one of the most favorite food in the world. The Chicken Ramen product had been a hit, and the despite a hefty tag of 35 Yen, he unleashed the product &amp;ndash; Cup Noodles, on the market. 

Nissin has been the undisputed leader of the noodle industry since then, selling a 85.7 billion servings every year, according to &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAgence%20France%20Presse"&gt;Agence France Presse&lt;/a&gt;.

"The Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum" opened in 1999 in Ikeda City in western Japan housing his various inventions. 

His firm also developed a version of Cup Noodles for Japanese &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Aastronaut"&gt;astronauts&lt;/a&gt; to eat on &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ASpace%20Shuttle%20Discover"&gt;Space Shuttle Discovery&lt;/a&gt;. "It is like a dream that people from rivaling countries can eat Ramen together in space," were Ando's words to the reporters at that time. He retired as the chairman of Nissin in the year 2005. The Japanese newspapers have been paying tribute to him by publishing long obituaries and eulogies. According to the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMainichi%20Shimbun"&gt;Mainichi Shimbun&lt;/a&gt;, Ando was last seen in public on Wednesday when he made a New Year's speech at Nissin's head office in Osaka and had a lunch with executives, a bowl of Chicken Ramen with rice cake.

The incumbent &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AGovernor%20of%20California"&gt;Governor of California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; had been one of the celebrities to endorse the brand. 

Ando is survived by his wife, Masako; two sons; and a daughter. His son Koki Ando is president of Nissin Food Products Co. Ltd.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Polish%20Archbishop%20resigns%20after%20spying%20revelations&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AStanislaw%20Wielgus"&gt;Stanislaw Wielgus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AArchbishop%20of%20Warsaw"&gt;Archbishop of Warsaw&lt;/a&gt;, resigned yesterday after admitting to have worked for the &lt;a href="w%3AS%C5%82u%C5%BCba%20Bezpiecze%C5%84stwa"&gt;secret police of Poland&lt;/a&gt; during the operation of the Communist government. At a mass in Warsaw Cathedral, the Archbishop was to have marked his formal installation. Instead, he tendered his resignation. The resignation came at the request of &lt;a href="w%3APope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt;, who had appointed Wielgus one month previously. 

The reaction to the resignation is mixed. Polish President &lt;a href="w%3ALech%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Lech Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt;, who attended the service, applauded the resignation. Wielgus' supporters gathered outside the cathedral, yelling "Stay with us". Those opposed to the Archbishop also gathered outside, carrying banners that said "non possumus" ("we cannot allow that").

Since the late 1960s, the former Archbishop spied on members of the Church for about 20 years. After the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGazeta%20Polska"&gt;Gazeta Polska&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper published allegations of his actions on December 20, Wielgus denied them. However, when church officials announced they had obtained documents showing that Wielgus had willingly co-operated with the secret services, he acknowledged that the accusations were true. 
There is some suspicion&lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6239669.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the documents were leaked by communists, in retribution for the Catholic Church's role in the fall of European communism.

A poll, conducted by the TNS OBOP Institute and published January 5 in the Polish daily ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ADziennik%20Polska-Europa-%C5%9Awiat"&gt;Dziennik Polska-Europa-Świat&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, revealed that 26% supported the Archbishop's immediate resignation, 41% thought that he would have to resign "after some explanations", 20% believed that he should keep his position, and 13% had "no opinion".

Cardinal &lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%B3zef%20Glemp"&gt;Józef Glemp&lt;/a&gt; will retain the position of apostolic administrator until a replacement is chosen.

The largest telecom company in Brazil, &lt;a href="w%3ABrasilTelecom"&gt;BrasilTelecom&lt;/a&gt;, has blocked its users from accessing &lt;a href="w%3AYouTube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; following a court order to shut down the popular video sharing website.

BrasilTelecom did not issue an official statement regarding YouTube, but its customers are complaining that all access to the website is blocked.

A ban on YouTube was ordered by Brazilian courts after celebrity &lt;a href="w%3ADaniela%20Cicarelli"&gt;Daniela Cicarelli&lt;/a&gt; sued the website for hosting unauthorized videos of her having sex on the beach. YouTube removed the videos, as is standard for videos it receives legal complaints about, but was unable to stop other users from uploading copies since it does not screen videos before they are uploaded.

Subway service in the United States capital city of &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; was disrupted Sunday afternoon when a &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Metro"&gt;Washington Metro&lt;/a&gt; Green Line train derailed as it approached the
&lt;a href="w%3AMt%20Vernon%20Sq/7th%20St-Convention%20Center%20%28Washington%20Metro%29"&gt;Mount Vernon Square&lt;/a&gt; station.

Sixteen passengers were reported hospitalised, but no critical injuries were reported. All passengers were evacuated from the trains less than an hour after the incident. The Mount Vernon Square station remained closed for the remainder of Sunday, with shuttle bus service bypassing the accident scene. Travel for Green and Yellow line passengers was delayed by 20 minutes during clean up and accident investigation. Normal service on Metrorail resumed on Monday.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVienna"&gt;Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 

A crowd of about 250 activists from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustrian%20National%20Union%20of%20Students"&gt;Austrian National Union of Students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Österreichische Hochschülerinnen- und Hochschülerschaft, ÖH) as well as the Organisation of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASocialist%20Students%20of%20Austria"&gt;Socialist Students of Austria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Verband Sozialistischer StudentInnen Österreichs, VSStÖ) quickly reacted to the announced forming of the new &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n coalition government by starting a demonstration in front of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Vienna"&gt;University of Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the largest in the country.

Specifically, the demonstration protested against the proposed plan of enabling students to do community service work at a rate of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEURO"&gt;EUR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 6 (about &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 7.6) per hour to work off student fees of about EUR 372 (about USD 475,8) per semester. These fees were introduced under the government of chancellor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWolfgang%20Sch%C3%BCssel"&gt;Wolfgang Schüssel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which ruled Austria from 2000 on.
The protest started directly in front of the university buildings on the famous &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARingstra%C3%9Fe"&gt;Ringstraße&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Protestors blocked the street by sweeping the street, symbolising the work students have to do in order to study. They proceeded to the headquarters of the SPÖ, where they chanted "Who betrayed us? Social Democrats!", and later to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustrian%20Parliament"&gt;parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; building. After this, they announced to go to the ÖVP headquarters, when this reporter had to leave the scene.

On October 1, 2006, a new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustrian%20National%20Assembly"&gt;National Assembly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was elected. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASP%C3%96"&gt;Social Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; narrowly won the election, while the ÖVP suffered severe losses and fell to second place. Since then, intense negotiations between the two parties about a coalition have taken place and presumably ended today, when at 13:30 hours, SPÖ leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlfred%20Gusenbauer"&gt;Alfred Gusenbauer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and ÖVP leader Wolfgang Schüssel announced the finishing of negotiations and conciliation of the two parties in a new government, which is to be sworn in by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustrian%20President"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHeinz%20Fischer"&gt;Heinz Fischer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on January 11.
One of the deals struck today between the SPÖ (who called for the complete abolition of the controversial student's fees during the election campaign) and the ÖVP calls for legislation enabling easier access to and higher scholarships, as well as reforms in the student loan system and, most visibly, a system whereby students will be able to work in organizations providing social and community services. For this work, they will receive EUR 6 per hour. The total fees for one semester amount to EUR 372; this means a student will have to work 62 hours per semester to fully pay the fees.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Natural%20gas%20odor%20permeates%20New%20York%20and%20Jersey%20Cities&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A strong odor of natural gas permeated through parts of &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrooklyn"&gt;Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJersey%20City"&gt;Jersey City&lt;/a&gt; early this morning. Authorities assert that there is no cause for alarm and assure the air quality, though smelly, is safe enough to breathe. &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;'s Health Department, the &lt;a href="w%3ACoast%20Guard"&gt;Coast Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AConsolidated%20Edison"&gt;Con Ed&lt;/a&gt; are still on the scene.

In a press conference, Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Bloomberg"&gt;Michael Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; says that a small gas leak at Bleeker St. and Sixth Av. "could not account for a smell so pervasive throughout the city". &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Authority%20Trans-Hudson"&gt;PATH&lt;/a&gt; trains were temporarily suspended from Hoboken, New Jersey, to the 33rd St. terminus, and an &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;MTA&lt;/a&gt; control tower at West 4th St. was also temporarily shut down.

"Sensors do not show any high concentration of natural gas that would cause concern" continued Bloomberg. "We want to take our time and make sure we don't get the wrong information. We cannot speculate, but these are the facts: the smell is there, we don't know the source, and it doesn't appear to be dangerous."

Some buildings in Midtown Manhattan were evacuated as a safety precaution, and &lt;a href="w%3AHVAC"&gt;HVAC&lt;/a&gt; systems in the area have been brought back online. Jersey City &lt;a href="w%3AEmergency%20Medical%20Technician"&gt;EMT&lt;/a&gt;s report that seven people have been taken to hospital, but it is unclear if it is a direct result of &lt;a href="w%3Amercaptan"&gt;mercaptanline&lt;/a&gt; inhalation.

&lt;a href="w%3AWINS-AM"&gt;WINS-AM&lt;/a&gt; reporter Juliett Poppa has been reporting along 34th St., commenting that the odor was most noticeable around Fifth Av., but has now dissipated. Radio announcer Lee Harris added that the odor was noticeable even in their Broadway and 57th St. studios. During an interview on air, a Con Ed spokesman said that no gas leak has been found.

"We've had reports as far north as 96th St. on the West Side and 130th on the East" said one NYC &lt;a href="w%3A3-1-1"&gt;311&lt;/a&gt; operator (This was during this journalist's report of a gas smell at 205th Street.)

Natural gas supplied for domestic and commercial use is odorless. Mercaptan is added to give natural gas its distinctive smell as an aid to leak detection.

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s first &lt;a href="w%3AMultiple%20birth"&gt;sextuplets&lt;/a&gt;, four boys and two girls, were born on the weekend of January 6th 2007 at the &lt;a href="w%3AB.C.%20Women%27s%20Hospital%20%26amp%3B%20Health%20Centre"&gt;B.C. Women's hospital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;. The first baby was delivered vaginally, while the following 5 had to be removed by emergency &lt;a href="w%3AC%20section"&gt;caesarean section&lt;/a&gt;. 

Dr. Liz Whynot, the Women's Hospital president said the first baby was delivered around 8:30 p.m. Saturday night, with the others born early Sunday. Whynot said the parents "... understand there is a lot of public interest in the birth of their babies, they are feeling overwhelmed. So they're asking for their privacy to be respected."

The children weigh about 800 grams each. The mother was reported to be in her 25th week of &lt;a href="w%3Apregnancy"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and the babies will require a period of time in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit as most pregnancies last 40 weeks.

<h1>Accusations Tigger threw punch fill airwaves as teen claims neck injuries</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Accusations%20Tigger%20threw%20punch%20fill%20airwaves%20as%20teen%20claims%20neck%20injuries&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A family has a video of what they claim to be "Tigger" punching their son. Visiting the Disney-MGM Studios on Saturday, Jerry Monaco Jr. of &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; alleges that Tigger purposely punched him without provocation. The footage was caught on the family's video camera, and the Monacos and their attorney are demanding an apology from the actor.

The costumed character actor at the time was employee Michael J. Fedelem.

The contact between the actor's mitted hand and the teen's face is brief. The video shows the following sequence of events:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Monaco Jr.'s left arm is moving behind Tigger, while Tigger's right arm is on Monaco Jr's shoulders.
BULLET::::- Tigger abruptly moves his right arm down and around, sweeping Monaco Jr.'s left arm off of his back, pinning Monaco Jr.'s arm to his body.
BULLET::::- Tigger then starts rotating clockwise, wherein Tigger's left arm moves across his body. It appears that Tigger briefly pulls down on his chin, in what looks like a move to possibly prevent the head from flying off.
BULLET::::- Monaco Jr. stumbles, in combination with his arm being pinned and Tigger's rotation.
BULLET::::- Tigger's left hand appears to hit Monaco Jr.'s head or face.
BULLET::::- Monaco Jr. appears to hit Tigger in the head area with his free right hand.

</ul>
The footage is very brief. It shows little before or after the punch, a total of only four seconds. 

Jean Erik Redrupp, General Manager of Park Operations, stated to Local 6 that "I just wanted to follow up with you and let you know that we have spoken to the cast member in question and have reacted very strongly toward him."

Monaco Sr. told the station that "The general manager apologized to me. Everybody will come up and apologize to me but Tigger. He won't be a man about it and get out of the costume and come out and apologize to my son. I didn't want VIP treatment. I didn't want an extra day at Disney. I didn't want any of that. I wanted him to apologize and that is the one thing that they won't do." In the statement, he did not clarify whom "everybody" was.

Both Disney and the Orange County Sheriff's Office launched investigations on Saturday. Fedelem has been suspended by the company until the investigation is complete. Disney commented in a statement to CBS News that: "We received the complaint alleging that a character struck a guest; guest and character altercation is not tolerated. The Orange County sheriff is launching an investigation and we are conducting our own investigation and we have suspended the cast member pending the outcome."
Monaco Sr. took his son to the hospital the night after the altercation. Monaco Jr. claimed that he had neck pains. "I'm a little sore and most of the pain is gone because I have medicine," he told the CBS Early Show today.

In footage, Monaco has no visible bruising.

The videotape was in regular rotation on news stations on Sunday and Monday. As of 4:00 pm ET 8 January 2007, Google News listed over five hundred news outlets filing stories on the incident.

<h2>Pooh once subject of similar attention</h2>
A 1981 case tried Winnie the Pooh, a character from the same series of cartoons as Tigger, was viciously slapped. The incident, which happened three years prior, was alleged to have resulted in bruising, recurring headaches, and possible brain damage.

Costumed character actor Robert Hill was the first witness in the case. He testified that the costume severely restricted his vision and movement. He recalled that the girl was tugging at his costume from behind. Turning to see who it was, he accidentally struck her ear.

The Disney attorney reentered the courtroom in costume, with Hill in costume. Hill responded to questions while on the witness stand. Pooh was asked "What do you do at Disneyland?" Hill danced down the courtroom aisle, causing the audience to burst into laughter. The judge stated, "Have the record show that he's doing a two-step." The comical procedure demonstrated the arms on the elaborate costume were too low to the ground to slap the girl at her then height.

After 21 minutes, defendant Robert Hill was acquitted on all charges.

Similarly in 1976, a women filed a lawsuit claiming one of the Three Little Pigs ran up to her at the "It's a Small World" attraction, grabbing at and fondling her, it supposedly exclaimed "Mommy! Mommy!" As a result, she claimed to have gained 50 pounds, seeking $150,000 in damages for assault and battery, false imprisonment, and humiliation.

The plaintiff dropped charges after Disney's laywers presented her with a photo of the costume, which had only stubs, not operable arms.

<h2>Previous Tigger accused, acquitted</h2>
Another Tigger performer, Michael C. Chartrand, was prosecuted on criminal charges. A 13-year-old girl and her mother both claimed he fondled their breast while posing for a photo, while visiting the Magic Kingdom on 21 February 2004. Arrested in April, Chartrand was charged with lewd and lascivious molestation of a child and simple battery. Twenty-four more complaints were logged with authorities in the following week, however each lacked sufficient evidence to press charges.

A plea bargain found him not guilty after Mr. Chartrand's attorney, Jeffrey Kaufman, donned a Tigger costume to demonstrate its limited visibility and maneuverability to the jurors. He was allowed to return to his job by August.

The same actor was later suspended after "shoving" a male and a female Kodak photographer in the chest as Goofy. His lawyer from the previous case felt this was just part of the act, and not unnormal. He also stated to his client that as a tall character actor at a Disney Park immediately following the court case, "he would be a walking bull's-eye" for such accusations.

A man who visited &lt;a href="w%3ACosta%20Rica"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; who was on &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flight 1552 from &lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami, Florida&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; was stung by a &lt;a href="w%3AScorpion"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. The scorpion was from Costa Rica, where the man was on a camping trip with his brother.

The scorpion crawled out of the man's carry-on knapsack. Then, the scorpion stung the man, who is believed to be in his 20s or early 30s. Flight officials immediately delayed the outbound flight. The man was treated by paramedics and was taken to hospital.

Later, the scorpion was killed. Animal control officers said the scorpion was a non-lethal species.

"We delayed the outbound flight and searched the cabin of the aircraft to see if we could find any more, which we did not," said John Hotard, a company spokesman in &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Worth%2C%20Texas"&gt;Fort Worth, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. "This is rare. I'm not aware of a scorpion stinging a person on any of our flights before."

"We've had cases where passengers have brought critters on board in their backpack and they get out and crawl around, but it's rare," he added.

They arrived safely at Toronto's &lt;a href="w%3APearson%20International%20Airport"&gt;Pearson International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. The flight back to Miami was delayed by less than an hour.

When the flight resumed, the pilot said: "Welcome to Scorpion Flight 1011."

The scorpion is said to have been brought on the plane unintentionally.

Mustafa Osman Ismail, &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan's&lt;/a&gt; Presidential Advisor, opened the possibility of allowing some &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%23Peacekeeping"&gt;United Nations peacekeepers&lt;/a&gt; into its troubled &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; region. Ismail admitted that the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; Commander in Darfur could request non-African troops if he decides that current troop numbers are not sufficient. This would allow forces from organisations such as the UN to send troops there at the Commander's request. When asked whether this would lead to UN troops in Darfur, Ismail replied "You are right."

While the region is &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union%20Mission%20in%20Sudan"&gt;currently overseen by 7,000 AU troops&lt;/a&gt;, hopes indicate that a joint venture might see as many as 17,000 UN and AU troops deployed, in addition to 3,000 police officers.

Sudan had previously rejected UN Security Council Resolution 1706, which authorised 22,500 UN peacekeepers to handle the &lt;a href="w%3ADarfur%20conflict"&gt;Darfur conflict&lt;/a&gt;. Since the start of the conflict, 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million driven from their homes.

&lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Laurent%20of%20Belgium"&gt;Prince Laurent of Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, the youngest son of &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20II%2C%20King%20of%20the%20Belgians"&gt;King Albert II of Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, has been questioned last night by the federal police and is attending today's court session in &lt;a href="w%3AHasselt"&gt;Hasselt&lt;/a&gt; in a marine fraud case that has gripped Belgian media since last December. He arrived in a &lt;a href="w%3Asmart%20%28automobile%29"&gt;Smart car&lt;/a&gt; and was accompanied by his lawyer and former politician Fred Erdman. The case turns around funds of the &lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20Navy"&gt;Belgian Navy&lt;/a&gt; that have been used to beautify the Prince's villa in &lt;a href="w%3ATervuren"&gt;Tervuren&lt;/a&gt;. The Prince is expected to testify this afternoon.

In total, &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt; 2.2 million was supposedly diverted from the marine's purchasing services using false invoices. Roughly € 185 000 was allegedly used to paint the Prince's villa, install lights in the garden, for the purchase of carpet and furniture, and for his secretariat and for animal clinics the Prince supports via his Foundation. Twelve marine officers and contractors are being accused of document fraud, collusion, bribery, embezzlement of government money ♡❤etc♡❤. and could face 10 years in prison. The money was part of the budget that wasn't spent at the end of the year, and which would flow back to the government if the army didn't spend it.

The Prince, who is also an officer in the navy, is being treated only as a witness in this case, there have been no charges against him. The Attorney General in Hasselt Marc Rubens has said that there are no elements in the investigation that point to the fact that Laurent was aware of the affair, however several accused have contested this in the press. Technically, the villa is not the property of the Prince himself, but of the Royal Gift, which manages the real property of the Royal Family.

During his interview by the police last night, Prince Laurent stated that he needed funds to renovate his villa, and that Noël Vaessen, his adviser, told him the Navy could help him. The Prince stated that he thought it was legal, and that he had no reason to doubt his adviser.

Ex-Colonel Noël Vaessen was an adviser of the Prince between 1993 and 1999. Vaessen has declared in the media during the last month that the Prince actively participated in the fraud, and that he fears a cover-up. He said that the Prince was a demanding party in the operation, and that "he knew that we were arranging things to make his life and his work as comfortable as possible." According to Vaessen, the Prince was in need of money to support a royal lifestyle, and "didn't even have enough money to buy food."

In 2001, Vaessen was discharged with honour from the army "for medical reasons", but Defence Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAndr%C3%A9%20Flahaut"&gt;André Flahaut&lt;/a&gt; is investigating if there was no agreement to give him his pension in exchange for the fact that he wouldn't incriminate the Prince. Vaessen also accused the Prince of other things, such as racing against the high-speed train &lt;a href="w%3ATGV"&gt;TGV&lt;/a&gt; on a French highway. He has also incriminated Admiral Herteleer. Captain Johan Claeys, one of the accused, studied with the Prince and worked at the facturation services of the Navy in 1998 and 1999. One of the accused contractors, Marc Luypaerts, has told the press that the judge responsible for the investigation in Hasselt had forbidden him to speak about Prince Laurent.

Laurent's status as a Prince has several judicial consequences for the trial. In Belgium, it's against the law to incriminate the Royal Family during a trial. Also, the Prince is protected from judicial pursuit because he is also a &lt;a href="w%3ABelgian%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; by law. Justice Minister &lt;a href="w%3ALaurette%20Onkelinx"&gt;Laurette Onkelinx&lt;/a&gt; has issued a Royal Decrete, which the King has signed while on holiday in &lt;a href="w%3ANapels"&gt;Napels&lt;/a&gt;, which would make it possible for Princes to testify in a trial.

However, Public Prosecutor Erwin Steyls has chosen to have Laurent interrogated by the police last night in Hasselt. This was the first time during the last six years of the inquiry that the Prince was questioned. Today in the court, the Prosecutor defended the act of having him questioned outside the trial, saying that there were several procedural issues. First, the subpoena for the Prince wasn't issued in time to be legal. Second, the details of the protocol to hear the Prince in court were not explained in the recent Royal Decrete, making it worthless -something Minister Onkelickx denied. Thirdly, nobody can be forced to testify against himself, and if the Prince were to make false statements under oath, he could only be sued for perjury. However, the court has decided to let him testify anyway this afternoon.

During the last month, the case has caused a several spin-off discussions in Belgium. One of the surprises during this period was the King's Christmas Message, in which he referred to the case. The regional governments are now investigating and discussing their donations to the IRGT/KINT, an environmental organisation supported by Prince Laurent. But there is also an ongoing debate over the position of the &lt;a href="w%3AMonarchy%20of%20Belgium"&gt;Monarchy in Belgium&lt;/a&gt;. Some politicians are suggesting to limit the role of the Monarchy, and other think that only the King and Queen, the Crown Prince or Princess and the widow(er) of the King or Queen should receive state funding.

A &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; nuclear-powered &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Asubmarine"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; collided with a &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aoil%20tanker"&gt;oil-tanker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrait%20of%20Hormuz"&gt;Strait of Hormuz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; late last night. Only minor damage to the tanker and no serious injuries were reported. 

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Newport%20News%20%28SSN-750%29"&gt;USS Newport News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; submarine collided with the stern of the Japanese oil-tanker, causing minor damage to the tanker. No personnel on either vessel were seriously injured, US Navy and Japanese government officials said. 

The straits of Hormuz connect the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea and is a major waterway for oil tankers. 

Immediately after the incident the tanker was able to continue to nearby port in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The tanker is owned by Japanese shipping company Kawasaki Kisen Ltd. 

The Japanese government was informed of the incident soon after by the Navy and the U.S Embassy in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They have requested that the U.S investigate the cause of the incident. 

The recent incident is a stark reminder of the February 2001 incident when a U.S. Submarine rammed into a Japanese fishing vessel in waters off &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , killing nine people.

<h3>&lt;a href="Polish%20Archbishop%20resigns%20after%20spying%20revelations"&gt;Polish Archbishop resigns after spying revelations&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
♡❤♡Poland♡❤♡

Stanislaw Wielgus, the Archbishop of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, resigned yesterday after admitting to have spied for Poland's former Communist Government. At a mass in Warsaw Cathedral, the Archbishop was to have marked his formal installation. Instead, he tendered his resignation. Since the late 1960s, the former Archbishop spied on members of the Church for about 20 years. After the Gazeta Polska published allegations of his actions on December 20, Wielgus denied them. However, when church officials announced they had obtained documents showing that Wielgus had willingly co-operated with the secret services, he acknowledged that the accusations were true.

♡❤♡United States♡❤♡

In New York, a strong odor of natural gas permeated through parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Jersey City early yesterday morning. Authorities asserted that there is no cause for alarm and assure the air quality, though smelly, is safe enough to breathe. In a press conference, Mayor Michael Bloomberg says that a small gas leak at Bleeker St. and Sixth Av. "could not account for a smell so pervasive throughout the city". "We cannot speculate, but these are the facts: the smell is there, we don't know the source, and it doesn't appear to be dangerous," the Mayor continued.

A family visiting the Disney-MGM Studios in Florida on Saturday has a video of what they claim to be "Tigger", the Winnie-the-Pooh character, punching their son. Jerry Monaco Jr. alleges that Tigger purposely punched him without provocation. The footage was caught on the family's video camera, and the Monacos and their attorney are demanding an apology from the actor.

India's yearly pilgrimage to the Ganges river is the worlds largest religious pilgrimage. This year thousands of Hindu Holy Men threatened to boycott festivals during their pilgrimage to the Ganges. The Hindus ritually wash away their sins by bathing in the river. However, raw sewage from Varanasi has raised the levels of fecal coliform bacteria to 1.5 million times the level safe for drinking.

Prince Laurent of Belgium, the youngest son of King Albert II of Belgium, has been questioned last night by the federal police and is attending today's court session in Hasselt in a marine fraud case. The case turns around funds of the Belgian Navy that have been used to beautify the Prince's villa in Tervuren. The Prince has testified this afternoon. Prince Laurent stated that he needed funds to renovate his villa, and that Noël Vaessen, his adviser, told him the Navy could help him. The Prince stated that he thought it was legal, and that he had no reason to doubt his adviser.

The &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that US forces began an on-going operation of airstrikes in southern &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, and that the attacks, targeted at Islamic militia, are continuing. Somalia's president had earlier said that the United States was pursuing suspects of the &lt;a href="w%3A1998%20United%20States%20embassy%20bombings"&gt;1998 United States embassy bombings&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that the militants are sheltering the suspects.

An attack against Ras Kamboni — a remote island near the Kenyan border, represents the first American involvement in the tumultous country since the &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Mogadishu"&gt;the 1993 operation that resulted in the deaths of as many as 1,500 Somali militiamen and civilians&lt;/a&gt;.

A Somali Defence Ministry official has additionally reported that American helicopters launched an attack against &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Courts%20Union"&gt;ICU fighters&lt;/a&gt; in Afmadow, a city near the Kenyan border, 350 kilometres southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AMogadishu"&gt;Mogadishu&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20AC-130"&gt;AC-130 gunship&lt;/a&gt; attack killed an unknown number of civilians, alternatingly reported as 4, 19 or 31.

<h2>Mixed reactions from international community</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-Moon&lt;/a&gt;, secretary-general of the United Nations, expressed concern that the unilateral actions represented a "new dimension" that could escalate hostilities. 

The concern was echoed by the Italian foreign ministry declared its "...opposition to unilateral initiatives which could set off new tensions" the Italian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

&lt;a href="w%3AEthiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;, which borders Somalia, sent in troops on Dec. 24 to defeat the Islamic movement that was in contradiction with Somalia's internationally recognized government, which at the time controlled only the western town of Baidoa.

News networks quickly picked up footage of Tigger punching a guest at Walt Disney World. The Monaco family claims that the costume character hit their son in the face unprovoked. He went to the hospital that night, to get medication for "neck pain".

The full home video of Tigger punching has now surfaced on YouTube, providing a unique context to the incident.

News outlets, on the other hand, were only provided with a four second clip of the footage, which seems to have been edited to back up the Monaco family's claims.

In the full footage, edited to include commentary, the blogger transcribes the voices of Jerry Monaco Junior and Senior, as Jerry Sr. videotapes the ground.

He comments that "it sounds like Jerry [Jr.] laughs, and then his arm goes down a bit", in order to undo the zipper on the back of Tigger's costume, before his punch is thrown.

"Now the question to ask is are the father and son game players? I mean, the father says, 'oh yeah, I was on your head.'"

The blogger comments that he notices "Jerry's pretty quick to hit Tigger back on the head... I mean if Tigger's hitting him out of the blue, he's reacting pretty fast in hitting Tigger."

&lt;a href="Apple"&gt;Apple Inc.&lt;/a&gt; today has introduced the much-anticipated &lt;a href="w%3AiPhone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; at the Macworld Conference in San Francisco.

The iPhone is claimed to be "a revolutionary mobile phone" as stated on the Apple website. The device appears to be running a mobile version of the Apple operating system Mac OSX. It is approximately the same size as a 5th generation iPod, it has a 3.5-inch LCD touchscreen display that is used to access all features of the phone including number dial, as well as making phone calls. The iPhone plays music, movies, displays pictures and is able to connect to a wireless network.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the device by walking onto the stage and taking the iPhone out of his jeans pocket. During his 2 hour speech he stated that "Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone, We are going to make history today".

Today Apple also released their Media Center device - &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20TV"&gt;Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;. It will directly compete with Microsoft's Media Center operating system. Apple has taken a different approach to the media center market; rather than storing content (such as movies, music and photos) on the device, Apple TV connects to a computer (Mac and Windows) over a wirless network connection and plays all content stored on that computer. This makes it substantially easier for users to organize their media content.

A student carrying a long bag and wearing military clothing prompted a massive police response at &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal, Canada's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AConcordia%20University"&gt;Concordia University&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. Many police vehicles swarmed the Loyola campus, but the only weapon discovered by officers was a stick used for martial arts purposes.

The incident brought back memories of Montreal's history of campus shootings. In 1992, a Concordia professor shot four people to death on the campus. In 1989 &lt;a href="w%3AMarc%20L%C3%A9pine"&gt;Marc Lépine&lt;/a&gt; killed 14 woman during the &lt;a href="w%3AEcole%20Polytechnique%20Massacre"&gt;Ecole Polytechnique Massacre&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, in September 2006, one student died when a gunman attacked &lt;a href="w%3ADawson%20College"&gt;Dawson College&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20Sudan"&gt;Central Bank of Sudan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has started circulation of the new &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASudanese%20pound"&gt;Sudanese pound&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that is to replace the current &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASudanese%20dinar"&gt;Sudanese dinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This measure is part of the peace agreement signed between the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Sudan"&gt;Government of Sudan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASudan%20People%27s%20Liberation%20Army/Movement"&gt;SPLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , that ended a 20-year old civil war.

The dinar was viewed in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Sudan"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as part of an attempted "Arabisation" of Sudan by the previous government and was not in circulation in areas controlled by the southern rebel movement. Several alternative currencies, including old Sudanese pounds were used instead.

According to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASabir%20Mohamed%20Al%20Hassan"&gt;Sabir Mohamed Al Hassan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the governor of the Central Bank of Sudan, the dinar will remain in circulation, along with the pound, for an interim period of six months before it is discontinued on July 1, 2007. 

The conversion rate set by the Central bank is 1 Sudanese pound equals 100 Sudanese dinars, and 1 piaster is equivalent to 1 dinar. A U.S. dollar trades for about 200 dinars.

The Central Bank said that the new currency design will reflect Sudan's peace vision, unity in diversity, civilization, natural resources and economic progress. Several themes were avoided in the new design including human portraits, references to wars and conflict, and religious and ethnic symbols.

The change is expected to cost over US $150 million. Hassan said that the expected international assistance in meeting the cost was not forthcoming and that Sudan's oil revenue was used instead, Reuters reports. 

Shipments of the new currency have been sent to the south, where it is to be introduced first.

Eyewitnesses told the &lt;a href="w%3AFars%20News%20Agency"&gt;Fars News Agency&lt;/a&gt; (FNA) that a radiant &lt;a href="w%3AUFO"&gt;UFO&lt;/a&gt; had crashed in the Barez Mounts of &lt;a href="w%3AKerman"&gt;Kerman&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday morning. 

Abulghassem Nasrollahi, the Deputy General of the &lt;a href="w%3AKerman"&gt;Kerman&lt;/a&gt; province in &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; told the news agency that all the aircraft in the area had been accounted for, but did not rule out the possibility that the object could be a meteor. 

Another source also told the FNA that the object was on fire with thick smoke coming from it, and claimed that this implied the object was not a meteor. However, meteors appear as bright fireballs in the sky, as they are heated to high temperatures due largely to &lt;a href="w%3Aram%20pressure"&gt;ram pressure&lt;/a&gt; as they fall at high speeds through the Earth's atmosphere. Meteors often burn up completely before reaching the ground and some leave a smoke-like trail in their wake. 

Abulghassem noted that a few days earlier, in &lt;a href="w%3ARafsanjan"&gt;Rafsanjan&lt;/a&gt;, a similar incident was reported by witnesses.

Teamsters Union has spoken out in defense of Michael J. Fedelem, a Disney employee who played Tigger at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park.

The international news media jumped on Fedelem Sunday, after he hit a teenage guest in the face.

Teamsters representative Donna Lyne Dalton says that the teen had been "agitating" the actor in costume. Dalton says the teen grabbed the back of the costume, effectively cutting off air. Because of his headpiece's limited peripheral vision, Fedelem was unaware he was swatting anyone, when he moved his arm.

On Sunday, video broke internationally of Fedelem as Tigger, hitting teen Jerry Monaco Jr. in the head. The New Hampshire tourist and his father both claim the hit was unprovoked.

"Nuh, no provokin' at all, ya know, it was all out of the blue." Junior told FOX News.

Monaco Sr. commented, "At first I'm upset with my son. I'm like, Jerry don't, ya'know ... but then I review it, I mean it's pretty clear, for no reason, he just clocked him in the face."

A full version of the video was released on YouTube yesterday. In the footage before Tigger's punch, Monaco Sr. taunts Tigger, saying "Aw, too much? Heh... I was on your head."

Investigation is still underway by the Orange County Sheriff's Office into the hit Tigger unleashed on a tourist at Walt Disney World on January 6.

The status of Walt Disney World's separate investigation is unknown.

Yesterday Captain Mark Strobridge confirmed with Wikinews that the investigation was on-going. "The Orange County Sheriff's Office is investigating the case and is not prepared to provide details at this time." They are not commenting to the press on any details.

The Walt Disney Company (Canada) Ltd. has not replied to Wikinews' multiple requests for comment. The Monaco family has not talked to the press since an exclusive CBS ♡❤The Early Show♡❤ appearance a week ago Monday. They had originally talked to a FOX News affiliated channel.

Two Sundays prior, video broke internationally of Disney employee Michael J. Fedelem as Tigger, hitting teen Jerry Monaco Jr. in the head. The New Hampshire tourist and his father both claim the hit was unprovoked. They claimed Jerry Jr. needed medical attention and prescription medicine that night. In contrast, most Internet pundits critical of the video have suggested that the hit was relatively weak. Fedelem himself claims the swat was indeed provoked, after the Monaco Jr was pulling on his costume, trying to suffocate him.

The Teamsters Union Local 385 website appears to suggest that not all character cast members are unionized. Fedelem is known to be unionized, as he is mentioned on the website regarding a separate matter.

<h2>Hit becomes punchline</h2>

Tim MacDonald of The News and Tribune joked that, "in addition to her Majority Whip", new US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi "might want to consider hiring the DisneyWorld employee in the Tigger costume to keep her Democrats in line."

Meanwhile, a British columnist riffed on how Tigger let the boy off lightly. Brian Reade commented "most Brits feel that, simply on the grounds he's called Junior, it's a shame the guy in the Tigger costume wasn't called Charles Manson."

A columnist suggested that "Tigger does more parenting before 9 a.m. than some parents do their entire lives", in an article advocating discipline. Doug Powers contined that, "If the boy was taken to the hospital for that, Lord help him if he's ever in a pillow fight. The poor lad would be in traction for a month."

The "grievance" against a Teamsters Union Local 385 person named "Michael Fedelem", "was resolved prior to Step 3." It is presumed, but not known, if this website mention relates to the employee who played Tigger at Walt Disney World, as he is mentioned on the "Character Team" page of the website.

Teamsters representative Donna Lyne Dalton had previously stated that the teen had been "agitating" the actor in costume, according to Feledem, cutting off the air supply to the costume. The actor swatted his arms and claimed to have no intention to hit the boy due to the lack of peripheral vision.

On Sunday, video broke internationally of Fedelem as Tigger, hitting teen Jerry Monaco Jr. in the head. The New Hampshire tourist and his father both claim the hit was unprovoked.

Adam DePrisco, a 19-year-old from &lt;a href="w%3AWoodbridge%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Woodbridge, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, was found dead in &lt;a href="w%3AAcapulco%2C%20Mexico"&gt;Acapulco, Mexico&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday.

The family of the young man are still looking for answers after Mexican authorities said that he was hit by a car after leaving a nightclub. The family believes that the young man was beaten to death. Marco Calabro, a friend who went to Mexico with DePrisco, also believes that he was beaten to death.

Calabro and DePrisco were in a nightclub on Saturday, and DePrisco was dancing with a Mexican woman. The woman's boyfriend became upset. The Canadian men were urged to leave the nightclub. Not long after, Calabro found his friend lying on the road bleeding from his head.

DePrisco died in a Mexican hospital on Monday evening.

"The pain in my heart is not just for my nephew; it's for any Canadian -- you go out to have a good time and this is what happens," Claudio Pannozzi, his uncle, told ♡❤CTV News♡❤. "When you think Mexico, think twice."

DePrisco is the third Canadian who has recently died in Mexico, after &lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Ianiero"&gt;Nancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADomenic%20Ianiero"&gt;Domenic Ianiero&lt;/a&gt;, a couple also from Woodbridge, who were stabbed to death at a luxury resort hotel near &lt;a href="w%3ACancun"&gt;Cancun&lt;/a&gt;, also a popular vacation destination.

Mexican officials came under fire shortly after the Ianiero case last February. They are currently investigating the case of Adam DePrisco. Talk radio shows in Canada are even suggesting the Canadian federal government ban Canadians from going to Mexico.

It is not yet known when DePrisco's body will be returned to Canada.

Six &lt;a href="w%3APremature%20birth"&gt;premature&lt;/a&gt; babies born in &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; could get a blood transfusion, if the parents allow it. Premature babies are usually encouraged to get them, especially the sextuplets born on Sunday, which weigh 700 to 800 grams.

The parents are &lt;a href="w%3AJehovah%27s%20Witnesses"&gt;Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;/a&gt;, a faith that has a doctrine against blood transfusions. (Officially, the church holds that blood transfusions consisting of blood products, rather than whole blood, may be accepted by Witnesses in some circumstances as a matter of individual conscience; however, de facto all blood transfusions are forbidden to Witnesses. Many people who are a part of the faith create an Advance Medical Directive card ordering that &lt;a href="w%3AJehovah%27s%20Witnesses%20and%20blood"&gt;no blood transfusions&lt;/a&gt; be given under any circumstances.)

"&lt;a href="w%3ABlood%20substitutes"&gt;Non-blood&lt;/a&gt; treatment is way superior in every situation and many doctors in hospitals worldwide are calling it the gold standard," said Mark Ruge, director of public information at the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20headquarters%20for%20Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses"&gt;Canadian headquarters for Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;/a&gt;, from his office in &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgetown%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Georgetown, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. "Even for young children and babies, there are alternatives – no (blood) transfusion doesn't mean you're going to die."

"To have blood is not the superior way, even though the little jingles on TV say blood gives life...Parents want the best for their children and so do we; we consider life very precious," said Ruge. "We love our children dearly; we're very family oriented... but there can be a public misperception."

Peter Cech, a spokesperson for &lt;a href="w%3AB.C.%20Women%27s%20Hospital%20%26amp%3B%20Health%20Centre"&gt;B.C. Women's Hospital&lt;/a&gt; said their religious status was leaked by the media.

"I'm very curious about that," said a man of the Jehovah's Witnesses Assembly Hall in &lt;a href="w%3ASurrey%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Surrey, B.C.&lt;/a&gt; "So what if they're Jehovah's Witnesses? What difference does it make? If they were Catholic would the hospital have said that?"

"If a Catholic had sextuplets would people call the &lt;a href="w%3AVatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt;?" he added. "When there's a car crash or someone has won the lottery, do they mention religion? This isn't a religious issue."

No information has been released since the babies were born after the parents publicly asked for privacy. The first child was born 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, the others Sunday.

&lt;a href="w%3ASaskatoon%2C%20Saskatchewan"&gt;Saskatoon, Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt; – 

<h2>Travel shut down</h2>
 closed many schools and highways as the eye of the storm traversed this western province. Travelling from , into northern Alberta and Edmonton, Alberta region, through and to , a severe started the night of Tuesday January 9, 2007. By Wednesday January 10, 2007, the storm tracked from Alberta and hit Saskatchewan. According to weather announcements on the Weather Network the blizzard is expected to abate in Saskatchewan by 9:00 pm Central Standard Time. At the height of the storm, gusting winds approached upwards of 80 miles per hour. The temperature began in the morning around -10 Celsius, dropping to -21 Celsius by the evening. 

Blowing snow conditions reduced visabliity to less than a car length at times. Some drivers who dared venture out on the highway told of needing to leave their car to kick away snow on the ground in order to determine if they were still driving on pavement. Heroic citizens donned ski pants and parkas, and thus bundled against the elements, assisted drivers who were unable to navigate the black ice covered by the fresh snow at the top of the . In this way their efforts relieved an already bad condition of the piled up congestion on this bridge. Early in the afternoon, the new was closed, and traffic was ill advised to use Circle Drive, which was battered by drifting snow drifts and gusting winds coming in from the open countryside. Around noon, it was said that taxi companies ceased to operate. A typical 15 minute venture driving across the City of Saskatoon mounted into line ups of 1 to two hours as traffic slowed to a snail's pace, due to stuck vehicles, accidents, tow trucks, emergency vehicles, and vehicles unable to navigate steep hills and the underlying black ice from previous winter conditions. Highways, public schools and school bus routes were among the first to be closed. Shopping malls, universities, colleges and high schools soon followed. Any children who arrived at school in early morning were kept at the school until parents could pick them up. Pedestrians were virtually impossible for vehicular traffic to see, and drifting snow made sidewalks hard to navigate. According to media sources, some children may be stranded overnight at schools in cases where roads are totally impassable due to white out conditions. By 6:00 pm City transit buses were not running, Saskatchewan transit buses would not take on highway travel and the airport closed down. Any travellers were strongly urged to book into hotel rooms by 3:00 pm as many hotels were near capacity by mid afternoon. Attempts to use cell phones were often greeted with a busy signal, as the network was loaded with calls during the emergency period. At 3:00 pm any calls for ambulances were encouraged to be of necessity only, and even then a 20 minute wait for the arrival of an ambulance was foreseeable according to radio announcements. As of 7:00 pm, police were only responding to crimes in progress and emergency situations. Tow trucks and were having a difficult time responding to situations. Residents were strongly urged to stay at home.

<h2>SGEU Snowplow operators strike overview</h2>
To make matters more complicated highway workers supported the Saskatchewan Government Employees Union, (SGEU) which had been on strike since December 20, 2006. Correctional workers, and environmental employees who were on strike were joined by snowplow operators and supervisors Sunday, January 7, 2007. By the end of Sunday approximately 1,200 highway workers were on a rotating strike, and had walked off the job. 
On Tuesday, January 9, 2007, in the face of weather predictions, SGEU advised highway workers to return to work. By Wednesday, January 10, 2007, the brunt of the storm was faced by a full contingent of snowplow workers.

<h2>Environment Canada Blizzard Warning</h2>
A Blizzard warning from environment Canada reported zero to almost zero visibility in Saskatchewan. The area around announced closures first. Many highways closed between north western centrally located , and as far south and east as , and everywhere in between. Highways out of the cities were barricaded. Police and media were advising any and all travel be delayed till the conditions abate. Snow is drifting and the strong winds have made total snowfall hard to calculate.

<h2>Weather shuts down Saskatchewan</h2>
At 7:30 p.m. CST Martensville - Warman - Rosthern - Delisle - Wakaw-
City of Saskatoon. Blizzard warning in effect. Wind northeast 60 km/h gusting to 80 diminishing to 40 gusting to 60 then becoming north 20 near midnight. Low minus 27. Wind chill minus 38.
Winter storm warning in effect for Southern Saskatchewan.

<h2>Photographs of the Storm</h2>
Pictures of the January 10 Saskatchewan storm are online which were taken by CP Press photographer Geoff Howe. Sun Young walking to work, College Drive pedestrian, and three young samaritans who helped vehicles navigate the weather. 

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
The full effects of the blizzard have yet to be witnessed in news reports of Thursday January 11, 2007. Wednesday's announcements of leaving the home only if absolutely necessary, and blizzard warnings to eliminate highway travel hopefully have averted many disasters. As of Friday, January 12, three people in Saskatchewan had succumbed to the storm.

In Saskatchewan it has been reported on January 11, 2007 that three persons have lost their lives due to the blizzard. All had left their vehicles and fell short by meters of shelter from the elements. 

Due to traffic snarls and tie ups emergency rescue personnel used snowmobiles to search out stranded vehicles and investigate for persons within. Several weary travellers were indeed found in this way. Due to drastic cold weather, vehicles failing to start, and homes being snowed in, school was cancelled the day following the blizzard, as wind chill dropped to -47 Celsius. Tow trucks were busy all day Thursday, and a special phone number was available for city residents who had abandoned their vehicles in the storm. To clear the streets, tow trucks would take vehicles to empty parking lots till claimed. 

In Saskatchewan to attain "blizzard" status, a storm must last at least 4 hours. Wednesday's storm delivered approximately 7 hours of zero visibility. This storm severe as it was pales in comparison to the February 1947 blizzard which raged for 10 days burying trains, and the 4 day long blizzard of February 1978 which deposited snow up to the eavestrough of homes. The storm has been dubbed an ♡❤♡Alberta Clipper♡❤♡ storm as it had its origins in the Rocky Mountains in western Canada racing south and westerly across Alberta and the prairies towards the Appalachains and north eastern USA as well as Eastern Canada. Frigidly cold weather follows the low pressure front of the Alberta Clipper storm.

&lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; gave a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20Way%20Forward"&gt;speech that unveiled a "surge" strategy plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt;. His plan involves sending 21,500 more troops into &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. He and Iraqi Prime Minister &lt;a href="Nouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt; have sent benchmarks for the Iraqi government to accomplish. These benchmarks include increasing the Iraqi Army's size and appointing a head general of the army and two deputy generals. The increase in troops would be used to occupy areas after they have been cleared from insurgents.

Republicans on the Armed Services Committee voiced support for the plan. “To my colleagues, I would ask, at least in the short term here, that we measure our words, that we not... declare the war lost when it’s not yet lost," said Senator Lindsey Graham "or to embrace strategies that would lead to defeat.”
