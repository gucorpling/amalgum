<h1>Mexico score three against Iran in Group D</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Mexico%20score%20three%20against%20Iran%20in%20Group%20D&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Two half-time substitutions by &lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20La%20Volpe"&gt;Ricardo La Volpe&lt;/a&gt; helped &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to a 3-1 win over &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANuremburg"&gt;Nuremburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.

The first half of this Group D tie ended 1-1 and it appeared to be a close contest between two hard-working teams. Then the &lt;a href="w%3AMexican%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Mexican coach&lt;/a&gt; Ricardo La Volpe, who was observed smoking a cigarette during the game, made two substitutions at half time. This seemed to change the game.

Shifting from three to two forwards, in the second half the &lt;a href="Central%20America"&gt;Central America&lt;/a&gt;ns won the ball more often in midfield; they then piled pressure on the &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; goal with an effective short passing game. Iran failed to adequately adapt to this tactical change.

With 15 minutes remaining an Iranian defensive error led to the game-winning goal, and a great flowing move four minutes later made the result look convincing for Mexico.

The Mexican team did lose experienced striker &lt;a href="w%3AJared%20Borgetti"&gt;Jared Borgetti&lt;/a&gt; to what seemed to be a leg muscle injury on 46 minutes. This will be a concern to the coach. But the majestic performance of captain &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Marquez"&gt;Rafael Marquez&lt;/a&gt;, who seemed to be nearly everywhere, ensured onfield leadership was unaffected.

His team had to wait a while for the go-ahead goal. On 75 minutes &lt;a href="w%3AEbrahim%20Mirzapour"&gt;Ebrahim Mirzapour&lt;/a&gt;'s clearance fell short; his centre back then failed to control the ball and &lt;a href="w%3AOmar%20Bravo"&gt;Omar Bravo&lt;/a&gt; was put through to slide the ball in for his second goal. In the first half Bravo had deflected a &lt;a href="w%3AGuillermo%20Franco"&gt;Guillermo Franco&lt;/a&gt; header into the net for his first. 

Iran, in all red kit, had a good first period but was out-played in the second. Iran equalised from a goalkeeper error on 36 minutes. Centre back &lt;a href="w%3AYahya%20Golmohammadi"&gt;Yahya Golmohammadi&lt;/a&gt; poked into the top of an empty net after Mexico keeper &lt;a href="w%3AOswaldo%20Sanchez"&gt;Oswaldo Sanchez&lt;/a&gt; had leaped and missed at a ball crossed in from a corner kick. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABranko%20Ivankovic"&gt;Branko Ivankovic&lt;/a&gt;'s Iran side conceded the third goal on 79 minutes, Mexico's familiar green and white shirts now swarming all over the Iranian defence. Zinha passed the ball wide to the right of the penalty area. Zinha, surging forward, rose unmarked on the penalty spot to greet the cross and guided the ball into the bottom right corner of Mirzapour's net.

Daryl Brown, former trader of Oklahoma-based &lt;a href="w%3AWilliams%20%28company%29"&gt;Williams Power Company&lt;/a&gt;, pleads guilty in federal court of conspiracy to manipulate natural gas prices between 1998 and 2002, during the &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20energy%20crisis"&gt;California energy crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Brown is the third Williams trader to plead guilty of similar charges since 2004. Brown had agreed to cooperate in an ongoing probe.

U.S. Attorney Kevin Ryan said, "Mr. Brown admitted that approximately 75 percent of the trades he reported to industry newsletters were deliberately fabricated. These false data skewed published prices so the company could illegally profit."

Brown will be sentenced on September 22.

With the goal scored after four minutes it might have seemed the game would be a rout for the Portugal side. With attacking stars Figo, Ronaldo and Pauleta, they lined up against an Angolan team who made their first appearance at the World Cup in the Rhein Energie Stadion.

But a score of 6-0 or 5-1 - the scores of the two times the teams had played in their recent fixtures - was not to be. And, in a defensive move, on 61 minutes Ronaldo, was pulled off by Portugal's Brazilian coach Luis Felipe Scolari. 

Ronaldo in the first half had a header that hit the Angolan crossbar but it might be the yellow card the gifted 20-year-old had received which prompted the move to rest the player.

Angola did not make the game easy but when it seemed the Portugal coach was content with his side to defend the lead against the former Portugal colony some in the crowed jeered loud enough to be heard on television.

This would be no disrespect to Figo who was on exceptional form, involved in almost every Portugal attack. Despite the defensive tactics he might have created more goals but for the deep-sitting Angolan defence that made it difficult to get a clear sight of goal. 

Angola, in an apparent attempt to keep the score respectable, kept 11 men in their own half of the pitch for much of the game. In the second half, as the clock ticked, Angola appeared reluctant to attack the Portugal goal in numbers such that Portugal could catch them on the break.

The only goal conceded by Luis De Oliveira Goncalves side was the result of the inventive play of Portugal's famous number seven. Figo cleverly knocked the ball around a defender and ran at speed into the penalty box. His run brought Angolan goalkeeper Joao Ricardo toward him, and Figo found Pauleta in the perfect position to pass the ball into the net.

A huge snowstorm has hit &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

Some parts of South Canterbury have had as much as 30 cm.

Some bus services in &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt; have closed down, including the Rangiora line.

Christchurch Airport has closed.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMetService"&gt;MetService&lt;/a&gt; reports that there is a good chance of getting up to a half a metre of snow.

Further north in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, the bad weather also caused power outages when an earth-wire at the Otahuhu substation snapped. The substation is the main supplier of power going into Auckland.

Internet Service Provider (ISP) &lt;a href="w%3AXtra%20%28ISP%29"&gt;Xtra&lt;/a&gt; reports that some people will experience Internet failure, especially where the power outages are, Auckland and the rest of the upper North Island.

The power is expected to be back by at least nightfall &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_New_Zealand"&gt;NZST&lt;/a&gt;, however some places are reporting to have had power back.

The &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky%20Kernel"&gt;Kentucky Kernel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Kentucky"&gt;University of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; student newspaper, rejected a full-page ad calling for Tubby Smith's dismissal as the men's basketball head coach. Richard Cheeks, a professor at the school, and a group called Concerned Fans for UK Basketball sought the $1,700 ad.

Cheeks said "We see the program in decline. ... We don't want it to decline the way the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Louisville"&gt;Louisville&lt;/a&gt; program did in the latter years when &lt;a href="w%3ADenny%20Crum"&gt;Denny Crum&lt;/a&gt; was there. So we decided that we were going to begin to get our message out."

A spokesman for Kentucky basketball, Scott Stricklin, said "Being that he's one of the nation's winningest coaches, he pretty much knows what it takes to win championships because he's done it here," Stricklin said.

The Kentucky Kernel's general manager, Chris Poore, the decision to reject the ad was without the influence from the University of Kentucky's administration.

In the past nine seasons at Kentucky, Smith has obtained a 241-71 record, including winning the 1998 national championship.

&lt;a href="w%3AArgentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; has defeated &lt;a href="w%3AWales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3Arugb%20union"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ARaul%20Conti%20Stadium"&gt;Raul Conti Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Madryn"&gt;Puerto Madryn&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. Both nations scored three &lt;a href="w%3Aytry"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt; each, but it was the kicking of &lt;a href="w%3AFederico%20Todeschini"&gt;Federico Todeschini&lt;/a&gt; that got Argentina home in the 27 to 25 win. It was Welsh head coach &lt;a href="w%3AGareth%20Jenkins"&gt;Gareth Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;'s first game in charge.

After opening pressure applied by the Welsh, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Jones%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Mark Jones&lt;/a&gt; scored the opening try of the game, dashing over in the corner to give the Welsh a five to nil lead after five minutes. The try was not converted. However Argentina was quick to reply as &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Manuel%20Leguizamon"&gt;Juan Manuel Leguizamon&lt;/a&gt; scores a try for the Pumas one minute later to level the scores at five-all. With &lt;a href="w%3AFederico%20Todeschini"&gt;Federico Todeschini&lt;/a&gt; being successful with his conversion, Argentina takes the lead seven to five. &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Evans"&gt;Ian Evans&lt;/a&gt; intercepts a pass and runs 60m to score Wales' second try. With &lt;a href="w%3ANicky%20Robinson"&gt;Nicky Robinson&lt;/a&gt;'s conversion, Wales is back in front with a 12 to seven lead. &lt;a href="w%3AGavin%20Thomas"&gt;Gavin Thomas&lt;/a&gt; is yellow-carded at the ruck which results in a penalty for Argentina which Todeschini kicks to bring the score to 12 to 10 to Wales. One man down, Wales avoids conceding another try as &lt;a href="w%3AIgnacio%20Fernandez%20Lobbe"&gt;Ignacio Fernandez Lobbe&lt;/a&gt; penalisesd for a double-movement. One minute from half-time Wales has second played yellow-carded in &lt;a href="w%3AAlix%20Popham"&gt;Alix Popham&lt;/a&gt;. Argentina scores a late try with &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Maria%20Nunez%20Piossek"&gt;Jose Maria Nunez Piossek&lt;/a&gt; running in the right corner. Todeschin adds the conversion,subsequent penalty shots are taken by both nations, though Wales' missed and Argentina goes into the break leading 20 to 12.

Six minutes into the second half, Robinson misses a long range penalty goal and the scores remain at 20 to 12 for Argentina. However, in the 62nd minute he gets another shot at goal and is successful to get Wales to 15 to 20. Minutes later &lt;a href="w%3ARodrigo%20Roncero"&gt;Rodrigo Roncero&lt;/a&gt; is sent to the sin bin for Argentina, and Robison kicks a penalty goal to narrow the gap to 20 to 18. With just two points separating the nations, with three minutes remaining, &lt;a href="w%3AFrancisco%20Leonelli"&gt;Francisco Leonelli&lt;/a&gt; scores a try for Argentina and Todeschini's conversion takes their lead to 27 to 18. However, in the third minute of extra play, &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Hook%20%28rugby%29"&gt;James Hook&lt;/a&gt; scores a try for Wales and Robinson adds the conversion. However, after Wales is penalised for holding on in a tackle, the referee signals the end of the match and Argentina wins 27 to 25.

Researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;University of New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; have discovered that &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; healthcare workers do not wash their hands often enough in the course of their work. Researchers claim the practice places patients at risk of contracting infections.

The study, which looked into hygiene practices in Australian hospitals, found that some healthcare workers only washed their hands 15 percent of the time. Mary-Louise McLaws, a researcher at the University of NSW, said that the research found that most staff only washed their hands after using the toilet or when they felt dirty.

Professor McLaws said healthcare workers should wash their hands after coming into contact with each and every patient. Even after simple tasks such as taking a patient's temperature and making a bed, healthcare workers should wash their hands according to the study.

Researchers explained that despite more sinks being placed in hospitals, infection rates were still high. They concluded that behaviour modification was also required.

The study also found that hand washing after coughing or sneezing was beneficial for preventing the spread of &lt;a href="w%3AInfluenza"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt;. Professor McLaws said, "We really need to get the message into the community that we wash our hands to protect others too".

A train carrying 200 people has crashed into a pick-up truck in &lt;a href="w%3ANetanya%2C%20Israel"&gt;Netanya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;. At least 75 people are injured and at least five have died. Police say that the truck was pushed onto the tracks by another car when the train smashed into it. The driver was not injured.

"A train travelling from Tel Aviv to Haifa struck a truck at ... a junction. As a result of the impact, the first three carriages of the train were derailed. We are dealing with a large number of casualties," said a spokesman for the Israeli Police.

Witnesses say that the driver of the truck managed to escape before the train hit the vehicle "crushing" it in the process.

"I'm not sure why (the truck) got stuck, but its two front wheels got caught. The driver got out before the crossing gate came down. ... The train just continued steaming ahead with the truck, and the truck was crushed," said Miri, a witness on the scene.

The train was traveling from &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AHaifa"&gt;Haifa&lt;/a&gt;.

Police in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; have reported that they pulled over a 10 year-old child driving his grandmother's car along the &lt;a href="w%3ANewell%20Highway"&gt;Newell Highway&lt;/a&gt; in North-Western NSW on Sunday.

According to police, they received numerous calls around 12:30 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday from truck drivers who were concerned that two children appeared to be alone in a red &lt;a href="w%3AHolden%20Commodore"&gt;Holden Commodore&lt;/a&gt; station wagon, one of which was driving along the busy highway. The Newell Highway is the primary road transport route between &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AMoree%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Moree&lt;/a&gt; police dispatched a highway patrol unit that located the vehicle 35 km North of Moree.

When signalled by police, the 10-year-old driver pulled over and got out of the vehicle with his six-year-old brother to speak to police. They told police that they were with their grandmother in &lt;a href="w%3ABoggabilla.%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Boggabilla&lt;/a&gt; when they decided to visit their grandfather in &lt;a href="w%3AMoree"&gt;Moree&lt;/a&gt;, 120 km South. The children said they had taken their grandmother's car to make the trip. When pulled over by police, they had travelled around 85 km.

Sergeant Matt Clifford said "They appeared to be driving normally … certainly better than probably some other people on that road".

Police drove the vehicle to the children's grandparents' home in Moree where the children were returned to their grandparents.

A large &lt;a href="w%3Ameteorite"&gt;meteorite&lt;/a&gt; slammed into the side of a mountain near the area of &lt;a href="w%3ATroms"&gt;Troms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFinnmark"&gt;Finnmark&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; at about 2:05 a.m. on June 9, 2006. 

Scientists say the explosive force of the meteorite could have been "compared to the &lt;a href="w%3AAtomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki"&gt;Hiroshima bomb&lt;/a&gt;." Truls Lynne Hansen of the Northern Lights Observatory, however, called this description "an exaggeration."

"This is simply exceptional. I cannot imagine that we have had such a powerful meteorite impact in Norway in modern times. If the meteorite was as large as it seems to have been, we can compare it to the Hiroshima bomb. There were ground tremors, a house shook and a curtain was blown into the house," said Norwegian astronomer, Knut Jørgen Røed Ødegaard.

"Of course the meteorite is not radioactive, but in explosive force we may be able to compare it to the bomb," added Ødegaard.

The last record for a meteorite impact in Norway was Alta, weighing over 198 pounds. It struck in 1904.

"The record was the Alta meteorite that landed in 1904. That one was 90 kilos (198 lbs) but we think the meteorite that landed Wednesday was considerably larger," said Ødegaard. He also said that area residents could find remnants of the meteor.

Professor Kaare Aksnes of the Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo later apologised for the comprison with the Hiroshima bomb "We cannot be completely sure, but the light and sound phenomena were exceptional. It indicates that there has been a great deal of energy involved."

&lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Aviance"&gt;Kevin Aviance&lt;/a&gt;, a 38-year-old gay male drag queen and singer, was attacked outside the "Phoenix," a &lt;a href="w%3Ahomosexual"&gt;gay&lt;/a&gt; bar in &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Manhattan, New York&lt;/a&gt;'s East Village. Police say that he suffered head injuries, a broken jaw and bruises, but is in stable condition.

"I thought they were going to kill me. I was thinking 'Is this the way I'm going to die?’” said Aviance.

Police call the assault a hate crime and say that four boys ages 16-20 are responsible for the attack. Police also say the boys were calling Aviance "faggot." Jarell Sears and Akino George, 20, Gregory Archie, 18 and Gerard Johnson, 16 are being charged with first-degree assault and hate crimes.

According to Len Evans, the publicist of Aviance, people who were walking by refused to help. Evans also said that Aviance was not in drag at the time of the attack, saying that he was "dressed like a boy." Evans also says that at least "six or seven" people were involved in the attack.

"They kicked me in my back, they kicked in my knees. They just kept kicking," said Aviance. "I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never been harassed. If anything people approach me with warmth."

Aviance was scheduled to perform at several gay pride events in Manhattan, before the pride parade on June 25. Evans says that he will not be performing at those events.

"I'm supposed to be doing all this stuff. With my jaw wired shut, what can I do?" added Aviance.

Aviance has had several number one dance hits including "Din Da Da" in 1997, "Alive" in 2003 and "Give It Up" in 2004.

In what amounted to a dramatic last 10 minutes Guus Hiddink's side overturned Japan's single goal lead as the searing heat of the Fritz Walter Stadium, Kaiserslauten, made Australia's all-out-attack brand of football too hot to handle.

Australia had faced disciplined and organised Japanese defending for 84 minutes of the game. Captain Tsuneyasu Miyamoto looked impressive while goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi made key saves against Australian captain Mark Viduka - including a double one in the first half.

The Socceroos might consider themselves unfortunate for the goal they conceded. It was disputed with questions of goalkeeper interference. In any event, on 25 minutes Mark Schwarzer failed to reach a cross looped in from the right; the ball sailed over his head and into the net. 

The match had good passing, inventive plays; both sides played with three defenders and encouraged attacking football, with much of the play in and around the penalty areas. After second half substitutions, Australia ended the match with three forwards over six feet in height and this may have made the difference.

But had Japan scored from a number of good opportunities they made the Australian come back may not have been enough.

The equaliser on 84 minutes owed to similar element of luck or goalkeeping error as the first goal. The Japan keeper missed a throw from the left. The ball fell loose to midfielder Tim Cahill, close to the penalty spot. The substitute drove the ball low through the legs of players to score.

Then the Japanese may feel unfortunate - a minute later Tim Cahill appeared to up-end a Japanese player in his penalty box. No penalty was given; the score remained 1-1.

Zico, the Brazilian manager of the Japanese team who had been minutes from successfully guiding his team to a first game win, then watched as Tim Cahill on 89 minutes scored his second from the top of the semi-circle; with much deftness, he curled the ball in off the right post. Kawaguchi had no chance.

At this point the Japanese, in the 30-plus &lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;Celsius&lt;/a&gt; heat, seemed to be exhausted while the Australian substitutes were just warming up. Substitute John Aloisi used his pace to beat Yuichi Komano and put the ball in the bottom left corner for the third goal. 

There were seven cautions in the game and a total of 33 fouls. However; it was Australia, who had more cautions and committed twice as many fouls as their opponents, whose extra aggression paid in the end.

At least nine people were killed in a series of attacks in &lt;a href="w%3AKashmir"&gt;Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, including one close to a camp housing &lt;a href="w%3AHindu"&gt;Hindu&lt;/a&gt; pilgrims, while a boy died in police firing. Suspected Islamist militants threw three grenades at a crowded bus station in Jammu city, police said, killing one person and wounding 22. The station is close to a camp where hundreds of pilgrims are staying before embarking on a long journey to &lt;a href="w%3AAmarnath"&gt;Amarnath&lt;/a&gt;, a Hindu shrine deep in the &lt;a href="w%3AHimalayas"&gt;Himalayas&lt;/a&gt;.

"I was about to board a bus when something exploded between some buses," said Manoj Kumar, who sustained glass splinter injuries and was admitted to a local hospital. Islamist militants fighting against Indian rule in the disputed region have attacked the annual pilgrimage several times in the past but the last three years have been peaceful. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

In a violent day in the troubled Himalayan region, a teenage boy was killed in Kupwara district when police fired to disperse Muslim demonstrators protesting against what they believed had been the desecration of a &lt;a href="w%3AKoran"&gt;Koran&lt;/a&gt; and a mosque, witnesses and police said. Twenty others, including 10 policemen, were injured in the clash 85 km northwest of &lt;a href="w%3ASrinagar"&gt;Srinagar&lt;/a&gt;. On Saturday, villagers told journalists that soldiers had entered a mosque wearing shoes and then desecrated a copy of the Islamic holy book.

A policeman was killed and another wounded as suspected militants fired on a police patrol in Sopore town, north of Srinagar, police said. And unidentified gunmen shot dead seven labourers -- said to be from the Indian state of Bihar -- in Anantnag district in south Kashmir. No group claimed responsibility and the army said it was investigating.

According to Wikipedia, the conflict between Islamist separatists and the military in &lt;a href="w%3AJammu%20and%20Kashmir"&gt;Jammu and Kashmir&lt;/a&gt; has claimed thousands since the early 1990s. The region has long been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan, with both nations claiming sovereignty over it.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATamil_Nadu"&gt;Tamil Nadu&lt;/a&gt; Government on Sunday said it would forego sales tax on the incremental component of the recent diesel price and yet maintain bus fares of State Transport Undertakings (STUs) at existing levels. Announcing this, Chief Minister &lt;a href="w%3AKarunanidhi"&gt;M. Karunanidhi&lt;/a&gt; said following the decision, the incremental retail price, inclusive of the sales tax component, would come down from Rs. 2.23 a litre to Rs. 1.78. As a result, the price of diesel, that increased from Rs.33.72 a litre to Rs.35.95 on Tuesday, would come down to Rs. 35.50. But, by foregoing the sales tax of 45 paise a litre, the State Government would lose Rs.180 crore annually. The decision not to increase the fares would result in Rs.100-crore additional burden on the STUs, Mr. Karunanidhi said in a statement.

His announcement came after a similar initiative by Maharashtra and a day after Union Petroleum Minister Murli Deora met him in Chennai. A couple of days ago, the Chief Minister had said that any reduction in the sales tax could result in the bus fares going up. In the statement, Mr. Karunanidhi said the rising crude oil prices globally necessitated an increase in fuel prices. It had become routine for the ruling party to explain the circumstances leading to the increase and the Opposition to protest. The upward revision in petrol and diesel prices was being talked about by the Centre for some months now, but was put on hold. The Centre, he said, had little option but to increase the price despite some of the coalition partners opposing the move and even the President of the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian_National_Congress"&gt;Indian National Congress&lt;/a&gt; (Congress Party) &lt;a href="w%3ASonia_Gandhi"&gt;Sonia Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; not favouring it. 

While a reduction in levies on petroleum products by the Centre and the State Government was a temporary solution, the long-term solution was to reduce consumption of petroleum products and promote research on their alternatives. In a statement, &lt;a href="w%3AAIADMK"&gt;AIADMK&lt;/a&gt; General Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AJayalalithaa"&gt;Jayalalithaa&lt;/a&gt; said the State Government could reduce the price burden by reducing the sales tax on petrol and diesel. Noting that it was not her suggestion but what Mr. Karunanidhi had given when she was Chief Minister, she said the Centre had recently said that such a move could reduce the impact of petrol and diesel price increase.

<h1>Czech Republic coast to 3-0 win over USA in Group E</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Czech%20Republic%20coast%20to%203-0%20win%20over%20USA%20in%20Group%20E&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Tomas Rosicky's lethal finishing ensured an easy 3-0 win for the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in Group E, Gelsenkirchen, Monday.

The immaculate surface of the Veltins Arena, a pitch that can be covered and uncovered by a retractable roof over the stadium, saw the Czech Republic give USA a lesson in football efficiency.
The United States had 55 per cent ball possession but scored no goals; the team lacked aggression and creativity near the Czech Republic goal. Passes did not reach the forward players in goal scoring positions. 

In the air long balls into the box were picked like apples from a tree by Czech Republic goalkeeper Petr Cech. On the ground, the USA short passing game faced resolute blocking and tackling from the Czech Republic defence.

For the Czech Republic, Rosicky and Pavel Nedved were a problem for the USA defence whenever they got the ball.

On 76 minutes the two combined for Rosicky's second goal of the match, Nedved sent his team mate through three USA defenders. With the outside of his right foot, the younger protege of Czech football clipped the ball over Kasey Keller's left arm.

The first goal had come on five minutes; it equaled the third goal in directness and the clean finish. A long ball down the left flank of the USA defence led to a first-time cross into the box. Jan Koller headed powerfully past Kasey Keller.

The pick of the three, on 35 minutes Tomas Rosicky picked the ball up 35 yards out from goal; a few seconds later the Teamgeist football had glided beautifully into the net, swerving left of a diving goal keeper.

For the seventh successive time an American side has failed to beat European opposition in a World Cup match and with Italy in the same group USA coach Bruce Arena may need his players to produce something special to get past the group stage of the tournament. 

Jan Koller had to go off with a muscle injury on 41 minutes. This is unfortunate for the Czech Republic coach Karel Bruckner as he was the Czech's highest goalscorer in World Cup qualification. As a tall well built man Koller provided a different means of attack to the small, sprightly - and today deadly - Rosicky.

Today in &lt;a href="w%3AReno%252C_Nevada"&gt;Reno, Nevada&lt;/a&gt; a judge has been shot in a courthouse while he stood near a third floor window. The police and a &lt;a href="w%3ASWAT"&gt;SWAT&lt;/a&gt; team have been searching the nearby parking garages for the shooter. Judge Chuck Weller was hit in the chest with the bullet at the Mills B. Lane Justice Center around 11:15 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3APacific_Daylight_Time"&gt;PDT&lt;/a&gt;. 

He was rushed to the Washoe medical center said police spokesperson Steve Frady. Police have closed off many blocks in the downtown casino district around the courthouse to look for the shooter. 

The police have found one suspect. His name is Darren Roy Mack &lt;a href="http%3A//www.news10.net/storyfull2.aspx%3Fstoryid%3D18119"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Roethlisberger"&gt;Ben Roethlisberger&lt;/a&gt;, starting quarterback for the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;National Football League&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%20Steelers"&gt;Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;, has been seriously injured in a motorcycle accident Monday at roughly 11:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_Daylight_Time"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;. Early reports indicate he has broken his nose and jaw, but the full extent of his injuries remain unknown. Roethlisberger has already undergone surgery for his nose and mouth. He was riding without a helmet on Second Avenue near the intersection of 10th Street in downtown Pittsburgh when he collided with a silver Chrysler New Yorker, reportedly striking the windshield with his head.

Backup quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Batch"&gt;Charlie Batch&lt;/a&gt; was at the emergency room at &lt;a href="w%3AMercy%20Hospital%20%28Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania%29"&gt;Mercy Hospital&lt;/a&gt; today, but was unavailable for comment. Steelers head coach &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Cowher"&gt;Bill Cowher&lt;/a&gt; has talked to Ben in the past about riding without a helmet, and retired Steelers quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ATerry%20Bradshaw"&gt;Terry Bradshaw&lt;/a&gt; has spoken out strongly against the habit of riding without a helmet in the past.

A press conference held around 10:30 p.m. confirmed that Roethlisberger successfully underwent seven hours of surgery, and suffered no serious injuries in the initial accident apart from the broken nose and jaw. Initial reports of knee injuries were overstated. Actual knee injuries were limited to &lt;a href="w%3ARoad%20rash"&gt;road rash&lt;/a&gt;, and do not extend to joint injuries.

The match was notable for being the first time Ghana had played in the World Cup. At 25 years and two months Ghana also had the youngest team at the tournament. In the end the team's inexperience showed in the result.

Italy responded to early Ghanian pressure with forceful passing and aggressive attacks through Luca Toni. At first this effected to keep the fearless Africans, always looking to attack themselves, on the back foot. 

With Luca Toni Italy always looked dangerous going forward. On 25 minutes he evaded a defender and rasped a shot onto the underside of the crossbar. It missed going over the goaline by just a yard.

Ratomir Dujkovic's side had the best chance to shock the Azzuri after half an hour. Emmanuel Pappoe had space in the box - but skied his attempt over the bar. For some time it seemed goals might go in at both ends, as action was at one end, then another. But with tiredness Ghana lost some discipline in defence and ran out of ideas in attack.
The challenge of the two superb Italian defenders, Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta, proved too tough. The Italian penalty area was almost impermeable to the white shirts for long stretches.

Ghana found no good opportunities to test Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon partly because Ghana was unable to deliver crosses to target inside the box. Efforts on goal were restricted to shots from outside the box from Michael Essien.

Only four out of Ghana's 14 shots were on target. In contrast Italy had 18 shots; 13 were on target. This tells the story of a game in which two teams attacked a lot, but a vastly superior defence won.

Andrea Pirlo scored the game-winner. On 39 minutes, he received a pass from a corner at the top of the area; in plenty of space, he curled it low and hard into bottom left corner of the net.
Richard Kingston made a number of good saves to keep the Italians ahead by just the one goal but could not do anything about Samuel Kaffour's error on 83 minutes. Kaffour's back pass was too short and Vincenzo Iaquinta rounded Kingston to score.

Earlier, as Ghana got desperate, Asamoah Gyan tried something to unlock the Italian defence: a solo run; powering past blue shirts he got as far as the penalty area. Then he appeared to be fouled by Daniele De Rossi; the referee did not blow his whistle.

Marcelo Lippi, the Italian coach, might feel this game, the second in Group E, was a good work out for the Italians who were just a bit too wise for the Ghana team on this occasion.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARice%20University"&gt;Rice University&lt;/a&gt; baseball team (55-11) beat the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oklahoma"&gt;University of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; (45-22) in the &lt;a href="w%3ANCAA"&gt;NCAA&lt;/a&gt; Super Regional 9-5. Rice won the series between the two schools 2-1 and will now play in the &lt;a href="w%3ACollege%20World%20Series"&gt;College World Series&lt;/a&gt;.

Rice rallied in the 6th inning and turned a 4-3 deficit into an 8-4 lead. Rodriguez put Rice up 5-4 with a bases-loaded single, then Joe Savery helped bring the score to 8-4 after a hit toward center field that was just right of the 400-foot sign.

Other schools that have already advanced to the College World Series are Cal State Fullerton, Oregon State, Clemson, and Georgia Tech. South Carolina and Georgia will play later today to determine which school advances to the College World Series.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEntertainment%20Software%20Association"&gt;Entertainment Software Association&lt;/a&gt; president Douglas Lowenstein confirmed speculations that his group is planning to file a lawsuit against the state of &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; because of a new law, HB3004. Under this law, games that have "inappropriate violence" are added to a list of materials that are considered harmful to minors.

Lowenstein said that the ESA believes "HB3004 will restrict the First Amendment rights of Oklahoma's citizens and intend to file suit in Oklahoma federal district court shortly, asking that the state's new video game law be overturned."

Similar laws have been found unconstitutional in St. Louis, Indianapolis, Washington, Illinois, and Michigan. A &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; video game law is currently being reviewed in federal court. Last week, a &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; law was passed fining minors $25 for purchasing games rated "mature" or "adults only". Shortly afterwards, the ESA filed a lawsuit there.

Martin Bionics, a company based out of &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma%20City%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, was awarded the patent to a computer-controlled ankle. The Oklahoma Center for the Advancement for Science and Technology funded $573,000 towards the development of the device.

The computer-controlled ankle functions similar to how the brain controls a real human ankle. Although prosthetic ankles allowed for some basic performance, the technologies remained limited in where and how they may be used.

Vice president of research and development, Jay Martin, said "This design grants a greater sense of security and confidence to the amputee. Functioning at a higher level, walking with a smoother step and dressing without limits will provide the patient with greater self confidence."

Martin Bionics plans to have the ankle commercially available within the next two years.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Dallas%20Mavericks"&gt;Dallas Mavericks&lt;/a&gt; beat the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Heat"&gt;Miami Heat&lt;/a&gt; 99-85 in the second game of the &lt;a href="w%3ANBA%20Finals"&gt;NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt; and lead the series 2-0. The second game was solidly in Dallas' favor the entire time.

Miami star &lt;a href="w%3AShaquille%20O%27Neal"&gt;Shaquille O'Neal&lt;/a&gt; scored his career low in points for a playoff game and sat out the final 15 minutes. O'Neal was handed a $10,000 fine, as well as a $25,000 fine for the team, for declining to speak to reporters after the game.

Miami head coach, &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Riley"&gt;Pat Riley&lt;/a&gt;, said "I've been in a lot of playoff games, and I've gotten beat by 40, 30, 25, won by 25 or 30. Doesn't make any difference. The whole thing is about the next game and trying to leave this one behind us. Maybe it will set a fire in us a little bit."

Dallas must win two more games to become the NBA champions.

Authorities in southern &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; detained over 100 people when police mistook a game of &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; as a brawl. Police apparently received a tip that a large crowd had gathered at an empty sports ground on the outskirts of the city on Sunday afternoon. Around 70 policeman arrived at the scene to find a large number of cars parked around the area, and what appeared to be a crowd that was watching two rival gangs fight each other.

The police stopped the event and around 100 people were detained until they learned that they were actually playing a game of rugby. Everyone was released within a few hours, but authorities were displeased that they had not informed them of the sporting event earlier. A spokesperson for the police said, "Given the difficult, troubled situation in the region, at a time when counter-terrorism actions are being actively conducted, citizens are obligated to inform [authorities] either verbally or in writing of their intentions."

"The fact that police took us to be hooligans, this isn't the first time," said one of the organisers.

&lt;a href="w%3ATropical_Storm_Alberto_%25282006%2529"&gt;Tropical Storm Alberto&lt;/a&gt; is on-going. One WikiNews associate on the ground in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; provided this cover story from the front page of a local paper http://media.tbo.com/ttt/images/pdfs/TribFront.pdf .

Tropical Storm Alberto is currently over Florida. At present the West Florida Coast has flood warnings. The &lt;a href="w%3AWeather%20Channel"&gt;Weather Channel&lt;/a&gt; is providing clear live footage of the Tropical Storm as it progresses over Florida.

Businesses like Walmart are beginning to take the storm seriously. &lt;a href="w%3AWalmart"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has approximately 80 affected retail units in the area.

17 shelters opened in 11 different counties according to the Weather Channel.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Vaccine%20developed%20to%20fight%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease%20considered%20%26quot%3Bpromising%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A team headed by Yoh Matsumoto at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience in &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; has developed a &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; vaccine, with no side effects, to fight &lt;a href="w%3AAlzheimer%27s%20disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; and call the drug "promising." The vaccine, thus far, has only been tested on mice and is only in the experimental stages.

Tests are going to soon be done on monkeys and if that turns out successful then tests on humans could be done in perhaps three years, said lead researcher Yoh Matsumoto of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience in Japan.

"This work represents a promising new line of vaccine development but more research would be needed to see if this could be replicated safely in humans," said Doctor Clive Holmes of the Alzheimer's Research Trust.

The vaccine is given by an injection and works by reducing the amount of certain amyloid proteins, which scientists believe are the cause of the illness. The study says that the amount of amyloid proteins in different areas of the brain was reduced, in some cases, up to 50%. In the lowest amounts, the protein was reduced 15.5%. In direct areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, the reduction of the protein was 40-50%. Amyloid proteins, when over produced, are believed to cause the symptoms of the illness by forming masses in the brain, which spread. The vaccine involves injecting the mice with the protein and then the DNA vaccine. The vaccine codes itself to the protein, stopping the spread of the masses by not allowing the protein to reproduce.

"DNA vaccines are given by intramuscular injection, which stimulates the production of anti-amyloid-beta antibodies. In the early stage, we highly expect that DNA vaccination will prevent disease progression and, hopefully, normalize brain function," said Matsumoto.

However, Matsumoto also said that patients who are experiencing "advanced cases" of the illness will have "irreversible damage" even if they received the vaccine.

"In advanced cases, however, neuronal loss and brain atrophy are very severe and irreversible. So it may be difficult to obtain clinical improvement with DNA vaccination," said Matsumoto.

In 2003 18 of the 298 people testing the vaccine had symptoms of brain swelling and the trials were stopped. At least 6% of those testing the vaccine had an over-reaction, which caused swelling of the brain and some even suffered brain damage.

Researchers say the new development is "safe" but that it will be "years" before any real and extensive clinical tests of the vaccine begin.

"Any of these vaccines could prove safe and effective. But we are years away from seeing them widely used in clinical practice -- but perhaps as few as three years away," said chairman of the Alzheimer's Association's Medical and Scientific Advisory Council, Dr. Sam Gandy.

"The findings support the idea that a vaccine is our best hope for fighting this devastating disease for which there is currently no cure," said Doctor Susanne Sorensen, of the Alzheimer's Society.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General_of_Australia"&gt;Governor-General&lt;/a&gt; Major-General &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Jeffery"&gt;Michael Jeffery&lt;/a&gt; has formally created an instrument declaring the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt;'s Civil Unions Act, 2006 invalid. The instrument comes into effect from midnight tonight (&lt;a href="w%3ATimes%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt;).

Wayne Berry, speaker of the ACT Legislative Assembly called on the Governor-General earlier today to deliver an address from the assembly about the ACT's Civil Unions Act. According to the Governor-General, Mr Berry was advised that the request would have to be referred to the federal government.

Major-General Jeffery said that he must refer the matter to the federal government for their consideration. After consideration, the government is required to advise him in the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Executive%20Council"&gt;Federal Executive Council&lt;/a&gt; as to whether or not he should exercise his powers. The Governor-General denied having authority under the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20constitution"&gt;constitution&lt;/a&gt; to act without the advice of the Federal Executive Council where there is a difference between the policies of the ACT and the federal government.

Under the Commonwealth Australian Capital Territory (Self Government Act) 1988, the Governor-General has the authority to disallow any act passed by the ACT government.

Australia's Attorney General &lt;a href="w%3APhillip%20Ruddock"&gt;Phillip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that the Governor-General had conveyed the ACT government's request and despite the ACT government expressing that it would make some amendments to its act, the Federal Executive Council decided that it was more appropriate to disallow the act altogether.

Mr Ruddock said he, the minister of territories, and the Governor-General attended the Executive Council meeting.

Mr Ruddock said that the ACT government is welcome to discuss any further amendments with the government in the future, but made it clear that he would not accept any legislation allowing the marriage of same-sex couples even when given a different name.

Senator Kerry Nettle of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; have prepared a disallowance motion they will present on June 14. If passed, their motion would disallow Ruddock's move to quash the ACT's civil union law. "The Attorney General Phillip Ruddock has today trampled on the rights of the ACT in order to deny rights to same sex couples, but still we don't have any logical explanation as to why," Senator Kerry said in a Green Party media release. "The Greens are appalled at the lengths the Howard government will go to in order to deny basic rights to fellow Australians on the basis of their sexuality."

The Attorney General attacked the Civil Unions Act, saying that it was "provocative" and was intended to make Civil Unions mirror marriage, an area where the federal government has legislative powers. Mr Ruddock said the government would defend any attempt by states or territories to "intrude" into areas under which the federal government has responsibility.

President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; has made a surprise visit to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; hoping to bolster some support. He also went to meet their new Prime Minister &lt;a href="Nouri%20al-Maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt; and talk about next steps in the war. Even al-Maliki didn't know that Bush was coming until five minutes before he arrived.

The trip comes as over 70,000 mostly Iraqi citizens prepare to deploy into Baghdad to try and bring security to the capital.

It was a very dramatic move by the president to travel to a violence crazed area in Baghdad less than a week after the death of al-Zarqawi. Bush met with al-Maliki in a very well forified green zone in a palace once used by Saddam Hussien.

Aside from al-Maliki and his cabinet, Bush was to see Jalal Talibani, Iraq's largely ceremonial president. Bush also was to meet with the speaker of the parliament, a few national political leaders and many U.S. troops.

The Left parties, joined by regional forces like Samajwadi Party and Telugu Desam Party, today staged street protests to demand the roll back of the fuel price hike as the Communists said the UPA Government could not take their support for granted. Barring states ruled by the Left and Uttar Pradesh, where the ruling Samajwadi Party's workers stopped many trains and blocked highways at several places, the protests had little impact. Strikes by truckers against the price hike that coincided with the protests, however, affected transport services in Orissa, Tripura and Madhya Pradesh.

In Delhi, CPI(M) leaders Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury and CPI's A B Bardhan courted arrest at the Parliament Street police station with a large number of Left activists. Leaders from the Samajwadi Party,Rashtriya Lok Dal and Janata Dal-Secular were also present. They said the protest was meant to mount pressure on the government to reverse its "anti-people" decision and the issue would be raised in the UPA-Left Coordination Committee meeting on Wednesday. 

In West Bengal, the ruling Left Front organised sit-ins before the offices of oil PSUs. Normal life in Kerala, another Left-ruled state, was paralysed by a dawn-to-dusk strike called by trade unions. Shops and business establishments remained closed while attendance in government offices was thin. Over 5,000 Left activists, including CPI Secretary D Raja, were taken into custody across Tamil Nadu when they tried to picket Central Government offices and roads.

Members of the All India Bank Employees Association have threatened to go on nation-wide strikes to express their unhappiness with the move to privatise banks, allowing foreign direct investment in the banking sector and outsourcing of services. The exact dates of the strike will be decided at the AIBEA national general council meeting to be held in Chennai on June 13 and 14. Speaking to press persons on Friday, C.H. Venkatachalam, secretary of the association, condemned the attempts to continuously `attack the financial and banking sector.' 

The AIBEA was against the government's intention to privatise public sector banks and the disinvestment of shares up to 49 per cent. In the past decade, a number of private sector banks had folded and hence, in the best interests of the investor, banks should continue to remain in the public sector, he said. Merging public sector banks into five or six big banks in order to enable them become global institutions dealing with international trade and business was a `retrograde' idea, he charged. The total assets of all the 27 public sector banks in the country (less than U.S. $300 billion) were well below the assets of any top global bank, he added.

Police dispersed a group of activists who had gathered at the Haft-e Tir square in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, reportedly using pepper spray and beating up some of the protestors. The group was staging a demonstration calling for equal treatment for women under the Iranian law and better protection of their rights. The Iranian Justice minister Jamal Karimirad later said that 70 people were detained in connection with the event, of whom 42 were women. 

He also said that the reports of police beating up the protestors were being reviewed. 
The activists were protesting against gender discrimination in Iranian law, which is partly based on the Islamic &lt;a href="w%3ASharia"&gt;Sharia&lt;/a&gt; law. Women have had the right to vote and be elected to the &lt;a href="w%3AMajlis%20of%20Iran"&gt;Majlis (parliament)&lt;/a&gt; since 1963, but under the prevailing laws, they are excluded from constitutional posts such as Judge and President and their testimony in court is only worth half of that of a man. Similarly, "Blood Money" or compensation paid to the family of a murdered woman is only half of that for a man. The protestors were calling for equal divorce and custody rights for women, reform of inheritance laws, as well as a ban on polygamy.

In the first half the result looked like it might go Togo's way; the team, on its debut appearance at the World Cup, had the better of a slow game and went into the break 0-1 up.

Passes were at walking speed in the Commerzbank Arena, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , as both sets of players seemed to struggle with the stifling heat. With the snow-roof closed for television conditions approached something like a sauna.

The goal for Otto Pfister's side was scored by Kader on 31 minutes. Between two defenders, Kader took a ball delivered from the right wing, which he deflected into the penalty area with his thigh. Kader ran on to the ball and fired low across the keeper; it went in off the right post.

Mohamed Kader arguably was Togo's outstanding player of the match and caused trouble for Korean Republic in the second half with his pacey runs. 

But a second half substitution and a sending off favoured the 2002 tournament's semi-finalists to stage a come back. 

The Korean Republic upped the speed of their short passing game and when midfielder Ji Sung Park, 30 yards from goal, turned and beat Jean-Paul Abalo a chance for the equaliser looked on.

The Togolese defender hacked down the surging winger Park, who plays his club football for Manchester United. He was given a second booking and sent off. Issued by Graham Poll, this was the second red card of the 2006 World Cup in Germany. 

The goal came direct from the freekick; on 54 minutes Chun Soo Lee used his right foot to send the ball with pace and bend beyond Kossi Agassa.

With the Korea Republic playing against 10 men the game opened up. But Togo, though it had just 36 per cent of ball possession in the game, was not a push over. The West African team mounted a number of dangerous counterattacks.

On 63 minutes the energetic Moustapha Salifou was in space on the edge of the area but could not keep his shot down.
Seven minutes later Dick Advocat's half time substitute, veteran Jung Hwan Ahn, added another Korean example to the textbook of how to shoot from long range. Wider to the right than Chun Soo Lee's the 30-year-old drove it over Agassa into the same right corner.

The Korea Republic came into the tournament on bad form, which included a 3-1 loss to Ghana. But to beat Togo Dick Advocat's side had to improve during the match, which might give them confidence against France and Switzerland, also in Group G.

The derby between neighbour nations was expected to be a close affair and as it turned out this was the case, as a good defensive team cancelled out the more talented attacking one.

An unusual statistic from the game is that Switzerland edged ball possession. French star players Zinedine Zidane, Patrick Viera and Thierry Henry looked slow and indecisive and failed to dictate the game.

In the first half the French had the better chances with Thierry Henry getting in good positions. But it was the Swiss who came closest to scoring after 25 minutes. 

From a set-play, Alexander Frei chipped the ball towards goal; the ball missed everyone and hit Fabian Barthez's left post. Liliam Thuram was first to the rebound.

Switzerland, while playing a strong defensive game, had more chances to get the ball into Barthez's net in the second half. Daniel Gygax's downward header from five yards brought a brilliant leg save from the French keeper.

For the French the second half continued as the first: Zidane was not as influential as the French might have wished, Viera was not aggressive and Henry did not show the creative flair he had done during the season for his club side, Arsenal.

An 84th minute substitute Vikash Dhorasoo, 10 yards out to the left of Pascal Zuberbuehler's goal, had the best French chance in the match but his shot skewed wide.
Philippe Senderos, the 21-year-old Swiss central defender, was arguably the best player on the pitch for Switzerland coach Koebi Kuhn. However; moments from the final whistle the Swiss might have had another hero. 

A free kick to the left of Barthez's penalty area was whipped across goal for Swiss runners. But Swiss's first man Alexander Frei in an attempt to score with his hand deflected the ball wide of them all. The score remained a draw.

Raymond Domenech's French team might be disappointed with the result but arguably it could have been worse.

Haughey&lt;/a&gt; passed away on at his home in Kinsealy, &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Dublin"&gt;County Dublin&lt;/a&gt;. He was 80 years old. 

Haughey was leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AFianna%20Fail"&gt;Fianna Fail&lt;/a&gt; parliamentary party and served three terms as the Taoiseach as well as holding ministerial posts. Widely credited with founding the &lt;a href="w%3ACeltic%20Tiger"&gt;Celtic Tiger&lt;/a&gt; economy, he was never far from controversy with the &lt;a href="w%3AArms%20Crisis"&gt;Arms Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and various planning and corruption scandals attributed to him. Tributes were paid to Mr. Haughey by Irish President &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20McAleese"&gt;Mary McAleese&lt;/a&gt;, by the current Taoiseach and Fianna Fail leader, &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AT%C3%A1naiste"&gt;Tánaiste&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Harney"&gt;Mary Harney&lt;/a&gt; and leaders of several Irish political parties, as well as a tribute from his great adversary of the 1980's, former &lt;a href="w%3AFine%20Gael"&gt;Fine Gael&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AGarret%20Fitzgerald"&gt;Garret Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;. 

Although no cause was given, Haughey was suffering from prostate cancer. A state funeral will be held on Friday, June 16.

Representative of &lt;a href="w%3ARhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20J.%20Kennedy"&gt;Patrick Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; has pleaded guilty to driving while under the influence of prescription drugs after he was involved in an early morning car accident in May close to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; capitol. According to police, Kennedy said he was "headed to the Capitol to make a vote."

"I am pleading guilty to driving under the influence," Kennedy said to Magistrate Judge Aida Melendez, who presided over the case in the District of Columbia Superior Court.

Kennedy had charges of failure to exhibit a driving permit and reckless driving against him dropped in exchange for pleading guilty. Kennedy was also ordered to pay a $250 donation to the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington and a $100 donation to the Victims of Crime fund. Judge Melendez also ordered Kennedy to serve a 10-day jail sentence, but said if he followed the terms of his plea, then he won't have to serve the time. Kennedy is also on a one-year probation and must seek drug treatment.

"I've always said that I wanted to take full responsibility for my actions. Today in court, I suffered the consequences of my actions," said Kennedy during a press conference just outside the courthouse. "I look forward today to moving on to the next chapter in my life," he added.

Kennedy admitted to taking a sleeping pill called Ambien and also Phenergan, an anti-nausea prescription medication the morning of the accident, but said that he was not drunk.

Croatia had sat back and made it difficult but Brazil seemed to be in no great hurry to impress and was satisfied with the margin of victory. 

One noticeable feature of the match, Brazilian forward Ronaldo appeared to display an exaggerated lack of interest in the game. Carlos Alberto Parreira substituted the Real Madrid striker after just over an hour.

"I don't know what happened to him," Robert Kovac, the Croatian centre-back said. "He didn't run ... It was very easy," he said. 

Second best to three Croatian defenders, with the experience of 181 caps between them, Ronaldo did not get a shot on goal until the second half. 

The 72,000 fans in the Olympia Stadium saw the best of Brazil in the first half with Kaka and Ronaldinho bright in midfield. Lacking muscle from Ronaldo, Brazil was confined to long range shooting. 

Roberto Carlos fired a shot from 40 yards, which was put over by Stipe Pletikosa; the Croatia keeper then, after 15 minutes of the match, tipped a Ronaldinho effort behind. Cafu also had a shot on target and another from Kaka went wide.

A successful long-range effort came from Kaka at 42 minutes. At the top of the semi circle he curled the ball with the inside of his left foot, the keeper's right hand not even close.

The World Cup champions of 2002 were tested in defence as the Croatians probed for an equaliser. But the team with red and white chequers did not use their 50 per cent of possession to create many clear openings, nor did they capitalise on Brazilian errors. 

On 59 minutes Brazil's defence had a lapse in concentration: a misplaced pass between the back three nearly allowed the quick Croatian substitute Ivica Olic a chance on goal. The advantage came to nothing as the defence recovered. 

The best Croatian chance fell to Niko Kranjcar, minutes from the end. When the cross came into the box the midfielder was unmarked - but his header went far over the bar.

The Croatian manager, Zlatko Kranjcar might consider a one-goal loss a good result against the reigning champions. Carlos Alberto Parreira might think by Brazil's high standards the game was a bad training session. 

But the result was a win and was Brazil's eighth successive World Cup win, a tournament record.

&lt;a href="w%3AKenneth%20Thomson"&gt;Kenneth Thomson&lt;/a&gt;, Canada's richest man and the 9th wealthiest person in the world according to &lt;a href="w%3AForbes"&gt;Forbes's&lt;/a&gt; 2005 ranking, died Monday morning at his office in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. The cause of death is reported to be a heart attack.

He was the former Thomson Corp. chairman and the company's controlling shareholder. He made most of his money by making his father's trans-Atlantic newspaper (&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Globe%20and%20Mail"&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt;) into one of the world's leading resources for electronic information and data.

Mr. Thomson is survived by his wife, Marilyn; three sons, David, who succeeded him as chairman of Thomson in 2002, Peter and Taylor; and a sister, Audrey Campbell. A memorial service will be held on a date that has yet to be announced.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt; has gone over its allocated funding for the past election, because of a communication mixup that resulted in the party booking $900,000 plus &lt;a href="w%3AGoods%20and%20Services%20Tax%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;Goods and Services Tax&lt;/a&gt; (GST) of advertising, rather than the $900,000 including GST they were allowed to spend. It should be noted that advertising is invariably quoted exclusive of GST in New Zealand, resulting in the mixup. Because of this the National Party tried to get a bill passed so they could get a one off exemption that would allow them to pay the money owed to &lt;a href="w%3ATVNZ"&gt;TVNZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATV3%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;TV3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Television%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASKY%20Network%20Television"&gt;Sky Television&lt;/a&gt; and radio stations. However three parties; &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20First"&gt;New Zealand First&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaori%20Party"&gt;Maori Party&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Aotearoa%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; blocked this from happening, by one vote, on June 13, 2006.

It is prohibited to go over the allocation of money by the Broadcasting Act.

Winston Peters, head of New Zealand First and Foreign Minister, says "National has already broken the law by using more election advertising than it was entitled to and should just pay up. The law should not be changed to accommodate National's dilemma."

Don Brash, head of the National Party, says that he finds the statements "quite unbelievable", as Mr Peters was essentially suggesting that a member of parliament deliberately break the law.

The National Party has two options, they could lose the amount owed from the next elections budget or break the law and pay.

&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Bakar%20Bashir"&gt;Abu Bakar Bashir&lt;/a&gt;, 68, the accused spiritual leader of &lt;a href="w%3AJemaah%20Islamiyah"&gt;Jemaah Islamiyah&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="w%3AMilitant%20Islam"&gt;militant islamic&lt;/a&gt; organisation with links to &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; has been released from an &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; prison after serving his 25 month sentence.

Bashir was convicted for conspiracy, in connection with the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Bali%20bombing"&gt;2002 Bali bombing&lt;/a&gt;. Bashir was accused of playing a pivotal role in planning the attack which killed 202 people, 88 of whom were from &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The Judges ruled that he was not involved in the attacks, but had approved of it. 

Bashir has denied having links to JI or any other militant organisation and has denied all charges against him. He has also condemned the Bali bombing as a "brutal act".

As Bashir was released from Cipinang prison in &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;, he was greeted by hundreds of supporters who yelled, "God is great". Bashir gave a brief address to his supporters, thanking Allah for his freedom, vowing to uphold "Islamic sharia (law)" and said Indonesia needed to the law and was shrouded "in darkness".

The Australian government has expressed its disappointment at the release of Mr Bashir. Speaking before the Australian House of Representatives, &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said "I want them (the Indonesian government) to understand from me, on behalf of the Government, how extremely disappointed, even distressed, millions of Australians will be at the release of Abu Bakar Bashir," he said.

"Many Australians will see that particular outcome, although a product of the Indonesian justice system, as an extremely disappointing result."

Australia's foreign minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; assured the families of those killed in the attacks that the government shares their pain. "We ... accept the decisions of the Indonesian courts, but we are deeply disappointed with that release today and we share the pain with those families that suffered so much as a result of the Bali bombing," Mr Downer said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has also expressed dismay at Bashir's release. Speaking in Jakarta, US embassy spokesman Max Kwak said, "we were deeply disappointed that a person convicted of a sinister conspiracy was given such a short prison sentence".

Muhammad Hikam, an Indonesian politician claimed Bashir would have got a longer term if Indonesia was given access to &lt;a href="w%3ARiduan_Isamuddin"&gt;Riduan Isamuddin Hambali&lt;/a&gt; by the United States who have him imprisoned. Hambali is believed to be mastermind of the Bali bombings and is alleged to have links to Bashir.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; treasurer, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Higgins"&gt;Higgins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;) told parliament on Tuesday that the greatest threat to Australia's economy would be for opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Brand"&gt;Brand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;) to gain office.

Mr Costello said that the Australian economy would suffer with Mr Beazley at the helm. "The greatest threat to the Australian economy domestically… would be the election of the Leader of the Opposition," said the treasurer.

"I can think of nothing that could be worse for the Australian economy than Kim Beazley being in a position of influence."

Mr Costello told the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; that despite unemployment dropping below five percent last week, Mr Beazley made no comment on the matter. Mr Costello referred to a statement made about the oppositon leader in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Australian"&gt;The Australian&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, which said "Beazley is the leaf blower of Australian politics—lots of noise but all that comes out is hot air."

The treasurer went on to say that Mr Beazley is "not an economic four-cylinder leaf blower,"

"He is a V8 turbocharged double-exhaust leaf blower. There is no end to the leaf blowing and the hot air that comes out as a consequence."

Mr Costello said Labor's proposed changes to the government's controversial industrial relations laws (known as &lt;a href="w%3AWorkchoices"&gt;Workchoices&lt;/a&gt;) would harm the economy. Costello defended his government's IR reforms saying that countries around the world were moving to make their labour markets more flexible.

The treasurer warned that Labor's proposed changes would return industrial relations in Australia to the 20th and 19th centuries.

On Tuesday, &lt;a href="w%3ANFL"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt; quarterback &lt;a href="w%3ABen%20Roethlisberger"&gt;Ben Roethlisberger&lt;/a&gt; was upgraded to fair condition at Pittsburgh's Mercy Hospital. The extent of his injuries is now known. Roethlisberger lost two teeth and chipped others, suffered a concussion, a broken upper and lower jaw, a broken nose, broken facial bone, a 9 inch laceration to the back of his head, and road rash injuries to his knees which thankfully do not extend to the joints. Police confirmed that Roethlisberger was riding without a helmet and additionally, did not have a Pennsylvania motorcycle license; he had a learner's permit, which expired March 29, 2006. Given this fact, Roethlisberger was in fact legally obligated to wear a helmet in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Steelers officials and Roethlisberger's agent, Leigh Steinberg, confirmed that Ben had received a letter last year from team representatives warning him that parts of his contract might be affected if he were to be injured while riding a motorcycle. The letter was apparently sent in order to both put the team on solid legal footing were a major accident to occur, and apprise Ben of the risks he is taking by riding a motorcycle.

Records kept by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation indicate that 180 helmet-wearing motorcyclists died in wrecks in 2004 and 2005 in Pennsylvania. In the same period, 157 helmet-free bikers died in wrecks.

<h3>Pennsylvania's Helmet Law (Effective Sept. 4, 2003)</h3>
Pennsylvania's 35-year-old law requiring helmets to be worn was amended in 2003 to make helmets optional under certain circumstances. According to the amended law, a motorcyclist will no longer be required to wear a helmet if the rider is:
<ul>
BULLET::::- A person 21 years of age or older who has been licensed to operate a motorcycle for not less than two full calendar years.
BULLET::::- A person 21 years of age or older who has completed a motorcycle rider safety course approved by the department or the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.
BULLET::::- A passenger 21 years of age or older if the motorcycle driver meets one of the qualifications for not wearing a helmet.

</ul>

Luis Aragones might like to play the yellow shirted Ukrainians again because after only one quarter of the match it looked effectively over as a contest. And a red card against the Ukraine team just after half-time helped the red shirts complete the rout with two more goals.
Spain, with only Carles Puyol in the starting line from a team that reached the 2002 World Cup quarter finals, had been unbeaten in 21 matches under Aragones. Spain's superb form showed in a great understanding between players with passes meeting runs all over the pitch.

After four minutes Ukraine's long free kick from the left touchline found Vladimir Yezerskiy, but he could not direct his header toward goal. Ukraine got flagged offside six times in the first period.

Then two goals came in a five minute spell for Spain. On 13 minutes Marcos Senna drove a shot from long range which was tipped over by Oleksandr Shovkovskyi. The result, a corner, was met by a stooping Xabi Alonso at the near post who deflected the ball into the net.

Four minutes later a free kick was awarded against Andriy Rusol 30 yards from goal. The tall, dark-haired Ukrainian number six stood in the wall and promptly received the shot from David Villa on the side of his head. Shovkovskyi, in mid-flight, could not adjust his position to stop the ball going in the net.

Two goals down Ukraine did not get another chance on goal until the second half when substitute Sergi Rebrov shot over on 72 minutes. Illustrating a one-sided game, Spain had 10 shots on target to Ukraine's two. 

David Villa, with Luis Garcia and Fernando Torres was one of Spain's three forwards. He got his second goal on 47 minutes when he fired low to Shovkovskyi's right from the penalty spot. 

Vladyslav Vashchuk was sent off for his foul on Torres; as the Athletico Madrid striker burst through the Ukrainian defence the referee judged Vaschuk had pulled on the Spainard's shorts. 

The first three goals were from still ball set-ups but the brilliance of the fourth showed the team work, movement and accurate passes that characterised the play of the Spainish.

Curly-haired Puyol charged from the half-way line and gave the ball off in field; he ran more and received the ball again near the penalty area; headed into the path of Torres, and the 22-year-old shot right footed past Shovkovskyi.

In the 77th minute 19-year-old Cesc Fabregas was given a substitute appearance in the game. The midfield player became Spain's youngest player to play at a World Cup.

Four goals down, Ukrainian coach Oleg Blokhin was shown on television smiling. He might reflect that Tunisia and Saudia Arabia, the two other teams in Group H, had not been highly touted as potential World Cup winners.

Russia has chosen the remote town of &lt;a href="w%3ASeverodvinsk"&gt;Severodvinsk&lt;/a&gt; along Russia's northern White Sea coastlines for the world's first floating nuclear power station.

The station will float on a river flowing through the town and into the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Sea"&gt;White Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The plant will look like a 10-storey building and weigh 21,000 tonnes. In five years it'll generate enough electricity for 200,000 people. The cost will be $336m&lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5080732.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Aviation%20Administration"&gt;FAA&lt;/a&gt; has issued a license for commercial spaceflight operations to the Oklahoma Space Industry Development Authority (OSIDA). The OSIDA will oversee the operations of "suborbital, reusable launch vehicles" out of the Clinton-Sherman Industrial Airpark &lt;a href="w%3Aspaceport"&gt;spaceport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABurns%20Flat%2C%20Oklahoma"&gt;Burns Flat, Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. Testing at the spacesport is expected to begin sometime next year.

Bill Khourie, director of OSIDA said, "This is a tremendous opportunity for Oklahoma. The benefits are just enormous as to what can branch out from this."

&lt;a href="w%3ARocketplane%20Kistler"&gt;Rocketplane Kistler&lt;/a&gt;, an Oklahoma-based company, has started production of spacecraft and is working on the final steps of its license applications. Rocketplan Kistler plans on a "fairly extensive flight test program" in 2007 and commercial flights by 2008.

A Texas-based company has also expressed interest in the &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma%20Spaceport"&gt;Oklahoma Spaceport&lt;/a&gt;.

Other United States spaceports include California Spaceport, Mojave Airport (California), Kodiak Launch Complex (Alaska), Spaceport Florida, and Virginia Spaceport. A spaceport is also planned in South New Mexico, the Southwest Regional Spaceport.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Heat"&gt;Miami Heat&lt;/a&gt; beat the &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Mavericks"&gt;Dallas Mavericks&lt;/a&gt; by a score of 98-96 in the third game of the &lt;a href="w%3ANBA%20Finals"&gt;NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt;. Dallas leads the series 2-1.

Miami led at half-time by nine points, but Dallas outscored them in the third quarter 34-16.

Dallas held a 89-76 led with 6:30 left in the fourth quarter. A late 17-5 run led by &lt;a href="w%3ADwyane%20Wade"&gt;Dwyane Wade&lt;/a&gt; put Miami back into the game. With 9.3 seconds left, Miami's &lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Payton"&gt;Gary Payton&lt;/a&gt; hit the game winning shot. &lt;a href="w%3ADirk%20Nowitzki"&gt;Dirk Nowitzki&lt;/a&gt; had a chance to tie the game for Dallas, but failed to hit his freethrow.

Miami head coach, &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Riley"&gt;Pat Riley&lt;/a&gt;, said "The basketball gods were good to us tonight, that's all you can say."

The next game will be June 15, 2006 in Miami. Dallas needs to win two more games and Miami needs to win three more games to become the 2006 NBA champions.

Saudi Arabia lost 8-0 to Germany in their first game in the World Cup of 2002 but looked more composed against Tunisia, Wednesday, when they overcame a goal deficit to lead before Roger Lemerre's North African team grabbed an injury time equaliser.

Two different styles were evident as Brazilian coach Marcos Paqueta set his Saudi Arabian side up playing a short passing game. Tunisia, nicknamed by fans the Carthage Eagles, were strong on set plays and used long balls to reach striker Zaid Jaizi.

Jaizi missed an opportunity with an early header from a corner but scored after 23 minutes when a set play from the right was not cleared. Jaizi was patient and waited for the ball to drop then kicked it on the volley in controlled sissor motion. 

In the first half Saudi Arabia did not test the Tunisian defence as they did in the second when they were able to score twice on the breakaway. Their best shot was on 37 minutes from a Nawaf Al Temyat free kick. Ali Boumnijel saved.

The goal came from the side in the all green strip in the 57th minute from a beautiful sweeping move down the Tunisian left flank. The ball, crossed low into the box, met Yasser Al-Kahtani who had rushed in at the near post. The striker's deft touch was soon followed by a net that billowed high behind Boumnijel.

Though they were vulnerable to high balls into the penalty area Saudi Arabia were disciplined in defense and did not get cautioned in the game. They conceded just six shots at goal of which only the two that were goals were on target; the Saudis themselves achieved double those statistics at the other end. 

The 84th minute goal that put Saudi Arabia in the lead was scored by Sami Al Jaber. Two minutes earlier he had joined the action as substitute for the younger Al-Kahtani. One of his first touches was to beat Boumnijel in a one-on-one.

The dramatic finish had four minutes of injury time. In the 92st minute the joint of crossbar and post stopped a deflected Saudi Arabian free kick making the score 2-1.

Then, in the 93rd minute, another long ball found its way to Tunisia's best player, Jaizi. In line with the goal Jaizi chipped to Radhi Jaïdi who leaped high and headed powerfully downwards. The ball went underneath Mabrouk Zair's grasp and the score was 2-2.

On &lt;a href="w%3AJune%2010"&gt;June 10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2006"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, the Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Puerto Rico, also known as the "Puerto Rico Conference " a conference of the UCC, voted by a 3-1 margin to withdraw its affiliation with the UCC as a body, over discomfort about the UCC’s stance on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.ucc.org/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Btask%3Dview%26amp%3Bid%3D581%26amp%3BItemid%3D54"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Formed in &lt;a href="w%3A1931"&gt;1931&lt;/a&gt;, this conference affiliated with the UCC following the denominations founding in 1957. 

This vote to disaffiliate means most of the 68 previously affiliated congregations will become independent, although denominational officials expressed hope that several might continue affiliation, through other conferences or special arrangements.

In a speech, John Thomas, President of the UCC, called the vote to disaffiliate 'deeply painful.'

There are 68 congregations and 6000 members of the Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Puerto Rico. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.globalministries.org/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26amp%3Btask%3Dview%26amp%3Bid%3D1127%26amp%3BItemid%3D1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h1>North Korea to test missile that could reach U.S. mainland</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=North%20Korea%20to%20test%20missile%20that%20could%20reach%20U.S.%20mainland&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n Foreign Minister &lt;a href="Ban%20Ki-moon"&gt;Ban Ki-moon&lt;/a&gt; says that &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; is prepared to test an &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AICBM"&gt;intercontinental ballistic missile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with an estimated range of 3,500 miles. 

The missile, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaepodong%202"&gt;Taepodong 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , could with such a range reach the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mainland. On Tuesday, Lee Tae-sik, South Korea's ambassador to the United States, confirmed the reports saying, "preparations did appear to be under way."

"If North Korea fires a missile now while the six-party talks remain off and questions are being raised in the international community about the effectiveness of the talks, there is a possibility it will have a seriously negative impact on the resolution of the North Korean nuclear problem," said Ki-moon.

Ki-moon also says that N. Korea should set aside its plans to launch the test missile and return to talks with South Korea, the United States, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , on its nuclear program.

However; Tae-sik states that "the signs that [N. Korea] is moving in that direction, yet we cannot rule out the possibility that at the last moment it will change its mind." He also said that the preparations could be "quite worrisome", but also said that the U.S. and other nations should not "make a conclusion" that N. Korea will test the missile.

♡❤CNN♡❤ quoted an anonymous U.S. intelligence official as saying, "[N. Korea] is doing everything you would expect if you are going to launch a missile. There is reason to think they are doing it for show."

According to Alexander Vershbow, the US ambassador to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeoul%2C%20South%20Korea"&gt;Seoul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the U.S. will respond to the test of the missile with "appropriate measures."

N. Korea last tested a short-range missile in 1998 which shot over Japan's mainland and landed into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . This will be N. Korea's first long-range test since the nation imposed a "moratorium" in 1999. According to Tae-sik, N. Korea may be abandoning the moratorium in a move to pressure the U.S. into making diplomatic concessions.

N. Korea is currently refusing to hold talks with the 5 nations because of financial sanctions placed on the nation.

Early indications are that between 5,000 and 6,000 litres of fuel leaked from a storage tank into a stream leading to Welcome Bay, which is near Wollaston Lake in the northeast part of the province.

The &lt;a href="w%3ARCMP"&gt;RCMP&lt;/a&gt; is still investigating cause of the spill. "We're trying to determine the circumstances around the leak, whether it was an intentional act or whether it was due to a problem with the tank," RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Brian Jones said.

Poland, who lost their first round match, had hoped for a draw. But a sending off, an incessant German offensive, a couple of strikes against the woodwork and then an injury time winner defeated them. The German fans then cheered the six points that put the team top of Group A. 

The Polish tackled furiously but in the 75th minute had the extra handicap of having &lt;a href="w%3ARadoslaw%20Sobolewski"&gt;Radoslaw Sobolewski&lt;/a&gt; sent off. He tugged &lt;a href="w%3AMiroslav%20Klose"&gt;Miroslav Klose&lt;/a&gt; from behind earning a second yellow card from the Spanish referee.

It took until two minutes into injury time for the German team to score the decider. This was not for lack of chances. In the first half Klose, &lt;a href="w%3ABastian%20Schweinsteiger"&gt;Bastian Schweinsteiger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALukas%20Podolski"&gt;Lukas Podolski&lt;/a&gt; had all failed to get shots on target. 

Klose might have had three goals in the second half; he missed a cross, had a shot saved and, in the 90th minute, hit the crossbar with a header. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ballack"&gt;Michael Ballack&lt;/a&gt; smacked the rebound onto the same piece of &lt;a href="w%3AArtur%20Boruc"&gt;Artur Boruc&lt;/a&gt;'s woodwork.

If playing 10-men helped &lt;a href="w%3A%20J%C3%BCrgen%20Klinsmann"&gt;Klinsmann&lt;/a&gt;'s team so did his substitutions. He removed the young Germans Poldolski and Schweinsteiger. They had appeared inhibited by the aggressive Polish defence. 

Of the three substitutions made, two would combine to score the winner: the experienced Neuville and young sprinter &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Odonkor"&gt;David Odonkor&lt;/a&gt;. On 92 minutes Ondonkor was sent down the right wing. He crossed and the ball was met on the bounce by Neuville in front of Artur Boruc.
&lt;a href="w%3APawel%20Janas"&gt;Pawel Janas&lt;/a&gt;'s side did not have many chances. On 27 minutes &lt;a href="w%3AIreneusz%20Jelen"&gt;Ireneusz Jelen&lt;/a&gt; had an opportunity to set up a goal but chose to shoot. In the second half his long range shot did not trouble &lt;a href="w%3AJens%20Lehmann"&gt;Jens Lehmann&lt;/a&gt;. Poland now need Costa Rica to take three points from Ecuador on June 15, to have any chance to progress in this competition. 

The German team were always dominant in and around the Polish penalty area. They had 58 per cent of ball possession, three times as many shots on goal and six more corner kicks as the Poland side. One reason why was left-back &lt;a href="w%3APhilipp%20Lahm"&gt;Philipp Lahm&lt;/a&gt;; this right-footed player was Fifa's man of the match.

His brilliant movement and passes created chances for the German strikers. Lahm got forward even more in the second half after Sobolewski's sending off; and when Odonkor was brought on to run down the other wing it seemed only a matter of time before one of the combination cracked the Polish defence.

<h1>Immigration Detainees on Hunger Strike in Oxford UK</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Immigration%20Detainees%20on%20Hunger%20Strike%20in%20Oxford%20UK&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

One hundred and twenty detainees at an &lt;a href="w%3Aimmigration"&gt;immigration&lt;/a&gt; removal centre in &lt;a href="w%3AOxford"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, UK, are on &lt;a href="w%3Ahunger%20strike"&gt;hunger strike&lt;/a&gt;. The protest started when some detainees refused breakfast on Wednesday 14th June 2006. A letter from the hunger strikers explaining why they are seeking to draw attention to their plight in this way has been reproduced in full below.

Those detained at the centre are mostly men who have sought &lt;a href="w%3Aasylum"&gt;asylum&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and whose asylum applications have been rejected. These people are then held without knowing how long they will be detained for - some end up being held for many years while awaiting deportation. 

The removal centre, known as &lt;a href="w%3ACampsfield"&gt;Campsfield&lt;/a&gt;, or Campsfield House is approximately 5 miles north of Oxford and has been in operation since 1993. It was managed on behalf of the UK Government by &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20Solutions%20Limited"&gt;Global Solutions Limited&lt;/a&gt;, until may 2006 when it was taken on by GEO UK, the centre has a capacity of 198. Only males are detained at Campsfield. 

According to the campaign group &lt;a href="http%3A//www.barbedwirebritain.org.uk/"&gt;Barbed Wire Britain&lt;/a&gt; Over 2,600 individuals, mostly asylum seekers, are detained indefinitely in the UK without trial and with no automatic right to &lt;a href="w%3Abail"&gt;bail&lt;/a&gt;. 

There have been reports in the UK press of the state taking people to detention centres without notice, in the early hours of the morning using excessively heavy handed tactics, taking children out of schools and separating families. 

Many UK people and politicians express their disgust at the way detainees are treated, yet it continues. Perhaps this action by the detainees themselves will further highlight their plight and result in more UK electors writing to their MPs and demanding improvements to the way in which rejected asylum seekers are treated. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We are detainees at Campsfield removal centre in Oxford. Most of us have been here for a long while now. There are people who have been detained for up to two years and down to three months. We are cramped in here like animals. We are treated like animals and moved around different detention centres like animals. The immigration service have taken husbands from their families and taken people who ran away from persecution in their various countries, and dumped everyone in here.

Once you are put in here the immigration service forget you. There are detainees who have applied to go back to their own countries that are still being held here for months without any news about their cases, just so that the private security companies get more money.

Detainees are asked to seek asylum and then refused. The immigration service also ask detainees to apply for bail. When you get a bail hearing date all of a sudden they serve you with removal papers that are not valid. There are many of these situations. In most cases the immigration service don't take you to your court hearings. And then they tell the judges you refused to turn up, just so the hearing goes ahead in your absence. Many detainees have been served with removal papers and travel documents but nothing happens on the removal day.

Campsfield has become a slave house. We detainees are treated like slaves, to do odd jobs for officers. Detainees are handcuffed to see doctors or dentists in hospitals or clinic appointments. We have some racist security officers who make racist comments to detainees and go out of their way to make you feel like committing suicide. Detainees have to be at the point of death before they get to see the doctors.

The food is not worth eating. Even dogs would refuse to eat what we eat. But we don't have a choice; every single day we eat the same food (the food we eat is rice, chicken, sandwiches, and left-over eggs)".

&lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; officials resumed testing soil, water, and runoff from 20 eastern Oklahoma poultry farms for Attorney General Drew Edmondson's lawsuit against 14 poultry companies in Arkansas. The lawsuit alleges their operations have polluted &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Tenkiller"&gt;Lake Tenkiller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois%20River"&gt;Illinois River&lt;/a&gt; watershed.

The original order authorized soil samplers to enter the property "one time". Edmondson then asked for a clarification for "one time". Federal Magistrate Sam Joyner said, in a supplemental order, "With regard to soil samples, Plaintiff (Oklahoma) is permitted to enter and leave the property, as necessary, beginning with the first date of entry and proceeding on subsequent contiguous days until the necessary soil samples are obtained."

Bev Saunders, spokesman for Poultry Partners, said farmer's resistance to testing was unlikely. Poultry Partners represents a group of about 400 farmers. She went on to say "We don't agree with this, but we do abide by the law."

Tobacco users are being invited by the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Francisco"&gt;University of California, San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;'s Habit Abatement Clinic to test NicVax, a new vaccine being developed by Nabi Biopharmaceuticals. Tobacco users may be test subjects under the condition that they are at least 18 years old and willing to commit to a one-year program of injections and follow-up visits. UCSF is one of nine testing centers.

When tobacco smoke is inhaled, the chemical nicotine enters the bloodstream. The blood affected by nicotine eventually enters the brain, triggering neuro-receptors to react and cause addiction. This vaccine would produce antibodies to identify the nicotine molecule and prevent it from reaching the brain. "With little or no nicotine reaching the brain, smoking is less rewarding. That gives the smoker a chance to change the behavioral and social factors that also influence smoking," said Victor Reus, MD, principal investigator for the study at UCSF.

The antibodies of the NicVax last up to 12 months within the human body. If a person tries to smoke months after beginning the vaccination, there would not be a typical soothing feeling.

&lt;a href="w%3AJJ%20Redick"&gt;J.J. Redick&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and charged with drunk driving early Tuesday in &lt;a href="w%3ADurham%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina"&gt;Durham County, North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and lost his driving privileges in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; for 30 days. Redick was released on a $1,000 bond shortly after being arrested.

According to the arresting officer Redick had "very glassy eyes, strong odor of alcohol coming from breath" and a &lt;a href="w%3Ablood-alcohol%20level"&gt;blood-alcohol level&lt;/a&gt; of 0.11. The legal limit in North Carolina is 0.08.

In a statement released by &lt;a href="w%3ADuke%20University"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;, Redick apologized saying, "I regret what happened last night, and want to apologize to my family and the Duke community for the incident."

Duke coach &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Krzyzewski"&gt;Mike Krzyzewski&lt;/a&gt; said, "J.J. knows he made a mistake and regrets it. He represented the very best in college athletics and exhibited outstanding character at Duke the last four years. He is and will continue to be a credit to the Duke basketball family. As his friend and his coach, he has my total support."

J.J. Redick is expected to be taken in the first round of the &lt;a href="w%3ANBA%20draft"&gt;NBA draft&lt;/a&gt; that takes place on June 28. How the incident hurts Redick in the draft is unclear.

The New Zealand government has announced that New Zealand is to get &lt;a href="w%3Afree-to-air"&gt;Free-to-air&lt;/a&gt; (FTA) digital television by the start of next year.

The broadcasters: &lt;a href="w%3ATVNZ"&gt;TVNZ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanwest%20MediaWorks%20NZ"&gt;CanWest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori%20Television"&gt;Māori Television&lt;/a&gt;, the TAB and &lt;a href="w%3ARadio%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Radio New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have forged an alliance called &lt;a href="w%3AFreeView"&gt;FreeView&lt;/a&gt; which has leased satellite space for the digital television. Digital television will mean viewers can receive a crisper picture, clearer radio signals, limited reception problems, and more channels.

FreeView will require television viewers to buy a set top box, similar to the &lt;a href="w%3ASKY%20Network%20Television"&gt;SKY Network Television&lt;/a&gt; decoder. Some viewers in some areas will need to buy a satellite dish as well. The approximated cost will be $200 or, with a dish, $400 (NZD). However, there is no subscription cost, unlike Sky Television.

Mr Cavanagh, Radio New Zealand chief executive, says "it will be a [sic] hard to claw back the gains made by Sky, which has dominated the digital space."

New Zealand is one of the last developed countries to make the switch to digital. &lt;a href="w%3AAnalog%20television"&gt;Analogue&lt;/a&gt; will be switched off between 2012 and 2016.

&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Bakar%20Bashir"&gt;Abu Bakar Bashir&lt;/a&gt;, the alleged spiritual leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AJemaah%20Islamiyah"&gt;Jemaah Islamiyah&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMilitant%20Islamic"&gt;militant islamic&lt;/a&gt; organisation gave an address on return to his school in &lt;a href="w%3ASurakarta"&gt;Surakarta&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Java"&gt;Central Java&lt;/a&gt; where he urged &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; to convert to &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;.

Speaking outside his school (considered by many to be a terrorism finishing school), before thousands of students and onlookers, Bashir said "If John Howard wants to be safe and avoid going to hell, I suggest he convert to Islam."

Mr Bashir also urged Mr Howard, the United States and other "infidels" not to fight the Muslim world. "Maybe with God's permission they can kill us, but they certainly can't beat Islam," said Mr Bashir.

The Islamic cleric denied having links to JI or any other terrorist organisation saying that Western media had been "twisting his beliefs". He dismissed claims by the US and Australia that he is the spiritual leader of JI.

Mr Bashir said that the Islamic militants involved in the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Bali%20Bombing"&gt;2002 Bali Bombing&lt;/a&gt; has taken the wrong path, but stopped short of condemning their actions. "Their wrong step was to use a bomb as a weapon in a safe area," he said. 

"Bombs are only to be used in conflict areas." 

"In safe areas just preach, and we don't need bombs like that."

Helen Coonan, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; communications minister announced on Wednesday that the &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government planned on introducing legislation into parliament restricting access to inappropriate or harmful material on so-called "emerging content services". The government considers &lt;a href="w%3A3G"&gt;3G&lt;/a&gt; mobile communications and subscription-based Internet portals to be emerging content services.

Senator Coonan said in a statement that the government was supportive of new technology, but felt that the technology requires safeguards to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content.

“The Government supports the development of innovative new communications services which provide access to the Internet, email, games, instant messaging, chat rooms, video clips and television programs,” she said.

“However, these new content services may also potentially carry offensive or harmful content and we need to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect children from exposure to content that might be harmful.”

Senator Coonan said the government intends to prohibit material rated &lt;a href="w%3AOffice_of_Film_and_Literature_Classification_%2528Australia%2529%23Ratings_that_only_apply_to_Films"&gt;X18+&lt;/a&gt; and restrict access to other services based upon the subscriber's age and content classification. Speaking of the proposed legislation, the minister said “It will extend the current safeguards that apply to content delivered over the Internet or television to be applied to content delivered over convergent devices,"

“This will include prohibition of content rated X18+ and above, requirements for consumer advice and age-restricting access to content suited only to adults.”

The announcement comes as the government released a report into the effectiveness of the current regulatory framework and how it applies to new delivery methods.

The report, received by the government in April, found that the differences between television, print, radio and Internet media would be blurred by devices such as 3G mobile phones and wireless Internet access. It suggested that the government regulate based on the amount of control service providers have over content instead of via the method used to access it.

It also found that much of the content available via emerging content services was based upon that of other mediums, where censorship already takes place.

The report did however express concern about mobile chat services, claiming they could be used by pedophiles to target children. The report found it would be more difficult for parents to supervise their children's mobile chat behaviour as they would have access to the service from anywhere. The report said this could be countered by the fact that mobile users are easier to identify than users on the Internet, making pedophiles less likely to use the service.

The report also suggested that Internet access via mobile telephones be limited to customers over the age of 18, unless minors have permission from their parent or guardian. Under current Australian law, a minor is unable to sign up for an account with an Internet service provider, but is able to access &lt;a href="w%3AWAP"&gt;WAP&lt;/a&gt; based Internet services without restriction.

A retired biologist from &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida%20State%20University"&gt;Florida State University&lt;/a&gt; has captured photos of a rodent in &lt;a href="w%3ALaos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt; which scientists thought was extinct for 11 million years. Science education professor emeritus, David Redfield and bird watcher, Uthai Treesucon, were able to catch the rodent, but only after failing to do so four times. They returned it to the wild after they took photos and a video of the rodent.

"We went to Laos specifically to find this animal. We were extremely fortunate in so many ways to be able to do this. We photographed it with stills and a movie camera. Then we took it back to its habitat and released it. It's easily one of the most gratifying experiences of my life, and I hope these pictures will help in some way to prevent the loss of this marvellous animal," said Redfield.

The rodent, whose scientific name is ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALaonastes%20aenigmamus"&gt;Laonastes aenigmamus&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, is called Laotian rock rat and known to local villagers as 'kha-nyou'. It belongs to the family &lt;a href="w%3ADiatomyidae"&gt;Diatomyidae&lt;/a&gt;. It was photographed in Laos near the village of Doy, in May 2006. The rodent resembles a tree shrew or a squirrel. It walks like a duck and has angled feet that allow it to climb trees. These are the first live photos of the rodent to be taken, but last year, researchers found bodies of the dead animal being sold at local meat markets. The rodent has since been named as a new species.

"These images are extremely important scientifically, showing as they do an animal (with) such markedly distinctive anatomical and functional attributes. This is a truly exciting discovery," said Mary Dawson , the curator at the &lt;a href="w%3ACarnegie%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History"&gt;Carnegie Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;, who confirmed the findings.

The rodent was able to be officially named after researchers compared bones from fossils of the rodent found in &lt;a href="w%3AAsia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, to bones of a recently found Laotian rock rat. Last summer, a fossil of the same rodent was found in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

"Dr Redfield's sighting of the living animal is the first to be recorded scientifically. These are the first photographic images of the recently discovered 'living fossil' Laonastes aenigmamus," said Dawson.

A memorial dedicated to Oklahomans killed in the &lt;a href="w%3Awar%20on%20terrorism"&gt;war on terrorism&lt;/a&gt; is planned for just north of the &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt; Capitol. The memorial would be built next to the proposed Veterans Affairs Department building on the side of Lincoln Boulevard between NW 30 and NE 32.

The plans would also have statues and memorials honoring veterans south of the capital moved to the Veterans Affairs building.

The Veterans Affairs building is part of a $196 million bond issue that will also pay for six other projects. If Oklahoma legislators could take up the measure as early as a special session this month and include it in the state's 2007 fiscal year. The measure is expected to be raised next year if the bond issue is not acted on this year.

War On Terror Memorial Design Committee will oversee the task of seeking designs for the memorial. Because no state money has been set aside for the memorial, the committee would also raise money for its construction. Similar memorials around the country range in price of $1 million to $2.2 million.

The win for the South American team meant both Ecuador and Germany, each with six points from two games, progressed from Group A into the knock-out phase of the Fifa World Cup in Germany.

It was a comfortable match for Ecuador's Columbian coach Luis Suarez. He managed to rest three key players - goal scorer Carlos Tenorio, provider Luis Valencia, and impressive centre-back Giovanny Espinoza, with substitutes before the game was out.

Ecuador played keep ball well and maintain a slow tempo while Alexandre Guimaraes's side did not look a team able to raise the pace of the game and sustain pressure on Christian Mora's goal.

The game-winner was scored after seven minutes of action. Valencia to the right of the penalty area whipped a ball across the goal. Tenorio, unmarked in front of Jose Porras, dipped his body and headed in.

Costa Rica and Ecuador both missed opportunities before half time: Douglas Sequeira was unmarked at the Ecuador far post but his header was mistimed and wide. 

Then Edison Mendez and Agustin Delgado nearly combined for a carbon-copy of the first goal; but the striker, who had ran in unmarked in front of Porras, did stab at the ball and skewed it wide.

After he had another shot saved Degaldo's third attempt found the net. He shot hard from an angle inside the penalty area and beat Porras on his near post. 

It was then Tenorio's substitute Kaviedes's turn to miss two then score one. A save from Porras, a header wide, and finally the striker connected for a beautiful far post volley, finishing off another Mendez cross. 

Costa Rica were unlucky when a clever first time chip from Alvaro Saborio beat Mora only to hit a post but they had not created the clear chances that Ecuador had at the other end. 

The long shots from Carlos Hernandez and Mauricio Solis's tricky run were acts of individual play. No match for a solid-looking team who got its second consecutive World Cup shut out and will play Germany for the honour of Group A winner, on June 20.

&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity"&gt;University&lt;/a&gt; students continue their opposition to a new law, proposed by the &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; government, through organizing new rallies in &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt; as well as through the persistent occupancy of many departments in the two biggest Universities of Greece, the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Athens"&gt;University of Athens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AAristotle%20University%20of%20Thessaloniki"&gt;Aristotle University of Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;.

Students are opposing the law&amp;mdash;proposed by the Minister of Education Marietta Yannakou&amp;mdash;which has to do with the foundation of private universities in Greece as well as other aspects of the academic organization. 

The strike of the students has been backed by the Greek General Confederation of Labour (GSEE), the &lt;a href="w%3ASynaspismos"&gt;Synaspismos&lt;/a&gt; and KKE-Communist parties, as well as by various Professors who oppose the specific governmental law. Today, students organize demonstrations in the two biggest cities of Greece. More specifically, students and University professors have gathered at Propylea in central Athens and march towards the Ministry of Education while in Thessalonika the demonstration has been focused outside the Ministry of &lt;a href="w%3AMacedonia"&gt;Macedonia&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AThrace"&gt;Thrace&lt;/a&gt;.

During the previous week and more specifically during the demonstrations of last Thursday, the rallies had resulted to fights between anarchists and police in the centre of Athens; for that the Minister of Public Order had been accused for the violence that police forces exercised. However Greek police officials answered that anarchists who took part in the rallies caused heavy damages and provoked the police forces. Yesterday, a specific statement by Thanos Veremis, professor and Ministry of Education official, in which he characterized the protesters as roughs and eternal students(sic), caused much of irritation and agitation within the university students' movement.

Four major cell phone makers, &lt;a href="w%3AMotorola"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANEC"&gt;NEC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APanasonic"&gt;Panasonic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ASamsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, and two wireless providers, &lt;a href="w%3ANTT%20DoCoMo"&gt;NTT DoCoMo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt;, have announced they will work together to provide a &lt;a href="w%3ALinux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;-based platform for cell phones. This move could threaten the dominance &lt;a href="w%3ASymbian"&gt;Symbian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; in the operating systems market for cell phones.

Peter Gorham, an independent market analyst, said "Linux is also rock solid, unlike some of the existing operating systems. It would mean no more taking your batteries out of your phone to get it to reboot. And this would make things a lot easier for application developers."

On the lack of U.S. provider's support in this alliance, Gorham said "I am surprised that there aren’t any American carriers involved in this alliance, but they are probably skeptical about the longevity of these kinds of alliances. But Motorola and Samsung have a vested interest in the success of this thing, in part because they have a large customer, Vodafone, involved."

This alliance is not the first effort to standardize on Linux for cell phones. Several groups are currently working on this, including Linux Phone Standard Forum, Open Source Development Lab, and Electronics Linux Forum.

According to Christy Wyatt, vice president of market development at Motorola, said this effort differs from other efforts because it will establish a common platform for all participating manufacturers.

Linux is already being utilized on some mobile devices. Motorola has already shipped five million of these including the Ming model for China and Rokr E2 music phone in Asia. The Rokr E2 will be available in Europe soon.

The documents reveal that al-Zarqawi was planning to destroy the relationship between the &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a%20Islam"&gt;Shi'ite&lt;/a&gt; Iraqis and the United States. The document also said the U.S. military was hurting the insurgency by seizure of weapons, disrupting their financial outlets, massive arrests, and training Iraqi security forces.

The translated document said, "Generally speaking and despite the gloomy present situation, we find that the best solution in order to get out of this crisis is to involve the U.S. forces in waging a war against another country or any hostile groups."

Mowaffaq al-Rubaie said, "These documents have given us the edge over al-Qaeda and (they) also gave us the whereabouts of their network, of their leaders, of their weapons and the way they lead the organization and the whereabouts of their meetings."

England's win meant they were guaranteed a place in the knock-out round of the Fifa World Cup in Germany this year as they had taken six points from two games in Group B.

It was when Wayne Rooney and Aaron Lennon made an entrance as substitutes in the 58th minute that England kicked into gear. Lennon came on in place of England's fourth defender as Sven-Göran Eriksson told his men to go for the Socca Warrior's jugular.

Until that moment Trinidad and Tobago though not sealed-tight against England's attacks were more able to counter-attack due to the English side's slow play and lack of movement. 

The Caribbean side had looked especially strong on set plays and long balls floated towards England's goal.

England's goalkeeper Paul Robinson perhaps best showed his side's nerves: he missed three crosses. On two of these occasions Leo Beenhakker's side were inches from taking the lead. In the most dramatic of them, John Terry had to volley a ball off the goalline to stop England going into half-time a goal down to a Stern John header.

The Caribbean threat lessened with the substitutions as constant pressure meant Trinidad and Tobago attacker Cornel Glen when he did break was often unassisted. While England's threat increased with Rooney in the centre, and with Lennon and later substitute Stuart Downing who both tested the Socca Warriors from wide positions.

With 62 per cent of ball possession the story of England's game was simply the missed opportunities. Trinidad and Tobago was massively overpowered 23 shots to seven.

On 43 minutes Peter Crouch had the sort of miss that was so spectacular it may make highlight reels. Unmarked in the centre of the goal it might have been easier to get the ball on target than to skew the volley so far wide.

He was not the only culprit. Michael Owen, before he was substituted with Rooney, had missed two in more ordinary ways. 

Lampard had peppered Shaka Hislop's goal with shots all game. Three on 74, 77, and 78 minutes - but none troubled the West Ham keeper. The Fifa man of the match in the first England game may not want to remember this one. 

On the 83 minute mark England captain David Beckham crossed to the 6' 7" Crouch at the far post. This time he rose confidently above Brent Sancho and powered a header into the top left corner. Trinidad and Tobago were finally solved.

For a side that had all game struggled to find the killer instinct Steven Gerrard's late goal was well received. On the edge of the penalty area he cut left and fired left-footed into the top left corner. The win now looked comfortable.

After 6 months of development, the &lt;a href="w%3AInkscape"&gt;Inkscape&lt;/a&gt; project released today a new version of their &lt;a href="w%3ASVG"&gt;SVG&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3AGPL"&gt;GPLed&lt;/a&gt; vector drawing program. It features improved performance and many new features, such as a Layers dialog, better PDF export, configurable keyboard shortcuts and support for clipping and masking. Inkscape runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. 

Inkscape started in 2003 as a fork of the vector drawing editor &lt;a href="w%3ASodipodi"&gt;Sodipodi&lt;/a&gt;. Inkscape does not yet have as many features as the best commercial vector editors, but it is currently suitable for a wide range of applications. Inkscape's implementation of SVG and CSS standards is incomplete; most notably, it has not yet fully implemented SVG filter effects, animation, and SVG fonts. Inkscape is currently under active development, which is indicated by the version number below one; new features were being added regularly.

A tram derailed on Thursday in the middle of the afternoon on the Boulevard Georges Favon, near Route du Stand, Geneva, causing major traffic jams. By chance, this spectacular incident caused three light casualties. Sometime after 15.42, amazed eyewitnesses saw the tram travel 30 metres across the road, then up the sidewalk. It came, at the closest, to around 30 cm from a shop window. The three casualties are suffering from whiplash injuries to the neck and back according to Raymond Wicky, head of the Service d'incendie et de secours (SIS; Fire and Help services). On the other hand, the driver was affected psychologically by the incident, as were several shop owners.

Psychological assistance has been offered to them. Nine fire engines, two ambulances, and a dozen policemen and cars quickly arrived at the scene. A large security perimeter was placed around the immobilised tram whose length covered half of the road. 

Around a dozen onlookers assisted with the efforts made to move the tram from the road back onto its tracks. A truck then towed it back to its depot, where police and the Swiss Federal department of Transport are to examine the vehicle.

Only a few elements that caused the derailment are known: the tram was on a line different to its normal route. Police will investigate whether the tram was travelling too fast, or if it was a faulty switch at the junction, which would have connected the tram to Rue du Stand, and then return it to normal route. Another element is that drivers have the possibility to change the switches in front of them. The inquiry will determine if the driver, wanting to turn here, chose to merge into his normal route and possibly, this caused the incident.

&lt;a href="Bill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; will step down from his daily roles at &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; by July 2008. Gates, who founded the company, has been running it for three decades now. Gates plans to spend more time working on health and education at the &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20%26amp%3B%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation"&gt;Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.

Taking place immediately, &lt;a href="w%3ARay%20Ozzie"&gt;Ray Ozzie&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Technical Officer, will assume the title of chief software architect. Also happening immediately, &lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Mundie"&gt;Craig Mundie&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Technical Officer, will become chief research and strategy officer.

Gates said "Our business and technical leadership has never been stronger, and Microsoft is well-positioned for success in the years ahead. I feel very fortunate to have such great technical leaders like Ray and Craig at the company. I remain fully committed and full time at Microsoft
through June 2008 and will be working side by side with Ray and Craig to ensure that a smooth transition occurs."

Gates, who will remain chairman of the corporation, also said he believes "the road ahead for Microsoft is as bright as ever."

The result meant Sweden needed at least a draw in their next match with England to get into the knock-out phase ahead of Trinidad and Tobago.

The match was played at a fast pace as both teams wanted a win from the game. What it lacked in flair it made up for in enthralling passion. There were eight yellow cards in this cut and thrust encounter which Sweden edged on the shot counter 17:16. 

In the end what decided the match was Sweden's speed and ability to get behind Paraguay's defence and shoot from inside the penalty area. Rarely did Paraguay do this. Sweden's captain and centre-back Olof Mellberg had a strong game and may be the reason Andreas Isaksson had only three saves.

Lars Lagerback's half-time decision to take off Zlatan Ibrahimovic for Marcus Allback also seemed to tilt the outcome of the game in Sweden's favour. The striker combined well with Freddie Ljungberg. 

Allback frequently got in good attacking positions and stretched Paraguay's defence to breaking point. But for 43 minutes, after successive near misses it seemed like Paraguay would just contain the Sweden strikers. 

On 59 minutes Allback ran clear of the Paraguay defence to receive a bouncing ball; he lobbed Aldo Bobadilla and ran around him for the tap in. Unfortunately for Sweden the thing that hit the net was Paraguay's Denis Caniza; who had run at full speed to clear the ball just before Allback got there. 

Allback then had another chance, set up by Larson on the six-yard box. As he swiveled, with the defender behind him, the goal keeper guessed where he was going to shoot. 

The pace of the game did not relent and the creative movement of the Swedish attacks began to leave Anibal Ruiz's Paraguayans behind. Freddie Ljungberg found more space down the left and was also able to roam across to the right.

When a long ball reached Allback to the left of goal the striker headed across goal. Ljungberg ran in from the right and headed it back across the goalkeeper; one bounce and in. 

Bobadilla made 9 saves in the match but this one was a finger tip too far. Sweden after a disappointing scoreless match against Trinidad and Tobago hung on to their World Cup hopes and look set to qualify from the group together with England.

Americans United for Separation of Church and State (AU) is investigating a deal between the Governor of Connecticut, the United Church of Christ (UCC) and the Hartford Civic Center to keep the UCC's biennial convention in Connecticut&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ucctruths.com/default.htm%23AU"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The timing of the investigation coincides with another AU investigation of the National Baptist Congress of Christian Education (NBCCE) convention being in held in Maryland this month.

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; deputy leader, Senator &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Bartlett"&gt;Andrew Bartlett&lt;/a&gt; moved in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; a bill to amend the Marriage Act to provide for &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriages"&gt;same-sex marriages&lt;/a&gt;. 

Senator Bartlett's &lt;a href="w%3Asecond%20reading"&gt;second reading&lt;/a&gt; speech which was incorporated into the &lt;a href="w%3AHansard"&gt;Hansard&lt;/a&gt; described that the bill "reverses the &lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage%20in%20Australia"&gt;Marriage Amendment Act 2004&lt;/a&gt;...which...changed the definition to that of a union between one man and one woman only", and refuted arguments against same-sex marriage proposed by some conservative Government senators. Bartlett continued to say that "We do not want to send the message that discrimination is acceptable in Australia" to our children, or to other nations."

The federal Government is opposed to civil unions. In an interview on June 8, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; said, "I don’t see it in any way as discriminating against homosexuals, it’s not, it’s designed to preserve the special status of marriage in our community and that’s what it’s all about."

Debate on the bill will occur at a later date. A bill proposed later in the sitting day by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; to stop the Governor-General disallowing ACT state law establishing civil unions failed, by a majority of two votes.

A sexual attack on a woman in her &lt;a href="w%3APukekohe"&gt;Pukekohe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Auckland"&gt;South Auckland&lt;/a&gt; home was, police say, premeditated.

A man, who had been drinking, told the victim that he needed to use her phone, she handed him a portable phone through a small opening in the door and then closed the door. The man pretended to use the phone and then when she opened the door again to regain her phone the man barged his way in, at about 9:00 p.m., Tuesday, June 13 &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20New%20Zealand"&gt;NZST&lt;/a&gt;.

It was a five-hour attack and she only managed to escape when, the next day, she was driven to an &lt;a href="w%3AAutomated%20teller%20machine"&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt; to withdraw money where she fumbled with her bank cards and while the attacker was distracted she ran to a service station.

The victim told police that she believed that the man had been stalking her for about a week. Criminal profilers are worried that he may strike again.

Detective Senior Sergeant Grimstone says "the terror in the woman's eyes is clearly visible as she asks for help at a service station."

The attacker could be wearing blue jeans and a black jacket that was taken from the victim's house. The attacker is described as an unshaven &lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori"&gt;Māori&lt;/a&gt; male in his late 30s or 40s.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%20proclaims%20Northwestern%20Hawaiian%20Islands%20a%20National%20Monument&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; yesterday signed an executive order declaring the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorthwestern%20Hawaiian%20Islands"&gt;Northwestern Hawaiian Islands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20National%20Monument"&gt;U.S. National Monument&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , creating the largest protected marine area in the world and the largest single conservation area in the history of the United States.

In a signing ceremony attended by Hawaii officials, including Hawaii Governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALinda%20Lingle"&gt;Linda Lingle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Bush pledged, "This region holds the largest and healthiest untouched coral reef system in the United States. And we're going to preserve it."

Bush reportedly moved quickly to protect the archipelago after a screening of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJean-Michel%20Cousteau"&gt;Jean-Michel Cousteau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's documentary ♡❤Voyage to Kure♡❤ in April. He invoked powers under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which gives the President the power to restrict the use of public land by executive order. The area was under consideration as a National Marine Sanctuary, but Bush's invocation of the Antiquities Act bypasses the yearlong consultation that would be necessary.
As a National Monument, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands would be subject to one of the highest levels of protection in the U.S. All fishing will be phased out over five years, and visitors will require permits for snorkeling and diving. Lingle had enacted similar protections as Hawaii governor, but the protections were limited to a three-mile radius from shore.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would manage the monument along with its 13 national marine sanctuaries.

Advocates for the fishing industry have raised concerns about the feasibility of further protections, asserting that a small fishery operation in the area would cause little environmental impact. Kitty Simonds of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council said, "The President can do whatever he wants to do, but we're disappointed that we can't continue on a small, healthy bottomfish fishery."

Environmental groups generally lauded Bush's move.

"When you add it all up, it's a world-class ecological jewel. From both a national and global perspective, this really is a landmark conservation event," said Joshua Reichert, head of the environment program for the private Pew Charitable Trusts.

The preserve, covering all the islands northwest of Niihau, covers 140,000 square miles (360,000 km²), covering 10 islands and atolls, and stretches for about 1,400 miles (2,200 km).

<h1>Four incidents occur at Australian reactor in a week</h1>

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n federal opposition has attacked the &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government following four incidents in a week at the &lt;a href="w%3AHIFAR"&gt;HIFAR&lt;/a&gt; nuclear research reactor in &lt;a href="w%3ALucas%20Heights%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Lucas Heights&lt;/a&gt;, South of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. The incidents come just a week after the Australian government announced an inquiry into the feasibility of nuclear power.

The first incident occurred on June 8, when a carbon canister containing radioactive material exploded, blowing out seals in a cell at the Lucas Heights site. The accident is believed to be an explosion in a carbon canister containing radioactive material, which blew the seals out on Hot Cell No 2 in Building 54 releasing small amounts of &lt;a href="w%3AXenon"&gt;xenon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKrypton"&gt;krypton&lt;/a&gt; into the atmosphere.

Jenny Macklin (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Jagajaga"&gt;Jagajaga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor&lt;/a&gt;), shadow science minister and deputy leader of the opposition accused science minister Julie Bishop (&lt;a href="w%3ACurtin"&gt;Curtin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;) of misleading the parliament. Ms Bishop told parliament on Wednesday that "there was no measurable contamination found outside the immediate area where the incident occurred,"

Ms Bishop denied there being any radiation threat to the community. "According to ANSTO, there was absolutely no radiation threat to the health of the workers of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Nuclear%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Organisation"&gt;ANSTO&lt;/a&gt; or the community."

Jenny Macklin said in a statement on Wednesday that details of the incident were being hidden. "The local community deserves to be told what actually happened at the Lucas Heights reactor last Thursday, and why the release of radioactive gases into the atmosphere was not made public," said Ms Macklin.

Following Ms Macklin's statement ANSTO said it was "surprised and disappointed" at Ms Macklin's comments. ANSTO refuted that it failed to adequately notify the community saying that they released a media statement the day after the incident. ANSTO said that radiation released during the incident was "so low as not to be directly measurable". ANSTO said that it could however calculate the amount of radioactive material released and it was a "very small fraction of the radiation dose received by everyone each year from naturally occurring
sources of radiation".

ANSTO assured the public that the releases could not be detected off-site.

Following a statement by the science minister on Thursday that she was unaware of any incidents at ANSTO in the 12 months prior to the latest incidents, the opposition again questioned Ms Bishop's competence. Ms Macklin asked how the minister could not be informed about compliance reports issued by Australia's nuclear regulator ARPANSA that state there were 12 incidents at Lucas Heights in 2005.

Following Ms Macklin's removal from the house, &lt;a href="Anthony%20Albanese"&gt;Anthony Albanese&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Grayndler"&gt;Grayndler&lt;/a&gt;, Labor), shadow environment minister questioned Ms Bishop about incidents at ANSTO on Wednesday. According to ANSTO, a worker received a low dose of radiation from &lt;a href="w%3AIodine%20123"&gt;Iodine-123&lt;/a&gt; while packaging radiopharmaceuticals. ANSTO claims that the technician received a dose around four per cent of the annual limit for radiation workers and much less than a thyroid cancer patient would receive during a nuclear medicine scan.

In a statement, Ms Macklin later accused the science minister of being ill-informed of the incident at Lucas Heights, saying it was concerning the government had an "incompetent" science minister at a time when they were "pushing the benefits of nuclear power".

Responding to the opposition's questions during question time in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;, the science minister accused the opposition of engaging in a scare campaign to close down a facility that provides "a medical service for cancer suffers across Australia.

ANSTO has said that the radiation dose received by the technician was so low he did not require medical attention once he had undergone several tests.

ANSTO admitted another two incidents occurred at its Lucas Heights facility on Thursday. The first occurred when a worker who was cleaning a production area burst a package of radioactive material. The second occurred when a worker packing a radiopharmaceutical dropped a small vial. ANSTO said that the amount of radiation received by both workers was extremely low.

ANSTO said that while it is uncommon for two incidents to occur on a single day, it was not uncommon for minor incidents to occur once a month.

&lt;a href="w%3ADwayne%20Wade"&gt;Dwayne Wade&lt;/a&gt; had 36 points to lead the &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Heat"&gt;Miami Heat&lt;/a&gt; to a 98-74 victory Thursday night over the &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Mavericks"&gt;Dallas Mavericks&lt;/a&gt;. Miami's win over Dallas evens the &lt;a href="w%3ANBA%20Finals"&gt;NBA Finals&lt;/a&gt; series to 2-2.

Wade hit 13 of his 23 shots. Miami's &lt;a href="w%3AShaquille%20O%27Neal"&gt;Shaquille O'Neal&lt;/a&gt; added 17 points and 13 rebounds.

Dallas scored only seven points in the fourth quarter for a record-low in any quarter in the NBA Finals history.

Miami coach &lt;a href="w%3APat%20Riley"&gt;Pat Riley&lt;/a&gt; said "It was our best game, there's no doubt, of this series. Our defense was very active tonight. We did not want to give them free throws and did not want to give them layups and jumpers."

The fifth game of the series will be played in Miami this Sunday, June 18. The sixth and, if necessary, the seventh games will be played in Dallas.

On one side of this one-way game there was an embarrassment of Argentine talent; on the other there was the humiliation of Ilija Petkovic's side being out-played for 90 minutes by a team at the top of their form.

With the roof over the Veltins Arena it was dark enough in the stadium for camera flashes to light up in the crowd. On the pitch the Argentine players provided the flashes of brilliance.

An early goal after six minutes was the first of six goals that were the product of almost flawless team play and individual execution. Argentina swept down the left, Maxi Rodriguez ran at speed into a pass and toe-poked first time beyond Dragoslav Jevric.

The next one was the climax of a 24 pass move. Esteban Cambiasso tapped the ball forward to Hernan Crespo just inside the penalty area; a back heal and Cambiasso ran on and smacked it past Jevric.

On 35 minutes the Argentina fans in the crowd seemed to know which way the game was going. The chant "Ole" was heard as the Argentines continued to pass amongst themselves with great ease.

Totally dominant, the blue and white stripes had over 60 per cent ball possession come half-time. Roberto Abbondanzieri in the Argentina goal was for the most part the spectator number 52'001.

It could have been four nil at the break but on 36 minutes Crespo's effort was judged to have come from an offside position. Crespo got booked because he did not stop when the referee blew his whistle. The television replay showed the linesman was mistaken.

The third goal came on 41 minutes. Jevric could only palm a Javier Saviola shot to Maxi Rodriguez at the far post who stuck away his second off the post.

Savo Milosevic won his hundredth cap for Serbia and Montenegro, a statistic that included games with the Yugoslavia football team. He forced a corner with a hard long range shot and failed to reach a header after Danijel Ljuboja had briefly stretched Argentina on the right.
On 64 minutes Mateja Kezman appeared to make a frustrated two-footed lunge which caught Javier Mascherano. The referee reached for the red card and made a hard position harder for the unfortunate Serbia and Montenegro team.

Then it was the Lionel Messi show. The Argentines were comfortable but had not scored in the second half until the 19-year-old Barcelona striker came on after 74 minutes. Soon there were three more goals to the total.

Messi set up Crespo for a tap in; he burst into the penalty area and a delivered a superb low pass across the goal that beat both the keeper and defenders.

Another young Argentine Carlos Tevez got past two half-hearted challenges from the Serbia and Montenegro defence and put the fifth around Jevric. 

The goal many Argentines in the crowd had waited for came two minutes from time. Messi, recently back from injury, was fed on another burst into the penalty area. He beat Jevric at his near post.

This year Montenegro made their split from Serbia official in the political arena. In the Veltins Arena, Friday, the performance of the two national sides combined might be grounds for the coming football divorce.

The mathematics of the Group C table mean Jose Pekerman's Argentina are not yet through to the knock-out stage of the Fifa World Cup. They would go through if the Netherlands did not lose to Ivory Coast, who played Friday.

Former American Idol winner Ruben Studdard has won a lawsuit and $2 million against his ex-manager Ronald W. Edwards and Edwards' promotions company, Sez Inc. The lawsuit was for misappropriating the singer's money and credit cards. The suit claimed Edwards misused more than $246,000 of the singer's money. According to the judge's ruling, Edwards stole money from Studdard's checking and other bank accounts, improperly used his credit cards and even used Studdard's money to repay a $10,000 bank loan. 

Jefferson County Circuit Judge Scott Vowell awarded Studdard $500,000 for actual losses and another $1.5 million in punitive damages. Vowell dismissed Edwards' promotions company from the suit because it was bankrupt and had no money or assets. Edwards filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 17, 2005. Studdard has sold 2.2 million records, but because of the damage done to his credit by Edwards, it is now even hard for Ruben to buy a home, said Vowell.

In a nonbinding resolution, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;U.S. House&lt;/a&gt; voted 256-153 that an "arbitrary date for withdrawal or redeployment" of U.S. troops is not in the nation's best interest. The resolution also declared the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;Iraq War&lt;/a&gt; as part the global war on terrorism. 24 representatives did not vote on the resolution.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Boehner"&gt;John Boehner&lt;/a&gt;, Republican House Majority Leader, said, "Retreat is not an option in Iraq. Achieving victory is our only option, for the American people and our kids."

&lt;a href="w%3ANancy%20Pelosi"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, Democrat House Minority Leader, disagreed saying, "Stay the course? I don't think so Mr President. It's time to face the facts. The war in Iraq has been a mistake, I say, a grotesque mistake."

Despite Pelosi's opposition to the resolution, 42 Democrats voted in favour of the resolution.

Yesterday the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Senate"&gt;U.S. Senate&lt;/a&gt; rejected a proposal to withdraw combat troops by the end of 2006.

<h1>Timorese rebels begin disarming</h1>

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timorese&lt;/a&gt; rebels begun disarming Friday, when the rebel leader, Lt. Cmdr. &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAlfredo%20Reinado"&gt;Alfredo Reinado&lt;/a&gt;, and his men handed over ammunition and more than a dozen weapons to Australian peacekeepers. The disarming started after a official request of President &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AXanana%20Gusm%C3%A3o"&gt;Xanana Gusmão&lt;/a&gt; this week.

The disarming process requested this week by East Timor's President, Xanana Gusmão, started today in Maubisse, as Alfredo Reinado, the leader of the military rebels, handed over his &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AM-16"&gt;M-16 rifle&lt;/a&gt;, with telescopic sight, to an Australian soldier. Followed by him, his men saluted him and handed over their weapons. As Reinado checked that they were unloaded and turned them in to an Australian soldier, that noted down the weapon type and serial number.

In this ceremony at a ninteenth century Portuguese village, where Reinado's rebel group camped after fleeing the Timorese capital, Dili in April, Reinado and his men gave up 12 automatic rifles and four pistols. These were then stored at a container guarded by Australian soldiers.

After delivering the weapons Lt. Cmdr. Alfredo Reinado guaranteed in a press conference that he will continue to fulfill the orders of Xanana Gusmão.

Regarding the polemic question about the continuation of the Timorese first Prime Minister, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMari%20Alkatiri"&gt;Mari Alkatiri&lt;/a&gt;, in power, the Commander clarified that he is a "military and a Lieutenant Commander on the hierarchy of the Armed Forces" and that he is only "fulfilling orders".

The disarming process of the rebels' weapons will be also followed in Gleno, where the remaining rebel troops lead by the Lt. Cmdr. Marcos Tilman and Alves Tara are camped.

The start of the process had been announced this Thursday by Marcos Tilman and confirmed by Army Brig. Michael Slater, commander of the Australian-led forces. The announce was made 24 hours after President Xanana Gusmão have proclaimed, in message to the Parliament, that the hour for the second phase of the international military forces in the country had arrived. The international military forces, as the second phase starts, will leave Dili into the interior of the country, leaving the Timorese capital in control of the international police forces.

According to Army Brig. Michael Slater, that was speaking to the press in Dili to announce formally the beginning of the disarming process, the international force "will guarantee protection" to the rebels, that as of today are disarmed, in way that "nobody will go to their meeting with aggressive intentions".

Questioned regarding if the delivery of the weapons translates as a surrendering of the military rebels, Mick Slater rejected that classification, pointing out that "East Timor is not crossing a civil war".

"There's no civil war and nobody is surrendering. There's yes a internal dispute. The important is to create a reliable climate next to the population, taking it to gradually return to its communities", he added.

First Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri and Timorese Foreign Minister &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJos%C3%A9%20Ramos%20Horta"&gt;José Ramos Horta&lt;/a&gt; showed to be satisfied with the delivery of the rebels' weapons.

"It's a good start to stabilize the country. I expect that others follow the example", Alkatiri pointed out.

"They have not done harm to anyone and they have pledged they would not involve in violence with their comrades in the defense force," Ramos Horta said. "So that has only boosted their credibility", he added.

Regarding the ex-Lieutenant Gastão Salsinha, spokesman of the 600 individuals that subscribed an petition denouncing alleged practical discriminatory in the Timorese Armed Forces, Marcos Tilman assured that "they don't have any weapons".

Dismissed from the army in March after going on strike to complain of discrimination, the rebels have been hiding in the mountains surrounding Dili, since the start of the violence in the country in the last months.

By request of the Timorese authorities, a force of more than 2,000 military and police troops of Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Portugal started to arrive at Dili as May 25, 2006, to establish order and peace in the country, after a violence wave have caused the death of more than 2 dozens of people and 130,000 refugees.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; identified the new &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; leader in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ayyub%20Al-Masri"&gt;Abu Ayyub al-Masri&lt;/a&gt;, an Egyptian with ties to &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;. Zawahiri was the number two in command of Al-Qaeda.

"We think that Abu Ayyub al-Masri is in fact, probably, &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Hamza%20al-Muhajir"&gt;Abu Hamza al-Muhajir&lt;/a&gt;. They are probably one and the same" said Major General William Caldwell, spokesman for the U.S. military in Iraq.

Abu Ayyub al-Masri is thought to specialise in bomb making.

The announcement came eight days after Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Maliki said Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who had been identified by al-Qaeda as its leader in Iraq, had been "terminated" in a U.S. airstrike near Baqubah.

The result meant both the Netherlands and Argentina moved into the knock-out round of the Fifa World Cup as they both had six points; while the Ivory Coast and Serbia and Montenegro had no points with one game left in Group C. 

Excitement in the first-half gave way to a gritty second-half as Marco van Basten's Orangemen changed to a more defensive formation and showed resilience to stop the Elephant's charge.

The Netherlands committed 24 fouls in the match but could not stop Ivory Coast taking 16 shots, nine of which hit the target. Late in the match Robin van Persie used his chest to stop a Didier Drogba header going over the goal line.

Henri Michel's side played an attractive passing game but as the game went on this proved ineffective against the wall of orange-shirted Netherlands defenders. A more direct approach might have been better; as the tall, 180 centimeter, forward Didier Drogba showed when Van Persie was forced to clear from a corner.

Edwin van der Sar, in the Netherlands goal, conceded his first goal for his country since October 2004 but was otherwise safe and did not allow any rebounds from shots. In the second period he was helped by the Netherlands defence who blocked numerous shots from reaching their destination.

The best of the entertainment was in the first half. The first goal led from a free kick earned by Van Persie on 22 minutes. Van Persie ran at speed horizonal to the penalty area and was cut down in full flight by Kolo Toure.

Van Persie took the free kick and hammered the ball left footed around the wall into the net. 

Suddenly Ivory Coast were opened up again three minutes later. Good passes and movement and Arjen Robben found Ruud van Nistelrooij in space to the right of Jean-Jacques Tizie. The striker passed the ball high over the keeper.

The two goal lead did not reflect the play which had seen some good moves by Ivory Coast and an Emmanuel Eboue penalty appeal rejected.

On 32 minutes creative midfielder Didier Zokora gave Van der Sar a warning when he smacked a powerful long range shot against his crossbar.

Seven minutes later Bakary Kone ran from the centre of the field to space on the Netherland's left side. Kone reached the edge of the penalty area and let fly with his right foot; the ball thumped into the top right of Van der Sar's goal.

At this point the Ivory Coast looked better than the Netherlands defence. On 42 minutes Drogba intercepted a misplaced pass but on the breakaway could not thread his pass to his team mate when 2 on 1 with the last defender.

It was not to be Ivory Coast's day. While Ivory Coast still looked to pass through the Netherlands the Dutch looked more than capable to hold out for the win.

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ACBC"&gt;Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/a&gt; reports that a case of avian flu has been discovered in a bird in the Eastern province of &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Edward%20Island"&gt;Prince Edward Island&lt;/a&gt;.

The case was discovered in a gosling found in the community of O'Leary and confirmed at the Atlantic Veterinary College in &lt;a href="w%3ACharlottetown"&gt;Charlottetown&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement was made in a press release issued by the government of Prince Edward Island.

Chief Health Officer for PEI, Dr. Lamont Sweet, said, "From the information we have received, there is a low risk of human illness at the present time." He went on to suggest that people in West Prince who have contact with domestic or wild birds who may be experiencing flu-like symptoms should consult their physician.

While the Angolan's game was not all defense, they had eight shots and five corner kicks, it was Mexico who had much the best chances in the game and will be disappointed not to have scored a number of goals.

Three minutes into injury time Ramon Morales hung a high ball that dipped over the Angolan keeper. Ricardo stretched and the 36 year old goalkeeper, who did not have a football club, clinched the ball like a trophy and earned his team a 0-0 draw. It was Angola's first World Cup point.

For a nation where average life expectancy is 38 years this was the biggest result in Angolan football history. The result also meant if Angola beat Iran they still had a mathematical chance to get into the knock-out stage of the Fifa World Cup.

In the first half the crowd was subdued as chances were few. Mexico had free kicks saved, one from Rafael Marquez had come off the post. For Angola Figueiredo's free kick found Fabrice Akwa only for the captain's header to go nowhere near the goal.

The best chance in free play before the break fell to Mexico's Guillermo Franco. A long ball into box on 44 minutes bounced off a defender but Ricado was in the way of Franco's weak shot.

Ricardo La Volpe had been banned from smoking on the touchline by Fifa after being observed doing so in his first game. Against Iran the Mexican coach was credited with a change in the game after half time. 

♡❤Sans♡❤ cigarettes, this happened again against Angola but his team just couldn't get past Ricardo. 

Franco was denied once more on 55 minutes when he tried to lob the keeper but Ricardo got a hand to it. The ball then dropped to Jesus Arellano but his shot was tame and a defender on the line cleared.

When a defensive clearance rebounded to Omar Bravo Ricardo was in the right place to pick up the striker's scuffed shot.

Ricardo, the Fifa Man of the Match, missed a few crosses but when he got them he didn't drop them. On 64 minutes a cross was whipped in from the right and he caught the cross spectacularly with one-hand.

Angolan attacks were limited. Mendonca's drive went straight to Oswald Sanchez while a Figueiredo blast from outside the box cleared the bar.

On 80 minutes Andre was sent off for deliberate hand ball, his second yellow card offense in the game. All Angolan energies were now diverted to keep the scores level.

It was a difficult last ten minutes. Jesus Arellano floated a cross from midfield to Jose Fonseca but his volley went wide. With great technique Marquez connected superbly with a long 35 yard drive but Ricardo leapt to his right and used both hands to push the ball behind for a corner.

While two minutes remained Mexico hit the post for the second time in the match. Ricardo missed a fast cross but Omar Bravo's instinctive redirection toward goal was centimeters out.

The qualifiers from Group D was not settled by the result, Friday. Mexico's progress became more tricky. But the Central Americans still had the upper hand. Luis De Oliveira Goncalves's side had to score goals against Iran while Mexico needed only to not lose to Portugal in their last game to certainly go through.

A &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASoyuz%20launch%20vehicle"&gt;Soyuz rocket&lt;/a&gt; successfully launched a civilian Earth observation satellite into orbit today at the &lt;a href="w%3ABaikonur%20Cosmodrome"&gt;Baikonur Cosmodrome&lt;/a&gt; in central &lt;a href="w%3AKazakhstan"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt;. The satellite's mission is mainly to assist exploration of natural resources, monitor pollution and natural or man-made disasters.

The three-stage Soyuz rocket lifted off at 0800 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt; (4:00 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AEDT"&gt;EDT&lt;/a&gt;), little under nine minutes later in an orbit with an apogee of approximately 230 miles, a perigee of around 125 miles, and an inclination of about 70 degrees. The Resurs DK1 spacecraft, weighing close to 15,000-pound, successfully separated from the Soyuz upper stage. 

The DK1 is the newest member of the Resurs satellite fleet, the first in an upgraded series of spacecraft, and is capable of producing one-meter resolution images in black-and-white(two meters in color). The DK1 can document an area of up to 270,000 square miles a day and its advanced communications system allows fast downlinking of recent images to ground stations. 

Images from the new satellite will be used by Russian government agencies, international groups, as well as sold commercially. The satellite will also monitor sea surface status, polar weather and ice conditions as well as assist in topographic and thematic mapping in remote regions. 

In addition to the DK1, two secondary payloads were attached. One is the &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APAMELA"&gt;PAMELA&lt;/a&gt; (Payload for Antimatter-Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics) instrument, housed on the upper side of the satellite designed to examine cosmic rays in order to learn more about dark matter and the relationship between matter and antimatter. The other is a Russian &lt;a href="w%3Aparticle%20detector"&gt;particle detector&lt;/a&gt; for designed for identifying earthquake precursors in Earth's magnetic field. 

Further launches of these updated satellites are expected in the next few years. The Soyuz rocket's next scheduled launch is a cargo delivery flight to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, to be followed by the launch of the Eurosat MetOp-A weather satellite.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AIreland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in the second of two &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; tests. The All Blacks managed to create a good lead in the first half, though the Irish fought back to get within just three points. The All Blacks however held on in the end to win. The match was played at &lt;a href="w%3AEden%20Park"&gt;Eden Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.

The match kicked off after the All Blacks performed their traditional &lt;a href="w%3Ahaka"&gt;haka&lt;/a&gt; as the rain started to pour down. &lt;a href="w%3AByron%20Kelleher"&gt;Byron Kelleher&lt;/a&gt; opened up the scoring in the first half, scoring a &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; for the All Blacks after the first five minuets. &lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20McAlister"&gt;Luke McAlister&lt;/a&gt; kicks over a conversion to take the New Zealanders to a seven to nil lead. McAlister added another three points with a kick at goal when the All Blacks were awarded a penalty, taking their lead to 10 to nil. &lt;a href="w%3AClarke%20Dermody"&gt;Clarke Dermody&lt;/a&gt; charges over with just over 10 minutes remaining in the first half, though the Irish were upset about an alleged knock-on in the lead up to the play. McAlister converted the try, and the All Blacks now led 17 to nil. With around nine minutes left, Ireland scored their first points through &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20O%27Connell"&gt;Paul O'Connell&lt;/a&gt; who ran through to score under the posts. &lt;a href="w%3ARonan%20O%27Gara"&gt;Ronan O'Gara&lt;/a&gt; converts the try to put the Irish within 10 points. Minutes later, McAlister kicks a penalty to extend the All Blacks lead to 20 to seven. Minutes before half time, &lt;a href="w%3AJerry%20Flannery"&gt;Jerry Flannery&lt;/a&gt; scores a try for Ireland to put them back in the game, O'Gara converts, and the sides go into the break with the All Blacks leading 20 to 14.

O'Gara kicks a penalty goal after 10 miutes into the second half, putting Ireland within just three points of the All Blacks, the score now being 20 to 17, with around 30 minutes to go. A period of no scoring followed, with the score remaining separated by just three points.

Police were kept busy around &lt;a href="w%3ABlayney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Blayney&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales'&lt;/a&gt; central west this morning as two separate crashes on the &lt;a href="w%3AMid-Western%20Highway"&gt;Mid Western Highway&lt;/a&gt; claimed three lives. Both accidents occurred within 20 minutes of each other and were only seven kilometres (4 miles) apart.

The first accident occurred five kilometres North of Blayney towards &lt;a href="w%3ACowra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Cowra&lt;/a&gt; at 7:45 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt;. A B-double truck carrying woodchips slammed into a parked table-top truck as it went around a corner. As a result of the crash, the B-double rolled over. The parked truck's passenger died at the scene, while its driver was airlifted to &lt;a href="w%3AOrange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt; Base Hospital suffering abdominal injuries.

A second accident occurred two kilometres south of Blayney, towards &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt;. Both the driver and passenger died when their car left the road and collided with a tree. Police said they were investigating the crash and would prepare a report for the Coroner.

In a report released in 2004, the NRMA said that the government should give priority to upgrading the highway among others within the region. In 2005, the NRMA also expressed concern about the highway being reclassified as a regional road (from a state road), putting the onus for maintenance and improvements on councils, which already have limited resources.

According to a 2004 audit conducted by the NRMA, the Mid Western Highway is the fifth safest highway statistically in NSW with 18.7 major crashes per 100 million kilometres travelled and 11.5 fatalities per 100 million kilometres travelled. According to the NRMA, the most dangerous highway in NSW is the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Western%20Highway"&gt;Great Western Highway&lt;/a&gt;, which has 51.5 crashes and 30.8 fatalities per 100 million kilometres travelled.

Upon closer examination of statistics, the safety record of the stretch between Bathurst and Cowra (which also happens to be the most heavily used) is comparable to that of the entire &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20England%20Highway"&gt;New England Highway&lt;/a&gt; and more dangerous than the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Highway%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Pacific Highway&lt;/a&gt; with 29.5 crashes and 15.6 fatalities per 100 million kilometres travelled. A 14-kilometre section between Bathurst and Blayney is particularly dangerous according to the NRMA.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has defeated &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; 43 points to 18 in the second match of the &lt;a href="w%3ACook%20Cup"&gt;Cook Cup&lt;/a&gt; series between the two nations in &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt;. The second win for Australia saw them win the Cook Cup trophy, which was held by England entering the series. The match was played under a closed roof at &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra%20Dome"&gt;Telstra Dome&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMlebourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. Regular Australian captain &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Gregan"&gt;George Gregan&lt;/a&gt; entered the game off the bench in the second half to receive his 120th cap for the Wallabies - setting a new &lt;a href="w%3Aworld%20record"&gt;world record&lt;/a&gt;.

The first points of the match went to England with &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Goode"&gt;Andy Goode&lt;/a&gt; booting a field goal to put them up by three points. A few minutes later &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Smith"&gt;George Smith&lt;/a&gt; charged over to score a try under the posts for the Wallabies, &lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20Mortlock"&gt;Stirling Mortlock&lt;/a&gt; added the subsequent conversion to take the Australians to a seven to three lead over the English. In the 14th minute, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Gerrard"&gt;Mark Gerrard&lt;/a&gt; catches a cross field bomb from &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Larkem"&gt;Stephen Larkem&lt;/a&gt; to score the second Australian try. Although Mortlock missed the conversion, Australia move to a 14 to three lead over England. Goode was able to give England another three points, kicking a penalty goal in the 25th minute. &lt;a href="w%3ARodney%20Blake"&gt;Rodney Blake&lt;/a&gt;, one of Australia's heroes from the previous test, appeared to have hurt his ankle and is replaced by &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Baxter"&gt;Al Baxter&lt;/a&gt;. Minutes out from half-time, &lt;a href="w%3ALote%20Tuqiri"&gt;Lote Tuqiri&lt;/a&gt; scores for Australia. Mortlock is successful with the conversion to take the score to 19 points to six going into break.

&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Chisholm"&gt;Mark Chisholm&lt;/a&gt; runs in the first try of the second half, and with Mortlock adding the conversion, Australia's lead extended to over 20 points. Although an English comeback now looked unlikely, minutes later &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Chuter"&gt;George Chuter&lt;/a&gt; scores a try for England, although Goode missed the conversion, the score was now 26 to 11 to Australia. With 20 minutes remaining, Mortlock kicks a penalty goal to take to score to 29 to 11. A few minutes later, Gerrard runs in for his second side and with Mortlock adding the conversion, Australia now moved the score to 36 to 11. A late try to Larkham, which was converted by Mortlock sees Australia take the score to over 40 points. In the 80th minute of the match, moments from halftime, Varndell receives a pass from Balshaw to run in a late try for England. The final score was 43 points to 18.

Iran used defensive tactics to frustrate Portugal in the Commerzbank Arena and until one hour of play the scores were level. The defence had blocked shots, Ebrahim Mirzapour had made some great saves. 

Figo had created most of Portugal's best opportunities. In the first half the team in the maroon strip had 5 corners in the first 15 minutes and, after half an hour, had 68 per cent of the possession.

A Deco shot from a close angle forced Mirzapour to make a one-handed save over the bar. By half time Richard Carvalho, and later Ronaldo, had missed the target with a header from a Figo corner.

Branko Ivankovic's side did not trouble Ricardo at the other end but this did not make the Brazilian coach of the Portugal team adjust the 4-5-1 formation which had Pauletta up front on his own.

In the second half Figo was again the centre of everything but this did not look enough. It was Deco's brilliant 25 yard shot, from Figo's rolled pass, which won it.

Mirzapour could only stand and watch the ball rise into the net as Deco fell backwards onto the ground.

Portugal had ten shots on target to Iran's one; from a Vahid Hashemian header which produced a photographer friendly save from Ricardo. Iran allowed Figo to take 13 corner kicks and conceded 63 per cent of ball possession.

After the first goal the second looked more likely as Iran were forced to get forward to equalise. If they did not they would play only one more game at the World Cup.

Rasoul Khatibi got on the end of a long ball into the box but, at an angle, dragged wastefully wide of the far post.

On 78 minutes Figo attacked the Iranian penalty area once more and was brought down by Yahya Golmohammadi. Golmohammadi, Iran's captain, ten minutes later was taken off injured, clutching his left shoulder after he had stepped in front of Ronaldo.

Ronaldo passed the penalty in high using the inside of his right foot.

Portugal were due next to play Mexico and would go through as winners of Group D if they did not lose.

<h1>Ghana surge past Czech Republic in Group E</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ghana%20surge%20past%20Czech%20Republic%20in%20Group%20E&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Czech Republic had Tomas Ujfalusi sent off after 66 minutes but in this game Ghana had the best of the chances over the 90 minutes.

The African team played short quick passes as well as long ones and had relentless energy. They commanded the field with their physical presence.

With 10 minutes left some sides up by a single goal would hold the ball near the opponent's corner flag to run down the clock. Ratomir Dujkovic's side, at 25 years and two months the youngest at the Fifa World Cup, did not.

Against ten men they seemed determined to get a killer second goal. They eventually achieved this after numerous chances.

They surged forward in numbers such that sometimes the ten men Czech Republic broke with three players attacking four defenders - which might be a dangerous situation when two of them are Pavel Neved and Tomas Rosicky and your side is only one goal in front.

The Czech Republic did not take their opportunties to score. Their star midfielders looked busy but with the team's best strikers on the injury list - Milan Baros and Jan Koller - the Czech attack was toothless and a bit disorganised. 

At one point Rosicky let a low cross through his legs for a runner behind when he was in fact in the best striker's position. 
On 57 minutes Neved left an imprint of his frustration in the stadium when he kicked an advertising hoarding which left visible stud holes.

The game had started brilliant fashion for the passionate Ghanians. They never looked back from the second minute when Asamoah Gyan took a long ball down on his chest and from the edge of the area drove the ball low past Petr Cech.

On 31 minutes Gyan got behind the defence but Cech, in a good position, saved. Gyan should have chipped it. In the second period the promising 20-year-old arguably missed many equally good chances with only Petr Cech to beat - again shooting low when he might have gone high.

Karel Bruckner had Petr Chec to thank for the score not being an embarrassment. After the sending off saves from Ghanians came on 71, 73, 77, and 79 minutes. 

Any hope the central Europeans could surprise with a comeback ended when Sulley Muntari showed how to beat Cech on 84 minutes. In space in the area, he fired high left-footed inside the near post.

But before that there was drama of a sending off and missed penalty. Ujfalusi had interrupted Matthew Amoah's kicking leg when he was clean through and was shown a red card by Horacio Elizondo. 

The referee delayed the red card slightly and this led to what seemed to be a misunderstanding. The crowd roared when the belated red was flashed. Gyan, perhaps in eagerness, might have taken this noise a sign the whistle had blown. 

He took the penalty, though the referee was not yet in position to let it be taken. This earned the striker a yellow card and put him out of the USA match. An example of the inexperience of the young team. 

His Serbian coached then watched as Gyan hit midway up the right post with the actual penalty and the score stayed 1-0. 

On 93 minutes there was a flurry of activity near the Ghana goal and Richard Kingston pulled off two fine saves. But with captain Stephen Appiah and Michael Essian in control of midfield Ghana looked a powerful side who well-deserved their win against the understrength Czechs.

With three teams in Group E now on three points all eyes then turned to the next games, as potentially any of the four teams still could qualify.

Kasey Keller made three crucial saves as nine-man USA drew 1-1 with ten-man Italy in an heart-pounding Group E match.

The match was played in Kaiserslautern and there were many American fans present. Those who had seen the Czech Republic crush the USA 3-0 might have been surprised at the way the underdogs played against the Azzuri. 

Bruce Arena's side began with a 4-5-1 formation and started the game with great energy, attacking from the first whistle. However; arguably against the play Italy scored first. A set piece 45 yards out was driven low and Alberto Gilardino got in front of his defender and glanced a header to the far post.

USA got an equaliser on 26 minutes. Christian Zaccardo tried to clear a corner one way but skewed the ball the other. Own goal, Gianluigi Buffon did not move. 

Then there was a crucial turning point in the character of the game. Daniele De Rossi rose for a midfield challenge and hit Brian McBride under the left eye with what looked like an elbow.

Blood streamed from McBride's face. Uruguay referee Jorge Larrionda gave De Rossi a straight red.

Larrionda went on to show two more red cards in the match which equalled a tournament record. There had only been three other Fifa World Cup games with three red cards: 1938 Brazil v Czechoslovakia; 1954, Brazil v Hungary; and 1998, Denmark v South Africa.

For a few minutes McBride remained shirtless on the touchline while he received boxer treatment and three stiches for his cut. Italian manager Marcello Lippi replaced Francesco Totti with midfield tackler Gennaro Gattuso.

With half an hour gone the own goal and De Rossi's mistake had given the USA a massive advantage. But it appears they did not keep their heads.

Ten minutes after Pablo Mastroeni had grazed the crossbar with a shot he made a horrible lunge at the ankles of Andrea Pirlo. Jorge Larrionda flashed the red again.

Just before half-time the USA had neutralised their advantage. In less than one minute after the restart they were to hand the Italians the advantage. 

Eddie Pope was sent off after he received his second caution: two yellow cards equal one red card and now it was ten men versus nine. 

Lippi almost immediately got substitute Alexandro Del Piero on for one of his defenders to take advantage of their extra player. Arena brought on another defender and lined up 3-3-2. By 80 minutes this had become 8-0-0.

For a game with so few players and so much drama there were very few chances. Only three shots were on target; all for Italy. USA had 8 shots; none on target.

A statistic that suggests the draw was a tactical victory for the USA coach. Italy's forward line was guilty of getting caught offside 11 times.

Pirlo went close with a freekick and almost forced Carlos Bocanegra to head another dangerous dipping cross into his net; fortunately for Keller it clipped the bar.

As the Americans were stretched further Kasey Keller made a couple of crucial saves from Lippi's extra attacker. On 73 minutes he got one hand to a Del Piero header and then palmed away two-handed his long range drive.

In the last 10 minutes Italy passed well and created a few chances to score. Vincenzo Iaquinta broke the offside trap, but failed to control the ball with only Keller to beat. 

On 90 minutes Gilardino headed wide under pressure from Steve Cherundolo.
USA, despite playing the entire second half with 9 men might say they were unlucky not to get a second goal. A DaMarcus Beasley shot beat Buffon but was over-ruled because McBride was standing offside in the keeper's line of sight. 

On USA attacks Landon Donovan kept the ball well which allowed respite from Italian attacks and spurred his team on to play further up the pitch, until their stamina cracked with ten-minutes left.

The referee arguably was fair if not consistent. In the second half as both sets of players tired decisions appeared more based on necessity to be more lenient.

Lunges were not whistled and there was an aggressive shirt pull in the USA penalty area that was ignored. In an earlier World Cup match, a Ukraine player had conceded a penalty and was sent off for doing this. 

The shared point meant either one of Italy or Czech Republic would qualify from Group E for the knock-out stage of the Fifa World Cup. USA next play Ghana: a win for Ghana would mean qualification while the USA would qualify if they won and Italy beat the Czech Republic.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in the second of two &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; tests between the two nations, with the Springboks also winning the test in &lt;a href="w%3ADurban"&gt;Durban&lt;/a&gt; the previous week. The match was played in &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Elizabeth"&gt;Port Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AEPRU%20Stadium"&gt;EPRU Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3APercy%20Montgomery"&gt;Percy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; got the first points of the match as he kicked an early penalty goal for South Africa to put them out in front three to nil within the first couple of minutes. Montgomery kicked another penalty for South Africa in the fourth minute, taking South Africa out to an early six to nil lead, as well as taking his own international points tally to 600 points, becoming the first Springbok to do so. Scotland's &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Webster"&gt;Simon Webster&lt;/a&gt; scores the first try of the match. Although &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Paterson"&gt;Chris Paterson&lt;/a&gt; misses the conversion, Scotland are now just a point behind, the score now six to five. The Springboks furthered their lead with another successful penalty kick from Montgomery in the 16th mnute, as well as &lt;a href="w%3AJaco%20van%20der%20Westhuyzen"&gt;Jaco van der Westhuyzen&lt;/a&gt; kicking another around the 25 minute mark, taking the score to 12 to five. A late try was disallowed by the television match official to Scotland's Webster, so the sides entered half-time at 12 to five.

Montgomery opened up the scoring in the second half, kicking a penalty goal five minutes in. Subsequent penalties to Scotland's Paterson, as well as another to Montgomery saw the score move to 18 to 8 with over 25 minutes remaining. South Africa score their first try through &lt;a href="w%3AFourie%20du%20Preez"&gt;Fourie du Preez&lt;/a&gt; and although Montgomery misses the conversion, the Springboks now move ahead to a 23 to eight lead. With around ten minutes remaining the match, &lt;a href="w%3ADonnie%20Macfadyen"&gt;Donnie Macfadyen&lt;/a&gt; scores a try for Scotland, and with Paterson's conversion, the score moved to 23 to 15 with the Springboks still in front. Montgomery got the final points of the match, with another two successful penalty goals. The final score was 29 to 15.

&lt;a href="w%3AArgentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AWales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday in the second of two &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby&lt;/a&gt; test matches between the two nations. The final score was 45 to 27, with the match being played at &lt;a href="w%3AVelez%20Sarsfield"&gt;Velez Sarsfield&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;. The Pumas also took the first match, 27-25, played in the previous week in &lt;a href="w%3APuerto%20Madryn"&gt;Puerto Madryn&lt;/a&gt;. Argentina's &lt;a href="w%3AFederico%20Todeschini"&gt;Federico Todeschini&lt;/a&gt; ended the match with 30 points.

Argetine &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Durand"&gt;Martin Durand&lt;/a&gt; almost scored a try in the 15th minute, but the television match official disallowed it. However, &lt;a href="w%3AGonzalo%20Tiesi"&gt;Gonzalo Tiesi&lt;/a&gt; was over for Argentina soon after. Penalty goals to Todeschini saw Argentina accumulate 16 points in the first half, though &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Hook"&gt;James Hook&lt;/a&gt; kicked two penally goals for Wales, the nations went into half-time with Argentina leading 16 to six.

Argentina scored early in the second half through &lt;a href="w%3AJuan%20Martin%20Fernandez%20Lobbe"&gt;Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe&lt;/a&gt;, and with subsequent penalty goals, Argentina moved to a 32 to six lead over Wales. &lt;a href="w%3AGareth%20Delve"&gt;Gareth Delve&lt;/a&gt; posted Wales' first try of the match, scoring after 60 minutes, in the second half. Two late tries by &lt;a href="w%3AShane%20Williams"&gt;Shane Williams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALee%20Byrne"&gt;Lee Byrne&lt;/a&gt; reduced the scoreline in the end. The score at full-time was 45 to 27, which saw Argentina take the series between the nations 2 to nil. Argentina now await the &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; who play them in Argentina next week.

<h1>Legality of NSW traffic and parking fines to be tested in court</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Legality%20of%20NSW%20traffic%20and%20parking%20fines%20to%20be%20tested%20in%20court&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The legality of speeding and parking fines in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; is set to be tested in court this week. A lawyer from &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; will challenge the authority of the state's infringement processing bureau to issue fines for speeding and parking offences.

The lawyer claims that when the NSW government moved control of the bureau from the NSW Police to the Office of State Revenue in October 2001, the government failed to make correct legislative changes. He claims that all fines issued since the move are invalid.

The basis of the case revolve around whether or not the infringement processing bureau has powers to issue penalty notices (fines) under NSW law.

The bureau said that the case would only be relevant to fines which are disputed by a person in court. The bureau said that only five per cent of fines are challenged.

"People who did not elect to go to court and have paid their infringement notice will not be affected by any decision, so the issue of refunds does not arise," a statement by the Office of State Revenue said.

For the 2004/2005 financial year, the infringement processing bureau recorded revenues of &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$158.7 million from fines.

NSW Opposition leader Peter Debnam said the government has once again failed to write legislation correctly. "The bottom line with this thing is that the Government simply hasn't done its homework. We see this time and time again, legislation going through parliament, and it ends up costing tax payers a fortune," he said.

The second oldest British veteran of the First World War turned 108 on Saturday, June 17th. He celebrated this at his retirement home in Wells, in the south-west of England.

Harry Patch was called up to fight in 1917 at the age of 18, whilst he was a plumber's apprentice in Bath. Several days later he was in Belgium, participating in the Third Battle of Ypres, in Belgium, a battle which would kill 70000 soldiers in three months alone. Patch left the combat zone on September 22 after he was hit by a piece of shrapnel from a shell that had killed three of his companions. 

"I always remember September 22. That was the day three of my friends were killed," he said. "It was mud, more mud, and even more mud, and the lot was mixed with blood," he remembers. Patch is still convinced that the war was useless.

The oldest living British veteran of the war is Henry Allingham, 110, who served in the Royal Naval Air Service, which would later become the Royal Air Force. The oldest man to have seen combat in the war is Moses Hardy, 113, in the United States, and the oldest to have served in the armed forces during the war is Emiliano Mercado Del Toro, 114, again from the United States.

On the eve of the third anniversary of the June 17 raid on the central office of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Council%20of%20Resistance%20of%20Iran"&gt;National Council of Resistance of Iran&lt;/a&gt; and homes of dozens of Iranian political refugees and dissidents, &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACourt%20of%20Appeals"&gt;Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; in separate rulings revoked all restrictions on Mrs. &lt;a href="w%3AMaryam%20Rajavi"&gt;Maryam Rajavi&lt;/a&gt;, the Iranian Resistance's President-elect, and all those arrested on &lt;a href="w%3AJune%2017"&gt;June 17&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2003"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;. The rulings came while the investigative magistrates were insisting on continuing the restrictions. 

For the past three years, Mrs. Rajavi and 16 members and supporters of the Iranian Resistance had been under judicial restrictions including the denial of the &lt;a href="w%3Aright%20to%20travel"&gt;right to travel&lt;/a&gt;, entry to the headquarters of the National Council of Resistance of Iran in &lt;a href="w%3AAuvers-sur-Oise"&gt;Auvers-sur-Oise&lt;/a&gt;, and the right to have contact with each other. 

Mrs. Rajavi welcomed the verdict and said, "The case was conceived at the request of the &lt;a href="w%3Afascist"&gt;fascist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Atheocracy"&gt;theocracy&lt;/a&gt; ruling Iran and was solely based on lies churned out by this regime. With the latest ruling, the time has come for this dossier to be brought to an end and all proceedings halted.", "The shameful June 17, 2003 raid was a futile attempt to destroy Iran's democratic opposition and aid the Iranian regime. If resistance against religious despotism for freedom is considered a crime, then I and all members and supporters of the Resistance proudly accept this crime. We are determined to establish democracy in Iran. Nothing can save the clerical regime from its inevitable fall and nothing can stop the &lt;a href="w%3AIranian%20people"&gt;Iranian nation&lt;/a&gt; from attaining freedom and democracy," she added.

Following the court ruling, dozens of Iranian and French sympathizers of the Resistance went to Mrs. Rajavi's residence in Auvers-sur-Oise, to congratulate her. Mayors of Auvers-sur-Oise and &lt;a href="w%3ACergy"&gt;Cergy&lt;/a&gt;, in the northern Paris province of &lt;a href="w%3AVal%20d%27Oise"&gt;Val d'Oise&lt;/a&gt; also joined the celebrations.

<h2>NCRI Lawyers statement</h2>

Lawyers involved in the case welcomed the decision by the Paris court of appeals to remove all restrictions imposed on Mrs. Rajavi in a press release issued on Friday. They described the reasons presented by the investigative magistrates to reject the appeal as baseless, "The whole case was based on one sided and biased claims and extremely suspicious witnesses who were obviously in contact with Iran's secret services," said the statement.

The lawyers stressed that the investigative magistrates should now draw the necessary conclusions and admit to the emptiness of the file against members of the Resistance and remove prosecution orders. "This was done three years ago to please &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;," the statement added, "and it is now clear that it was aimed to win commercial contracts."

"Today, no appeasement is acceptable especially after the worrying trend taken by the clerical regime over this period which was largely envisaged by Mrs. Rajavi," concluded the statement.

<h2>Background</h2>

Shortly after 6AM on Tuesday, June 17, 2003, 1,300 hooded and heavily-armed French policemen and Special Forces from a dozen security and intelligence agencies, equipped with armored cars, helicopters and boats, launched the largest police operation in three decades to raid 13 offices and homes of Iranian refugees. The main target was the office of the National Council at Auvers-sur-Oise. Police arrested Rajavi, the NCRI's President-elect and 164 Iranian political refugees and activists.

Hours after the raids, three leading human rights organizations in France - The &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20League"&gt;Human Rights League&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20Libert%C3%A9"&gt;France Liberté&lt;/a&gt; foundation and the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Federation%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;International Federation of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; - issued a strongly-worded joint statement condemning the action.

Both teams worked hard and had clear chances to score but lacked the necessary ruthlessness in front of goal. On a hot field and under the blue sky in the Frankenstadion the conditions won as the match petered out at a walking pace.

In the first period Japan's goal keeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi kept Japan in the game. Kawaguchi dived low to his left to save Darijo Srna's driven penalty after Dado Prso had been knocked down from behind by Tsuneyasu Miyamoto.

The yellow card for the central defender and captain of the Japan team meant he would miss Japan's next match against Brazil.

The Japanese keeper was centre of the action again when the Croatian coach's son Niko Kranjcar turned brilliantly and rattled the crossbar from 25 yards.

With half an hour gone Kawaguchi got a shock - a bouncing back pass bobbled one meter in front of him. Fortunately for Japan though it evaded his control the ball trickled just wide of the post.

Croatia had the better opportunities. Overall, their physical presence meant they were dangerous from their 11 corner kicks and were capable of making space to shoot from the edge of the area.

If Zlatko Kranjcar might have wished for more luck in front of goal, Japan coach Zico might also rue the lack of finishing from his team. Atsushi Yanagisawa missed an open goal on 50 minutes.

Both sides gave their best in the heat and deserved their first Fifa World Cup point. The result did not play either team out of the World Cup but the advantage in Group F remained with Brazil and Australia who had three points after the first games.

A woman that was angry her new Chihuahua had just died entered a dog breeders home and pummeled him on the head with her dead puppy. Lisa Lynn Hopfer was charged with trespassing and third-degree assault with her Chihuahua on the June 7 incident. The 33-year-old woman told police she had taken the puppy to a veterinarian, who said it was only 4 weeks old and needed to be returned to its mother. But before she could return the puppy named Chloe, it died.

Early Wednesday she went to the breeders home and wrestled him as she tried to get down to the basement and take another puppy. Then the breeder got Lisa out of her house and that is when she started to get beaten over the head with a dead Chihuahua. As the woman drove away she waved the dead puppy out of the sunroof and shouted numerous threats at the breeder. 

Police said they are considering felony burglary charges against woman and misdemeanor assault charges.

The game had started slowly as Australia, playing defensively, kept many players near the edge of their penalty area. But a goal by Adriano four minutes after half time changed that and made for a more attacking game.

After nine minutes Vince Grella set the tone for the first half when he raked his studs on Ronaldo's calf. While the referee did not give a caution for this bad foul, four of the five cautions issued by German referee Markus Merk came in the first half. Two went to Australian players.

Brazil were closed down quickly and suffered 25 fouls in the game. When they had the ball Australia, who wore a dark blue strip instead of their traditional yellow and green, used their ball possession effectively and got forward with neat passes. 

The Brazilians in contrast did not start well. On an elusive run into the penalty box Ronaldinho had used fine skill to elude his markers but then trod on the ball and fell over. Ronaldo then had an embarrassing moment when he created a good opening to shoot only to kick at fresh air.

And when Roberto Carlos had broken free unmarked the attacking left-sided defender jumped up and down in frustration when Ronaldo over hit his pass. 

Brazil's goal came four minutes after half time.

Ronaldo rolled the ball across the edge of the box to Adriano. The striker moved quickly to his left and passed a firm shot through Scott Chipperfield's legs. The ball hugged the grass and beat Mark Schwarzer's out-stretched left hand.

Australia in an effort to get an equaliser replaced a defender with an attacker. But they found it hard to get past Brazil's defence; Ze Roberto made two key tackles to stop Marco Bresciano and Harry Kewell.

On 56 minutes Harry Kewell missed Australia's best chance. The ball came loose to his feet and the goal beckoned. But Dida dived at his feet and Kewell skied his effort over the bar.

While Australia made good forward moves Brazil attacked into the space they left behind. Kaka flicked a Ronaldinho corner on to the crossbar and in injury time missed wide when he only had Schwarzer to beat.

The exciting second half was rounded off when on 89 minutes Robinho, who was a lively substitute for Ronaldo, hit a powerful shot off the inside of Schwarzer's left post. Fred tapped in the rebound.

The result meant Brazil qualified for the knock-out stage of the Fifa World Cup while Australia would need to get a least a draw against Croatia in their final Group F game to extend their stay in Germany.

On 81 minutes France were punished for their complacency by a Korea Republic team that had never given up and that ended the last minutes of a strange match arguably the stronger side.
For most of the game Korea Republic, in an almost luminous red outfit were not in the game. Their three forwards hardly got a touch; in fact they didn't have a single shot in the first half and had only two on target in 90 minutes. 

By contrast the French had three times as many shots as the Koreans but managed only four accurate attempts on Lee Woon-Jae's goal - two more than the Koreans managed. A poor showing for a side so at ease it played mostly in its opposition's half of the pitch and did not concede a shot until the 54th minute.

All looked good when Henry had scored after nine minutes. The ball got through the defence via a deflection; and with a touch from his right foot the Arsenal striker put the ball into the perfect position to pass it in with his left.

With the great throng of red Koreans bouncing up and down and singing there was a great atmosphere in the Zentralstadion and it did not sound like their side were a goal down. 

A Patrick Viera header followed from a corner and was saved by Lee Woon-Jae. There was no great French appeal but the television replay clearly showed the ball had crossed the line. 

After half time the French kept to their slow passing game which made Dick Advocaat's hustling team exceptionally tired without killing them off. With ten minutes left the Korean game sprang to life and deckchairs were brought out to witness a mugging.

Eric Abidal brought down Lee Young-Pyo and got a yellow card. Quick Korean passes found their target and the French suddenly looked a little disorganised.

A cross from deep near the right corner flag from Seol Ki-Hyeon found Cho Jin-Jae. Beyond the far post, the substitute headed back into the path of Park Ji-sung who from five yards helped the ball over both Fabian Barthez and William Gallas. 

The slowness by which the ball went over a grasping Barthez and the French centre half was tantalising and made the score seem more painful.

Now there was a ripping end-to-end contest. Three minutes later Thierry Henry got a chance to make it 2-1 but Lee Woon-Jae jammed his arm hard on the ground for a magnificent left-handed save. In the final minute Ahn Jung-Hwan screamed a free kick past Barthez's right post.

The result meant France, who still had not won a game since the 1998 World Cup final, probably had to win their last match against Togo for a chance to reach the knock-out stage of the 2006 World Cup. Their captain Zinedine Zidane, who got a caution in the game, would be ruled out for that tie.

Korea Republic now lead Group G with 4 points and would certainly advance as group winner if they won their last game against Switzerland.

The World Cup is not the only international competition going on this summer. With vacation and beach reading season in full swing, American readers find themselves trailing their reading counterparts across the pond.

For the first time in five years, American production of new book titles trails that of Great Britain, a country of one-fifth the population of the USA, the Kansas City Star recently reported. Last year, production of new titles in the UK surpassed 206,000, compared with 172,000 in America.

Bowker, a consulting firm following the publishing industry, suspects that as America's wealth increases, more entertainment options compete with books for Americans' leisure time. The figure does not necessarily reflect whether Americans read books less than Brits, and does not, for example, track the comparative reading of reprints and classics.

<h1>&quot;Avast ye scurvy file sharers!&quot;: Interview with Swedish Pirate Party leader Rickard Falkvinge</h1>

MP3s for the people? The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APirate%20Party%20of%20Sweden"&gt;Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a new &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; political party first publicized in January, wants to legalize sharing music, movies, and other copyrighted content using the Internet. What may seem like a doomed effort by a small group of idealists is attracting significant media attention, in part due to a recent police raid on &lt;a href="The%20Pirate%20Bay"&gt;The Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt;, an extremely popular &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent%20tracker"&gt;BitTorrent tracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (see &lt;a href="The%20Pirate%20Bay%20and%20Piratbyr%C3%A5n%20raided"&gt;Wikinews coverage&lt;/a&gt;). 

The Pirate Bay allows people to download content listed in its database using the BitTorrent protocol (including the latest Hollywood movies or computer games) and has gained something of an international cult status, in part for its public and irreverent responses to legal threats received from copyright lawyers of major corporations. The site was reopened days after the raid on Dutch servers (but is now back in Sweden again). Rickard Falkvinge, leader of the Pirate Party, argues that regardless of the legal outcome in the case, the web site demonstrates that copyright law in its current form is not sustainable.

Adopting the moniker of the maligned "Internet pirates", the party argues for drastically limiting the scope and enforcement of copyright law, abolishing patent law, and protecting privacy in what it sees as a "control and surveillance society". The party is hoping to garner enough votes in the September election to become a small but important faction in the next Swedish parliament. Rickard Falkvinge found some time in between interviews and party work to answer our questions.

♡❤♡There are rumours that the Swedish government was indirectly acting on behalf of the U.S. MPAA in shutting down the site. Do you feel that your government is beholden to U.S. interests?♡❤♡

Oh, the MPAA said so themselves in a press release, it's more than a rumor. Check their press release "Swedish authorities sink Pirate Bay". ♡❤[Ed.: see &lt;a href="%23External%20links"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;]♡❤

And yes, this particular fact has caused something of an uproar in Sweden. It's widely believed that Swedish authorities were more or less ordered by a foreign power to act forcefully against an entity that was in, at worst, a legal gray area according to Swedish law.

♡❤♡The raid must have boosted your recognition. How many members do you currently have, and how successful has your fundraising effort been so far?♡❤♡

Our member count is at 6540, no, 6541, no wait, 6543... well, you get the picture. Our members register themselves on our website after paying the membership fee electronically, which helps reduce our admin load considerably.

Fundraising brought in 108,000 SEK ♡❤[Ed.: approx. 14,700 USD or 11,600 EUR]♡❤, enough to buy 3 million ballots, which is some kind of at-least-we're-not-starving minimum. We're not full, but we're not starving, either. Following the raid on the Pirate Bay, we have received another 50K in donations. My sincere thanks to everybody who wants to help out; we are now looking into getting more ballots to make sure we don't run out on election day. (10 million ballots was our initial full-score aim.)

♡❤♡Do you think you will be able to cover future expenses such as radio and television ads?♡❤♡

Following the raid on the Pirate Bay, and our tripling of the member roster, we don't need advertising. We've been mentioned almost every news hour across all channels on national television in the last week.

Also, the established parties have now started to turn, following our success. Parties representing almost half of the elected parliament are now describing today's copyright situation as not working. They still don't understand why, though, they are just echoing what we say without understanding what the words mean. We'll get around to teaching them &amp;mdash; them and the voters alike.

This might be hard for people not following the Swedish media to grasp, but we have made a ♡❤big♡❤ splash. Today, our Minister of Justice was quoted as saying that he's open to changes to copyright laws that would make file-sharing legal, with the headline "Bodström (his name) flip-flops about file sharing." Immediately underneath were the Pirate Party's comments to his suggestions. Let's take that again: when a minister makes a statement about file sharing, media calls us for comments, and publishes them next to that statement. That's how big we have become since the raid on the Pirate Bay.

The Minister of Justice later denied having made that statement to the press that reported it.

We will never be able to pay for television ads, the way I see it. Unless a very wealthy donor comes on stage. (If any such person is reading this, we have planned how to spend up to $375,000 in a cost-efficient way up until the elections, on the chance that donations appear. That spending does still not include any TV ads.)

♡❤♡Are you aware of similar initiatives in other countries?♡❤♡

Some are trying, but none have achieved the necessary momentum and critical mass that we have. We expect that momentum to happen once we get into Swedish Parliament and show that it can be done.

♡❤[Ed.: A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Pirate%20Party"&gt;United States variant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the party was recently launched. See also: &lt;a href="w%3ACategory%3AIntellectual%20property%20activism"&gt;Intellectual property activism category&lt;/a&gt; on Wikipedia]♡❤

♡❤♡The name "Pirate Party" seems to identify the party with what is currently defined as a crime: piracy of software, movies, music, and so on. Will a name like "Pirate Party" not antagonize voters, given that the label is so negatively used? How about potential allies abroad who argue for a more balanced copyright regime, such as the &lt;a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ?♡❤♡

Oh, it ♡❤is♡❤ a crime. That's the heart of the problem! The very problem is that something that 20% of the voters are doing is illegal by punishment of jail time. That's what we want to change. Where the established parties are saying that the voters are broken, we are saying it's the law that is broken.

Besides, it's a way of reclaiming a word. The media conglomerates have been pointing at us and calling us pirates, trying to make us somehow feel shame. It doesn't work. We wear clothes saying "PIRATE" in bright colors out on the streets. Yes, we are pirates, and we're proud of it, too.

Also, the term is not that negative at all in Sweden, much thanks to the awesome footwork of the Pirate Bureau (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APiratbyr%C3%A5n"&gt;Piratbyrån&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), who have been working since 2003 to educate the public.

♡❤♡If you are elected, and have the opportunity to become part of the next government of Sweden, do you intend to focus only on the issues in your platform (IP law and privacy)?♡❤♡

Our current plan is to support the government from the parliament, but not be part of it. If we're part of it, that means we get a vested interest to not overthrow it, which puts us in a weaker position if they start going against our interests.

Overall, our strategy is to achieve the balance of power, where both the left and right blocks need our votes to achieve a majority, and then support the issues of whichever government that agrees to drive our issues the strongest. Basically, we sell our votes on other issues to the highest bidder in exchange for them driving ours.

♡❤♡Have you already made any contacts in Swedish politics?♡❤♡

Contacts... I'm not sure what you mean. Several of us have been shaking hands with some of the established politicians, particularly in the youth leagues, if that's what you mean.

♡❤♡I was thinking along the lines of exploring possible modes of cooperation with established political parties &amp;mdash; are you already taken seriously?♡❤♡

We are taken seriously by most of the youth leagues and by at least one of the represented parties. In particular, which is what counts, we are now taken seriously by national media. However, we can't tie contacts that explore modes of cooperation quite yet &amp;mdash; since our strategy depends on holding the balance of power, we need to not express a preference for whom we'd like to cooperate with, or we'd put ourselves in a weaker bargaining position.

♡❤♡What is your position on moral rights, as recognized by European Union copyright laws: the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and the right to the integrity of the work. Do you think these rights should be preserved?♡❤♡

We safeguard the right to attribution very strongly. After all, what we are fighting for is the intent of copyright as it is described in the US constitution: the promotion of culture. Many artists are using recognition as their primary driving force to create culture.

Publishing anonymously or pseudonymously happens every day on the Internet, so no big deal there either.

The right to integrity, however, is an interesting issue. We state that we are for free sampling, meaning you can take a sound that I made for my tune and use it in your own tunes, or for that matter, a whole phrase. That's partially in line with today's copyright law on derivative works; as long as you add your own creative touch to a work, you get your own protection for the derivation. We want to strengthen that right.

You might want to consider the alternative. In the 50s and 60s, a lot of rock and roll bands started doing covers of old classical music. This would almost certainly have been considered to violate the integrity of the original artist &amp;mdash; and was considered to do so by many &amp;mdash; but in the eyes of many others, it was instead great new culture of a previously unseen form and shape.

So I don't have a definite answer on the integrity issue. While I am leaning towards the promotion of new culture taking precedence over a limitation right, there may be unconsidered cases.

♡❤♡Do you feel that trademark law is adequate as it is?♡❤♡

Yes. We have not seen any hidden costs to trademarks that outweigh the benefits of reducing transaction costs on a market where seller and buyer are not personally acquainted.

♡❤♡How do you intend to deal with EU treaties which define certain legal frameworks for the protection of intellectual works?♡❤♡

What can they do? Fine us? Send us an angry letter?

Come on, countries need to think more like corporations. If the fine is less than the cost to society, which it is in this case, then the right thing to do is to accept the fine with a polite "thank you".

Actually, national media just called me about this very question; the Department of Justice has stated that we can't allow file sharing, as it would break international treaties. My response was that it is more important to not have 1.2 million Swedes criminalized, than it is to avoid paying a penalty fee.

♡❤♡Do you think that weaker intellectual property laws would lessen the amount of products released in Sweden by foreign companies, such as Hollywood studios?♡❤♡

As long as they believe that they will have a revenue here that exceeds the cost of operations, they will keep coming here. Anything else would be wrong from a corporate standpoint.

Besides, you need to remember what we are doing is to change the map according to what reality looks like. We do not want to change people's behavior. We want to change the law so it reflects what the world actually looks like.

So, as they apparently make a profit today, I expect that to continue.

♡❤♡Do you feel that the music industry in its current form will still be needed in a world where non-commercial copying is permitted?♡❤♡

It's not so much if they are needed where non-commercial copying is permitted, rather if they are needed when they're not necessary any more to be the middle man between consumer and artist.

The music industry ♡❤will♡❤ lose its current chokepoint, because they don't add any value to the end product any longer. They will probably survive as a service bureau for artists, but they will not be able to control distribution.

It's actually quite simple: if they get their act together and provide a service that people want to buy, they will remain. If not, they will vanish. Today, they have legislated that people must buy their service regardless of whether it adds value or not, and that's not gonna hold in the long term.

♡❤♡Why fight against intellectual property laws, instead of focusing your energy on creating freely licensed content, such as Creative Commons films or open source software?♡❤♡

I want to raise the issue a level, to show that it's not about payment models or what level of control the copyright holder chooses to exert over his or her work.

Let me put it this way: we have achieved the technical possibility of sending copyrighted works in digital, private communications. I can send a piece of music in e-mail to you, I can drop a video clip in a chat room. That technology is not going away, leaving us with two choices.

So &amp;mdash; ♡❤if♡❤ copyright is to be enforced &amp;mdash; if you are to tax, prohibit, fee, fine, or otherwise hinder the transmission of copyrighted works in private communications, the only way to achieve that is to have all private communications constantly monitored. It's really that large.

Also, this is partly nothing new. We've been able to do this since the advent of the Xerox copier &amp;mdash; you could photocopy a poem or a painting and put it in a letter in the mail. Again, the only way to discover or stop that would have been for the authorities to open all letters and check their content.

So we're at a crossroads here. Either we, as a society, decide that copyright is the greater value to society, and take active steps to give up private communications as a concept. Either that, or we decide that the ability to communicate in private, without constant monitoring by authorities, has the greater value &amp;mdash; in which case copyright will have to give way.

My choice is clear.

♡❤♡The Pirate Bay was shut down and re-opened days later on a Dutch server. According to a Swedish newspaper report, traffic has doubled since then. How long do you think the cat and mouse game will continue?♡❤♡

Until one of two things happen: The authorities realize they can't enforce laws that require monitoring all private communications, especially given the large international level of grassroots support, or [they] actually start monitoring all private communications.

A new book claims that &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; made plans to gas the New York subway system in 2003. According to extracts due to be published in next week's Time magazine, the author of ♡❤The One Percent Doctrine♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3ARon%20Suskind"&gt;Ron Suskind&lt;/a&gt;, asserts that Al-Qaeda's number 2 cancelled the attack 45 days before it was due.

Suskinds book states "U.S. intelligence learned of the plot from a laptop computer belonging to a Bahraini jihadist captured in Saudi Arabia in early 2003."

The book continues, "The computer contained plans for an easily constructed and concealed device that releases deadly hydrogen-cyanide gas using a remote trigger."

The &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Intelligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; built a prototype of those designs shown on the computer and then showed it to the United States President, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. The President then ordered an alert to all levels of the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US government&lt;/a&gt;.

Al-Qaeda had planned to put them in the subway cars and other strategic places.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

A brief look around major league baseball. . . 

♡❤♡Philadelphia 8, Tampa Bay 5♡❤♡

The Philadelphia Phillies snapped a five game losing streak, defeating Tampa Bay 8-5 between a Father's Day crowd of 42,658 earlier today at Citizens' Bank Park in Philadelphia. Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard homered and knocked in four runs, and Phils' closer Tom Gordon, in a game for the first time in over a week, pitched 1 2/3 shaky innings for his 19th save. The Phillies are 15-5 in games in which Howard hits the long ball. Tampa OF Carl Crawford was 2 for 5 with a homer and 2 RBI for the losing Rays.

With the Phillies getting farther away from the Mets in the NL East, the Phils are likely to start concentrating on the NL wild card race if not now, very soon.

♡❤♡Washington 3, N.Y. Yankees 2♡❤♡

Further south, Washington Nationals' third baseman Ryan Zimmerman hit a walk off 2 run shot in the bottom of the 9th to lift Washington over the visiting New York Yankees, 3-2. Zimmerman, whose hitting has gotten hotter with the temperatures, hit the game winner off of Yankees losing pitcher Chien - Ming Wang spoiling his major league debut

<h2>Oakland A's notch tenth win</h2>

♡❤♡Oakland 5, L.A. Dodgers 3♡❤♡

Oakland right-hander Joe Blanton, pitching into the ninth inning, helped the streaking Oakland A's to their tenth straight win over the Los Angeles Dodgers, 5-2 earlier today. Blanton gave way to Oakland reliever Huston Street, who pitched an inning for his 17th save. Oakland center-fielder Jay Payton and infielder Marco Scutaro each had three hits for the A's, who edged into first place in the AL west over Texas.

<h2>Cubbie Blues Continue</h2>

♡❤♡Detroit 12, Chicago Cubs 3♡❤♡

Chicago's Mark Prior made his season debut after a series of injuries that left him sidelined. The Detroit Tigers gave him a rude welcome, as they knotched 6 runs in the first inning on 3 homers. Jose Guillen had a 3-run homer in the first inning to contribute to the Tigers route. Prior didn't last 4 inning and gave up 7 earned runs. The Cubs lost their 6th in a row and are only one game ahead of the cellar Pirates. Detroit sweeps the Cubs and now holds a 1.5 game lead over Chicago's American League team, the White Sox.

Today, at &lt;a href="w%3AWinged%20Foot%20Golf%20Club"&gt;Winged Foot Golf Club&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="w%3AMamaroneck%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Mamaroneck, New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeoff%20Ogilvy"&gt;Geoff Ogilvy&lt;/a&gt; won the 106th &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Open%20%28golf%29"&gt;U.S. Open&lt;/a&gt; with a score of 285, 5 over par. &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Furyk"&gt;Jim Furyk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColin%20Montgomerie"&gt;Colin Montgomerie&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Mickelson"&gt;Phil Mickelson&lt;/a&gt; all tied for second place one stroke behind at 6 over. Ogilvy, born in &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide%2C%20Australia"&gt;Adelaide, Australia&lt;/a&gt; took home almost $1.25 million dollars. Other notable scores include &lt;a href="w%3AVijay%20Singh"&gt;Vijay Singh&lt;/a&gt; at a tie for 6th at 8 over, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Duval"&gt;David Duval&lt;/a&gt; making a comeback at a tie for 16th place at 11 over, &lt;a href="w%3AAdam%20Scott"&gt;Adam Scott&lt;/a&gt; at a tie for 21st at 12 over and &lt;a href="w%3AErnie%20Els"&gt;Ernie Els&lt;/a&gt; tying for 26th at 13 over.

Defending champion &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Campbell"&gt;Michael Campbell&lt;/a&gt; of New Zealand, &lt;a href="w%3ARetief%20Goosen"&gt;Retief Goosen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ATiger%20Woods"&gt;Tiger Woods&lt;/a&gt; all missed the cut in the hardest U.S. Open in a long time - the worst Open on record was also at Winged Foot in 1974, where winner Hale Irwin shot 7 over. This was Tiger's first tournament since his father's death on May 9, although he said in a press conference that there was no excuse for his awful playing. Woods said of his poor playing, "I don't care if you had what transpired in my life of recent or not, but poor execution is never going to feel very good."

Ogilvy came in to the clubhouse, almost sure of his second place. But Phil Mickelson's double bogey at the 18th hole gave Ogilvy a boost in the leaderboard, bringing him to first. He said later, "I thought, Make this and come in second in the Open on your own. I never thought Phil would make bogey at the last. He ended up making double, and it's got to be a hard one to swallow for Phil, because he's obviously been the outstanding player at majors in the last eight or nine months." Mickelson only hit 2 out of 14 fairways on Sunday and 24 out of 56 total. He managed to scramble out in the first three rounds, but the course fought back on Sunday. His tee shot at the final hole went far left. He played the shot very aggressively and ended up hitting a tree and putting the ball only 25 yards farther. It just got worse from there for Mickelson. His third shot ended up buried in the left greenside bunker. His fourth went back over the green and into the rough. He chipped out and one-putted for the catastrophic double bogey that cost him the championship. 

Ogilvy didn't win purely by Mickelson's double bogey, though. He saved par on the 17th with a chip-in from the rough, and overcame a few tough shots to save par at the 18th. His last two US Opens resulted in a missed cut in 2003 at a tie for 28th last year. His win this year at the &lt;a href="w%3AWGC-Accenture%20Match%20Play%20Championship"&gt;WGC Accenture Match Play Championship&lt;/a&gt; set him up for the first Australian major win since Steve Elkington at the 1995 PGA Championship. 

Besides Mickelson, there are quite a few other contenders who are not going to forget today - or the vicious 18th hole - for a while. Colin Montgomerie made a remarkable comeback after a poor round yesterday, holing a 75-footer for birdie at the 17th hole. His second shot, from 172 yards away in the fairway, went far right into a very deep cut of rough. His third shot went 40 feet past the hole. He put his par putt 10 feet from the hole, missed that putt, and went on to also make double bogey. Jim Furyk hit a bunker shot to 5 feet on the 18th, but two-putted and came up one stroke short of Oglivy. &lt;a href="w%3APadraig%20Harrington"&gt;Padraig Harrington&lt;/a&gt;, who ended up in sole fifth at 7 over, went bogey-free for 15 holes and bogeyed the last three to fall out of contention. And of course, there's &lt;a href="w%3AKenneth%20Ferrie"&gt;Kenneth Ferrie&lt;/a&gt;, who started the day out tied with Mickelson for the lead. He just crashed the whole day, making 6 bogeys and no birdies to fall to a tie for 6th at 8 over.

A summary? The Mickelslam is no more, and another newcomer has made his statement at the 2006 US Open. No one can deny that Winged Foot has provided yet again a challenge that has beaten even the best of players.

2000 Cantabrians are still without power a week after a huge snowstorm struck and took out the electricity in mid and south &lt;a href="w%3ACanterbury%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;.

Sunday &lt;a href="w%3AJune%2018"&gt;June 18&lt;/a&gt; came and brought more snow to mid and south Canterbury, but just a minuscule amount compared to last weeks.

Civil Defence says "It is keeping an eye on the situation, and welfare work is continuing to make sure everyone is coping. Iroquois helicopters are reportedly on standby at Wigram Air Base if needed,"

Chief executive of Orion (a power company) Roger Sutton says, "Another 20 or 30 homes are without power in the Lake Coleridge area."

Repair crews were taken out of duty on Sunday because the snow got too deep, but should be back on the job Monday June 19.

&lt;a href="w%3ANZ%20Post"&gt;NZ Post&lt;/a&gt; also reports that they have had to cancel deliveries to some &lt;a href="w%3ADunedin"&gt;Dunedin&lt;/a&gt; suburbs because it got too icy. NZ Post says that deliveries will continue on Tuesday June 20 or if the weather clears up before that.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMetService"&gt;MetService&lt;/a&gt; has put severe weather warnings for some of the central cities of the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Island"&gt;North Island&lt;/a&gt;.

Barry Stratton, Transit, says that all roads are open in the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Island"&gt;South Island&lt;/a&gt;, but some will have delays.

Last year's survey by the firm indicated that the area has about 90 million tonnes of &lt;a href="w%3ANiobium"&gt;Niobium&lt;/a&gt;. The company would use open cast method, as most of the mineral is found near the surface.

Well worked moves led to a goal in each half from Alexander Frei and Tranquillo Barnetta.

Despite the relative youth of an outfield of twenty-somethings, and 21-year-old center-back Philippe Senderos who helped shut out the Togolese, the Swiss appeared to be the more organised team.

Togo were lively going forward and individual acts of skill tested the Swiss defence who could not always close down quickly enough. A statistic that showed the game was a bit more even than the scoreline, Togo had seven shots on target to Switzerland's nine.

Switzerland had to soak up a good deal of Togoese pressure and Otto Pfister's side were unfortunate not to have scored.

In the first period Tomas Dossevi had time and space but from 15 yards out he chose to shoot first time and the ball skewed badly wide. Emmanuel Adebayor then ran at speed and wrong-footed a Swiss defender. He fell but Carlos Amarillo declined the penalty appeal.

On the day when the Swiss did go forward they arguably were more ably assisted by a midfield which gave their attack more potency. Though ball possession was split down the middle the Swiss managed a third more shots at goal than the Togolese. This was partly due to 21-year-old right-midfield Barnetta who had a goal and an assist in the game.

The first goal was scored on 17 minutes. Ludovic Magnan sprayed a long ball to the far post, Barnetta intelligently knocked it into the path of Alexander Frei, and the striker, in the center of goal, could not miss from 5 yards.

Two minutes from time Barnetta was rewarded with a goal; he ran on to a pass and drove low across goal. The ball cannoned in off Kossi Agassa's right post.

The result put Switzerland on four points with at least a chance of qualifying for the knock-out stage of the World Cup if they did not lose to Korea Republic in their last Group G game, and certain qualification if they won.

Pro-&lt;a href="w%3Awhaling"&gt;whaling&lt;/a&gt; countries within the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Whaling%20Commission"&gt;International Whaling Commission&lt;/a&gt; celebrated yesterday after a resolution was passed which stated that the commission's 20-year moratorium on commercial whaling is "no longer necessary" and which went on to blame whales for depleting fish stocks. 33 countries voted in favour of the resolution, with 32 voting against, and &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; abstaining. The vote is considered a victory for &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, which has long argued for a return to commercial whaling, and has been 'recruiting' sympathetic nations to join the IWC in order to bolster its vote.

The vote does not directly enable a return to commercial whaling, as that would require a three quarters majority, but is significant in being the first time that a major vote at the IWC has sided with the pro-whaling nations in two decades.

Previous votes during the conference had been narrowly won by the anti-whaling group of countries, including a motion to introduce secret ballots, to introduce an exemption allowing Japanese coastal communities to whale, the elimination of a &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Ocean"&gt;Southern Ocean&lt;/a&gt; whale sanctuary and a block on the IWC discussing dolphins and porpoises.

Commercial whaling has been banned under the IWC moratorium since &lt;a href="w%3A1986"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;, but some whaling has been able to continue. Japan and &lt;a href="w%3AIceland"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt; have hunted a number of Minke whales every year under an exemption for 'scientific whaling'. &lt;a href="w%3ANorway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt; flat out refused to accept the original ban. The stated aims of scientific whaling are to examine the stomach contents of captured whales, in order to examine the whale ecosystem and the effect that whales may have on fish stocks. However, the whale meat from scientific whaling catches is usually sold commercially in order to fund the research. Some observers, including scientists from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, have accused Japan and Iceland of simply using scientific whaling as a legal loophole. Other whaling allowed under the IWC moratorium includes subsistence whaling by &lt;a href="w%3Aaboriginal"&gt;aboriginal&lt;/a&gt; groups.
&lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; activist Adele blogged the news from their &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt; office expressing reservations over the legitimacy of the vote saying it would "change little or nothing" as previous votes had already been passed in favour of the anti-whaling group of countries. Mike Townsley from Greenpeace International said, "Greenpeace is disgusted that any member of the IWC would seek to promote whaling based upon the false notion that whales consume so much fish that they are a threat to food security for coastal nations". He added that the declaration was more like a whaler's "wish list, peddling predictable and well-rehearsed rhetoric". 

A paragraph within the declaration passed at the IWC meeting suggested that a number of international NGOs with self-interest campaigns were using threats in an attempt to direct government policy "on matters of sovereign rights related to the use of resources for food security and national development". In response, Greenpeace says they were dedicated to the principles of "peaceful protests", adding that the threat was to the world's whales. They stated that they had "delayed, disrupted and documented hunts in the Southern Ocean" in order to defend the whales, however.

&lt;a href="w%3ADr.%20Joth%20Singh"&gt;Dr. Joth Singh&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Fund%20for%20Animal%20Welfare"&gt;International Fund for Animal Welfare&lt;/a&gt; (IFAW) said, "after losing on every single proposal they brought to this meeting, the whaling countries and their supporters cooked up a non-binding statement, sprang it on the commission and pushed it to a vote - they want to kill whales, and they're willing to kill the Commission to do it." He added that they were concerned, but not disheartened by the news.

Japanese commissioner, Mr &lt;a href="w%3AMinoru%20Morimoto"&gt;Minoru Morimoto&lt;/a&gt;, praised the winning vote and said the declaration "added weight to Japan's proposal to normalize the IWC and bring it back to its original function of managing and regulating sustainable commercial whaling."

The IWC has historically always voted against pro-whaling motions by a majority of around ten votes, but the number of members favoring a return to commercial whaling has increased in recent years, with Japan persuading several new countries to join the IWC, including many that have never done any whaling at all. As Japan has given aid to some of these new countries, some observers have accused it of buying votes.

&lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; prosecutors have asked a judge to indict a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; soldier for fatally shooting Italian intelligence officer &lt;a href="w%3ANicola%20Calipari"&gt;Nicola Calipari&lt;/a&gt; at a roadblock in Iraq a year ago. The shooting occurred when Calipari was escorting the Italian journalist &lt;a href="w%3AGiuliana%20Sgrena"&gt;Giuliana Sgrena&lt;/a&gt; on her way to Baghdad airport. When their car came under fire from U.S. Marines at a roadblock, Calipari was fatally shot while trying to shield Sgrena, who was only lightly wounded in the incident.

The circumstances of the shooting are a matter of dispute between Italy and the United States. The U.S. military claims that the car was approaching the checkpoint at high speed, when the troops attempted to signal the car with light signals, aiming a green laser at the windshield and warning shots. When the car failed to slow down, the soldiers shot into the engine of the car.

The Italian government claims that there were no warning signs prior to the shootings. They contest that the car was speeding and that it accelerated after the first round of fire. Moreover, they allege that a proper inquiry into the case was impossible since the vehicle was removed and army logs destroyed shortly after the incident.

Italian prosecutors are arguing that the shooting was a "political murder" as Calipari was a civil servant and the shooting damaged Italy's interests. In Italy, murder suspects cannot be tried in absentia unless the murder has political connotations. It is expected to take at least two months for a judge to rule on the indictment request.

The U.S. Embassy in Rome declined to comment.

The win was Ukraine's first in the World Cup finals.

Oleg Blokhin's team were aggressive from the start and their first World Cup goal was scored from a corner after just four minutes. Andriy Rusol ran to the near post and met Maxim Kalinichenko's hard spun cross with his knee. 

Ukraine, whose slick passes and fast runs frequently pulled the Saudi Arabia defense out of position, could have been four goals up by half time.

In one instance, from another Kalinichenko corner Andriy Shevchenko had a powerful header cleared off the line by Ahmed Dokhi. 

Sehiy Rebrov, in acres of space, scored the second from 30 yards; his strong shot dipped across Mabrouk Zaid, who slipped in a vain attempt to reach it.

The second period began as the first had; Ukraine scored early. Kalinchenko provided another beautiful cross which Shevchenko guided toward the far post with his forehead.

Shevchenko surged down left wing and set up the fourth goal on 83 minutes. Into the penalty area, Shevchenko committed the keeper and then gave the perfect ball to Kalinchenko who passed it into the roof of the net.

Though ball possession was equal the telling statistic was the shot total. Ukraine had 19 shots; nine on target. Saudi Arabia had six shots; none on target.

There also were 49 free kicks in the match which might be partly due to the rain over the AOL Arena which made the pitch slipperly. Ukraine committed 25 of the fouls and got three of six yellow cards.

It was not a rigourous test for the East European side but they now had three points which meant a draw in their next game against Tunisia would definitely send them into the round of sixteen if Tunisia did not win against Spain, who also played Monday. The result against Ukraine would almost certainly put Paqueta's Saudi Arabia out of the World Cup.

After just eight minutes before which Spain had appeared to have left off from their form that destroyed Ukraine Zied Jaizi attacked into the Spanish box. His strong run ended with the ball prodded to Jaouhar Mnari. The Tunisian number 12's shot was saved by Iker Casillas but he passed the rebound into the turf and over the keeper.

Spain were behind. And then it started to rain hard.

For 70 minutes Spain attacked and failed to beat the Tunisian keeper Ali Boumnijel. While he made seven saves the wet conditions made holding the football hard and Boumnijel faced a lot of shots. 

In the first period crosses and corner kicks met heads in the Tunisian box but none of the succession of different foreheads found the target. On 43 minutes Xabi Alonso went closest: his header from a corner was cleared off the line by Anis Ayari. 

As the clock ticked it seemed Spain's short passing game was the longest route to goal.

In the end Luis Aragones's three substitutions can be said to have unlocked the Tunisian defence. On 71 minutes the floodgates opened like the storm clouds had in the Gottlieb Daimler Stadion.

Joaquin ran down the right and passed to Cesc Fabregas at the top of the area. Fabregas's first time shot was not particularly powerful but Boumnijel gave up a rebound and in followed Raul. 1-1.

For his second assist Fabregas then played in Fernando Torres who rounded the keeper for the game winner.

On 90 minutes Raul chipped to the far post for Torres who then appeared to be tugged to the floor. The young Athletico Madrid striker scored low under the keeper from the spot.

Torres, who with three goals in two matches became the top scorer at the Fifa World Cup, could have had two more goals in the final minutes from surges through the Tunisian defence. In the first instance the keeper saved well and in the second Torres blasted over.

The goals though they came late created a scoreline that reflected Spainish dominance of the game. They outshot their opponents by 20 and had 11 more corner kicks. Tunisian players accrued six yellow cards in their attempt to hold back Aragones's side who also hogged 66 per cent of possession.

The result meant Spain were through to the round of sixteen of the Fifa World Cup and that Tunisia had to beat Ukraine in their third and final match of Group H if they wanted to join them there.

British &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Secretary"&gt;Home Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reid%20%28UK%20politician%29"&gt;John Reid&lt;/a&gt; has met criticism from several quarters for his suggestion that the UK should adopt a law allowing the public naming of known paedophiles.

The United States has legislation known as '&lt;a href="w%3AMegan%27s%20Law"&gt;Megan's Law&lt;/a&gt;' which Reid has suggested should be adopted. Such a law would allow concerned parents to access information regarding paedophiles in their area. &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Sutcliffe"&gt;Gerry Sutcliffe&lt;/a&gt;, a Home Office Minister, has been sent to the US to investigate whether a similar system could be introduced.

A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a statement on comments Reid made over the weekend, "the important thing and the difficult thing in this is to get the balance right between, on the one hand, protecting the public and giving the public as much information as possible, and on the other making sure that you don't have vigilantes".

The spokesman denied that there were immediate plans to adopt Megan's Law, "What's important is that Gerry Sutcliffe goes to the US and looks at how they do things there. We are not planning immediately to import US laws but we do need to consider how these operate".

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; has accused &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; of creating a rift between Pacific Countries. She accuses Japan of influencing the voting of some member nations of the Pacific Island Forum at the International Whaling Commission by supplying vast amounts of aid to certain small pacific nations. 

New Zealand provides a total of $23 million a year in aid to three of the six Pacific nations – Kiribati, the Solomons, and Tuvalu. Japan pledged approximately 45 billion yen (NZ $633 million) in aid for all Pacific nations. New Zealand's annual budget for aiding pacific nations on the other hand totals merely NZ $173 million.

Miss Clark is quoted as saying "One would hope that over time Japan might reflect on the damage this is doing to [its] relationships around the world" and that it "sprayed a lot of money around" to garner support.

The Prime Minister has ruled out any retaliation against the islands, saying it would not affect any future aid funding.

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; yesterday discussed as part of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrivate%20Member%27s%20Bill"&gt;private Member's business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a motion moved by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Johnson"&gt;Michael Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Australian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Ryan"&gt;Division of Ryan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) that sought to affirm and "celebrate" support for marriage "between a man and a woman" and called on the Government to "enact policies that promote and strengthen marriage".

<h2>Speeches</h2>
Johnson discussed the earlier &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASame-sex%20marriage%20in%20Australia"&gt;amendment to the Australian Marriage Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; passed in 2004 that effectively removed the possibility for &lt;a href="same-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;, and continued that the failed efforts of the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt; (ACT) to provide for civil unions within that state was a matter for "grave alarm". Johnson then argued against same-sex marriage saying that "Children come from marriage and families stem from marriage". Johnson criticized the earlier ACT legislation that provided for the dissolution of civil unions by letter to the ACT registrar, stating, "Marriage is a lifelong commitment". However, Johnson went on to discuss the breakdown of marriage and the status of single parents to argue, "surely we all agree that the best environment for the rearing of children is one that has both a mother and a father".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Hayes"&gt;Chris Hayes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Werriwa"&gt;Division of Werriwa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), took a different stance in speaking to the motion, by discussing how the Government's new industrial relation legislation, &lt;a href="WorkChoices"&gt;WorkChoices&lt;/a&gt;, would affect the balancing of work and family life, and called for industrial legislation that would "support families into the future". 
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20May"&gt;Margaret May&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Liberal, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20McPherson"&gt;Division of McPherson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), the seconder of the motion, recommenced arguing against same-sex marriage, calling it a "social experiment", and went on to state, "Same sex relationships, or, indeed, unions should not have the same status as a marriage between a man and a woman". May concluded her speech by calling for support to "services to assist children, young people and adults and to continue sustaining safe, supportive and nurturing family relationships".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Murphy"&gt;John Murphy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Lowe"&gt;Division of Lowe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) also affirmed support for heterosexual marriage, by stating, "Marriage is a natural bond between man and woman, recognized in the vast majority of cultures, whether Christian or otherwise", and added, "nature ordains the natural procreative function of man and woman". Murphy also addressed the amendments to the Marriage Act, saying, "this definition is the only valid recognition of our civil laws, which correctly reflects the natural law and moral law", adding, "You do not even have to believe in anything to draw that conclusion." Murphy however stated in conclusion of his speech, "we are all let down by those who … mask their support for marriage and who employ it as a weapon to attack the many other relationships in our society. Such attacks are unconscionable, unnecessary and unjustified."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ferguson"&gt;Michael Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Liberal, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Bass"&gt;Division of Bass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) reiterated points raised by those before him, but also mentioned the issue of discrimination, saying, "there is different treatment under the law for different relationships. But this is not about dicscrimination against the indivdual and it is not designed to be." Ferguson continued to say, "As individual people, homosexual men and women have exactly the same legal rights as you or I".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACraig%20Emerson"&gt;Craig Emerson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Labor, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Rankin"&gt;Division of Rankin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) quoted a House Committee report ♡❤To have and to hold -- strategies to strengthen marriage and relationships♡❤, saying that the report was bipartisan and added, "the issue of marriage does enjoy bipartisan support in this parliament", and reiterated Labor's support for the Marriage Amendment, which excluded the possibility for same-sex marriage. Emerson concluded his remarks by again tying the impact of the WorkChoices to family life.

<h2>Further debate</h2>
No other members of parliament spoke against or criticised the motion before debate was interrupted.

Interestingly, the &lt;a href="Australian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; is yet to debate a motion moved by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in order to repeal the Marriage Amendment discussed and institute same-sex marriage. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are also supportive of same-sex marriage, but neither of these parties hold seats in the House.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20police"&gt;New Zealand police&lt;/a&gt; who are investigating the deaths of male twin babies say that they suffered from serious head injuries.

The two babies were named Chris Kahui and Cru Kahui. They lived in a auckland house with 12 family members. &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Department%20of%20Child%2C%20Youth%20and%20Family%20Services"&gt;Child, Youth and Family&lt;/a&gt; have removed two other children living at the &lt;a href="w%3AMangere"&gt;Mangere&lt;/a&gt; home.

The police are investigating a double homicide after the two babies were taken off life support at Starship Hospital, &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;. The twins were admitted to Starship on Tuesday June 13. At the time of admission they both suffered from head injuries and one suffered from a broken thigh.

A &lt;a href="w%3Apost-mortem"&gt;post-mortem&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the babies had died from numerous injuries and brain damage, however police cannot tell if any of the injuries were historical.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; is ranked third for the rate of child murder in the &lt;a href="w%3AOECD"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)&lt;/a&gt;.

UK Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; is set to give the go-ahead for an order of two government jets. One jet is likely to contain 70 seats, whilst the other will be smaller with around 15 seats. Previously the Prime Minister has chartered aircraft or used a royal plane. Both planes would be second hand and not bought outright but leased on a long-term contract.

Government departments, as well as the royal family, who will have first priority, will be able to use the jets, but will have to pay for the full cost of travel. 

The story was first reported by BBC correspondent James Hardy, and comes out of a study into ministerial travel costs.

The nicknames 'Blair Force One' and 'Blair Force Two' have already begun to stick. American presidents have traditionally used a special jet called '&lt;a href="w%3AAir%20Force%20One"&gt;Air Force One&lt;/a&gt;'.

&lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt; is planning to sell full-length feature films for download via the online &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes%20Music%20Store"&gt;iTunes Music Store&lt;/a&gt;. The store currently sells digital music tracks, and more recently has begun to sell TV episodes.

Apple executives are in negotiations with film studios to arrange the deal and settle on pricing structures. It is expected that films will retail for around $9.99 US dollars, although some studios are reported to want to set a higher price.

iTunes is currently by the biggest online retailer of digital music, with its software tightly integrated with the popular &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; line of products. Newer versions of the iPod include a colour screen capable of displaying videos, and so consumers could watch the films on the devices, but it is not yet clear how many people will want to do this.

Apple CEO &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; is also the largest single shareholder of &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Walt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;, which now owns animation studio &lt;a href="w%3APixar"&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt;, however he could end up playing a wider role within the film industry if iTunes becomes the dominant online distributor.

A full-length TV movie, '&lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20School%20Musical"&gt;High School Musical&lt;/a&gt;' from Disney, is already available on iTunes, suggesting that the technical infrastructure is already in place.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; government has announced its support for &lt;a href="w%3AShashi%20Tharoor"&gt;Shashi Tharoor&lt;/a&gt;'s candidature to the post of the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Secretary%20General"&gt;Secretary General&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;. Tharoor is a writer, journalist and is currently the Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information of the UN. Arguably the most powerful multilateral position in the world, the author will have his work cut out in trying to win broad based support for his candidature from the developed world.

Tharoor met the Prime Minister and President of India, who have expressed their solidarity and whole hearted support to his campaign. It is generally understood that Mr. Tharoor has the blessings of the incumbent &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he has shared a long and fruitful working relationship.

&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; have threatened to nominate their own candidate, leading to speculation that the Asian vote may be fragmented. However, it remains to be seen if these threats are translated into action.

<h1>Interview with BBC Creative Archive project leader</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Interview%20with%20BBC%20Creative%20Archive%20project%20leader&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Archive%20Licence"&gt;Creative Archive&lt;/a&gt; project is a &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; led initiative which aims to make archive audio and video footage available to be freely downloaded, distributed, and ‘remixed’. The project is still in a pilot stage, and is only available to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; residents, but the long-term future of the project could have a major impact on the way audiences interact with BBC content.

The project is partly inspired by the &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; movements, and also by a general move within the BBC to be more open with its assets. Additionally, educational audiences such as schools have expressed an interest in using BBC content within the classroom, both to watch and to create multimedia content from.

So far, clips made available under the licence have included archive news footage, nature documentary footage, and video clips content designed for educational uses. “It’s done very well with the audiences we’ve directed them towards – heavy BBC users,” says Paul Gerhardt, project leader. Users downloading the clips are also prompted to fill in a questionnaire, and so far 10-15% of people seem to be doing something with the material, although the BBC can’t be sure what exactly that is.

One of the biggest limitations within the licence as it currently stands during the pilot scheme is that the material is only available for use by people resident in the UK. The BBC’s Creative Archive sites use ‘geo-IP filtering’ to limit downloads to the UK, but there is some confusion over whether people who create their own content using the material can upload their creations to their own websites. A question within the &lt;a href="w%3AFAQ"&gt;FAQs&lt;/a&gt; for one of the more recent selections of clips suggests that this isn’t possible, saying “during this pilot phase material released under the terms of the Creative Archive Licence cannot be used outside the UK - therefore, unless a website has its use restricted to the UK only, content from the 'Regions on Film' archive cannot be published on it.”

“We want people to make full use of this content, whether they cut and paste it or whether they share it, and we completely accept that we’ve got a bit of a contradiction at the moment by saying UK-only and yet encouraging people to put it on their sites to share it with others, because you can’t expect people to have geo-IP restriction technology,” admits Mr Gerhardt. “We’re thinking hard about how to deal with this after the pilot – at the moment it’s quite likely that we’re probably going to need to find a distribution partner outside of the UK, so that if you’re outside of the UK you’ve got roughly the same experience as in the UK, but the content could be surrounded by sponsorship messages or advertising or whatever. Once we’ve done that then leakage from one to the other won’t really matter very much.”

The Creative Archive project has not been without critics from the commercial sector, worried that the BBC giving away their content for free would make it difficult for them to be able to make money from their own content. The BBC has explained to some of the commercial players that the content would be limited during the pilot, would not be available in broadcast quality, and that watermarking technologies would be trialled so that content could be recognised when it crops up elsewhere. The BBC is also investigating a business model for the future where there would be a “close relationship between public access to low-resolution content and a click through to monetising that content if you want to buy a high-resolution version”. People who want to play around with the material might discover they have a talent and then find they need to get a commercial license to use it properly, Mr Gerhardt explains, and the project wants to make it easy for this to happen.

Before the project can go ahead with the full scale launch, it will have to go through a ‘public value test’ to assess its overall impact on the marketplace, and commercial media companies will have a chance to input at this point.

For ease in clearing the rights, all of the content available under the pilot project is factual, but in the future the project could include drama and entertainment content. The BBC may also, in the future, work the Creative Archive licences into the commissioning process for new programmes. “This raises some really interesting ideas – if you have a documentary series, you could use the Creative Archive to release the longer form footage, for instance – that would create a digital legacy of that documentary series,” Mr Gerhardt explains. “The other interesting thought in the longer term would be for the BBC, or another broadcaster, to contribute to a digital pool of archive material on a theme, and then invite people to assemble their own content out of that. We could end up broadcasting both the BBC professionally produced programme accompanied by other programmes that other people had made out of the same material.”

One of the ways that the Creative Archive licence differs from the other ‘&lt;a href="w%3Acopyleft"&gt;copyleft&lt;/a&gt;’ licences like Creative Commons, aside from the UK-only limitation, is that the licence currently allows the BBC to update and modify the licence, which may worry those using the licence that their rights could suddenly become more restricted. “The licence at the moment is a draft, and we’ve given warning that we may well improve it, but we wouldn’t do that more than once or twice. The ambition is that by the time we scale up to the full service we would have a fixed licence that everyone was comfortable with, and it wouldn’t change after that.”

“The ambition is to think about creating a single portal where people can search and see what stuff is out there under the same licence terms, from a range of different suppliers. The idea is that if we can create something compelling like that, we will attract other archives in the UK to contribute their material, so we’d be aggregating quite a large quantity.”

The Creative Archive project has captured the interest of many Internet users, who are growing increasingly, used the idea of being able to ‘remix’ technologies and content. Some groups have been frustrated with the speed at which the project is developing though, and with some of the restrictions imposed in the licence. An open letter to the BBC urges the dropping of the UK-only limitation, the use of ‘open formats’, and to allow the material to be usable commercially. 

Mr Gerhardt has publicly welcomed debate of the licence, but makes it clear to me that the whole BBC archive will never all be available under the Creative Archive terms. “We will make all our archive available, under different terms, over the next five to ten years, at a pace to be determined. There would be three modes in which people access it – some of the content would only be available commercially, for the first five year or so after broadcast, say. The second route is through a ‘view again’ strategy where you can view the programmes, but they’d be &lt;a href="w%3ADRM"&gt;DRM&lt;/a&gt;-restricted. And the third mode is Creative Archive. Over time, programmes would move from one mode to another, with some programmes going straight to the Creative Archive after broadcast.”

Others who disagree with the ‘UK-only’ restriction within the licence include &lt;a href="w%3ASuw%20Charman"&gt;Suw Charman&lt;/a&gt;, from the Open Rights Group, who has said “it doesn't make sense in a world where information moves between continents in seconds, and where it is difficult for the average user to exclude visitors based on geography.” On the project generally, though, she said “I think that it is a good step along the way to a more open attitude towards content. It is a toe in the water, which is far preferable to the attitude of most of the industry players, who are simply burying their heads in the sand and hoping that lawsuits and lobbying for new legislation will bolster their out-dated business plan.”

Other organisations currently participating in the Creative Archive scheme include the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Film%20Institute"&gt;British Film Institute&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AOpen%20University"&gt;Open University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATeachers%27%20TV"&gt;Teachers' TV&lt;/a&gt;. Two artists have been awarded scholarships to create artworks using BBC archive material, and &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%201"&gt;BBC Radio 1&lt;/a&gt; has held a competition asking people to use the footage in creative ways as backing visuals to music. The process of making the BBC’s archive material fully available may be a long one, but it could end up changing the way that people interact with the UK’s public service broadcaster.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that its famous &lt;a href="w%3ATop%20of%20the%20Pops"&gt;Top of the Pops&lt;/a&gt; music programme is to be axed this summer, after &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;Media Guardian&lt;/a&gt; broke the news. The programme began on New Year's Day in 1964 and has featured most of the top bands and artists ever since.

The last show will be on July 30, 2006.

The Controller of &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Two"&gt;BBC Two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARoly%20Keating"&gt;Roly Keating&lt;/a&gt;, said "I've really enjoyed the last year that Top of the Pops has transmitted on BBC Two and the team did a sterling job in revitalising the format for our audience, but we all recognise that the time has come to move on."

The Germans got goals from Miroslav Klose, whose two tallies put him top of the Fifa World Cup scorers chart with four goals, and Lukas Podolski, his first at the competition.

Luis Suarez's side had 57 per cent of ball possession but Jens Lehmann had to make just two saves from Edison Mendez's and Edwin Tenorio's 35 yard efforts.

After the third goal what there was of a contest ended. This was partly because both sides had already achieved qualification through to the round of sixteen and wanted to conserve energy. 

It also was 27 degrees Celsius in the Olympiastadion and together with the 65 per cent humidity playing at a fast pace for a long time was difficult.

The first goal came on three minutes. Bastian Schweinsteiger brought down a cross level with goal and cut it back to Klose. The Polish born striker finished neatly across Cristian Mora from the edge of the six yard box.

Ecuador were no big threat going forward and had rested Carlos Tenorio, Augustin Delgado and Ivan Hurtado, the captain, for the game. Marlon Ayovi was Ecuador's captain against Germany.

Germany's second was set up by Michael Ballack. His brilliant chip surprised two Ecuador defenders and Klose stole in between them and before the advancing Mora to score.

In the second half there was no hurry to the German game, Ecuador had much of the possession, but Klinsmann's team looked a constant threat on the break. On one such fast attack Bernd Schnieder on the right wing crossed low for Podolski who slid in and tipped the ball toward the far post.

Germany and Ecuador had to wait on the outcome of the Group B match between Sweden and England to know their next opponents. The winner of Group A would play the runner-up in Group B and ♡❤vice versa♡❤.

The result of the match gave Poland three points but they did not qualify for the next round of the Fifa World Cup as Ecuador had six and Germany nine. Costa Rica left the 2006 World Cup without a victory in three games.

Though the pace of the game was rather slow in the heat the outcome did seem to matter to the two teams who both wanted a World Cup win.

Referee Shamsul Maidin produced his yellow card ten times; five for each side, which was to that date the highest caution tally of the tournament.

Alexandre Guimaraes's Central Americans had the best start with a goal from a freekick. Ronald Gomez fired hard and low through the wall and it somehow went between an off-balanced Artur Boruc's legs.

Jose Porras in the Costa Rica goal then helped Poland to an equaliser. Porras missed at the near post a corner Maciej Zurawski clipped to the far post. Polish defender Bartosz Bosacki notched his first international goal off the underside of the crossbar.

Another set-piece in the second half led to the winner for Bosacki. Jacek Krzynowek delivered from another corner, again to Bosacki, who headed beyond Porras.

Seconds from time England looked likely to win against a team they had not beaten since 1968. But a long throw from the Swedish left was missed by Sol Campbell and Henrik Larson got a touch that crawled into the far corner of Paul Robinson's net. 

For England, who needed at least a draw to top Group B and play Ecuador in the round of sixteen, the drama began after two minutes. Striker Michael Owen fell to the floor unchallenged apparently badly injured. Owen rolled off the pitch and was substituted with Peter Crouch. Later it was confirmed Owen returned to England and would not play again at the 2006 World Cup.

Sweden pressured an unsettled England early on with aerial balls, from corners especially; these tactics would provide two goals in the second half for the Scandinavians.

England had 55 per cent of ball play in the game and were most dominant before half time. 

Sven-Göran Eriksson's side had the lead on 33 minutes. Joe Cole on England's left took a clearance on his chest 35 yards from goal. Cole volleyed the ball first time on a high dipping trajectory and a scrambling Andreas Isaksson could only paddle it in off the post.

Joe Cole created the second goal for Steven Gerrard on 85 minutes with a chip to the far post that Gerrard headed powerfully on target. Joe Cole also earned seven fouls for his side, two of which got Swedish players cautioned.

Joe Cole aside, Sven-Göran Eriksson's England might have been fortunate to had gone one goal up with five minutes to go as Sweden had many chances in the second half.

The chance Sweden converted to make it 1-1 came on 51 minutes from one of Sweden's 12 corner kicks. Marcus Allbäck, standing on the left edge of the six yard box, flicked Tobias Linderoth's cross with his head and it looped behind him over the defence and in the net.

An almost identical corner brought a reaction save on to the crossbar from England's Robinson. Sweden captain Olof Melberg then hit the crossbar with an effort. From yet another dangerous Linderoth corner Gerrard cleared the ball off the England goalline.

Given the Swedish pressure the last minute equaliser perhaps created a fair reflection of the game. It also seemed to expose in the Group B winners a weakness defending high balls. Sweden play the winner of Group A, Germany, in the next phase of the Fifa World Cup.

Paraguay edged the game from start to finish and got a goal in each half.

Trinidad and Tobago could manage just two shots to trouble Aldo Bobadilla in the Paraguay net. Kelvin Jack, who started his first Fifa World Cup game, made seven saves.

After 25 minutes Jack was a bystander when Roberto Acuna's freekick was driven hard into the box. Jack's central defender Brent Sancho inadvertently directed the ball goalbound with his head.

The goal that sealed the game for the South Amercians was scored six minutes from time by Nelson Cuevas after he had exchanged passes with Roque Santa Cruz.
The game was notable for being the last appearance for Carlos Gamarra, 35, for his national side. He had played 110 games for Paraguay.

After three games the Group B table was topped by England with seven points and then Sweden with five points with Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago going out of the competition.

New Zealand farmers have won a key victory in &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, with MPs voting to exempt &lt;a href="w%3AHerding%20dog"&gt;Working farm dogs&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3AMicrochip%20implant%20%28animal%29"&gt;microchipping&lt;/a&gt; legislation, passing 61:60.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederated%20Farmers"&gt;Federated Farmers&lt;/a&gt; debated the law for a long time, saying that the cost of microchipping all their dogs will be a huge cost and an inconvenience. Under previous legislation, all newly registered dogs were to have identification microchips embedded by July 1. The microchips in dogs are for owner identification, in case of attacks on humans. This law was introduced when Carolina Anderson, 7-year-old, was attacked in 2003.

Parliament has been debating several proposed amendments to the Local Government Law Reform bill, which aimed to change the microchipping requirement.

Blogger David Farrar says "It is very messy for the Government to lose the vote after piling so much pressure on." In the end only Labour, Progressive plus New Zealand First voted for it.

The &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20of%20Aotearoa%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Green party&lt;/a&gt; split votes (rare for a party). Four Greens MPs voted for the farm dog exemption and two against. 

The four Green MPs were - Sue Bradford, Keith Locke, Sue Kedgley and Nandor Tanczos. The Greens had previously proposed that only dangerous dogs should be microchipped.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; announced on Tuesday that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra"&gt;Old Parliament House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="Canberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; has been heritage listed. It is the 31st entry on the National Heritage List.

The listing acknowledges the role the building has in shaping Australia's culture and protects it from being modified in any way which could affect its historic value.

Old Parliament House served as the home of &lt;a href="Australian%20Parliament"&gt;Australia's parliament&lt;/a&gt; from 1927 until 1988, when it was relocated to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20House%2C%20Canberra"&gt;present&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; parliament house. From 1901-1927, parliament met in &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20House%2C%20Melbourne"&gt;Victorian Parliament House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (the state parliament was relocated for 26 years). Before being known as Old Parliament House, the building was known as Provisional Parliament House - as it was intended to be used for 50 years before a permanent building could be built.

In the 61 years the building was used as the seat of parliament, the government changed only seven times, and several new political parties were formed (the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Anti-Communist Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ).

Mr Howard said the building played an important part in Australia's political history. "Old Parliament House will always be an important part of our political history with its rich collection of original furniture, art and memorabilia helping to illustrate the story of Australia's political customs and functions," he said.

According to Mr Howard, the National Heritage List lists sites which have helped shape the country. "The National Heritage List contains places that have played an important role in the development of our nation, such as Captain Cook’s landing place in &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, Port Arthur in &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; and the Australian War Memorial in Canberra," said the Prime Minister.

The building currently houses Australia's National Portrait Gallery, and serves as a venue for receptions and exhbitions.

Around 17,000 people converged on the ancient monument of &lt;a href="w%3AStonehenge"&gt;Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt; this morning to celebrate the northern hemisphere's &lt;a href="w%3ASummer%20solstice"&gt;summer solstice&lt;/a&gt;. Despite a night of torrential rain, spirits were high as the sun rose over the horizon, though clouds blocked out the dawn for much of the event.

The summer solstice is the longest day of the year, having the greatest length of time between dawn and dusk. Stonehenge is constructed so that on the dawn of the solstice, the sun appears in the centre of one of the stone structures. Pagan rituals have taken place at this time every year for many centuries.

&lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; – A few hundred &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20football%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; fans weren't watching the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; match against &lt;a href="w%3ASweden%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; last night in a pub or at home, but instead had ventured out to their local cinema to see the game on the big screen. A number of Odeon cinemas nationwide have been using digital projection technology to screen the matches live with a high definition (HD) picture. HD broadcasts contain a greater level of detail than traditional TV broadcasts, meaning a sharper picture and better sound quality. 

In the darkened auditorium of the cinema in Covent Garden, the audience (or should that be crowd?) were behaving almost as if they were at the stadium, singing along to the national anthem, cheering at the England goals and groaning at the Sweden chances. At times, chants being sung by the England crowd at the match were even picked up and sung along to by those watching the cinema screen like some kind of football karaoke contest.

Trailers before the match were replaced by a soundtrack of England anthems, both the successful and not-so-successful ones, and the traditional movie treat of popcorn was replaced by trays of beer (in plastic cups) being brought in by the punters. The cinema had cheekily listed the screening as being 'directed by Sven-Göran Eriksson' and as 'starring Wayne Rooney (hopefully)'.

Despite a disappointing 2-2 draw, the audience seemed impressed with the experience. "I'm a bit short and so wanted to make sure I had good view without having to jostle around for position," Amanda, from London, explained to me. "I also liked that it was non-smoking, and there was a fabulous atmosphere". Sian, Caio and Laura, who lived locally, said they wanted to see the match on the big screen and commented on the excellent picture quality. 

Other events that have been broadcast by the cinema chain include concerts by Robbie Williams and Elton John. Odeon Marketing Director Luke Vetere said "offering films is just one part of the cinema experience - our ambition is to offer guests the chance to watch other events they feel passionate about". Watching football in the cinema is not a brand new event though, during previous World Cups such as in 1966, film footage from the matches was broadcast in cinemas after the event, providing a way for people to see the games in colour when TV broadcasts were in black and white.

Cinema screenings aren't the only way that fans can watch the World Cup games in high-definition this year though, as both &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20TV"&gt;Sky TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATelewest"&gt;Telewest&lt;/a&gt; have been broadcasting the games in HD to viewers with a special set-top box. There have been trials with HD on the growing &lt;a href="w%3AFreeview"&gt;Freeview&lt;/a&gt; platform too, with a pilot group of a few hundred viewers in London. However, as any move to roll out HD on Freeview would use up extra space on the broadcast spectrum and would require viewers to buy a new set-top box, it seems unlikely that this will happen any time soon.

The three goals came in the first period of a match in which Mexico had a player sent off and missed a penalty in the second.

Portugal had rested Deco, Ronaldo and Pauletta but with Figo, Simão and Maniche still packed an offensive threat.

Five minutes into the game Simão ran down the left side of the penalty area and passed a ball square. It deceived the Mexican defence and Maniche, who ran on to it, placed the ball high beyond Oswaldo Sanchez.

The second goal came after 23 minutes when Rafael Marquez reached with his hand to meet a cross from a corner. The resultant penalty saw a theatrical display by Sanchez on the goal line but Simão scored hard to his right.

If Mexico's Omar Bravo had a better game the result might have been a Mexican victory. In the first half he volleyed wide and via a Ricardo leg-save hit the crossbar; on 63 minutes through on goal he blazed over.

Bravo's best chance came on a 56 minute penalty kick after a move of neat passes ended with Miguel's arm connecting with Luis Perez's ball control in the area. Bravo stepped up and hit well over.

Statistics say ball possession was equal and shots on goal were just shaded by Mexico despite the fact Ricardo La Volpe's side had to play the last half hour with 10 men.

Perez received his second yellow card four minutes after Bravo had missed his penalty - sent off for foul simulation in the Portuguese penalty area, in an apparent attempt to get another. 

The biggest threat to Portugal's goal was posed by Jose Fonseca. He got four of six shots on target and scored the only Mexican goal, a glancing header from Bravo's corner kick.

Defeat to Portugal did not alter the top two positions in Group D. Luiz Felipe Scolari's Portugal would next play the team placed second in Group C in the round of sixteen, while Mexico had to play the winner of that group.

Angola needed to win at least 2-0 in their game and for Mexico to lose 2-0 to Portugal in the other Group D game played, Wednesday.

For fifteen minutes Goncalves De Oliveira might have thought his side could do what was necessary when Ze Kalanga's beautiful cross to Flavio was headed over Ebrahim Mirzapour and Angola were one-up.

The news from the other Group D game played concurrently was that Mexico were losing 2-1; two more goals for Angola or Portugal or one more goal for each would do it.

However; Branko Ivankovic's team were not to be beaten. Iran had 55 per cent of ball possession in the match and saw twelve shots saved by the Angolan keeper, Ricardo.

Iran may consider they were the better side on the day and deserved to share the point they earned 15 minutes after they conceded.

A corner met Sohrab Bakhtiarizadeh who, barely challenged, guided his header into the open net to the right of a stationary Ricardo.

In the first half, on 26 minutes, a similar move almost resulted in a goal for Iran. Vahid Hashemian saw his header, also from a corner, cleared off the line by the man on the post, Mendonca. When Iran scored there was nobody on the post.

Both sides had rested key players for the game and seemed to give the greatest respect for the other side's abilities and in the end both defenses won. 

With Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez, who started for rested players, Argentina had the talent to get a win. However; though Messi was lively the Argentines struggled for space to trouble the Orangemen and Argentina had to settle for a draw, which was enough to top Group C. 

The Netherlands, who had rested Arjen Robben and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, had the best of the first twenty minutes play. In this time they had 65 per cent of the play, although this was to almost even out by the end of the match. 

A goal nearly came when Dirk Kuyt robbed a defender to the left of the penalty box and ran toward goal. Had Kuyt passed to Ruud Van Nistelrooij instead of forcing a near post save out of Roberto Abbondanzieri there may subsequently have been a more open match. 

Argentina then had more of play though they needed a set piece to trouble the opponent's defence. A Juan Riquelme freekick fizzed low into the box and Khalid Boolahrouz almost tipped into his own net but Edwin Van Der Sar's right post intervened.

The teams denied each other space which made it hard to pass around the penalty boxes and get clear sights of goal. This is implied in the game statistics. Both keepers made three saves during the game; while - indicating some attacking play - there were 17 corner kicks as defenders successfully blocked crosses and shots.

The best two moments in a second half that was more scratchy than the first came from the boot of Tevez. On 72 minutes a hard shot from outside the box produced a one-handed save from Van Der Sar and a last minute effort from a long ball whizzed wide.

In the round of sixteen Argentina would play the runners-up of Group D who were Mexico. The Netherlands would play Portugal for the right to get into the Fifa World Cup quarter-finals.

This match had no effect on the Fifa World Cup round of sixteen as the two sides started the game without a point in Group C. The win was Ivory Coast's first at a World Cup finals.

Serbia and Montenegro had been beaten 6-0 in their previous Group C tie with Argentina but to begin with seemed to have put that behind them.

Nikola Žigić with great skill took down a long ball from Dejan Stankovic and rounded Boubacarthe Barry on 11 minutes. Ten minutes later Sasa Ilić made it two when Cyrille Domoraud under pressure miscontrolled the ball six yards from goal.

Moments of indiscipline - two Milan Dudic handballs and the sending off of Albert Nadj for a second yellow card just before half time - seemed to show it was the broken will of the Balkans team that eventually lost the game. 

Ivory Coast would end the match with 68 per cent of ball possession and having had 14 extra shots, including a Blaise Kouassi effort that hit the white of Jevric's goal.

Serbia and Montenegro were 2-0 up when on 37 minutes Dudic stuck out his hand to touch a ball tossed in front of Dragoslav Jevric's goal. Aruna Dindane tucked the spot kick away. Moments later the side in blue were down to 10 men when Nadj walked for a rough challenge into the side of Abdulkader Keita.

In the second half Dindane bagged his second, a header from a Keita cross. Then Bonaventure Kalou stepped up and scored the winner from another penalty six minutes before time. 

Milan Dudic had also a hand in the second Ivory Coast penalty as it was his hand that had got in the way of Kalou's shot.

Both sides lacked the necessary discipline to keep 10 men on the pitch for the whole game. Domoraud received a second yellow in injury time and the captain had started to walk even before the referee had flashed his red.

An 85-year man, Reginald Hugh Donovan has been jailed for a month by the &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt; District Court for shoplifting. He is the oldest person in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; to be sentenced to prison.

Mr Donovan has been previously banned from many stores for shoplifting and has been convicted about 50 times for it. 

The Christchurch District Court judge, Colin Doherty, said to Mr Donovan "You are a recidivist and incorrigible thief. You steal predominantly from local supermarkets. The extent of your offending is not great in monetary terms, but you persist."

He has always promised to stop shoplifting after receiving sentences of supervision and community work. He blames his poor memory for his shoplifting problems.

Mr Donovan was found stealing small items and he did not have enough money in his pocket to pay for those items. He suffers from deafness, dizzy spells, chronic breathing difficulties and the after-effects of a disabling accident.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; movement admitted the &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i national emergency and medical relief service, the &lt;a href="w%3AMagen%20David%20Adom"&gt;Magen David Adom&lt;/a&gt; (MDA), after a 58 year wait, despite objections by some &lt;a href="Muslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; member countries.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Crystal"&gt;Red Crystal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; emblem, into which the Star of David may be placed, made it possible for Israel's MDA to join the humanitarian network &amp;mdash; which makes up the world's largest relief agency &amp;mdash; after decades of isolation.

The decision had met with resistance from some Muslim countries opposing the Israeli group's admission, including representatives of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, as well as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; delegates.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts &lt;a href="Australian%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; Helen Coonan announced on Wednesday that the federal government would be spending &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; $116.6 million on a package of measures to protect Australians from inappropriate material on the Internet. Dubbed "Protecting Families Online", the package includes free filtering software for all families.

The government claims that its National Filter Scheme will be central to the package. In addition to providing families with free filtering software, the government will also provide libraries with filters for Internet terminals. It is hoped that the filters will ensure that children using the Internet from libraries can do so without being exposed to inappropriate material.

As part of the package, the government's Internet safety and advisory agency &amp;mdash; NetAlert will be located within the Australian Communications and Media Authority &amp;mdash; the chief regulatory authority for telecommunications, radiocommunications, Internet and media services. The government will also give NetAlert an additional $5 million to spend on advertising to promote its services.

In addition to the Protecting Families Online package, the government will again examine &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Service%20Provider"&gt;Internet Service Provider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ISP) level filtering. A trial will be carried out in &lt;a href="Tasmania"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt; to determine its effectiveness. According to Senator Coonan it is the fourth time the government has undertaken such a trial.

As part of the trial, the ACMA will be required to report on ISP level filtering around the world and work with NetAlert to investigate advances in filtering technologies.

Senator Coonan assured Internet users that the initiatives were only to protect children from inappropriate material and the government wasn’t dictating what adults could access. "This is not a one-size-fits-all approach to protecting Australia families and we are not dictating to every Australian Internet user what they should and shouldn’t see," she said.

<h1>Science academies urge teaching of evolution</h1>

The Interacademy Panel on International Issues (IAP), a global network of the world's science academies, has released a statement urging parents and teachers to provide children with 'the facts about the &lt;a href="w%3AOrigin%20of%20life"&gt;origin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEvolution"&gt;evolution of life&lt;/a&gt; on Earth'. The statement is signed by 67 of the 92 member academies of the organisation, and notes that in some schools around the world, "testable theories" about evolution are being "concealed, denied or confused by theories not testable by science".

The statement presents four "evidence-based facts" that no scientific evidence has ever contradicted. These include the Earth being approximately 4.5 billion years old, life on Earth being at least 2.5 billion years old, and commonalities in all living organisms indicating a common primordial origin based on the process of photosynthetic organisms.

The news follows developments, mainly in the , where there is a concerted effort to include the teaching of '&lt;a href="w%3Aintelligent%20design"&gt;intelligent design&lt;/a&gt;' (ID), a theory which claims that complex biological features indicate that the presence of an intelligent 'designer' in schools. Opponents of this movement argue that it doesn't qualify as a scientific theory, and is simply a disguise for &lt;a href="w%3Acreationist"&gt;creationist&lt;/a&gt; beliefs. In the US, where the separation of church and state is mandated by constitutional law, efforts to include ID in school syllabi were quashed by the courts, as the teaching of religion in schools is against the Establishment clause of the constitution of the United States. Despite this, George Bush has in the past remarked that he believes intelligent design should be taught in schools. The President has not shown any sign of plans to personally intervene in the legal debate however.

In December 2005, following legal case between the parents and the school district of Dover (Pennsylvania, USA), the judge decided that intelligent design was a religious view, and that it was unlawful to teach it as an alternative to evolution within the classroom. The IAP statement suggests that the science academies believe that ID is still being taught within some schools, however.

A Gallup poll conducted in May concluded that 46 percent of Americans believe that God created man in his present form sometime in the past 10,000 years, with 13 percent believing mankind evolved with no divine intervention and 36 percent saying that mankind developed over millions of years from lesser life forms, but with God guiding the process.

The IAP statement acknowledges limitations in current understanding, but argues that the process of science allows it to be open-ended and subject to correction and expansion as new understanding emerges.

There was not much difference between the two sides, the youngest squad in the tournament versus the 2002 Fifa World Cup quarter-finalists, although the manner of the Ghana win might have left a sour taste in the mouth of USA coach &lt;a href="w%3ABruce%20Arena"&gt;Bruce Arena&lt;/a&gt;.

Early in the game, Claudio Reyna was dispossessed with the ball in a last man defensive position. Haminu Draman ran on to goal with the ball and one-on-one passed it by Kasey Keller. Reyna was stretchered off with a knee injury; the USA captain came back on but was substituted before half time.

Landon Donovan took the USA captaincy following Reyna's departure.

The second Ghanian goal was from a penalty. The ball was played into the USA penalty area and Razek Pimpong fell to the pitch next to Oguchi Onyewu. The replay was not conclusive but did show the defender's arms were not in a position to push hard on the Ghana player who had appeared to make a rapid fall.

Though he was the last defender before the goalkeeper Onyewu was not cautioned for the challenge. Stephen Appiah converted the penalty inside right foot to top left of the net, seconds before half time.

United States had drawn level from Clint Dempsey on 43 minutes when DaMarcus Beasley intercepted a defensive pass and weighted the perfect ball for the striker to run on too.

The crowd booed the referee when the half time whistle blew but in the second half their team did not do enough to put Richard Kingston, and the Ghana goal, under pressure. The USA got just three shots on target in the game.

Ghana conceded 32 fouls in the game and the pressure on their defence increased in the second half when they had to defend their lead.

From Eddie Lewis's short cross to the near post Brian McBride went closest to making the score 2-2 flicking a header onto a vertical. Donovan got in good positions, a freekick close to the penalty area and a run into the box, but in both cases his decision to pass badly and not shoot relieved the pressure for Ghana.

A feature of the game the FIFA Technical Study Group might look at was the number of Ghana players who spent a long time on the ground with injuries under challenges. There was five minutes of injury time at the end of the match. This meant the game ran well past the finish time of the concurrent contest between Italy and Czech Republic also in Group E. 

The half-time kick-off also started five minutes behind the match Italy won to top the group. One point ahead of a Ghana team who had reached the round of sixteen in just their first Fifa World Cup finals.

Despite having had to replace key central defender Alessandro Nesta, who was injured after 17 minutes, the ♡❤Azzuri♡❤ defeated the Czech Republic comfortably. 

Italian fortunes were helped when on 46 minutes the Czech Republic had Jan Polak sent off for his second yellow card offense within a 12 minute period before half-time.

Before that Italy had gone ahead with Nesta's substitute rising well to meet and head down Francesco Totti's corner. Marco Materazzi had an exceptional game with Fabio Cannavaro and was awarded Fifa's Man of the Match.

It was thought Alessandro Nesta's groin injury meant he would miss the round of sixteen and possibly any later World Cup matches Italy would play.

For the Czech Republic 33-year-old Pavel Nedved worked very hard for little reward - other than perhaps a showcase final appearance at a World Cup against a very good side.

On 15 minutes Gianluigi Buffon was forced to make a double save from Nedved's drive and Marek Jankulovski's follow-up from a close angle.

In the second half Filippo Inzaghi came on for Alberto Gilardino and on a number of ocasions found himself unmarked behind ten man Czech Republic's lines. He put his first chance - a free header six yards out - wastefully wide but rounded the keeper to score on a breakaway three minutes from time.

The result meant Italy would play the runner-up of Group F in the round of sixteen, while Karel Bruckner's Czech team would check out of their hotels.

&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; – 
Yesterday, a recently-planted garden and "Welcome to the Elmwood Village" sign at the corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; was dedicated to the community at 6 PM. The garden was planted by a group of local citizens known as the ♡❤Elmwood Village Gatekeepers♡❤, who formed to maintain the green space on the corner which is unmaintained by Hans Mobius, the owner of the land and properties at 1109-1121 Elmwood.

"This is our neighborhood, and we don’t want to see it go down-hill. The lawns are part of the look of this corner that we love, and we can do something about," said Joe Runfola an area resident.

The ♡❤Gatekeepers♡❤ are hopeful that the "annuals and the perennials planted in the garden can be enjoyed by all for years to come," said owner of Don Apparel with Patty Morris, Nancy Pollina.

Local artist Steven Myers and owner of Gateway Studios on Elmwood and Forest painted the new welcome sign.

"In the design, I wish to show the transition from green parks, to lively urban neighborhoods, to downtown, in the background. The four colors, red, white, yellow and black will also be incorporated in their pure form to represent the Native American medicine wheel, which teaches us that the four symbolic races are all part of the same human family," said Myers.

The newly formed group hopes to plant an elm tree at the proposed site in July.

So far, 2 of the 5 businesses on the proposed site have relocated or closed their doors. The group is hopeful that a lawsuit filed against the developer Savarino Construction Services Corporation and the City of Buffalo will stop the proposal from moving forward and hope that the garden can become a "community garden."

The preliminary hearing, which was scheduled for 9:30am today was initially postponed until July 20, 2006; however, attorney Arthur J. Giacalone, who is representing the petitioners of the lawsuit Nancy Pollina and Patricia Morris, Angeline Genovese and Evelyn Bencinich, owners of residences on Granger Place which abut the rear of the proposed site, Nina Freudenheim, a resident of nearby Penhurst Park, and Sandra Girage, the owner of a two-family residence on Forest Avenue less than a hundred feet from the proposed hotel's sole entrance and exit driveway, has said that the preliminary hearing has been postponed indefinitely and at the moment no new date has been set. According to Giacalone, Savarino Construstion has not yet presented their case and has not yet filed their papers.

Australia drew with Croatia 2-2 in a drama-packed final Group F game in Stuttgart, Thursday. 

The draw put Australia on four points and Croatia on two, allowing the Australian team, nicknamed "The Socceroos", to progress into the Fifa World Cup round of sixteen.

The action-packed match, which was witnessed by 52'000 at Gottlieb Daimler Stadion, had controversy throughout the game.

Croatian defender Stjepan Tomas handballed two Australian crosses within the Croatian penalty area; but only one penalty was given. This was inconsistent with matches such as the clash between Serbia and Montenegro against Côte d'Ivoire (The Ivory Coast), where Milan Dudic of Serbia and Montenegro committed two fouls against Côte d'Ivoire the previous day and both penalties were awarded on that occasion. 

There was high tensions in the last moments of the match, as Croatia was desperate to get a winner while Australia did not want to concede. This is reflected by the fact that this game was only the fifth time in World Cup history (and the second time in the 2006 World Cup) where three players had been shown a red card in one match. The other times were 1938 - Brazil vs. Czechoslovakia, 1954 - Brazil vs. Hungary, 1998 - Denmark vs. South Africa, and 2006 - USA vs. Italy. 

Three players were shown two yellow cards, but in the confusion of the last few minutes of the match, English referee Graham Poll had only sent two of those players off the field.

Dario Simic was first to go after fouling Harry Kewell, halting an Australian breakaway. Australian Brett Emerton walked when he committed a handball foul, preventing an attacking pass by Croatia.

Josip Simunic should have gone at the 90 minute mark when Poll flashed him a second yellow card for what may be described as a rugby tackle in a last ditch attempt to stop another Australian breakaway. 

The referee failed to realise that he had booked Simunic 61 minutes into the game and allowed him to stay on until he was booked a third time after the end of injury time three minutes later. In the Fifa match report, the last booking was also officially recorded.

Poll later claimed to the Fifa referee committee when he booked Simunic for the second time he had marked down the number of Australian Craig Moore instead.

An earlier drama in a second half saw Croatia's go-ahead goal. Tim Cahill fail to challenge Niko Kovac until the edge of the Australian penalty area; this resulted in Kovac using the space for a low shot at Australian goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac. Kalac's egregious attempt at the save seemed almost like a dive out of the way when the ball hit a bad bounce in front of him, and rolled into the net. 

The game started spectacularly with arguably the best freekick goal the tournament seen to this point, scored by Darijo Srna. Right footed, 30 yards out, he curled it over the wall and past the out-stretched right hand of Kalac into the top left corner of the Australian net.

On 37 minutes Poll penalised Tomas' handball and Craig Moore converted the penalty shot easily down the middle. Stipe Pletikosa gave plenty of space for Moore to shoot, having committed his dive a metre left while Moore was still having his run up.

Pletikosa later made two outstanding saves, a reaction stop from Kewell and then to grab a low cross amidst flying legs on his goal line.

Australia had more shots at goal and ball possession in the match, and their second equaliser came 11 minutes from time. Marco Bresciano's cross was flicked onward by John Aloisi, allowing Kewell to strike past Pletikosa near the far post.

Australia manager Guus Hiddink might think the match was a rather surreal affair, but the reality is he has progressed Australia into the round of sixteen for the first time at the World Cup finals. Italy, winners of Group E, will meet them in the round of sixteen.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Heat"&gt;Miami Heat&lt;/a&gt; won their first &lt;a href="w%3ANBA%20Finals"&gt;NBA Title&lt;/a&gt; in franchise history Tuesday beating the &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Mavericks"&gt;Dallas Mavericks&lt;/a&gt; 95-92.

Two goals from Ronaldo put his combined Fifa World Cup tournament tally at 14 - equal to German Gerd Muller and two more than fellow Brazilian legend Pele.

The game against Japan did not go the Brazilian's way until the second half. Yoshikatsu Kawaguichi had made five stunning saves to deny Ronaldo, Robinho and Juninho. 

Inspired, Japan then shocked the 2002 World Cup champions when, against the run of play, Japanese left-back Alessandro Santos - "Alex" - found Keiji Tamada in the Brazilian area with only Dida to beat. The striker slammed the ball home.

Ronaldo leveled with a deserved equaliser just before half time when Cicinho headed Ronaldinho's ball across goal for Ronaldo to head past Kawaguichi.

The Japanese keeper saved 10 of 14 shots in a one-sided match but, despite his earlier heroics, was at fault for Juninho's go ahead goal which he seemed to lose in the flight as it rifled in from 25 yards. 

Ronaldinho sent Gilberto down Japan's right flank to score the third and Ronaldo wrapped up the victory with a stunning drive from outside the box. 

The total of 15 fouls in the game was to that date the lowest of the tournament and indicates this was not a physical contest; rather, both teams focussed on passing and movement to create scoring openings.

"Modern football at its best" was the opinion of Gyorgy Mezey of Fifa's Technical Study Group. 

Brazil topped Group F with nine points and would play the runner-up in Group E, Ghana, for the right to get into the World Cup quarter-finals.

Mr Beazley said that the government's Protecting Families Online initiatives were a belated response to Labor's policy of "clean-feed" filtering - where pornographic and other inappropriate material is filtered at the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Service%20Provider"&gt;Internet Service Provider&lt;/a&gt; level. He asked why the government would not "swallow its pride" and introduce the policy proposed by Labor.

In response, the Prime Minister said that the package announced by his government on Wednesday achieves the goals of protecting children without "imposing the unreasonable restrictions and cost burdens of the Labor Party’s policy".

In April, the Internet Industry Association - the apex body representing Internet related businesses in Australia dismissed the idea of ISP-level filtering, calling it "inappropriate and heavy handed". The association said despite network level filtering working in schools and large corporations, it would more than likely impact network performance on large service provider networks.

The IIA said that providing users with filtering software and supervision of children's online activities by parents are the most appropriate means by which to protect children using the Internet.

The two recently discovered moons of the planet &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APluto"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were officially named &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHydra%20%28moon%29"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANix%20%28moon%29"&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Astronomical%20Union"&gt;International Astronomical Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the internationally recognized authority for assigning designations to celestial bodies. 

The moons were discovered in May last year by the Pluto Companion Search Team, a team of scientists from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouthwest%20Research%20Institute"&gt;Southwest Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (SwRI), the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohns%20Hopkins%20University"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Telescope%20Science%20Institute"&gt;Space Telescope Science Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALowell%20Observatory"&gt;Lowell Observatory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , using images taken from the &lt;a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble space telescope&lt;/a&gt;. The moons were designated as S/2005 P1 (Hydra) and P2 (Nix) upon discovery. 

Their discovery comes 27 years after the discovery of Pluto's largest moon &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharon%20%28moon%29"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The two moons are roughly 5000 times fainter than Pluto and two to three times farther from Pluto, compared to Charon. The two bodies are roughly 50 km in diameter. 

The names are derived from Greek mythology, where &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALernaean%20Hydra"&gt;Hydra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a monster with the body of a serpent and nine heads and Nix is the goddess of darkness and night. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANyx"&gt;Nix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is also the mother of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharon%20%28mythology%29"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , an allusion to the giant impact which is believed to have created the three satellites of Pluto, with Charon borne of the material from which Nix formed. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APluto%20%28mythology%29"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; himself is the god of the underworld.

&lt;a href="w%3AMatt%20Hanson"&gt;Matt Hanson&lt;/a&gt; aims to raise &lt;a href="w%3APound%20Sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;1 million to fund the production of a feature-length film which would be distributed freely via the &lt;a href="Internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt; under a &lt;a href="w%3ACreative%20Commons"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; licence, all funded through 50,000 people each donating £25 to the project, which he's called '&lt;a href="w%3AA%20Swarm%20of%20Angels"&gt;A Swarm of Angels&lt;/a&gt;'.

No stranger to filmmaking, Matt has produced numerous digital short films, a series of books on digital filmmaking and set up the digital film festival &lt;a href="w%3Aonedotzero"&gt;onedotzero&lt;/a&gt;, now in its tenth year. He wants to finally make a feature length film, and decided that it was better to turn to the Internet for help and funding rather than plod through the usual '&lt;a href="w%3Adevelopment%20hell"&gt;development hell&lt;/a&gt;'. 

"I wanted to put into practice what I’ve been preaching as a film futurist for ten years, and the technology and Internet infrastructure has just really caught up with that vision now for me to put it into practice."

The process is inspired by the '&lt;a href="w%3AWeb%202.0"&gt;web 2.0&lt;/a&gt;' movement, using social and collaborative communities on the Internet. Matt doesn't see the funding as coming from donations, but as people paying a subscription to become part of a 'Swarm'. "Rather than the 'many producer' model, this is more of an 'smart consumer' model ... members can help implement and bring their expertise into play, and so become more actively involved in the production."

The project hopes to use professional actors and crew, but use qualified members from the swarm as much as possible. The cast and the crew, including any volunteers that get chosen, would be paid for their work on the film, with Matt suggesting that this is "a great way for people to get into the industry".

Those members not directly involved in making the film can still participate in the process by discussing ideas on a &lt;a href="w%3Amessageboard"&gt;messageboard&lt;/a&gt;, and having a vote on certain crucial decisions such as which script gets chosen for production. Asked how he would balance his own creative direction with input from members, Matt said "my vision will lead the project forward and define the parameters, but the Swarm can influence that, and indeed offer improvements or insights I might not think of alone". 

"Remember filmmaking is always a team effort - whether you are &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Scorsese"&gt;Martin Scorsese&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AStanley%20Kubrick"&gt;Stanley Kubrick&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AJean%20Luc%20Godard"&gt;Jean Luc Godard&lt;/a&gt;, you promote people within the project that will complement and bring something extra to the vision of the film. Give it more life. With the Swarm we are making that process more &lt;a href="w%3ADemocracy"&gt;democratic&lt;/a&gt;, and giving a wider range of people an opportunity to shine and have creative input."

Members are promised a collector's edition &lt;a href="w%3ADVD"&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; of the end product and exclusive merchandise, but the main distribution of the film will be via the Internet, using '&lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt;' and &lt;a href="w%3APeer-to-peer"&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;/a&gt; networks. "Unlike many other filmmakers, I'm not wedded to cinema projection as the 'be all and end all' - I'm much more excited about people viewing remixed versions on their video &lt;a href="w%3AIPod"&gt;iPods&lt;/a&gt;," explains Matt.

The 'remixing' of the film will be possible thanks to it being distributed under a Creative Commons licence. Matt suggests that the 'younger generation' is more used to being involved with and interacting with entertainment, and points to remixes of the &lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Wars"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt; films (eg '&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Phantom%20Edit"&gt;The Phantom Edit&lt;/a&gt;') as an example of these 'mashups'. "At the end of the project I would love to have an event that showcased five wildly different versions of the film, different visions from people other than my definitive initial edit," he suggests. The licence will be for non-commercial use only, however, and so commercial TV stations would still have to pay in order to screen the film.

The project is partly inspired by the success of '&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Million%20Dollar%20Homepage"&gt;The Million Dollar Homepage&lt;/a&gt;', in which British student Alex Tew aimed to raise a million &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;dollars&lt;/a&gt; to fund his university education, simply by selling advertising space on a single web page. The publicity surrounding the idea, coupled with the 'viral' effect of Internet users passing the page on, meant that he eventually managed to make himself the million dollars.

The success of these projects partly seems to depend on them being interesting and original enough to attract enough attention, and it’s often difficult to see how they could be repeated. Copy-cat versions of the million dollar homepage have so far failed to hugely take off. When asked about this idea, Matt responded "I already expect people to copy the model we are inventing with A Swarm of Angels - it's a perfect way to create cult media, where the director gets more creative control and organically funds a project, and the fans of the project get more involvement within it. If the market gets too crowded with these projects though, then they’ll have to be packaged differently to stand out. But that’s what traditional film and media projects need to do anyway."

Over 600 members have signed up to the 'swarm' so far, which Matt comments is already an early success, but 50,000 members in total will be needed in order to fully fund the £1 million budget. Matt suggests that getting to the next stage, of reaching 1,000 members, followed by the phase of getting 5,000 members, will be the hardest part, as after that the film will be more 'tangible'. He expects to raise the full budget, but comments that if the fundraising stalls, "options will be presented by advisors and The Swarm, and based on some kind of consensus we’ll come up with the best option for moving forward."

Traditionally, independent films are funded either through persuading wealthy individuals to invest, who sometimes are sometimes given '&lt;a href="w%3Aexecutive%20producer"&gt;Executive Producer&lt;/a&gt;' credits, or through organisations like the &lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Film%20Council"&gt;UK Film Council&lt;/a&gt;, who award funds from the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Lottery"&gt;National Lottery&lt;/a&gt;. A tax credit for producers making small films in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; was announced by the government in 2005, in a bid to give a boost to the UK independent film industry.

Matt says that the film will be "a thriller with soft science fiction elements", which he says will suit his target audience. "But it will have an &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent%20film"&gt;indie&lt;/a&gt; edginess to it, and be far more visually inventive than you would get with a 'normal' British independent feature." Contributors to the project include artists &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Kleptones"&gt;The Kleptones&lt;/a&gt;, who will help with the soundtrack, comic book writer &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Ellis"&gt;Warren Ellis&lt;/a&gt; and documentary filmmaker &lt;a href="w%3AGrant%20Gee"&gt;Grant Gee&lt;/a&gt;.

The Swarm of Angels project is online at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.aswarmofangels.com/"&gt;aswarmofangels.com&lt;/a&gt; and costs £25 as an individual to become a member.

Authorities were on high alert as a &lt;a href="w%3AKLM_Royal_Dutch_Airlines"&gt;KLM&lt;/a&gt; Cityhopper flight from &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; made an emergency landing at &lt;a href="w%3AEindhoven%20Airport"&gt;Eindhoven Airport&lt;/a&gt;.

Four crew and 50 passengers were on board at the time.

During the emergency, the airport was immediately closed and emergency crews arrived within minutes at the scene. Twenty fire units were sent to the plane.

The Ministry of Defense said no one was injured in the incident and an investigation is under way.

Dr. Douglas Kerr, a neurologist at &lt;a href="w%3AJohns%20Hopkins%20University"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;, has recently led a research team to identify enough of the chemicals necessary to regrow &lt;a href="w%3Amotor%20neurons"&gt;motor neurons&lt;/a&gt;. They have succeeded in partially restoring paralyzed &lt;a href="w%3Arats"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;' ability to walk.

These results represent major progress towards curing many nerve-related problems in &lt;a href="w%3Ahumans"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="w%3ALou%20Gehrig%27s%20disease"&gt;Lou Gehrig's disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aspinal%20cord"&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt; injuries. However, Dr. Karr emphasized that it will be many years before any possible treatments for humans become available.

Dr. Naomi Keitman of the &lt;a href="w%3ANIH"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Aneurology"&gt;neurology&lt;/a&gt; division said "They did something that people have been trying to do for at least 30 years and literally hit a brick wall until now." 

The research will be published in the &lt;a href="w%3AAnnals%20of%20Neurology"&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/a&gt;.

The bars affected are the Dairy Milk Turkish 250g, Dairy Milk Caramel, Dairy Milk Mint bars, Dairy Milk 8 chunk, Dairy Milk 1kg bar, Dairy Milk Buttons Easter Egg 105g and 10p Freddo bar. Uneaten products can be returned to 'Cadbury Recall, Freepost MID20061, Birmingham B3O 2QZ', and then a full refund will be given. Customers can also call 0800 818181 if they are concerned.

Cadbury has said that it expects to have fresh stocks of the products back on the market in the near future. 

The decision was made in consultation with the Food Standards Agency.

Roger Lemerre, coach of Tunisia, might consider his team were unlucky as the match seemed to turn on officiating decisions that favoured the Ukrainians.
Ukraine went into the last Group H game needing a draw to go through to the round of sixteen while Tunisia needed a win. It was a competitive match without much flair or accurate passing.

A total of just nine shots and six corner kicks and the 42 fouls amassed suggested that the game was mostly played in the centre third of the pitch.

The first of three things to go wrong from the Tunisia perspective was the sending off of arguably their best player Zied Jaziri. He got his second yellow card a minute before half-time for a mistimed challenge which followed a yellow card for foul simulation earlier in the game. 

The second crucial moment, when the score was still 0-0, appeared to follow from an Andriy Rusol foul a few yards away from his penalty area on 64 minutes. The caution Rusol received meant he would miss Ukraine's next Fifa World Cup match.

Anis Ayari took the freekick and got it up over the wall; it was close enough to going in that it landed on the netting on top of the goal. Unfortuantely for Tunisia television replay showed a Ukrainian player in the wall, inside the penalty area, stuck his arm up and the ball had clipped his arm on the way through.

This was the fifth time in three days at the World Cup players in defensive positions had put their hand up in their own penalty area to stop balls; it also happened in Portugal versus Mexico; Serbia and Montenegro versus Ivory Coast; and Croatia versus Australia. In this match no penalty was awarded for the handball.

Four minutes later Andriy Shevchenko made it 1-0 for Ukraine from the penalty spot. There was some question about whether the award was just. Although Shevchenko had done well to nip past the Tunisian keeper, and had two defenders in close vicinity, he had appeared to trip himself when he tapped his own left ankle with his right foot. 

For neutral fans in the Olympiastadion a bright spot in a scrappy match came on on 89 minutes when Ali Boumnijel made a brilliant save from Andriy Voronin. Voronin was one-on-one with the Tunisian and the save seemed to block an almost certain second goal for Ukraine.

By that time the game was done and dusted and Ukraine were through to the round of sixteen of the Fifa World Cup for the first time in its history.

Except for an unlikely scoreline, the result of the game would not change the position of the top two teams in Group H and Spain started the game resting most of its first choice team.

The Spainish dominated the game but did not take its chances to make a hefty scoreline against the team that was 29 places below them in the Fifa rankings.

On 88 minutes Saudi Arabia nearly made Luis Aragones's side pay when Mohammed Noor ran to the Spainish goaline and cut a ball back for Saad Al Harthi who, with a good view on net, hit his shot high over the bar.

Saudi Arabia had 41 per cent of ball possession and otherwise were confined to hitting the red shirts on the break. They were caught offside five times.

Jose Antonio Reyes and Joaquin were brightest attacking players for Spain and had a number of chances to score but either their finishing was off or Mabrouk Zaid saved well. The Saudi Arabian keeper had an outstanding game saving 12 shots.

The Spanish passing game lacked a bit of speed and the only goal came from a well executed set-piece after half an hour's play. Reyes, on the left touchline whipped in a vicious cross and Spanish defender Juanito rose 12 yards from goal and headed down powerfully inside the near post.

Though the result was not comfortable and could have ended in a draw had Al Harthi not spurned his glorious chance Spain won their last Group H match with what were essentially reserve players. Luis Aragones would enter the round of sixteen game against France, runners-up in Group G, with a first team of well rested-players.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASealand"&gt;Principality of Sealand&lt;/a&gt; is currently being checked, after a fire caused havoc to the ex-World War II tower. Fire fighters from the Thames Coastguard poured water onto the structure, and rescued a security guard who was taken to Ipswich hospital by an RAF helicopter, suffering from smoke inhalation. It is believed that the fire was started by a fault in a generator. The Harwich off-shore lifeboat team attended the platform, and described the top platform as having caught alight due to an 'electrical fire'.

Sealand, formerly &lt;a href="w%3AHM%20Fort%20Roughs"&gt;HM Fort Roughs&lt;/a&gt;, is a self declared principality comprising of an old army fort. It was built to deter, and report back on, any German attempts to lay mines using aircraft in the channel of the Thames. The offshore company &lt;a href="w%3AHavenCo"&gt;HavenCo&lt;/a&gt; used it to hold servers for the computer industry.

Seven people arrested in &lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt; allegedly planned attacks on &lt;a href="w%3ASears%20Tower"&gt;Sears Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and other buildings as part of pledge to &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; to wage war against the United States. They are also accused of having planned attacks on &lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; buildings.

Attorney General &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt; said Friday that "seven young men arrested in Miami were part of a group of "homegrown terrorists" who sought to work with al-Qaida but ended up consorting instead with a law enforcement informant."

<h2>The terror suspects</h2>

The seven individuals, are ranging in age from 22 to 32. 

They were due to appear in a Miami &lt;a href="w%3Amagistrate%27s"&gt;magistrate&lt;/a&gt; court on Friday.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Switzerland%20shut%20door%20on%20Korean%20Republic%202-0%20in%20Group%20G&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; Switzerland dashed the Fifa World Cup dreams of the Republic of Korea beating them 2-0 to top Group G, Friday.

Republic of Korea (ROK) could not break through the Swiss defence even after they lost center-back and goal scorer Philippe Senderos to a shoulder injury on 53 minutes.

Earlier the 21-year-old rose majestically and thundered in a header from Hakan Yakin's freekick. The centre-back put so much neck power into the contact he headbutted Korea Republic defender Jin-Cheul Choi on the follow-through. Jin-Cheul and Senderos both needed medical treatment for cuts. 

However; Senderos's imperial commitment to the Swiss would not last what seemed to be a shoulder injury just after half-time and he was substituted on 53 minutes. With the experienced Hakan Yakin on great form in midfield the side did fine without him.

After hitting a post with a shot Alexander Frei scored the second for Switzerland on 77 minutes. Frei received a deflected pass onside and rounded Woon Jae Lee to side foot home.

The goal caused some controversy because the referee allowed it though his linesman had flagged for offside. Korean Republic players knew the second goal would make it almost impossible to win the game against the Swiss defence with only 13 minutes left.

Indeed, Koebi Kuhn's Switzerland team were to complete a three match shut out. Six foot six Pascal Zuberbuehler in the Swiss net had eight saves in the game bringing his total to 21 saves in three World Cup matches.

The 2002 World Cup semi-finalists had most ball possession and looked dangerous when the creative Chun Soo Lee was in possession but lacked strength in the penalty box and a decisive finisher to beat Zuberbuehler. 

Though under quite a bit of pressure in the second half the Switzerland team were never ruffled and conceded only eight fouls in the match to Korea Republic's 20 fouls.

The result meant Republic of Korea who had four points would finish third in Group G behind France on five points, after the French beat Togo, Friday.
Switzerland would face Ukraine in the round of sixteen, the winner of that match playing the victor of Italy versus Australia in the quarter finals.

Patrick Viera and Thierry Henry scored second half goals to give France a 2-0 win over Togo in Group G, Friday.

A win that should have been a rout but for the number of almost unwatchable misses racked up by David Trezeguet and Frank Ribery. The lack of French execution in front of goal had fans in the crowd jeering when they were 2-0 up.

This was very unfair on the French team, and particularly the brilliance of Patrick Viera, who were totally dominant as an attacking side and were much the better team in all areas - only to be let down by nerves in front of goal.

Before the game France were third in Group G with two points from two matches to Korea Republic's and Switzerland's four. France had to win the game to get into the round of sixteen and the pressure seemed to be evident in the first half. 

Out of seventeen French shots at goal nine found the area guarded by Kossi Agassa but the keeper did not have to produce a spectacular performance. Togo did not play as much as a team as the French a fact reflected in their attack which forced Fabien Barthez to make just two saves. 

Patrick Viera, on his 30th birthday, got the necessary goal on 55 minutes. Ribery ran at the Togo defence and slipped a pass to Viera. Inside the area with his back to goal, the Juventus man turned his defender and hit the ball hard to Agassa's left.

A striker's goal from a midfield player. 

Viera's presence was noted by the eight fouls he suffered in the game; his excellence by the fact he conceded no fouls. He also got an assist on the second goal when he flicked a header to Henry in the penalty area. A typically clinical finish, Henry's first touch put the ball in a position to shoot before his marker could react.

Raymond Domenech's side win earned a round of sixteen match against Group H winners Spain.

&lt;a href="Gloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Arroyo&lt;/a&gt;, President of the &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, has signed legislation abolishing the &lt;a href="w%3ADeath%20penalty"&gt;death penalty&lt;/a&gt;. This move comes on the eve of a visit to see &lt;a href="w%3A%20Pope%20Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt; and only two weeks after the legislation was confirmed by &lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20the%20Philippines"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;. The change in sentencing law will lead to more than 1,200 prisoners having their sentences changed to life imprisonment.

Arroyo has made assurances that "we shall continue to devote the increasing weight of our resources to the prevention and control of serious crimes, rather than take the lives of those who commit them". She was keen to emphasise that her country was not soft on terrorism.
In the Philippines, the death penalty was originally abolished in 1987, but it was reintroduced in 1993. Since then seven people have been executed. Abolition of the death penalty has generally occurred in correlation with increasing democratisation in nation-states around the world. As of 2005, a majority of states (122) were abolitionist, and a minority (73) retained the death penalty.

Sweden did not get into the round of sixteen game against the host nation and were not helped when Teddy Lucic was sent off before half time. Lucic had tugged Miroslav Klose's shirt to stop a dangerous run, and received his second yellow card on a controversial call.

Podolski scored the goals but the supremacy on the field was due to captain Michael Ballack who, with his passes from midfield, controlled the game for the Germans. Klose was influential next to young Podolski in attack, setting up both goals.

In the fourth minute, Klose turned and split two Swedish defenders just outside the box. His shot was blocked by Andreas Isaksson, but Podolski was there to put in the rebound. Soon thereafter, Klose occupied three Swedish defenders with a run across the penalty area, sent a reverse ball into the centre and Podolski converted for his second goal of the match.

Jürgen Klinsmann's side did not hesitate to shoot; they kept 63 per cent of possession and Ballack dominating many chances were created. Germany had 21 more shots than Sweden in the game. Isaksson made some outstanding one-handed saves to keep the score at 2-0, from Klose and a Ballack effort which he tipped onto his right post.

Lars Lagerback's side played with just ten men in the second half but they nearly got the perfect start with a penalty after Christoph Metzelder pushed Henrik Larsson from behind. This was the referee's second disputed call, after sending off Lucic. Larsson took the spot kick but the 35 year old Swedish star shot just over the crossbar. 

Argentina, the winner of match 50 versus Mexico, would meet the hosts in the quarter-finals of the World Cup.

Juan Sorin hit a cross-field pass to the midfield player at the top right edge of the Mexican box. Rodriguez jumped to receive the ball and, in the same moment, chested high the way it had come. He met the descending ball 25 yards out with a perfectly timed left-footed volley and the ball arrowed over Oswaldo Sanchez into the opposite corner of the net.

The evenness and excitement of the match might easily be overshadowed by the winning goal. Though the shot totals were not high - Argentina had five shots on target to Mexico's three - the action was end to end.

Part of the reason for the excitement was while Mexico tried to keep a fast attacking pace Argentina attempted to slow the game down. There could have been more goals; both Argentina and Mexico defended well and had timely saves from their goalkeepers. 

Mexico got off to the best possible start with a goal from a set-piece after five minutes. Pavel Pardo's cross from the right touchline was flicked on by Mario Mendez and Rafael Marquez slid in to score on a half volley at the far post.

For Argentina the equalising goal five minutes later was the best possible response to going behind. A corner kick was swung in low to the near post; Hernan Crespo raised his foot, Jared Borgetti stuck out his neck and between them the ball sped past Sanchez.

The match had its moment of controversy. Just before half time the Argentine goalkeeper rolled a ball to Gabriel Heinze. Somehow his defender let it go past him to Mexican striker Jose Fonseca. Heinze lunged to bring Fonseca down. Massimo Busacca adjudged Roberto Ayala to be the last defender and spared Heinze the red card for the deliberate professional foul. 

Goalkeepers at either end made match saving contributions in the second half. On 53 minutes Roberto Abbondanzieri saved a defensive a clearance that deflected off Borgetti six yards from goal. Five minutes later Javier Saviola was through on goal; he went high and hard with the shot but Sanchez stuck out a strong left palm and batted the ball away for a corner. 

Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez replaced Crespo and Saviola as Argentina sought to break the deadlock. A minute from time Tevez thought he was through on goal but Ricardo Osorio got back just in time and the game was destined for another 30 minutes and that special moment in extra time.

Argentina's win meant they would play their quarter-final match in the Olympiastadion, Berlin, against the host nation Germany on June 30.

&lt;a href="http%3A//Jatalla.com"&gt;Jatalla.com&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="w%3ASearch%20engine"&gt;search engine&lt;/a&gt;, provides search engine results pages that are derived strictly from user-generated submissions. The &lt;a href="w%3ARelevance%20%28information%20retrieval%29"&gt;relevance&lt;/a&gt; ranking procedure relies upon "lexivotes", which consist of two parts: (1) a word or phrase (similar to a &lt;a href="w%3AFolksonomy"&gt;folksonomic&lt;/a&gt; tag, but potentially much longer than a traditional tag) and (2) at least one &lt;a href="w%3AUniform%20Resource%20Locator"&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt;. When a user submits a search query, all lexivotes that exactly match the search query are counted, and results are ranked according to number of votes.

Such an approach, which appears to be the first of its kind for this application, differs from the approach of traditional search engines, which rely upon &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%20crawler"&gt;web crawlers&lt;/a&gt; to gather content and then analyze this content using one or more &lt;a href="w%3AAlgorithm"&gt;algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. Jatalla's lexivote system also differs from traditional ranking mechanisms, such as those of the search engine leader Google, which rank relevance according to sites that link to a given web page.

The &lt;a href="w%3AJatalla"&gt;Jatalla&lt;/a&gt; page for ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFAQ"&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ states, "When you perform a search on Jatalla.com, you are interviewing the entire world of Web users, and only those opinions matching your query -- character-for-character -- are counted in generating search results...
If you believe (as do we!) that humans are still smarter than computers, you have come to the right place."

The beta launch for the search engine is expected in July.

&lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday in a &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; test match. France outscored South Africa, with four &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;tries&lt;/a&gt; to South Africa's one, with a lot of South Africa's points coming from penalty goals. The French win put an end to an undefeated-at-home streak that the Springboks had been building, which was at 13 games before the loss to France. The win over South Africa is a good sign for France, who are also the current &lt;a href="w%3ASix%20Nations%20Championship"&gt;Six Nations&lt;/a&gt; champions, and the host of next year's &lt;a href="w%3A2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt;.

France opened the scoring after four minutes when winger &lt;a href="w%3AC%C3%A9dric%20Heymans"&gt;Cédric Heymans&lt;/a&gt; gathered a kick to run in the first try of the match. &lt;a href="w%3ADimitri%20Yachvili"&gt;Dimitri Yachvili&lt;/a&gt; was unsuccessful with the conversion, so the score was five points to nil. A few minutes later, the Springboks are awarded a penalty, and &lt;a href="w%3APercy%20Montgomery"&gt;Percy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; successfully kicks a penalty goal to take the score to five to three. France are awarded a penalty at around the 10 minute mark, and Yachvili successfully kicks a penalty goal to extend the French lead to eight points to three. France post more points with a drop goal from &lt;a href="w%3AFlorian%20Fritz"&gt;Florian Fritz&lt;/a&gt;, furthering their lead over the Springboks to 11 points to three. South Africa catch up in the subsequent five minutes, with Montgomery kicking another two penalty goals. In the 28th minute, South Africa takes the lead with another successful penalty goal by Montgomery. Subsequent penalty goals are missed by both nations before they go into half-time.

South Africa score their first try of the match through &lt;a href="w%3ABrent%20Russell"&gt;Brent Russell&lt;/a&gt;. Montgomery is unsuccessful with the conversion attempt, with the ball hitting the upright. France hit back two minutes later with a try of their own through &lt;a href="w%3AVincent%20Clerc"&gt;Vincent Clerc&lt;/a&gt; and Yachvili is successful with the conversion. Five minutes later, France are able to take the lead again, with &lt;a href="w%3ADamien%20Traille"&gt;Damien Traille&lt;/a&gt; scoring under the posts, and Yachvilli subsequently adding the conversion. With around 15 minutes remaining in the match, Traille kicks France's second drop-goal to extend their lead to 28 to 23. A penalty goal is kicked by Montgomery for South Africa, narrowing the score to 28 to 26, however, Clerc scores his second try of the match for France in the last ten minutes to secure the win. The final score of the game is 36 to 26.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="w%3AIreland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; 37 points to 15 at &lt;a href="w%3ASubiaco%20Oval"&gt;Subiaco Oval&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday in a &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; test match. The Wallabies had just come of a successful two test series win over &lt;a href="w%3AEngland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; whilst the Irish had come from two competitive losses against the &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; in New Zealand. The win makes it three from three for new Australian coach &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Connolly%20%28rugby%29"&gt;John Connolly&lt;/a&gt;.

The scoring opened after 13 minutes of play, with Australia being awarded a penalty. &lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20Mortlock"&gt;Stirling Mortlock&lt;/a&gt; was successful with the shot at goal to take Australia to a three to nil lead. Ireland successfully held Australia for the following ten minutes, until &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Latham"&gt;Chris Latham&lt;/a&gt; dived over to score the first try of the match. Mortlock missed the conversion and Australia led eight points to nil. Ireland is awarded a penalty in the 29th minute which sees &lt;a href="w%3ARonan%20O%27Gara"&gt;Ronan O'Gara&lt;/a&gt; successfully kick a goal for Ireland, getting its first points of the game bringing the score to eight to three, with Australia having a five point lead. Australia furthers its lead when Mortlock is successful with another penalty goal around five minutes before half time. The teams entered half time, with Australia in front, 11 points to three.

Ireland is quick to get back into the match, with a try to O'Gara in the 42nd minute. Although the conversion is missed, Ireland has moved closer to Australia, with the score narrowed to 11 points to eight. Ireland scores again in the 51st minute, with &lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Best"&gt;Neil Best&lt;/a&gt; scoring a try, and along with O'Gara's successful conversion, Ireland is now in front, 15 to 11, with just under 30 minutes remaining in the match. Australia is quick to respond, with &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Gerrard"&gt;Mark Gerrard&lt;/a&gt; scoring a try a few minutes later. Mortlock is successful with the conversion, and Australia takes back the lead, with the score now at 18 to 11. Prop &lt;a href="w%3AGreg%20Holmes"&gt;Greg Holmes&lt;/a&gt; gathers a loose ball and runs over 50m to score for Australia. Mortlock converts and Australia leads 25 to 15 with around 20 minutes remaining. &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Gregan"&gt;George Gregan&lt;/a&gt; scores a try for Australia in the 67th minute, with Mortlock missing the conversion, Australia now leads 30 to 15, making an Irish comeback unlikely, with just over ten minutes left in the match. &lt;a href="w%3ACameron%20Shepherd"&gt;Cameron Shepherd&lt;/a&gt; scores the last try of the match, which is converted by Mortlock, making the final score 37 to 15.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; came from behind at half-time to defeat &lt;a href="w%3AArgentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; test match at &lt;a href="w%3AVelez%20Sarsfield%20Stadium"&gt;Velez Sarsfield Stadium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABuenos%20Aires"&gt;Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;. The All Blacks had just completed a two to nil test series win over &lt;a href="w%3AIreland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, and Argentina had were also coming off a two test series win, over &lt;a href="w%3AWales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;. 15 of New Zealand's 25 points came from &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carter"&gt;Daniel Carter&lt;/a&gt;.

Argentina moved to an early lead with &lt;a href="w%3AFederico%20Todeschini"&gt;Federico Todeschini&lt;/a&gt; kicking a penalty goal after five minutes of play. The scores were leveled by Daniel Carter in the 9th minte with a penalty goal for New Zealand. Full-back &lt;a href="w%3ALeon%20McDonald"&gt;Leon McDonald&lt;/a&gt; scored the first &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; of the match to put the All Blacks in front. A successful penalty goal by Todeschini in the 18th minute narrowed the All Blacks' lead. Argentina moved in front with a try to &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Durand"&gt;Martin Durand&lt;/a&gt; in the 20th minute, with Todeschini adding the conversion. Argentina's lead was extended with another successful penalty goal by Todeschini in the 29th minute. The All Blacks were able to fight back in the remaining ten minutes of the first half, with a try to Carter in the 30th minute, which he also converted. Argentina entered half-time, leading 16 to 15.

The All Blacks picked up where they left off in the latter stages of the first half, with a try to &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Hamilton"&gt;Scott Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; eight minutes into the second half, which was converted by Carter. Todeschini was successful with penalty goal in the 52nd minute, as was Carter for the All Blacks five minutes later. Two yellow cards were given out during the last fifteen minutes of the game with &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Nunez%20Piossek"&gt;Jose Nunez Piossek&lt;/a&gt; of Argentina getting the first, and All Blacks' try scorer McDonald getting one a few minutes later. The score remained 25 to 19 through to the end of the match to see the All Blacks hold onto the win.

<h1>Ex CIA aide: Tenet misled Powell on evidence for mobile labs</h1>

Former &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; Director &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Tenet"&gt;George Tenet&lt;/a&gt; and Deputy Director, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20E.%20McLaughlin"&gt;John E. McLaughlin&lt;/a&gt; lied to then Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3AColin%20Powell"&gt;Colin Powell&lt;/a&gt; about the depth of evidence regarding mobile chemical weapons labs built by Iraq for germ warfare, according to a story published today in the &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. 

In their briefings to Powell on Feb. 4, 2003, one day before the secretary's &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; speech, Tenet and McLaughlin told Powell the evidence on the mobile labs was exceptionally strong, based on multiple sources whose stories were independently corroborated. According ex-CIA officer &lt;a href="w%3ATyler%20Drumheller"&gt;Tyler Drumheller&lt;/a&gt;, McLaughlin knew this was not true. A few days earlier, Tyler says, McLaughlin became alarmed at discovering there was only one tangible source of information on the labs. Tenet's knowledge on lab intelligence is not well known, except that he strongly supported the veracity of reports on chemical weapons labs. 

In a late-night check of the facts, the night before Powell's speech, Tenet called CIA officer Tyler Drumheller. When the subject of the mobile labs came up, Drumheller told Tenet about the unreliability of the information, but Tenet seemed distracted and tired and told him not to worry.

Tenet and McLaughlin both deny the account given by Drumheller. McLaughlin says he cannot remember anyone making the problem clear to him prior to the UN speech. Drumheller says he had spelled out the problem to McLaughlin, in an ad-hoc meeting held in McLaughlin's office with one other person present. Tenet responded to questions on this story by providing the Washington Post with a statement he had given in response to the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Intelligence%20Commission"&gt;Silberman-Robb Commission&lt;/a&gt;, in which he said he didn't learn of the problems with &lt;a href="w%3ACurveball%20%28informant%29"&gt;Curveball&lt;/a&gt; until much later. He did not recall talking to Drumheller about Curveball, and said it was "simply wrong" for anyone to imply that he knew about the problems with Curveball's credibility.

From the statements made, one can conclude that either Drumheller is lying or Tenet and McLaughlin told Powell they had more evidence on the chemical weapons labs than they actually did have.

&lt;a href="w%3AArcelor"&gt;Arcelor&lt;/a&gt;, Luxembourg's largest steel company, has reached in an agreement with &lt;a href="w%3AMittal%20Steel%20Company"&gt;Mittal Steel&lt;/a&gt; over a €26.9 billion merger (at €40.44 per share). The new company will be called &lt;a href="w%3AArcelor-Mittal"&gt;Arcelor-Mittal&lt;/a&gt;. Mittal Steel will hold 45% stake in the new company. Arcelor would pay &lt;a href="w%3ASeverstal"&gt;Severstal&lt;/a&gt; €130 million as a "fine" for the fall-out of their failed talks. Lakshmi Mittal (owner of Mittal Steel) and Joseph Kinsch (current Arcelor chairman) will be the co-chairmen of the new company. The new company will have a net capacity of 120 million tonnes.

United State president &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; kicked off the 2006 Tee Ball on South Lawn season Friday, June 23, 2006. This is the sixth year of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Tee Ball Initiative.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope's&lt;/a&gt; (HST) main camera has ceased to function. 

The telescope revolutionized &lt;a href="w%3Aastronomy"&gt;astronomy&lt;/a&gt; with its stunning pictures of the universe. It has three separate electronic cameras and a collection of filters and light dispersers that are used to photograph distant celestial objects. The third-generation instrument installed by a space shuttle crew in 2002 went off line Monday. Engineers are still working to rectify the situation, but have not yet identified the source of the problem. The other two cameras are being used while repair efforts on the main camera continue.

"It's still off line today," said Max Mutchler, an instruments specialist at the &lt;a href="w%3ASpace%20Telescope%20Science%20Institute"&gt;Space Telescope Science Institute&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;.

The cause of the main camera's malfunction may be a faulty transistor or a disruption to the camera's memory. "Both possibilities are things that can be resolved here on the ground," said Ed Campion, a &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; spokesman at the &lt;a href="w%3AGoddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center"&gt;Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt; outside Washington, D.C. He also told the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; Saturday that "he was hopeful the problem on the space-based telescope could be fixed from the ground."

A solution could come as early as June 30.

NASA scientists say the studies being carried out with the Hubble will not be harmed, just the order reshuffled.

Hubble, launched in April 1990, is beginning to show its age. It needs new batteries and &lt;a href="w%3AGyroscope"&gt;gyroscopes&lt;/a&gt; if it is to keep working beyond next year. 

Early last year it was announced that Hubble would be cut from NASA's 2006 fiscal year budget. However, there have been questions about the future of Hubble, with the famous space telescope in need of service and power if it is to continue to be active in 2007.

For the neutral &lt;a href="w%3Afootball"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; fan the game was not especially attractive to look at. There were only 7 shots on target in the 90 minutes and neither team controlled the play well. The scrappy match was broken by up 37 fouls.

The game had temperatures at around 90 degrees &lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit"&gt;Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt;, which caused several English players, including Beckham, to suffer from heat exhaustion and dehydration. Beckham was sick on the pitch shortly after his goal and was substituted before the end. &lt;a href="http%3A//soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story%3Fid%3D372503%26amp%3Bcc%3D5901"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Ecuador had the best of the first 45 minutes. The slow tempo of the game seemed to lead to simple errors of concentration from England and favoured Ecuador's passing play. 

Ecuador had slightly more ball possession over the game and also the first chance. &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Terry"&gt;John Terry&lt;/a&gt;'s back header to his keeper fell short but &lt;a href="w%3AAshley%20Cole"&gt;Ashley Cole&lt;/a&gt; slid in to deflect &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Tenorio"&gt;Carlos Tenorio&lt;/a&gt;'s shot onto &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Robinson"&gt;Paul Robinson&lt;/a&gt;'s crossbar.

In the second half England put more pressure on Ecuador's goal. However, passes into lone striker &lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Rooney"&gt;Wayne Rooney&lt;/a&gt; – who played 90 minutes for the first time since he recovered from injury – were often off-target. 

England's best chance to score from free play followed Wayne Rooney trickery on the left touchline. The striker evaded his marker but &lt;a href="w%3AFrank%20Lampard"&gt;Frank Lampard&lt;/a&gt; spooned Rooney's cut back high over the bar.

Beckham's free kick was a trademark fast curled pass from over 30 yards which beat the opposition wall and took a small touch off the fingertips of &lt;a href="w%3ACristian%20Mora"&gt;Cristian Mora&lt;/a&gt; before nestling into the bottom right corner of the net. The goal meant David Beckham had broken an English record by scoring in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 World Cups, the first English player ever to score in three different World Cups.

England were scheduled to meet the winner of game 52, &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, in the quarter-final of the World Cup in &lt;a href="w%3AGelsenkirchen"&gt;Gelsenkirchen&lt;/a&gt; on July 1.

For the first time in his career, &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; won the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Canadian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3ACircuit%20Gilles%20Villeneuve"&gt;Circuit Gilles Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt; on an island in the &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Lawrence%20River"&gt;St. Lawrence River&lt;/a&gt;.

Alonso once again had a great race, driving in the lead for the most of the race. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; started fifth, but finished before &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20Raikkonen"&gt;Kimi Raikkonen&lt;/a&gt;, who made a crucial mistake on the last lap. Alonso teammate &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisicella&lt;/a&gt; finished on the back of Raikkonen, because of a bad start from the second place and a "drive through pit-lane" penalty imposed by a false start.

Canadian fans were absolutely upset when &lt;a href="w%3AJacque%20Villeneuve"&gt;Jacque Villeneuve&lt;/a&gt; crashed on the dying laps of the race, causing a safety car to close the gap between Raikkonen and Schumacher.

Four &lt;a href="w%3Apelican"&gt;pelicans&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, are being tested at a Southern California wildlife centre under the suspicion that they may be drunk on &lt;a href="w%3Aalgae"&gt;sea algae&lt;/a&gt;. The concerns were raised after one of the pelicans ran head first into a vehicle.

Three of the pelicans were noticed wandering around the streets of &lt;a href="w%3ALaguna%20Beach"&gt;Laguna Beach&lt;/a&gt; dazed, and the fourth suffered numerous internal injuries and cuts after its' encounter with the windshield of an oncoming vehicle.

The four seabirds are being tested for the presence of sea algae, which can produce &lt;a href="w%3Adomoic%20acid"&gt;domoic acid&lt;/a&gt; poisoning when eaten - causing the dazed, drunken effect in the birds. Assistant Wildlife Director Lisa Birkle has warned the public to stay on the lookout for any birds acting in a disorientated or "drunken" manner.

&lt;a href="w%3ADomoic%20acid"&gt;Domoic acid&lt;/a&gt; poisoning is also thought to be behind the cause of a 1961 seabird attack on people and cars in &lt;a href="w%3ACapitola"&gt;Capitola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

Russian referee Valentin Ivanov warmed up for an active evening of arm-raising with yellow cards in the second and seventh minutes. Mark Van Bommel and Khalid Boulahrouz had crashed two heavy fouls on Christiano Ronaldo; the second left a stud mark on his right thigh.

At the end of 96 minutes the yellow card count was 16 and the sides had nine men each. The four players sent off was a total that set a new Fifa World Cup record. This came as the 2006 tournament had already seen two games with three red cards. All four red cards were shown for two cautionary acts. 

Following the second Boulahrouz foul Ronaldo received treatment and would be substituted before half time. 

However; Ronaldo was involved in a wonderful move that lead to Portugal's game-winner. On 22 minutes he fed Deco, Deco crossed low to Pauleta; Pauleta laid it off, and Maniche side-stepped a defender to hammer past Edwin Van Der Sar from 12 yards. Maniche was spared his second yellow card, and subsequent, expulsion when the referee decided not to execute the FIFA guidelines for leaving the pitch during celebrations of a goal.

Portugal also scored first blood when Ivanov's red card was brandished at Costinha for stopping a pass with his arm, after he escaped a second yellow card just minutes earlier after his second rough tackle of the day.

Though Portugal looked dangerous on the break the game was dominated by the Netherlands who had over 60 per cent of ball possession.

In the second period there was less flow and more stoppages. The main incidents were violent and many times players surrounded the referee adding to the disruption.

On 59 minutes there was shoving after Portugal was awarded a free kick in shooting range of Edwin Van Der Sar's goal. In the scrum Luis Figo gave a headbutt to Van Bommel but was only shown a yellow card. Three minutes later the same Figo appeared to walk into an upper arm from Boularouz and Boularouz was sent off. 

Deco was next to go with two cards in quick succession. Ricardo Carvalho made a lunge to block one of the Netherlands 20 shots at goal. The Portuguese didn't stop for treatment, so the referee blew his whistle so the defender could get treatment. 

Netherlands bucked the informal tradition of giving the ball back and Deco's response was a lunge at John Heitinga. This incident kicked off another melee in which Wesley Sneijder was booked when he pushed Petit to the floor. 

Five minutes after his first caution Deco was sent to the touchline for holding on to the ball when the Dutch players wanted to resume playing.

Twice up by an extra man the Netherlands did not beat the Portuguese goal keeper Ricardo. They went close. Three minutes after half time an unmarked Philip Cocu struck the crossbar in the rebound from six yards. After Deco's dismissal Dirk Kuyt ran through the central-defense but was foiled by a challenge from the goalkeeper.

In the final of the six minutes of added time Portugal worked another counter attack and Giovanni Van Bronckhorst got tangled with Simao's legs. Ivanov produced his fourth red card.

The victory for Portugal put them on a head-to-head with England in the quarter-finals, but at a cost. Luiz Felipe Scolari's side would miss Deco and Costinha with suspensions for that match while Ronaldo would be an injury worry.

Police in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; have arrested a 22-year-old man following an incident in &lt;a href="w%3ANarrabeen%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Narrabeen&lt;/a&gt;, a Northern suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. Police allege the man dragged a dead &lt;a href="w%3Apossum"&gt;possum&lt;/a&gt; behind his car along a busy Sydney road.

According to a police statement, a number of citizens contacted them after seeing a vehicle driving along the Wakehurst Parkway in Narabeen with what appeared to be an animal tied to the rear. The police were told that the animal was dragged for several hundred metres before breaking free from the rope.

After receiving further information from the public, police found the body of a &lt;a href="w%3ACommon%20Brushtail%20Possum"&gt;brush tail possum&lt;/a&gt; on the side of the road. Witnesses then provided police with further information that assisted them to locate a 22-year-old male, believed to have been driving the vehicle the possum was tied to.

Police attended a house where the man was staying and took him to &lt;a href="w%3ADee%20Why%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Dee Why&lt;/a&gt; police station where he was interviewed. Police have stated that another three youths have been interviewed regarding the incident.

The 22 year-old man was charged with offensive conduct and is to appear in court on a later date. Under NSW law, the maximum penalty the man faces is 3 months in jail or an &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$660 fine.

Police and the &lt;a href="w%3ARSPCA"&gt;RSPCA&lt;/a&gt; will conduct an &lt;a href="w%3AAutopsy"&gt;autopsy&lt;/a&gt; on the possum, which they expect will confirm that the possum was already dead before being dragged.

&lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Reserve Bank of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; Governor, &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Bollard"&gt;Dr. Alan Bollard&lt;/a&gt;, says that the price of New Zealand houses is to fall after a meeting of central bankers at &lt;a href="w%3ASwitzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;.

Dr. Bollard told &lt;a href="w%3ABloomberg%20Television"&gt;Bloomberg Television&lt;/a&gt;, "house prices will start falling by the end of the year, as higher &lt;a href="w%3Ainterest%20rates"&gt;interest rates&lt;/a&gt; start to bite."

He continues, "house price inflation has been a key driver of &lt;a href="w%3Amonetary%20policy"&gt;monetary policy&lt;/a&gt;, with prices rising by 69% between 2000 and 2005 according to OECD figures."

Dr. Bollard comments, alongside an &lt;a href="w%3AOECD"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt; report, that &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has the most vulnerable property market in the world.

&lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Buffett"&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;/a&gt;, the billionaire investor of &lt;a href="w%3ABerkshire%20Hathaway"&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, announced on June 25 to &lt;a href="w%3AFortune%20magazine"&gt;Fortune magazine&lt;/a&gt; that he would be donating a total of $37 billion (&lt;a href="w%3AUSD"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;) to the &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20and%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation"&gt;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, which is already worth over $29 billion, and other charities. Buffett, at 75, is one of the richest people on the planet with a fortune estimated at $44 billion. Buffett previously stated that he would give a mass portion of his wealth away to &lt;a href="w%3Aphilanthropy"&gt;philanthropic&lt;/a&gt; purposes in his will when he died.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Martin"&gt;Sir George Martin&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href="w%3AGiles%20Martin"&gt;Giles&lt;/a&gt; are reported to be working on a new &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Beatles"&gt;Beatles&lt;/a&gt; album, which is scheduled to be released by The Beatles' company &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Corps"&gt;Apple Corps&lt;/a&gt; through later this year. 

The album will be based on the new show by , entitled &lt;a href="w%3ALOVE%20%28Cirque%20du%20Soleil%29"&gt;♡❤LOVE♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, which will feature remixed versions of The Beatles' songs. Some observers have stated that the album, which is being put together from the original &lt;a href="w%3AMaster%20recording"&gt;master recordings&lt;/a&gt;, may well be the closest thing to an original Beatles album since the legendary band's break up. 

The album will be released in November.

In a pre-dawn, cross border &lt;a href="w%3Araid"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Amilitant"&gt;militants&lt;/a&gt; on an &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Amilitary"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; position near &lt;a href="w%3AKerem%20Shalom"&gt;Kerem Shalom&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, two Israeli soldiers and two Palestinian gunmen were killed. A number of Israeli soldiers were wounded and a 19-year-old Israeli Soldier, Corporal &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt; was taken captive. He had been in the army for 11 months, and is the first Israeli soldier to be taken captive since 1994. &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href="w%3AIzz%20ad-Din%20al-Qassam"&gt;Izz ad-Din al-Qassam&lt;/a&gt; Brigades, the &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Resistance%20Committee"&gt;Popular Resistance Committees&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AArmy%20of%20Islam"&gt;Army of Islam&lt;/a&gt; have claimed responsibility for the raid and Gilad Shalit's subsequent capture, although they have not confirmed that they are holding him themselves. Hamas claimed that the operation was in response to the recent deaths of civilians and the targeted killings of two militant leaders.

The raid followed the detention by Israeli forces of two Palestinians claimed to be Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip the previous day in what was Israel's first military incursion into Palestinian territory since its &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20disengagement"&gt;disengagement&lt;/a&gt; in 2005. 

At least seven Palestinian militants took part in the attack, gaining entry into Israel via a more than 300-metre-long tunnel from the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;. After crossing the border via the tunnel, the &lt;a href="w%3Amilitant"&gt;militants&lt;/a&gt; split into three groups and attacked a watch tower and an empty armoured personnel Carrier; while the third group attacked a tank with &lt;a href="w%3Arocket%20propelled%20grenades"&gt;Rocket propelled grenade&lt;/a&gt;. Two militants died during the raid.

Two Israeli soldiers, Lieutenant Hanan Barak, and Staff Sergeant Pavel Slutsker, both 20 years old, died in the attack on the tank. The missing soldier was a tank gunner. A fourth member of the group was seriously injured.

Israel has responded by incursions into the Gaza Strip and air strikes on bridges and the major power station in the search for their missing soldier who is thought to be alive following &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; announcements. Currently, the militants are reportedly demanding, "First, the immediate release of all women in prison. Second, the immediate release of all children in prison younger than 18.", until they release the Israeli soldier. The Popular Resistance Committees stated that they would execute a kidnapped Israeli settler, seized in the West Bank, if the Israeli Army moved in. Israeli police have not confirmed this claim, but are investigating the disappearance of an 18 year old settler.

It is believed that Israel is holding approximately 100 women and 300 individuals under 18 among the over 9 000 Palestinians incarcerated in Israeli facilities. Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; said in a speech in Jerusalem, "The question of freeing [Palestinian] prisoners is in no way on the Israeli government agenda. There will be no negotiations, no bargaining, no agreements." He also has prepared the Israeli army for an extensive operation. "The time is approaching for a comprehensive, sharp and severe Israeli operation. We will not wait forever," Mr Olmert said.

US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has urged Israel to give diplomacy a chance to win the release of the tank gunner.

Other countries have been attempting to broker the soldier's release. Hoping to head off a potentially major conflict, Egypt has been trying to negotiate Shalit's release. So has France, as the conscript has French as well as Israeli citizenship.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt;ese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMari%20Alkatiri"&gt;Mari Alkatiri&lt;/a&gt; has resigned from his position. He cited the growing violence and the threat by President &lt;a href="w%3AXanana%20Gusmao"&gt;Xanana Gusmão&lt;/a&gt; to resign if he did not.

"I am assuming my own share of responsibility for the crisis affecting our country, I am determined not to contribute to any deepening of the crisis," said Mr Alkatiri.

The news of the Prime Minister's imminent departure comes after the Foreign Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Ramos%20Horta"&gt;Jose Ramos Horta&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href="w%3ANobel%20Peace%20Prize"&gt;Nobel Peace Prize&lt;/a&gt; winner, resigned from his position earlier in the week stating he could not work with Alkatiri. He resigned by means of an &lt;a href="w%3AShort%20message%20service"&gt;SMS text message&lt;/a&gt; to Prime Minister Alkatiri.

The resignation was greeted by cheers and drum beats by thousands in celebration. Around 200 buses and vans drove through East Timor's capital city of &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt; with their horns sounding. Alkatiri is widely blamed for the violence that erupted in &lt;a href="w%3ADili"&gt;Dili&lt;/a&gt; in May.

Today, the Internet news site &lt;a href="w%3ADigg"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt; launched the third version of its site, which sees it expanding from exclusively technology-related news into tech, entertainment, world, business and science news. The site has also had a redesign.

This received a negative response from the majority of the &lt;a href="w%3Ablogosphere"&gt;blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;.

Last Thursday a launch party for Digg 3.0 was held at a San Francisco bar. &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rose"&gt;Kevin Rose&lt;/a&gt; gave a preview of the new version of Digg and features to come out in July, 2006. &lt;a href="w%3ADiggnation"&gt;Diggnation&lt;/a&gt; video of the launch party is located at http://videos.revision3.com/diggnation/0051/diggnation--0051--2006-06-22--small.m4v.

The famous ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABaywatch"&gt;Baywatch&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ star, &lt;a href="w%3APamela%20Anderson"&gt;Pamela Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, arrived today in &lt;a href="w%3AAthens%2C%20Greece"&gt;Athens, Greece&lt;/a&gt;, taking part in the pan-&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; promotion of the MAC cosmetic products as well as in the fight against the sprawl of &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; (AIDS). Anderson held a press conference at a central Athens Hotel, during which a 30,000-Euro check issued by the MAC AIDS Fund was handed to ♡❤Kentro Zois♡❤, a Greek non-profit organization. Later today, fans of Pamela Anderson would have the opportunity to meet her in downtown Athens, in the crowded Ermou street, in an organized appearance of the famous actress in a specific store. 

Accompanying the &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; actress in Athens is Peter Lichtenthal, MAC global general manager. Established in Toronto, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, in 1984, MAC soon flourished through cool combinations of recycling strategies and show-biz glitz. The famous &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; actress is committed to the fight against HIV/AIDS, including working with children and supporting associations such as &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals"&gt;People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals&lt;/a&gt;. MAC company's cosmetics are known for pushing the limits of the global beauty industry. The same happens when it comes to its efforts in fighting AIDS, for which the company is currently collaborating with Pamela Anderson, organizing a promotion-trip around Europe.

A fire close to the &lt;a href="w%3AKing%27s%20Cross"&gt;King's Cross&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Arailway"&gt;railway&lt;/a&gt; station in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, England has led to the station being evacuated because of fears that the fire could cause the explosion of fuel close to or in the station area. London's subway, or "tube", system is still functioning normally. At this time, one person has been injured from burns and has been hospitalised.

In a recent update on June 27, it appears that, for a second day, King's Cross will continue to be closed to passengers. The explanation for the closure is because gas cylinders near the fire and rail station were heated up and could explode. Many homes are within the 200 m radius around the site, and the station itself is about 100 m away from the fuel. The estimated 60,000 passengers per day on the station's rail lines will probably have to wait until around tomorrow (Wednesday) at noon, when the station is expected to re-open.

Since &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; was toppled in the allied &lt;a href="w%3Ainvasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aoil%20production"&gt;oil production&lt;/a&gt; figures have been bleak. However, new signs are being revealed that Iraqi oil output is at its best since the fall of Hussein. The Iraqi oil minister, &lt;a href="w%3AHussain%20al-Shahristani"&gt;Hussain al-Shahristani&lt;/a&gt;, stated that about 2.5 million barrels of oil are now produced per day, a figure that has seen a rise lately. During the invasion of Iraq, lead by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, oil output was at about 2 million barrels per day (&lt;a href="w%3Abpd"&gt;bpd&lt;/a&gt;) and before the invasion oil production ranged from 3 million to, at its peak, 3.5 million bpd&lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5117170.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Shahristani told &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; that he expects Iraqi oil exports to soon target that of the oil giant &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3ACitigroup"&gt;Citigroup&lt;/a&gt;, a large investment and banking firm, stated that, "Shahristani announced that Iraq hoped to be producing 4.3 million bpd by 2010, and perhaps less convincingly, suggested that Iraq would be challenging Saudi Arabia by 2015."&lt;a href="http%3A//today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx%3Ftype%3DbusinessNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D2006-06-26T125945Z_01_SP323974_RTRUKOC_0_US-MARKETS-OIL.xml%26amp%3Barchived%3DFalse"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Scott MacLean, an &lt;a href="w%3AOrdination"&gt;ordained&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Church%20of%20Christ"&gt;United Church of Christ&lt;/a&gt; (UCC) minister and the early morning Newscast Director at &lt;a href="w%3AWFSB-TV"&gt;WFSB-TV&lt;/a&gt;, Channel 3 in &lt;a href="w%3AHartford%2C%20Connecticut"&gt;Hartford, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, is running for the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; nomination as the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Representative"&gt;U.S. Representative&lt;/a&gt; in the Connecticut first district&lt;a href="http%3A//www.politicalgateway.com/cand.php%3Fid%3D405%26amp%3Bpage%3Dcand"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and according to an email sent by MacLean to Republicans in Connecticut, MacLean has been using First Church in Hartland Congregational UCC to hold campaign meetings.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ucctruths.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In the email, MacLean claims that "the good folks from the First Church in Hartland-Congregational (my home church) have graciously let me use the Parish Hall for campaign meetings".

This is the second church/state issue in Connecticut in the last month involving the United Church of Christ. &lt;a href="w%3AAmericans%20United%20for%20Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State"&gt;Americans United for Separation of Church and State&lt;/a&gt; is investigating a deal between the Governor of Connecticut, the UCC and the Hartford Civic Center to keep the UCC General Synod in Connecticut. According to a report in the June, 3, 2006 &lt;a href="w%3AHartford%20Courant"&gt;Hartford Courant&lt;/a&gt;, the state is "taking care of the $100,000 fee for the Civic Center" for the UCC's General &lt;a href="w%3ASynod"&gt;Synod&lt;/a&gt; next July.

The MacLean controversy also comes on the heels of a controversy in Ohio where two mega-churches are being accused of illegal political activities for their support of Republican candidate for Governor, &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Blackwell"&gt;Ken Blackwell&lt;/a&gt;. A group of Columbus clergy, headed by UCC minister Eric Williams, has filed a complaint with the &lt;a href="w%3AInternal%20Revenue%20Service"&gt;IRS&lt;/a&gt; questioning the &lt;a href="w%3Atax-exempt"&gt;tax-exempt&lt;/a&gt; status of the churches. The complaint alleges that the mega churches have used their facilities for &lt;a href="w%3APartisan%20%28political%29"&gt;partisan politics&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Italy%20win%20with%20last%20kick%20against%20Australia%3B%20into%20quarter-finals&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; A &lt;a href="w%3AFrancesco%20Totti"&gt;Francesco Totti&lt;/a&gt; penalty deep in added time put &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; through to the next round of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Fifa%20World%20Cup"&gt;2006 Fifa World Cup&lt;/a&gt; at the expense of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, Monday.

The Australian ♡❤Socceroos♡❤ had the ball more, but the more experienced ♡❤Azzuri♡❤ defenders created an impenetrable defence, limiting the number of Australian scoring opportunities. This was despite the Italian team shrinking to ten men after &lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Materazzi"&gt;Marco Materazzi&lt;/a&gt; was shown a controversial straight &lt;a href="w%3Ared%20card"&gt;red card&lt;/a&gt; in the 50th minute.

Australia looked to have gained an advantage when Marco Bresciano surged through the Italy &lt;a href="w%3Adefence"&gt;defence&lt;/a&gt; and Materazzi slid in to trip him up. Though there was an Italy defender on Bresciano's shoulder, Spanish referee &lt;a href="http%3A//fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/ref/187224_MEDINA_CANTALEJO_Luis.html"&gt;Luis Medina Cantalejo&lt;/a&gt; deemed that the tackle was deliberately not aimed at the ball, and considered the foul worth more than a single &lt;a href="w%3Ayellow%20card"&gt;yellow card&lt;/a&gt;. It would not be the only disputed decision in the match.

Both sides had a number of good opportunities to score, but the shots were generally too close to the box to beat the &lt;a href="w%3Agoalkeeper"&gt;goalkeepers&lt;/a&gt;. The best save of the game was made by &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Schwarzer"&gt;Mark Schwarzer&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href="w%3ALuca%20Toni"&gt;Luca Toni&lt;/a&gt; effort 20 minutes into the game.

&lt;a href="w%3AGuus%20Hiddink"&gt;Guus Hiddink&lt;/a&gt; delayed making attacking substitutions against ten-men Italy likely because he expected the game to go to &lt;a href="w%3Aextra%20time"&gt;extra time&lt;/a&gt;, and so wished to keep a fitness advantage later on in the game. Hiddink's only substitution, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Aloisi"&gt;John Aloisi&lt;/a&gt;, came on at the 80th minute, while the Italian coach &lt;a href="w%3AMarcello%20Lippi"&gt;Marcello Lippi&lt;/a&gt; had made three, including the crucial one of Totti five minutes earlier.

In the attack Totti was a straight swap for &lt;a href="w%3AAlessandro%20Del%20Piero"&gt;Alessandro Del Piero&lt;/a&gt;, a fresh pair of legs which ensured Italy were a threat on the break right until the end of the regular period of play. It was a tactic that paid dividends in the end.

The second disputed referee decision was a &lt;a href="w%3Apenalty%20kick"&gt;penalty kick&lt;/a&gt; was awarded to &lt;a href="w%3AFabio%20Grosso"&gt;Fabio Grosso&lt;/a&gt; three minutes into added time (and the last minute of game time). Grosso was running towards goal from out wide having avoided &lt;a href="w%3AMarco%20Bresciano"&gt;Marco Bresciano&lt;/a&gt; before being obstructed by &lt;a href="w%3ALucas%20Neill"&gt;Lucas Neill&lt;/a&gt;. The central defender had fallen to the ground early and Grosso, though not tripped, was impeded and dived straight over him. Medina awarded a penalty shot as this occurred within the penalty area.
Totti, dropped from the game in favour of Del Piero, grinned slightly as he placed the ball on the spot. The ball was struck close to the upper-right corner of Schwarzer's box, the goalie could do nothing to stop the ball. It was the last kick of the game and the Italians celebrated.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABudweiser%20Man%20of%20the%20Match"&gt;Budweiser Man of the Match&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="w%3AGianluigi%20Buffon"&gt;Gianluigi Buffon&lt;/a&gt; of Italy.

The prize was a quarter-final match against the lowest ranked FIFA team in their half of the knock-out tree, &lt;a href="w%3AUkraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.

The inaugural &lt;a href="w%3ACAR"&gt;CAR&lt;/a&gt; (Confederation of African Rugby) women's rugby 7's tournament was held in &lt;a href="w%3AKampala"&gt;Kampala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; on the 24th June 2006. &lt;a href="w%3AKenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABurundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AZambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AZimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Uganda while &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; jetted in on Friday evening. Uganda fielded two teams – Lady Cranes and a select Uganda side to replace the Nigerians who had pulled out of the tournament. 

The games kicked off at 10:00am with great weather and apart from mid morning drizzle which quickly cleared up, it was a perfect day for 7's rugby. Tournament top seeds South Africa started on the right note when they had a comfortable 26 - 00 win against 5th seeded Zambia. Looking decidedly rusty in the game against their southern sisters, South Africa however steadily improved as the tournament progressed. Their disciplined defence, ball handling skills and excellent team work made them stand out and it was clear that this was the team to beat. South Africa beat a gritty Uganda Select side 22 – 05 and finished off their preliminary games with a 14 – 00 win over 4th seeds Kenya leaving them top of Pool A.

Kenya, whose men's 7's side are a regular inclusion in the IRB 7's circuit, also had comfortable wins over Uganda Select and Zambia beating them 33 – 00 and 22 – 00 to finish 2nd in Pool A. Zambia's only win in the group stages was against Uganda Select whom they beat 21 – 00. Zambia and Uganda Select were 3rd and 4tth respectively in Pool A.

Pool B had second seeds Lady Cranes (Uganda) outplaying 3rd seeds Zimbabwe and Burundi. The Lady Cranes were determined to keep their unbeaten record and showed themselves a cut above the other teams in their pool in terms of pace and superior ball handling skills. Burundi was thrashed 56 – 00 while Zimbabwe were eclipsed by a similar margin of 54 – 00. Rwanda almost threatened to upset the East African queens and made the Ugandans work for a 24 – 05 victory. Rwanda is the fastest improving team in East Africa and showed their intent when they comfortably beat Zimbabwe 25 – 00 and hammered their hapless neighbours, Burundi, 41 – 00. Zimbabwe beat Burundi 15 – 00 in a scrappy game that highlighted the large gap between the two sides and the other teams in this tournament. Although Zimbabwe had the requisite skills they were unpolished and unfit while the Burundians had a very young enthusiastic squad who are yet to master the basics of the game. Lady Cranes topped Pool A, Rwanda was 2nd with Zimbabwe and Burundi 3rd and 4th respectively. 

The first Plate trophy semi final matched Zambia against Burundi. Zambia easily disposed of the East Africans in one sided affair and humiliated Burundi 55 – 00. The second semi final was slightly more competitive and once again against pitted Southern Africa against East Africa. Uganda Select won their second game of the tournament when they beat Zimbabwe 22 – 00 to join Zambia in the Plate final. 

The 1st Main Cup semi final was another one sided match with South Africa running all over the tired Rwandese to win 46 – 00. Rwanda paid the price of depending solely on one player (teenage sensation Angelique Nzabamita) to win their games as the speedy winger was too fatigued at this stage to make any impact as she had been doing in the earlier games. There was a small consolation for Rwanda at the end of the tournament as Angelique Nzabamita was awarded the Top Try Scorers trophy.
The most exciting game of the tournament was perhaps the 2nd Main Cup semi final that was between arch rivals Uganda and Kenya. Ugandan fans expected the lighter, fleet footed Ugandans to run rings around their East African neighbours as they had done so frequently in the past. Those expectations were almost fulfilled when Uganda outpaced the Kenyans to score 2 tries (one of them a penalty try) in the first half and converted one to lead 12 – 00. Apart from Zimbabwe, the Kenyans were perhaps the heaviest girls in the tournament but their fitness was several notches above that of the southerners and they had pace and determination to go with it. The Kenyans recovered and sped their way to two tries one of which was converted to level the game at 12 -12 just before half time. After the half time break, Lady Cranes sought to put an end to the tension and went ahead with a try that was not converted. Kenya however dug their heels in and Doreen Remour, who was outstanding throughout the tournament for the Kenyans, equalised taking the game into sudden death extra time. Although exhausted both teams put up an excellent display of rugby, neither ready to give way to the other with the first half of extra time ending after 3 minutes with the teams still deadlocked at 17 – 17. In the second half, Sauda Adiru broke through a valiant Kenyan defence to score a try for the Lady Cranes and put an end to Kenya's hopes.

The Plate Final had Zambia taking on Uganda Select. The Ugandan second side had done very well to get this far and was eager to avenge their earlier loss to Zambia in the preliminary games. However, Zambia had been improving steadily with each game and was determined to take some silverware home. They were faster and more aggressive than the Ugandans and thumped them 33 – 00 to lift the Plate trophy.

The Main Cup Final was the game all the fans had been waiting to see: the Southern African queens versus the East African queens. The two teams were evenly matched for speed but the South Africans had superior ball skills, fluid teamwork and a tighter defence pattern. The first half was a tightly contested 10 minutes with South Africa drawing first blood with a try that they were unable to convert. Uganda responded with a well worked try and converted to give themselves a slim 2 point lead at half time. However, after half time, South Africa's well marshalled defence kept out the Ugandan speedsters and on attack they displayed slick moves that split open the Uganda defence to let them through for 2 more unconverted tries (one of them a penalty try) to win the game 15 – 07 and become the African 7's champions. The tournament's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award deservedly went to Charmaine Keyser from South Africa who dazzled players and spectators alike with her speed and great all round rugby skills. 

All in all, it was a historic day filled with fantastic rugby and a large step forward for women's rugby in Africa. Hopefully further editions of the CAR 7's will include teams from Western and Northern Africa. With the 2009 IRB &lt;a href="w%3A7%27s%20Rugby%20World%20Cup"&gt;7's Rugby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; including a women's competition, then this is definitely a step in the right direction.

Both teams started the game knowing their round of sixteen opponents were not ranked in the &lt;a href="w%3AFifa%20top%2010"&gt;Fifa top 10&lt;/a&gt; and appeared determined not to make mistakes. Tackles went in quick and hard but no side took any risks to win the game.

The statistics suggest Switzerland had more shots but they arguably were the more defensive team as they had started with one forward, Alexander Frei, whereas the Ukraine had three.

Frei's single shot came from a first period &lt;a href="w%3Afreekick"&gt;free kick&lt;/a&gt; which shook Oleksandr Shovkovskyi's lintel. Ukraine's forward men amassed six shots; &lt;a href="w%3AAndriy%20Shevchenko"&gt;Andriy Shevchenko&lt;/a&gt; went closest on 20 minutes when his diving header came off the ground and onto the crossbar.

Ukraine did not play well and despite their more attack-minded formation were so wasteful with possession that they made statistically fewer chances than the Swiss with their &lt;a href="w%3A4-5-1"&gt;4-5-1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aformation"&gt;formation&lt;/a&gt;. Switzerland had 55 per cent of the ball in the game. 

From a viewer's perspective the Mexican referee &lt;a href="w%3ABenito%20Archundia"&gt;Benito Archundia&lt;/a&gt; was lenient with tough challenges. A game with 44 fouls - one every three minutes - had only one yellow card. The yellow card was awarded on the hour to Tranquillo Barnetta for pushing a Ukrainian player as he ran toward the penalty area.

15 minutes each way for extra-time was not used effectively by the teams; neither side attacked hard and in the second period there were no shots at all. Switzerland almost got one but Andriy Gusin blocked Marco Streller 12 yards from goal.

Ukraine took and missed the first penalty but won the shootout 3-0 after Artem Milevskiy scored first with a impudent chip down the middle. For the Swiss Barnetta hit the bar, and then Shovkovskyi made two saves low to his right and left to send Ukraine through to a quarter-final match against Italy.

Switzerland was eliminated from World Cup competition without having conceded a goal during the entire tournament (excluding penalty shootout goals), the first time this has happened in World Cup history.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; government officials have announced that it will give &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20dollar"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;160,000 in aid to help farmers who were affected by the huge amounts of snow in &lt;a href="w%3ACanterbury%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Canterbury, New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago.

The aid package will provide four regional offices for co-ordination, food supplies and ongoing support.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFederated%20Farmers"&gt;Federated Farmers&lt;/a&gt; for mid Canterbury say that the aid will be a start to what looks like a tough winter. President of the mid Canterbury Federated Farmers Rupert Curd says, "It is too early to say exactly how much help the relief package will provide."

The snow has not yet reached a crisis point.

The Insurance Council has estimated the cost of the snow storm has reached $35 million so far. Chief Executive of the Insurance Council says, "There has been damage to homes, commercial premises both on farms and in town and vehicles. Businesspeople who have been without power are also claiming for loss of income."

The &lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20of%20Agriculture"&gt;Minister of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Anderton"&gt;Jim Anderton&lt;/a&gt; has said that they are not ruling out giving further aid.

He is the country's youngest Prime Minister since 1975, when Vietnam was unified, and is replacing the 72 year-old &lt;a href="w%3APhan%20Van%20Khai"&gt;Phan Van Khai&lt;/a&gt;.

63 year-old &lt;a href="w%3ANguyen%20Minh%20Triet"&gt;Nguyen Minh Triet&lt;/a&gt;, who is an economic reformer and the &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist"&gt;Communist&lt;/a&gt; Party Chief for &lt;a href="w%3AHo%20Chi%20Minh%20City"&gt;Ho Chi Minh City&lt;/a&gt;, was appointed as the country's president yesterday, with a majority vote of 94% by the Assembly. He replaces the 69 year-old &lt;a href="w%3ATran%20Duc%20Luong"&gt;Tran Duc Luong&lt;/a&gt;.

In a speech to the National Assembly, Mr Dung said: "Our urgent task is to quickly develop in a sustainable way and pull the country out of backwardness and fight corruption". It is expected that Mr Dung and Mr Triet will be looking ahead to the countries' expected entry into the World Trade Organisation, and dealing with the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) conference being hosted in Vietnam in November.

The two appointments mark major changes in the Communist leadership of Vietnam in order to bring in younger leaders for the country. The two appointments also mark the first time that the country has been ruled by two people from Southern Vietnam since the unification.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; Minister for Vocational Education and Training, Gary Hardgrave has announced the government will provide &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;15.8 million to establish an &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Technical%20Colleges"&gt;Australian Technical College&lt;/a&gt; in North &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;. The minister said the government was entering into a partnership with the Archdiocese of Adelaide and consortium of industrial and manufacturing companies.

The North Adelaide college will be located in &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%2C%20South%20Australia"&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt; and be operated as an independent non-government school. The college is one of 25 to be established across the country.

Enrolments at the college will begin in 2007 and will offer courses in areas where identified skills shortages exist in the North Adelaide region, specifically - engineering, construction, electronics and cooking.

Mr Hardgrave said that the proposed college had been popular among the North Adelaide business community. “This important initiative has been well received by North Adelaide business and industry, and will help to address skills needs and provide opportunities for those in greatest need, including a lot of Indigenous students in the region," Mr Hardgrave said.

“The fact that this College is being led by local employers, local government and other key stakeholders, means it will be truly industry and community driven," he said.

Australian Technical Colleges were established to cater for year 11 and 12 students who wish to do an apprenticeship as part of their school education. 

The Australian Education Union has expressed a number of concerns about the model put forward by the government. In a report, they claim that trade facilities at TAFE colleges (operated by state governments) will deteriorate as funding is diverted to the ATCs. The union is also concerned that ATCs are supposed to be selective VET schools. According to the union they will have selective entry and preferential funding. It is feared that teachers will be lured away from schools and TAFE colleges to higher paid positions in ATCs.

The Education Union suggested that the government invest in schools that already offer vocational education programs.

A woman with a &lt;a href="w%3ABlood%20alcohol%20content"&gt;blood alcohol reading&lt;/a&gt; of 0.14 has been arrested and charged after crashing into a police car in &lt;a href="w%3AKings%20Cross%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Kings Cross&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb of Eastern &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; early this morning.

Police officials claim the 27 year old woman was driving a &lt;a href="w%3AVolkswagen"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; the wrong way down a one way street when she collided with a police car parked outside Kings Cross Police Station. Following the collision, the woman drove off. Police later found the woman's car in a nearby alleyway where she and a male were standing.

Both the woman and her companion were taken to Kings Cross Police Station where they were questioned about the incident. While at the station, police conducted a &lt;a href="w%3ABreathalyzer"&gt;breath test&lt;/a&gt; on the woman, which returned a reading of 0.14 - almost 3 times the blood alcohol limit of 0.05 in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;. Further investigation revealed that the woman did not hold a driver's licence.

The woman was charged with mid-range PCA (driving under the influence of alcohol), driving whilst unlicensed and failing to give particulars after an accident.

The woman was not injured in the accident and the police car suffered only minor damage.

&lt;a href="w%3AMauritanians"&gt;Mauritanians&lt;/a&gt; voted in favour of a new &lt;a href="w%3Aconstitution"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt; by an overwhelming majority in a referendum held on June 26, according to results announced by Interior Ministry officials today. The new Constitution sets limits on the number of presidential terms a leader can serve, in contrast to several sub-Saharan countries, where several leaders have amended their Constitutions to retain power.

The Interior Minister, Mohamed Ahmed Ould Mohamed Lemine said that over 96 percent votes cast were in favour of the new Constitution. The turnout was over 76 percent of the close to One million registered voters, who constitute about a third of the country's population.

The referendum is being held as part of a transition from the country's present military government to a civilian one. The present government was formed in August 2005 in a bloodless military coup led by Col. &lt;a href="w%3AEly%20Ould%20Mohamed%20Vall"&gt;Ely Ould Mohamed Vall&lt;/a&gt;, which ended then President &lt;a href="w%3AMaaouya%20Ould%20Sid%27Ahmed%20Taya"&gt;Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya&lt;/a&gt;'s 21 years of strong-arm rule. The reforms voted upon must now be approved by the country's constitutional council. The new Constitution is to replace the 1991 one.

The referendum will now lead to municipal and legislative elections to be held in November, followed by elections to the parliamentary upper house and the President's post in 2007.

The new Constitution provides for a &lt;a href="w%3Apresidential%20government"&gt;presidential form&lt;/a&gt; of government, with the President commanding significant powers, including the appointment of the prime minister. The Parliament though, can vote for no confidence in the government or censure it. The Constitution disallows members of the present junta from running for the President's post and requires future leaders to swear on the &lt;a href="w%3AQuran"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt; that they will not amend the Constitution to stay in power. 

International observers from the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20League"&gt;Arab League&lt;/a&gt; said that the referendum appeared to have gone smoothly, but have yet to make their final reports.

President Ely Ould Mohamed Vall, who also voted in the referendum said, "This is a great day and a rebirth for Mauritania ... I am sure that all Mauritanians feel the same way and that for this reason the Constitution will receive massive support." and reiterated that "whatever the result I shall respect my promise" to return power to civilians in 2007.

The Constitution has the backing of most civic and political groups, though two small parties called for a boycott of the referendum, saying the proposed Constitution ignores slavery, which is officially banned but still persists according to activists; and issues of "cohabitation between the different national communities" (such as &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20people"&gt;Blacks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AArabs"&gt;Arabs&lt;/a&gt;).

Chinese &lt;a href="w%3AiPod"&gt;iPod&lt;/a&gt; maker &lt;a href="w%3AFoxconn"&gt;Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;, apparently named by the local &lt;a href="w%3AShenzhen"&gt;Shenzhen&lt;/a&gt; government as a "role model," has admitted employees work about 80 extra hours each month, "which is against the law in &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;," says China CSR.

Britain's the &lt;a href="w%3AMail%20on%20Sunday"&gt;Mail on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; said the Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, aka Foxconn, paid workers at its Longhua plant, "mostly young women from rural areas of China," only £27 ($50) a month, "about half what another electronics maker pays its workers who assemble other iPods".

They laboured in, "15-hour shifts," were housed in dormitories, "from which outsiders" were banned, and regularly paid, "about half their wages for room and board charges," the Mail said.

Now, Foxconn's Li Zong says the company's, "complicated salary structure has caused misunderstanding among the media, and the company has paid the workers according to the minimum salary standards of the Shenzhen local government," states China CSR.

"Li also says &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has sent a special team to investigate, but has found no problem with Foxconn".

Apple says it's, "committed to ensuring that working conditions in our supply chain are safe, workers are treated with respect and dignity, and manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible".

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hamas%20strikes%20deal%20with%20Fatah&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After much negotiation, &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; jointly signed a document setting out a basis for negotiation with Israel. Though premature news stories, issued before the document had been translated, had reported that the document was an implicit recognition of Israel, a &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMP"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASalah%20al-Bardaweel"&gt;Salah al-Bardaweel&lt;/a&gt;, denied that the new agreement implied the group now recognised Israel as one half of a two-state solution; the document only says that they "accept a state [in territory occupied] in 1967" - meaning Palestine - "but we did not say we accept two states". According to Hamas leaders, the document neither implicitly nor explicitly recognises Israel's right to exist. 

As of now, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has not made any comment on the new document. The statement made by U.S. press secretary &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Snow"&gt;Tony Snow&lt;/a&gt; gave the strong implication that Hamas will continue to be shunned by the U.S. and others until they renounce their stance on terror. 

Another important aspect of these events is that Hamas appears to have broken the silence between them and Fatah, the other major Palestinian party. Hamas, controls the parliament after a recent election victory, forming a government led by Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AIsmail%20Haniya"&gt;Ismail Haniya&lt;/a&gt;, while Fatah controls the presidency with &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; as president. Hamas and Fatah, after recent strife and violence between the parties, have agreed to a document that may help, even slightly, the relationship between Hamas and the PA.

The agreement between Hamas and Fatah on the yet-to-be-revealed document is still in place and looks fairly stable. There is an agreement of Hamas to let the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, negotiate with Israel, among other things that Hamas and Fatah are in agreement on. At the same time, Israeli PM &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; has given warning to the Palestinian militants that military force is about to be used as Israel moves forces near Gaza if the captured soldier is not released. This document has been released at a time when Palestinians are worried about the recent movement of Israeli troops in response to the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier. Since the capture of an Israeli soldier by &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; militants, both the government of &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; (PA) have been under pressure, with Israel now moving many forces near &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;. The Israelis have appeared to launch their offensive, with a bridge in Gaza being attacked by planes. It has now been confirmed that Israel to launch a ground offensive against the militants in Gaza.

<h1>Conditions in the womb determine male sexuality</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Conditions%20in%20the%20womb%20determine%20male%20sexuality&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Research published in the journal the ♡❤Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences♡❤ (PNAS) suggests a link between male sexuality and conditions in the womb.

Initial research by Dr. Anthony F. Bogaert and his colleagues at Brock University, Ontario revealed a possible link between the number of elder brothers a boy has and the likelihood he is to be gay. Whether this correlation be attributed to nature through the prenatal effects of the womb or to nurture through the psychosocial effects of growing up with elder siblings, however, remained unclear.

To further his research Bogaert studied 944 heterosexual and homosexual men. The men were either "biological" brothers and shared the same mother or "non-biological" brothers through adoption or as half or step siblings. Boegart reasoned that if the link between homosexuality and elder brothers was due to the nurturing effects of the family environment it would show regardless of any biological relationship.

The study showed, however, that the link was found only in biological brothers. The amount of time an individual spent being raised with elder brothers had no bearing on sexual orientation; the relationship was even found to be true in brothers who were raised apart from one another.

Bogaert writes in this month's PNAS: "These results support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men and indicate that the fraternal birth-order effect is probably the result of a maternal 'memory' for male gestations or births."

He suggests that each male foetus prompts a progressively stronger immune reaction in the mother's body. The antibodies that are produced by this reaction may account for sexual differentiation of the brain.

Scientists from Michigan State University added in an accompanying article: "These data strengthen the notion that the common denominator between biological brothers, the mother, provides a prenatal environment that fosters homosexuality in her younger sons." 

"Increasingly, credible evidence appears to indicate that being gay is genetically determined rather than being a so-called lifestyle choice. It adds further weight to the argument that lesbian and gay people should be treated equally in society and not discriminated against for something that's just as inherent as skin colour," said Andy Forrest, a spokesman for gay rights group ♡❤Stonewall.♡❤ However; Dr. Bogaert's study made no explanation for the origin of lesbianism.

Ghana seemed to dictate the style of this match; with their defensive back four near to the half-way line Brazil was kept out of shooting range. While Ghana could not stop the reigning champions scoring on three counter-attacks they achieved slightly more ball possession and shots on goal over the game.

The Africans out shot the South Americans 18:11 but were not very accurate, often wide from long range. Brazil looked much more deadly going forward and got ten out of their 11 shots on target.

Ratomir Dujkovic's team's offside trap was brittle and beaten after just five minutes. Kaka sent Ronaldo sprinting through. The forward did a step over in front of Richard Kingston and put in his fifteenth World Cup goal, his third in this championship - a total which surpassed the German Gerd Müller as the highest scorer in the history of the World Cup.

Another counterattack before half time led to Adriano's tap-in from Cafu's low pass across goal.

Ghana came closest to a goal when John Mensah headed a corner straight down at Dida's feet. The Brazilian keeper reacted quickly to save and kick the ball out of harm's way.

The third goal was from a simple long ball from full-back Ricardinho over the Ghanaian defence. Ze Roberto ran on to it and nicked it by the on-rushing keeper Kingston and coaxed it over the line.

At this point in the match the Brazilians had received boos from some of the crowd who thought football's traditional crowd-pleasers were deliberately playing within themselves. 

But as the clock ran down there were a number of exciting Brazilian attacks and Richard Kingston had to make three outstanding saves to keep the score respectable for Ghana.

Asamoah Gyan was sent off when he got a second yellow card for foul simulation.

In the next phase Brazil would play against France, in a game held in Frankfurt on July 1.

Singer &lt;a href="w%3AW.%20Axl%20Rose"&gt;W. Axl Rose&lt;/a&gt;, of the band &lt;a href="w%3AGuns%20%27N%20Roses"&gt;Guns 'N Roses&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested early Tuesday morning for assaulting and biting a security guard on the leg outside the &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; hotel where he was staying.

Rose, who performed in Stockholm on Monday, was held by the Swedish police on the suspicion of threatening and attacking the guard, as well as causing damage to the hotel. According to a police spokeswoman, Rose was intoxicated and threatening to the arresting police officers, necessitating the use of handcuffs. He was later jailed due to the potential flight risk he posed.

At approximately 7 p.m. &lt;a href="w%3ACentral_European_Summer_Time"&gt;CEST&lt;/a&gt; (1700 &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated_Universal_Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), Rose was released, having admitted his guilt in the crimes. The likely punishment will be a fine, most likely to the sum of 40 thousand &lt;a href="w%3ASwedish_krona"&gt;Swedish crowns&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an additional 10-thousand-crown restitution for the bitten security guard. The incident followed Rose's concert at the &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm_Globe_Arena"&gt;Globe Arena&lt;/a&gt; in Stockholm.

The win was a tactical triumph for the French coach &lt;a href="w%3ARaymond%20Domenech"&gt;Raymond Domenech&lt;/a&gt; whose team gave up 61 per cent of ball possession yet restricted their opponents to seven shots - two on target - and ran out three goal winners.

Nor did the French have many chances as for the majority of the game Spain patiently passed the ball around them. When they did have the ball they constantly pried at the Spanish offside line and therein found the weakness that lead to victory.

Though the French were offside eight times the crucial equaliser came from a Franck Ribéry run on to a Patrick Viera pass that beat the line of Spaniards close to half time. At speed Ribéry rounded Iker Casillas to slot home.

So solid were the French in defence intercepting passes, blocking shots and making tackles the only goal conceded - which put them behind - was from a penalty kick. This was slammed in low by David Villa on 27 minutes after Pablo had been clattered from behind by Liliam Thuram.

Ten minutes into the second half the score was at 1-1 but the French continued to test the Spanish offside trap. A worried Luis Aragonés brought on two substitutes and changed his system from 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1. The Spanish defence sat closer to their penalty area so there was less room to pass balls behind them.

But still the Spanish line was caught on 82 minutes when Thierry Henry was fouled by Puyol as he attempted to connect with another through ball. Henry fell as if hit in the face by Puyol although this could not be confirmed with television evidence. Zinedine Zidane floated the resultant free kick into the box, there was an inadvertent flick on from a Spanish player and Viera nodded in at the far post off Sergio Ramos.

As the Spanish pressed for a last minute score the French broke through again, Zidane this time cut back to lose Puyol, and with the keeper off balance he reversed his shot to the near post to put the game out of reach.

So efficient was the French performance FIFA statisticians logged the team with just 19 minutes actual playing time. Brazil, who the French will play in the quarter-finals, too conceded the majority of possession in their game but in comparison beat Ghana 3-0 with 27 minutes actual playing time, Tuesday.

<h1>Western Sydney rallies against government's workplace reforms</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Western%20Sydney%20rallies%20against%20government%27s%20workplace%20reforms&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
According to initial estimates by &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; police and unions, 30,000 people have rallied at &lt;a href="w%3ABlacktown%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Blacktown&lt;/a&gt; Showground in Western &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; to protest the federal government's &lt;a href="w%3AWorkchoices"&gt;Workchoices&lt;/a&gt; workplace reforms. Organisers had expected around 15,000 protesters to attend.

The rally at Blacktown is one of many to be held around &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; today as part of a "National Day of Action" to "protect worker's rights at work" according to unions.

The Blacktown rally saw masses of truck drivers, construction workers, teachers and police officers carrying banners and flags signalling their discontent at the federal government's reforms.

Many of the workers were joined by their families, chanting to the federal government "Your workplace changes have to go."

Speaking to protesters in Western Sydney, John Robertson, secretary of Unions New South Wales said the federal government had stripped away 100 years of worker's rights.
"These laws are direct attacks on hard-working Australians who are trying to pay off a home, provide for their kids' futures and have a bit of economic security," Mr Robertson said.

"It's in the suburbs and regional Australia that the impact of these laws will be felt - stripping away job security, penalty rates, time with family and wage rates." 

The NSW Premier's department has encouraged state government employees to attend the rallies to show their anger at the workplace reforms. As such, schools are mainly providing supervision today so parents can attend rallies, with many teachers also in attendance.

Employees of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20Post"&gt;Australia Post&lt;/a&gt;, a company wholly owned by the federal government, have been warned that unauthorised absences will result in disciplinary action being taken.

Speaking earlier today, Federal Workplace Relations Minister, Kevin Andrews said he expected most workers would not join the protests. "The reality is that most people are not going to do it because they know that we have delivered, as a government, a period of relative prosperity in Australia," said Mr Andrews.

"Part of the way we have done that has been to have the courage to engage in the reforms so we can meet the challenges of the future."

An &lt;a href="w%3Aconstitutional%20amendment"&gt;amendment&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitution%20of%20the%20United%20States%20of%20Americs"&gt;United States constitution&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20Burning%20Amendment"&gt;banning the burning of the American flag&lt;/a&gt; failed by one vote in the &lt;a href="w%3ASenate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. The final tally was 66-34; two-thirds (67 of 100 senators) was required for the amendment to pass. 

&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. President&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W.

Even though some members of each party voted for the amendment, some on both sides strongly dissented. &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Inouye"&gt;Daniel Inouye&lt;/a&gt;, a Democrat from the state of &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20War%20II"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aveteran"&gt;veteran&lt;/a&gt;, said &amp;mdash; like many other Senators including &lt;a href="w%3AKentucky"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; Republican Senator &lt;a href="w%3AMitch%20McConnell"&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; the proposed amendment was against the constitutional right to &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20speech"&gt;free speech&lt;/a&gt;.

A 3,000 strong detachment of the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israeli Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt; has moved back into the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt; only months after withdrawal of settlements from the area. Eight Hamas cabinet ministers, in addition to other officials, have been detained in a coordinated action codenamed &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Summer%20Rains"&gt;Operation Summer Rains&lt;/a&gt;. The pre-planned operation was launched in immediate response to what Israel said was the kidnap of 19-year-old Israeli tank gunner Cpl. &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3A25%20June"&gt;25 June&lt;/a&gt;.

Three bridges in the Gaza Strip have been bombed for the stated purpose of restricting the movement of the hostage takers and the hostage. 

In other operations a helicopter attack on a power station in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; plunged large portions of the Gaza Strip into darkness, leaving somewhere around 700,000 civilians without electricity or water. While Israeli troops and armored vehicles, lead by bulldozers, also moved into Gaza near a disused international airport. 

There were also reports of Israeli warplanes making warning flights over &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; in what has been reported to be a warning "against supporting Palestinian militants."

"Fight your enemies, who came to their deaths. Grab your rifles and resist," said &lt;a href="w%3ANizar%20Rayan"&gt;Nizar Rayan&lt;/a&gt; in a radio message to Palestinian militants. Despite this exhortation, there were no immediate reports of casualties or conflicts.

"We have no desire to remain in the Gaza Strip," said Israeli National Infrastructure Minister &lt;a href="w%3ABinyamin%20Ben-Eliezer"&gt;Binyamin Ben-Eliezer&lt;/a&gt;, on Israel Radio, although he did not give a timetable for the operation. "We want to bring our boy home, that's all."

The &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Resistance%20Committees"&gt;Popular Resistance Committees&lt;/a&gt; threatened to kill an Israeli soldier, kidnapped in the West Bank. The body of an 18-year-old Israeli settler, Eliyahu Yitzhak Asheri, kidnapped while hitchhiking in the West Bank, was found in the A-Tira neighbourhood of Ramallah today; he was killed by Palestinian militants from the &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Resistance%20Committees"&gt;Popular Resistance Committees&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. 

Israel has also detained dozens of Hamas MPs and ministers in a what Israel claims is an unrelated operation. An Israeli official denied the capture as a use for bargaining with the kidnappers saying, "They are not bargaining chips for the return of the soldier - it was simply an operation against a terrorist organisation."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVerneukpan%2C%20South%20Africa"&gt;Verneukpan, South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — South Africa's speed king, ♡❤♡Johan Jacobs♡❤♡, was involved in a fatal crash yesterday at a speed of more than 500 km/h. Jacobs (aged 40), who originates from &lt;a href="w%3APretoria"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt;, was busy conducting a test run before an attempt at the land-speed record.

His friends and family observed in horror as his &lt;a href="w%3Ajet"&gt;jet&lt;/a&gt;-powered car, after covering a mere 700 m, flipped over and disintegrated. &lt;a href="w%3AParamedic"&gt;Paramedic&lt;/a&gt;s rushed to the scene and tried in vain to &lt;a href="w%3Arevive"&gt;revive&lt;/a&gt; him.

♡❤On , Jacobs effortlessly improved upon the then current South African land speed record of 288 km/h, raising it to 504,5 km/h (average speed of two runs in both directions.)

Across &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; more than 100,000 people have rallied to protest against the federal government's controversial &lt;a href="w%3AWorkchoices"&gt;Workchoices&lt;/a&gt; workplace reforms. According to estimates by police, the largest rally was held in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; where more than 80,000 people were thought to be in attendance. The &lt;a href="Western%20Sydney%20rallies%20against%20government%27s%20workplace%20reforms"&gt;earlier protest in Sydney&lt;/a&gt; attracted some 30,000 protesters.

Smaller protests were held in other cities throughout the country.

At most rallies, members of the opposition and union leaders addressed the crowd, criticising the &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government's changes. Under the Workchoices system, centralised wage fixing was abolished and meal breaks, holidays and working hours became negotiable. Businesses with less than 100 employees were also given increased powers to dismiss workers. Unions and the opposition claim that the system will reduce worker's rights and wages.

Australian federal opposition leader, &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; attended the Melbourne rally where he addressed the crowd. He said those who attended the rallies were patriots who were standing up to defend the Australian lifestyle. "This is a battle for ordinary Australian life," he said 

"This is a battle for Australian families. It's also a battle for basic dignity in the workplace. 

"You are the people that made this nation what it is. 

"You are the builders of this nation. You are the true Australian patriots." 

Mr Beazley again promised that a government under his leadership would abolish the reforms.

"When we get into office in 18 months time, we will rip up these laws," he said. 

"Then we are going to put in place laws based on true Australian values." 

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), which represents a large number of employers in Australia said the total number of protesters across Australia was less than 150, 000 and labelled the protests as a day of "inaction", despite unions calling for a "day of action".

Peter Hendy, chief executive of the ACCI said the turnout figure is less than 10 per cent of the membership of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which encouraged workers to participate in a "national day of action" to "protect rights at work"

Mr Hendy said only 2 percent of Australian workers participated in the protests.

&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; Unions secretary, Janet Giles said the protests showed the dislike ordinary workers have for the laws.

"What today's demonstrated is that the momentum of this campaign is not waning, that union members, workers, community members are out today again to say we're still determined to campaign against these laws," she said.

&lt;a href="w%3AMontenegro"&gt;Republic of Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; became 192nd member state of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, following a vote in the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Assembly%20of%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;.

After the protocol officers had escorted the Montenegrin delegation to their seats in the Assembly, flag-raising ceremony took place in front of UN headquarters in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the newest member by praising non-violent and democratic process that gained Montenegro its independence from state union of &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia and Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, through an &lt;a href="w%3AMontenegrin%20independence%20referendum%2C%202006"&gt;independence referendum&lt;/a&gt;, on May 22, 2006.

Montenegro is the latest country to be admitted to the UN, following the international recognition of &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20Timor"&gt;East Timor&lt;/a&gt; in 2002.

A left-wing student group clashed with &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; police in the centre of &lt;a href="w%3AAthens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; during a demonstration organized by university students against new laws which have been proposed by the Greek Minister of Education, Marietta Yiannakou.

The conflict occurred as part of nation wide student protest against the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (&lt;a href="w%3AOECD"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt;) attempts to eliminate state funded universities in Greece.

The most serious incidents occurred near the ♡❤Athens' Polytechnic♡❤ and outside the ♡❤Law School of Athens♡❤ in the center of Athens where a small number of &lt;a href="w%3AAnarchism"&gt;Anarchists&lt;/a&gt; wore masks, caused damage to cars, shops and private properties, and threw stones and Molotov cocktails at police. 

Additional conflicts occurred outside the holiday resort of &lt;a href="w%3ALagonissi"&gt;Lagonissi&lt;/a&gt;, around 45 kilometers south-east of central Athens, where the OECD is meeting.

Greek university students currently occupy more than 400 faculties across the country, including the two biggest universities of Greece, to protest the OECD's proposals for privatization of universities.

Scientists from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; have discovered a new species of snake capable of changing it's colours, in the Betung Kerihun National Park on the island of Borneo.

Researchers Mark Auliya from the ♡❤Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig♡❤ in Bonn and a consultant for the ♡❤World Wildlife Federation♡❤(WWF), and John Murphy and Harold Voris from the ♡❤Field Museum of Natural History♡❤ in Chicago were collecting specimens from the wetlands of the Kapuas river when they stumbled upon the snake's colour changing ability.

"I put the reddish-brown snake in a dark bucket," Auliya explained. "When I retrieved it a few minutes later, it was almost entirely white."

The ability to change colour is known from some reptiles, famously the chameleon, but scientists have seen it very rarely with snakes and are yet to understand the phenomenon. In chameleons, colour change is an expression of it's physiological condition. Skin color is also influenced by light and temperature.

The two snakes, initially brown with an iridescent sheen, are about a half metre long and venomous. The scientists named them the 'Kapus-Mud-Snake'. 

They are believed to belong to the ♡❤Enhydris♡❤ genus, which is composed of 22 species of rear-fanged water snakes, only two of which are widespread. The scientists believe this newly discovered snake might only occur in the Kapuas river drainage system.

"The discovery of the "chameleon" snake exposes one of nature's best kept secrets deep in the Heart of Borneo." Said Stuart Chapman, WWF's international coordinator of the Heart of Borneo Programme. "Its ability to change colour has kept it hidden from science until now." 

In the last ten years 361 new animal and plants species have been discovered on the island of Borneo, however, WWF says wildlife in the region is threatened by deforestation. Today, only half of Borneo's forest cover remains, down from 75 per cent in the mid 1980s.

There is hope, however, that this trend can be halted. Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia and Malaysia - the three governments which hold jurisdiction over Borneo - recently launched the Heart of Borneo initiative. This aims to preserve approximately 220,000km2 of equatorial forests and numerous wildlife species.

Today, June 29, the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABroadcasting%20Standards%20Authority"&gt;Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA)&lt;/a&gt; decided to throw out the 35 complaints made against a South Park episode. Three of the 35 were from church societies. The South Park episode in question was aired in February and depicted a statue of the Virgin Mary menstruating. The episode was named ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABloody%20Mary%20%28South%20Park%29"&gt;Bloody Mary&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

That episode received the highest number of complaints the BSA has ever received since starting in 1989. And &lt;a href="w%3AC4%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;C4&lt;/a&gt;, the broadcaster, received the highest number of viewers since it started in 2003.

The complaints received state that the broadcaster breached a number of standards in the Free To Air Television Code of Broadcasting Practice but the BSA responded by saying that it is within the broadcasters freedom of expression.

C4 and the BSA both agree that people were given offence by the episode. C4 chose not to screen the episode again. The broadcast of the programme was protected by the Bill of Rights Act 1990.

The BSA did note that the programme was not a direct attack on Catholics but was to satirise the belief in miracles from statues. The programme was deliberately provocative. The BSA says, "But showing disrespect does not amount to the sort of vicious or vitriolic attack normally associated with the denigration standard."

Ikeda Kanako, a 21-year-old senior student of the &lt;a href="w%3AMeiji%20Gakuin%20University"&gt;Meiji Gakuin University&lt;/a&gt; and the first daughter of celebrity surgeon &lt;a href="w%3AYuko%20Ikeda"&gt;Yuko Ikeda&lt;/a&gt;, was kidnapped at about 1225 (UTC+9), June 26, 2006, in &lt;a href="w%3AShibuya%2C%20Tokyo"&gt;Shibuya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;.

A bullet was fired and one officer slightly cut when police stormed a Kawasaki apartment to rescue the girl.

Kanako was dressed in a white light half-sleeved cardigan, blue jeans with a bistre belt made of leather, a spring green camisole and carried a bag of Vuitton when she was abducted at a bus stop.

She was found unharmed 13 hours later by Japanese police at a condominium located in &lt;a href="w%3ANakahara-ku%2C%20Kawasaki"&gt;Nakahara-ku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKawasaki%2C%20Kanagawa"&gt;Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKanagawa%20Prefecture"&gt;Kanagawa&lt;/a&gt;. The young woman's make-up was not disordered; Kanako's long brown fringe was not disheveled at all and she was wearing what she had been when she was kidnapped. 

The kidnapping of Kanako was a big story in Japanese media in June, 2006. The story appeared in many newspapers as the front-page news on June 27, 2006.

Kanako and her kidnappers had been in touch with her mother using Kanako's mobile phone. The effort to free her was helped greatly by a woman who witnessed the moment Kanako was taken; she wrote down the license plate of the van and other details.

Police traced mobile phone calls and were able to locate the van in Kawasaki where they detained two of the kidnappers as they went shopping.

One conspirator Li Yong, 29, from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, led the policemen to the apartment and tricked Kaneo Ito, 49, from &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, to open the door. Ito managed to discharge one bullet before being restrained by an assistant police inspector, the first man in the room.

The other man involved in the kidnap of Kanako was Choi Gi Ho, 54, from &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. Kanato was freed unharmed.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%20Metropolitan%20Police%20Department"&gt;Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department&lt;/a&gt; arrested three men on suspicion of conspiring to kidnap a woman and hold her to a reported 300 million yen ransom.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;United States Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; has ruled that the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20military%20commission"&gt;military commission&lt;/a&gt;s set up in the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo Bay detainment camp&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, to try terrorist suspects are not authorized by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress’&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAuthorization%20for%20Use%20of%20Military%20Force%20Joint%20Resolution"&gt;Joint Resolution&lt;/a&gt; authorizing military action in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, and that the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; does not have the legal authority to establish military commissions without express authorization from Congress. The court also found the military commissions, as presently administered, to be in violation of the &lt;a href="w%3AGeneva%20conventions"&gt;Geneva Conventions&lt;/a&gt;, to which the United States is a party.

The case, titled &lt;a href="w%3AHamdan%20v.%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;, focused on an Yemeni citizen who is alleged to have been a bodyguard and driver for &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt; and was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001 and held at Guantanamo since June 2002.

On November 13, 2001, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; issued a Military Order declaring that military commissions would try foreign terrorist suspects for alleged war crimes. These military commissions would differ from traditional courts of law in that: they would allow hearsay evidence; would be allowed to consider classified evidence during closed sessions, without providing the suspect a chance to hear the evidence or defend himself against it; and they would be allowed to use evidence coerced through &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt;.

The court denied the government's assertion that it lacks authority to review decisions by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit"&gt;D.C. Circuit Court&lt;/a&gt; because the &lt;a href="w%3ADetainee%20Treatment%20Act"&gt;Detainee Treatment Act&lt;/a&gt; of 2005 only strips the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction over cases filed after its enactment. 

Turning to the merits of the petitioner, it found that the crime Hamdan is charged with - conspiracy - is not a crime that violates the &lt;a href="w%3Alaw%20of%20war"&gt;law of war&lt;/a&gt; and thus should not be tried by a military commission.

The court conceded that Congress has the prerogative to establish commissions such as the one desired by the Bush administration but found that it has not yet done so. 
The Supreme Court ruled 5-3 with &lt;a href="w%3AAssociate%20Justice"&gt;Associate Justices&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Breyer"&gt;Breyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Bader%20Ginsburg"&gt;Ginsburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Paul%20Stevens"&gt;Stevens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouter"&gt;Souter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAnthony%20Kennedy"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; in the majority; &lt;a href="w%3AAlito"&gt;Alito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20Thomas"&gt;Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AScalia"&gt;Scalia&lt;/a&gt; dissented and &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Justice"&gt;Chief Justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Roberts"&gt;Roberts&lt;/a&gt; recused (he had earlier sided with the government on the appellate level).

Nine other detainees face charges before the military commissions. The &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; had previously announced that it planned to charge an additional 60 of the 460 detainees remaining at Guantanamo before military commissions.

<h4>Reactions</h4>
Lt. Cmdr &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Swift"&gt;Charles Swift&lt;/a&gt;, Hamdan's military counsel who filed the request, said: "All we wanted was a fair trial and we thank the Supreme Court. Yes it is a rebuke for the process. [...] It means we can't be scared out of who we are."

President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; said that his administration "will work with Congress" to address the issue and added that "we're in a war on terror, that these people were picked up off of a battlefield, and I will protect the people and at the same time conform with the findings of the Supreme Court".

Senator &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Leahy"&gt;Patrick Leahy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AVermont"&gt;VT&lt;/a&gt;) said that "for five years, the Bush-Cheney administration has violated fundamental American values, tarnished our standing in the world and hindered the partnerships we need with our allies. This arrogance and incompetence have delayed and weakened the handling of the war on terror, not because of any coherent strategic view it had, but because of its stubborn unilateralism and dangerous theory of unfettered power".

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Warner"&gt;John Warner&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;VA&lt;/a&gt;) said he doesn't regard the decision as "a blow" but rather as "an interpretation of the law".

Senate Majority leader &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Frist"&gt;Bill Frist&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3A%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3A%20Tennessee"&gt;TN&lt;/a&gt;) promised to introduce a bill after the July 4 holiday recess that would allow Congress to re-establish the military commissions.

"I will introduce legislation, in consultation with the Administration and my colleagues, that authorizes military commissions and appropriate due process procedures for trials of terrorist combatants," Frist said. 

If a Frist bill is successful in becoming congressional law, along with backing from the executive branch, it would have the effect of over-turning the Supreme Court ruling.

&lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has today launched its foray into the world online payment processing with &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Checkout"&gt;Google Checkout&lt;/a&gt;. This is considered by many to be a rival to the payment giant &lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, owned by &lt;a href="eBay"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;. This service is currently only available to U.S. residents.

Google has created the service in a similar way to PayPal. There are two types of Google Checkout account, Buyer and Seller. Only a Seller account can receive payments through the service, a Buyer account can only make payments. This is tied in very closely with the &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Adwords"&gt;Google Adwords&lt;/a&gt; service &amp;mdash; adverts selling items can now display a small shopping cart icon &amp;mdash; which indicates that the advertiser accepts Google Checkout as a method of payment.

The selling rate is also closely tied in with the Google AdWords service. Other online payment services generally charge a set percentage per transaction, whereas Google Checkout credits you with a certain amount of "free transactions" when you purchase Google AdWords (For every US $1 spent on AdWords, US $10 in sales can be processed at no charge) &amp;mdash; or a rate of 2% plus US $0.20 if the Seller is not a Google Adwords subscriber. There are no charges associated with Buyer Accounts.

Currently, Google Checkout only accepts Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Credit Cards for inclusion on a buyer's or seller's account. They also offer a special deal for users of a &lt;a href="w%3ACiti"&gt;Citicard&lt;/a&gt; credit card &amp;mdash; US $5 (or 1000 ThankYou Points) for signing up. Google has announced its' intentions to "to make the service available to merchants internationally" in the near future.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Federal%20Reserve"&gt;Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; has announced an increase of 25 basis points (0.25%) in the &lt;a href="w%3Afederal%20funds%20rate"&gt;federal funds rate&lt;/a&gt; bringing it to 5.25 percent. It also announced its approval of a 25 basis point increase in the &lt;a href="w%3Adiscount%20rate"&gt;discount rate&lt;/a&gt; to 6.25 percent.

The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which depository institutions such as banks lend balances they maintain at the Federal Reserve (called ♡❤federal funds♡❤) to other banks overnight. The discount rate is the interest rate that an eligible bank is charged to borrow short term funds directly from the central bank through the ♡❤discount window♡❤. 

In its statement, the Fed said that growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier in the year, which it partly attributed to a cooling of the housing market and the delayed effect of increases in interest rates and energy prices. The Fed noted that inflation measures were "elevated" in recent months and that while productivity gains have held down increases in labor costs and inflation expectations "remain contained". However, it pointed out that high levels of resource utilization and high energy and commodity prices have the potential to sustain inflation pressures.

In its outlook over its future moves, the Fed statement said "Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information."

<h1>Zapatero announces peace talks with Basque separatists, ETA</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Zapatero%20announces%20peace%20talks%20with%20Basque%20separatists%2C%20ETA&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
“The Government is going to initiate talks with ETA" said Spanish President &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero"&gt;José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt; in a televised speech to Parliament, Thursday.

The historic announcement meant Mr Zapatero's Socialist-led government were set to begin peace talks with the Basque separatist group &lt;a href="w%3AETA"&gt;ETA&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in Spain's history.

"The process is going to be long, tough and difficult. We’ll handle it with determination and prudence, with unity and loyalty and always with respect to the memory of the victims,” said Mr Zapatero.

At a news conference Mr Zapatero said the proposed talks would discuss the dismantling of ETA's organisation and the 500 ETA prisoners in Spanish jails but not Basque independence. "Democracy will not pay any political price to achieve peace," Mr Zapatero said.

The Spanish opposition &lt;a href="w%3APopular%20Party"&gt;Popular Party&lt;/a&gt; did not give their full support for Mr Zapatero's peace bid. They particularly objected to talks with &lt;a href="w%3ABatasuna"&gt;Batasuna&lt;/a&gt;, the political front of ETA. "Any normal person understands you can't negotiate with someone whose negotiating weapon is as powerful and hard to argue with as a pistol," said Popular Party leader &lt;a href="w%3AMariano%20Rajoy"&gt;Mariano Rajoy&lt;/a&gt;.

ETA had been fighting a terrorist war since &lt;a href="w%3AFranco"&gt;Franco's&lt;/a&gt; era until it announced a permanent ceasefire March 22, 2006. The group was responsible for 817 deaths over its 38-year campaign while staking its claim for territory in northern Spain and south-western France.

ETA says the motivation for talks is so the Basque people get to decide their own future. 

Their request last week came after three months of ceasefire. Though ETA had not killed since 2003 it had continued to explode bombs and extort money from businesses. 

It is thought a six-year police crackdown on militants and opinion polls that suggested not all Basques wanted independence made violence a counter-productive strategy for ETA. Violence also had become associated with &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001"&gt;September 11, 2001&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Madrid%20bombings"&gt;2004 Madrid bombings&lt;/a&gt;.

Irish &lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; and British &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; have stated that the November 24 deadline for formation of a devolved, power-sharing government is final and that it is the last chance for parties to restore &lt;a href="w%3Adevolution"&gt;devolution&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The two prime ministers met in Belfast at &lt;a href="w%3AStormont"&gt;Stormont&lt;/a&gt; today with the major parties about the deadline.

Blair stated he would shut down the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20Assembly"&gt;Northern Ireland Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, cut the salary and benefits of all 108 members and forge a stronger &lt;a href="w%3Adirect%20rule"&gt;direct rule&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20Ireland"&gt;Republic of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. He also stated that both governments were not willing to continue talks past the deadline and would instead work on developing joint policies in Northern Ireland.

Blair who is under pressure to resign by next year is seeking a more permanent peace settlement before he leaves office.

"This is the last chance for this generation, really, to make this process work," Blair said. "We've come a long way, but we need to get the rest of the way now."

Ahern said that he wanted to see the institutions active as soon as possible. He added, "The reality of this is that if we don't do this by November 24 then we lose a huge opportunity."

The two prime ministers have also published a in-depth time-line stating what negotiators must accomplish to establish a joint power-sharing administration, one of the main goals of the &lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friday%20Agreement"&gt;Good Friday Agreement&lt;/a&gt; signed in 1998, by the deadline.

The administration would be led by the two main parties, the &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Paisley"&gt;Ian Paisley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Adams"&gt;Gerry Adams&lt;/a&gt;.

The parties gave their opinions over the visit by the prime ministers.

The deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Robinson"&gt;Peter Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, said their party stressed the need for the assembly to meet. He added, "If negotiations are going to begin in the autumn, then the assembly is going to have to meet between now and then. We can not move on to the next stage unless we move in the sequence of scoping the issues, debating the issues and then negotiating the issues." Robinson is referring to the fact that the Assembly will go on a summer recess soon.

Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams hoped the process could move on. "The two governments sought to reassure us of their total commitment to the November 24 deadline and their commitment to making this process work. "We now want them to match that verbal commitment with action in the time ahead," stated Adams.

Yesterday, Sinn Féin announced that the party is thinking of withdrawing from the Northern Ireland Assembly in autumn, after launching an internal review. The review could shift the party's focus from a devolution deal to the next election if the deal is unlikely by the November 24 deadline.

The leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Ulster Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Reg%20Empey"&gt;Sir Reg Empey&lt;/a&gt;, said that anyone who has no intention of meeting the November 24 deadline should "have the guts to say so". Empey added, "We want to see devolution restored if the conditions are right at the time and we will spare no effort to see that is achieved." 

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Ford"&gt;David Ford&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AAlliance%20Party%20of%20Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Alliance Party&lt;/a&gt; said that his party is sharing the frustration of the people of Northern Ireland. He added, "Alliance is prepared to work its socks off until November to get an assembly restored but we need the governments to play their part as well."

The leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic and Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Durkan"&gt;Mark Durkan&lt;/a&gt;, said ahead of his meeting with the two "The taoiseach and the prime minister shouldn't have to be here today trying to make sense out of a lot of the nonsense that is coming from some of the parties. I hope the two premiers are clear in their message today that they want to see the parties here get on with it, because that is what the public want to see." 

On May 15, the parties took their seats in the first session of the Northern Ireland Assembly since October 2002. The assembly had been suspended since 2002 over allegations of a republican spy ring. Direct rule from London has been in place since then.

A Preparation for Government Committee has been formed consisting of the various major parties, but progress has been slow. Especially since the DUP will not cooperate with Sinn Féin until the &lt;a href="Provisional%20IRA"&gt;Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; completely disbands. Last year, the IRA decommissioned their weaponry.

Blair and Ahern plan to return to Northern Ireland in October after the publication of a report on paramilitary activity.

Meanwhile, before meeting with the parties, the two prime ministers ventured to &lt;a href="w%3ABallymena"&gt;Ballymena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACounty%20Antrim"&gt;County Antrim&lt;/a&gt; to meet with cross-community students. The meeting is in response to murder of Michael McIlveen, a 15-year-old Catholic boy by a loyalist/unionist mob in County Antrim.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Ontario Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; created a new &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; trillium logo at a cost of $219,000 dollars. Many people and the &lt;a href="w%3AProgressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Ontario"&gt;PC Party of Ontario&lt;/a&gt; call it a waste of time and money. They replaced the logo with a version of the flower similar to the party's trademark. The picture can be seen here &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikinews.org/wiki/Image%3ATo-trillium-new.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 

Now the Progressive Conservatives have started a new website. The website is a petition to save the old trillium logo. The website just started yesterday. PC leader &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Tory"&gt;John Tory&lt;/a&gt; had lots of interviews today.

"You just don't arbitrarily tamper with it under cover of darkness," PC Leader John Tory said yesterday, launching the website &lt;a href="http%3A//www.savethetrillium.ca"&gt;savethetrillium.ca&lt;/a&gt;. "It survived more or less intact through seven governments under all parties until &lt;a href="w%3ADalton%20McGuinty"&gt;Dalton McGuinty&lt;/a&gt; and his partisan pork barrellers got their hands on it," said John Tory. He also said "it is wasting time and money fiddling with marketing and logos while gun violence and energy problems go unattended". Tory calls it a useless use of funds and an inappropriate change because the new logo too closely resembles the flower seen in the Liberal Party banner.

The logo was introduced in 1964. It has undergone minor redesigns, but always remained a stylized T-shaped trillium. The latest version, designed by Toronto advertising agency Bensimon Byrne, is more angular and has no border. 

"It's awful," Keith Rushton, a professor of design at the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20College%20of%20Art%20and%20Design"&gt;Ontario College of Art and Design&lt;/a&gt;. "It was a drastic change. It's a very aggressive, hostile logo."

The Liberals have defended the logo revamp saying "it was time to modernize the symbol in order to attract new business to the province".

For now, the Torys will leave it to the Canadian public.

<h1>Campaigning begins for groundbreaking Congo elections</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Campaigning%20begins%20for%20groundbreaking%20Congo%20elections&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Over 200 parties are gearing up to begin a month of campaigning across the &lt;a href="w%3ADr_congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of voting at the end of July. 

At midnight on June 29, canvassing can officially begin across the country, in the first open elections since the country gained independence in 1961. Polls were originally due to take place last year but were delayed twice by the interim government. 

The international community is taking a keen interest in events, many with a hopeful belief that the elections will end nearly a decade of violence in the country. The South African government announced earlier today that they hoped the ballot would “mark the culmination of over ten years of peace efforts by the people of the DRC.”

However some are concerned that despite the presence of the &lt;a href="w%3AIndependent_Electoral_Commission"&gt;Independent Electoral Commission&lt;/a&gt; (IEC) the campaigning would still not be fair. More than 200 parties are plying for votes, but only a few have enough money to target the mass media. The current President, &lt;a href="w%3AKabila"&gt;Joseph Kabila&lt;/a&gt; has a monopoly on the state media, according to the &lt;a href="w%3ABbc%23BBC_News"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, and in over a third of constituencies, there is only one candidate. 

The UN mission in the country, &lt;a href="w%3AMonuc"&gt;Monuc&lt;/a&gt;, has been monitoring the peace during the transitional period since war officially ended 3 years ago. In a statement today they said they demanded that “the electoral campaign takes place in a calm, serene and constructive spirit.”

A key area will be the fragile eastern parts of the country still recovering from the long war with &lt;a href="w%3Arwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday three people died in the eastern town of Goma as the roof of an aircraft hanger collapsed under the weight of hundreds of Kabila supports who had gathered to see the interim president, and likely winner of next months polls. 

Voting itself is due to begin on July 29.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; received on &lt;a href="w%3AJune%2029"&gt;June 29&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABeriev%20Be-200"&gt;Beriev 200&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aairplane"&gt;airplane&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Portugal"&gt;Portuguese Government&lt;/a&gt; has rented for two months. The stated objective is to test the aircraft during the &lt;a href="w%3Aforest%20fire"&gt;forest fire&lt;/a&gt; season, allowing the &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Internal%20Administration"&gt;Ministry of Internal Administration&lt;/a&gt; to determine if it should buy it.

The correspondent agreement agreed to by the Portuguese vice-Minister of Internal Administration, &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Rosa%20Andrade"&gt;Fernando Rosa Andrade&lt;/a&gt;, and the director of the Russian company &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABeriev"&gt;Beriev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVictor%20Kobzev"&gt;Victor Kobzev&lt;/a&gt;, will cost Portugal &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;1,234,000 (&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt; 1,552,802) for two months rent and maintenance. The objective is to test the aircraft in real firefighting situations this summer, these tests will then provide information for the Ministry of Internal Administration, so that this can make a final decision about a purchase.

With the double of capacity for the transport of water and fire retardants of other &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAerial%20firefighting"&gt;aerial firefighting&lt;/a&gt; aircraft that usually operate in Portugal, mainly the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadair%20CL-415"&gt;Canadair CL-415&lt;/a&gt;, the Beriev will operate throughout Portugal, independently of its base. The Beriev's capacity is almost twice that of the Canadair, 12,000 L/h and 6,160 L/h respectively.

"As of June 1, the aircraft will enter in operational tests in real environment, during 60 days", Gil Martins, operations commander of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Center%20of%20Rescue%20Operations"&gt;National Center of Rescue Operations&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;a href="w%3AR%C3%A1dio%20de%20Renascen%C3%A7a"&gt;Rádio de Renascença&lt;/a&gt; News Agency.

"The Beriev is an amphibious aircraft of the same type as the Canadair, that transports a dozen tons of fire retardants, the double than a Canadair aircraft", Martins added.

The aircraft arrives Thursday night at Monte Real Air Base, were he will stay until August 31, and will be visited tomorrow (July 1) by the Minister of Internal Administration, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAnt%C3%B3nio%20Costa"&gt;António Costa&lt;/a&gt;.

The plan is to purchase four heavy aircraft for fighting forest and ground fires which will become available in 2008. In addition to the order of airplanes the Government as purchased six medium and four light &lt;a href="w%3Ahelicopters"&gt;helicopters&lt;/a&gt;, in two separate bids, in which the deal for the six medium helicopters caused the dispute of an multimillion dollar war between the three competing companies in the courts.

The international contest was launched by the Portuguese Government in November 2005 for six medium helicopters was participated in by: Heliportugal, Helisul, Helibravo, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEurocopter"&gt;Eurocopter&lt;/a&gt; and the Polish &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APZL"&gt;PZL&lt;/a&gt;. With the decision made by a jury of seven members, in April the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACabinet%20of%20Portugal"&gt;Cabinet&lt;/a&gt; decided to purchase from Heliportugal six &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AKamov%20Ka-32"&gt;Kamov 32&lt;/a&gt; helicopters worth 42.1 million EUR, scheduled to arrive June 1.

Early this month the Polish company PZL interposed an action for a provisional &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALegal%20remedy"&gt;legal remedy&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Administrative%20Court"&gt;Supreme Administrative Court&lt;/a&gt;. In June 21 the Portuguese company Helisul made a plea for the decision of the Cabinet in April 27.

With about 3.2 million &lt;a href="w%3Ahectare"&gt;hectare&lt;/a&gt;s of forest in 1995 and 2.5 million hectares in 2005, Portugal lost about fifth of its forest in ten years to forest fires.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israeli Defence Forces&lt;/a&gt; have carried out 5 to 8 air strikes targeting the office of the Palestinian interior ministry's headquarters occupied by the governing party &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Gaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; and an office of President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; party in Gaza, &lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i sources say. 

Israel claims its ongoing &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Summer%20Rains"&gt;Operation Summer Rains&lt;/a&gt;, which began early on June 28, is in response to the capture of Israeli soldier &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Cpl. Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt; by Palestinian militants.

There were mixed reports of casualties from the air strike, although one source said a member of &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt; had been killed in the air strikes. Television images showed emergency crews responded to the attacks.

The Israeli military said the ministry office, controlled by Hamas, was "a meeting place to plan and direct terror activity." In addition, an Israeli official stated to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; that the attacks will only end when the captured Israeli soldier is unconditionally freed.

Days after the initial raid reports from Israeli officials stated that they had found the body of 18-year-old Eliyahu Yitzhak Asheri who was kidnapped by the Palestinian ruling party, Hamas, and shot in the back of the head on Sunday.

In his first appearance since the raid began, Palestinian PM and leader of the Hamas organization, &lt;a href="w%3AIsmail%20Haniya"&gt;Ismail Haniya&lt;/a&gt; denounced the raid saying it was a "premeditated plan" to bring down the new Hamas government. He accused Israel of hiding behind Cpl. Shalit to carry a "systemic campaign" against Hamas.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Police, in connection with the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority, Tow Truck Authority and &lt;a href="w%3ACentrelink"&gt;Centrelink&lt;/a&gt; (the agency responsible for providing income support) conducted random checks on tow trucks on Thursday. The checks were carried out in &lt;a href="w%3ABankstown%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bankstown&lt;/a&gt;, a suburb in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney's&lt;/a&gt; South-West.

According to police, 50 tow trucks were pulled over during the operation, coined "Operation Hook" between 8:30 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; and 4 p.m. Of those, 26 were directed to report to a vehicle inspection facility for further investigation.

Police issued 70 infringement notices (fines) during the operation. 11 were for being unlicensed to conduct business as a tow truck driver or business, and 13 for having incorrectly secured loads. 17 vehicles were issued defect notices as part of the operation.

Tow truck operators (business owners) are required to make a payment of &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt;$770 per year to the NSW government, while drivers are charged $152 per year for their licence. An additional charge for tow truck number plates of $292 per year also applies.

The maximum penalty for operators not being licensed correctly is $11,000 or 12 months imprisonment, drivers without the correct licence can be fined $5,500 or sentenced to 6 months.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASTRASBOURG%2C%20France"&gt;STRASBOURG, France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — &lt;a href="w%3AT-Mobile%20Team"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; suspended the Tour de France contestants &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Ullrich"&gt;Jan Ullrich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOscar%20Sevilla"&gt;Oscar Sevilla&lt;/a&gt;, and they will not participate in the &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;. Ullrich's mentor, &lt;a href="w%3ARudy%20Pevenage"&gt;Rudy Pevenage&lt;/a&gt;, is also suspended.

The news was published at today's press meeting.

It is the first consequence of the big Spanish doping-scandal. The 32-year old Jan Ullrich won Tour de France in &lt;a href="w%3A1997"&gt;1997&lt;/a&gt;. He was together with Team CSC's &lt;a href="w%3AIvan%20Basso"&gt;Ivan Basso&lt;/a&gt; the favorite winner in Tour de France, and the Spaniards Oscar Sevilla was one of Ullrich's most important helpers.

All three have to prove their innocence before they can be released, said the German crew who will try to get the two new bikers in the game.

Team CSC-owner &lt;a href="w%3ABjarne%20Riis"&gt;Bjarne Riis&lt;/a&gt; said , when he was on his way to meet the other sports executives, and the Tour-management:

- ♡❤"It is sad news. I just heard it. It is of course a shame."♡❤

Altogether 22 riders are mentioned on the list.

An Australian has been shot in the abdomen in Thailand. The 22-year-old man from Wagga Wagga, Lee Burkinshaw, was shot in the Chantaburi province during a drive by shooting. He was evacuated to Bangkok hospital after receiving some treatment at a local hospital. An operation is needed to remove the bullet from his abdomen. He is expected to make a full recovery.

His spleen was removed but no vital organs have been damaged.

His father received a call at 2 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3ATime_in_Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt;.

Lee went to Thailand to study the gem cutting.

“It is the gem capital of the world, and a lot of the rough cut gemstones come into there to be cut and styled,” Mr. Burkingsaw said.

He is undeterred from revisiting Thailand.

“This is purely a one-off incident ... Thailand is a wonderful country, it's just an unfortunate incident,” said Lee.

This is the second incident in recent weeks in which an Australian had been shot in Thailand. Last week a nurse was killed when she was shot in the neck near a bar.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APARIS%2C%20France"&gt;PARIS, France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 

The &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20France"&gt;French parliament&lt;/a&gt; has today finally adopted a law known as &lt;a href="w%3ADADVSI"&gt;DADVSI&lt;/a&gt; implementing the &lt;a href="w%3AEU%20Copyright%20Directive"&gt;2001 European directive on copyright&lt;/a&gt;, roughly an equivalent to the US &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;. The final text criminalizes sending copyrighted data over peer-to-peer networks, and enacts tough penalties for those designing programs "evidently designed" to send copyrighted data or meant for circumventing &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Rights%20Management"&gt;DRM protection techniques&lt;/a&gt;.

Free software groups contend that the law could in effect make it impossible to implement free software capable of reading DRM-encumbered formats. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.eucd.info"&gt;EUCD.info&lt;/a&gt; denounces the "worst copyright law imaginable". &lt;a href="http%3A//www.eucd.info/index.php%3F2006/06/30/333-french-parliament-approves-the-worst-copyright-law-in-europe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The text started to be examined in Parliament in December 2005, when it took an unexpected twist with an amendment decriminalizing peer-to-peer networks (in exchange for the payment of a flat fee), since repealed. In March, other amendments were strongly criticized by &lt;a href="w%3AApple%20Computer"&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result the US government pressured the French government to rescind them.

The ruling &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement"&gt;UMP&lt;/a&gt; party voted in favor of the law, but a number of its parliamentarians, including a vice-president of the National Assembly, expressed strong reservations; the centrist &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20for%20French%20Democracy"&gt;UDF&lt;/a&gt; split over it, with its president &lt;a href="w%3AFran%C3%A7ois%20Bayrou"&gt;François Bayrou&lt;/a&gt; being opposed to the bill, but some other members abstaining from voting; the left-wing opposition &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;PS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Communist%20Party"&gt;PCF&lt;/a&gt; voted against it. The opposition has announced it would mount a challenge over the law before the &lt;a href="w%3AConstitutional%20Council%20of%20France"&gt;French Constitutional Council&lt;/a&gt;.

Proponents of the bill claim that it will rein in unauthorized copying of copyrighted content, which they claim jeopardizes artistic creation in France. Opponents opposed both the way the bill was examined in Parliament, which they claim was put under pressure, and some clauses that they claim may violate civil liberties or jeopardize &lt;a href="w%3Afree%20software"&gt;free software&lt;/a&gt;.

The bill is due to be signed into law by president &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; following the probable examination by the Constitutional Council.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;US House of Reprensentatives&lt;/a&gt; is seeking to lift a nine year old ban on export sales of the &lt;a href="w%3AF-22A"&gt;F-22A Raptor&lt;/a&gt; stealth fighter. 

US lawmakers approved an amendment that would allow &lt;a href="w%3ALockheed%20Martin"&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/a&gt;, the aircraft's primary manufacturer, to sell the aircraft overseas to foreign nations. Every defence bill since 1997 contained language that prohibited the sale of the multi-role aircraft to foreign nations, due to concerns that the advanced technology in the plane may reach the wrong hands. &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, both strong allies of the United States are considered to be likely customers, if the ban is lifted.

The amendment was introduced by Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AKay%20Granger"&gt;Kay Granger&lt;/a&gt;, (R-Texas), whose constituency, the &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Worth"&gt;Fort Worth&lt;/a&gt; district is home to a major Lockheed Martin facility. The lifting of the ban comes at a time when continued US orders will no longer be guaranteed and that the aircraft's continued production is important for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics' business.

The &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portuguese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMinister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Portugal%29"&gt;Minister of Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ADiogo%20Freitas%20do%20Amaral"&gt;Freitas do Amaral&lt;/a&gt; has resigned from his position. Replacing Freitas do Amaral in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be Luís Amado, current Minister of National Defense.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJos%C3%A9%20S%C3%B3crates"&gt;José Sócrates&lt;/a&gt; requested President &lt;a href="w%3ACavaco%20Silva"&gt;Cavaco Silva&lt;/a&gt; to relieve Freitas do Amaral of his posts of minister of state and foreign affairs, on his request, for reasons of health, according to a cabinet press release.

In the press release, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJos%C3%A9%20S%C3%B3crates"&gt;José Sócrates&lt;/a&gt; also proposed the nomination of the current minister of defense, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALu%C3%ADs%20Amado"&gt;Luís Amado&lt;/a&gt;, to replace Freitas do Amaral. José Sócrates also proposed the nomination of Nuno Severiano Teixeira as the new defense minister. Teixeira was the Internal Administration Minister in the second executive lead by &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AAnt%C3%B3nio%20Guterres"&gt;António Guterres&lt;/a&gt; (1999/2001). Both possessions are scheduled for next Monday morning.

"In this occasion, the Prime Minister desires to underline the extraordinary contribute which, with all his experience and international prestige, the professor Diogo Freitas do Amaral gave to the Government and the national interests in the conduction of the Portuguese external politics", the press release stated.

In a press conference this Friday afternoon, Foreign Affairs spokesman António Carneiro Jacinto said that Freitas do Amaral will be operated next Monday (July 3) to an injury in the cervical column which hinders him from travelling by airplane in the coming months.

"The resignation was not motivated by politic divergences of any type, which had not existed, nor exist. It's because the aggravation of the health" of Diogo Freitas do Amaral, said the spokesman in the press conference.

The resignation of Freitas do Amaral was expected has for some time. On March, in an interview to the Portuguese newspaper "Expresso", the Minister said that he arrived home "at the end of the day completely tired" and admitted that he would not be able to handle the work of the ministry when Portugal starts to exercise its presidency of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in 2007.

Haniyah said that that &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s offensive in the Gaza strip was part of a premeditated plan to bring down the elected Palestinian government led by Hamas, and that it would fail.

Israel's air force struck roads, bridges and a power plant in Gaza within the past 24 hours, and the United Nations said it believes the destruction of the Gaza power plant has pushed Gaza close to a humanitarian crisis.

Israel maintains that its military activities are for the purpose of obtaining the safe return of one of its soldiers, &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Cpl. Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt;, who was kidnapped by Palestinian militants this past Sunday. Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz said, "The quicker this is done the better it will be. If the soldier will be returned and the Qassam (rocket) fire will be halted, we will also return our soldiers to their bases."

<h1>Germany master penalties to beat Argentina to semi-final spot</h1>

The match had drawn 1-1 without many clear chances for either side due to defensive play on both sides. First it was Germany who were unable to be positive as Argentina dominated play with 65 per cent of ball possession. 

Until their goal Argentina controlled the game. 

Four minutes after half-time Roberto Ayala got across Miroslav Klose to meet Juan Riquelme's corner which he powered between Jens Lehmann and his near post guard, Philipp Lahm.

The goal early in the second period made for a more exciting match which had been mostly uneventful in a first half during which neither side could muster more than a single shot. However; good scoring chances where hard to come by.

Juergen Klinsmann may be credited with a substitution change that partially helped Germany get an equalising goal. The fast David Odonkor troubled Juan Sorin and the Argentine left flank and allowed Germany to press forward nearer to the opposition penalty area.

Argentine manager may also have made a tactical mistake and suffered form a moment of bad fortune. In the minutes before Germany equalised from Ballack's wonderful left field cross his goalkeeper had to be stretchered off with a muscle injury.

Jose Pekerman followed his keeper's substitutions with two defensive ones; taking off creative midfield playmaker Riquelme and forward Hernan Crespo. The gifts of Lionel Messi and Javier Saviola were left on the bench while Julio Cruz, a long ball-holding forward, was brought on to partner Carlos Tevez.

The bad luck and changes seemed to put Germany in charge of the tactical game for the first time in the match.
A minute after Cruz arrived Pekerman might have regretted his decision. Klose's fifth World Cup goal ten minutes from time put him at the top of the Fifa Golden Boot leader board as the tournament's highest goalscorer. He beat his marker to dip and head beyond Leonardo Franco after Tim Borowski, a substitution on 74 minutes, had flicked on a Ballack cross.

The game finished 1-1 and the two halves of extra time mirrored the match; first half uneventful, the second half more attacking. Fabricio Coloccini came closest to breaking the deadlock when he hit the crossbar from 45 yards trying to catch Lehmann off his goal line.

Neither Germany or Argentina had lost in a World Cup penalty contest; both sides had won three. All the penalties hit the target and were well struck, except Ayala's who hit a soft effort which Lehmann saved to his left. Cambiasso's effort to Lehmann's left was better struck but the keeper had guessed the right side to dive to break Argentine hearts.

♡❤♡Post shootout melee♡❤♡

FIFA launched an investigation into an on-field melee which began after the penalties had been decided in Germany's favour.

Punches and kicks were thrown in the tangle. Unused Argentine substitute Leandro Cufre assaulted German Per Mertesacker and was presented the red card by Lubos Michel.

According to the German captain Michael Ballack the conflict originated when Argentine players shouted at the German team during the shootout. When Tim Borowski got Germany's fourth penalty he made a sign to the Argentine players to be quiet.

After the penalty kicks Argentine players approached Borowski and a scuffle of mostly pushing began that involved dozens of players, referees, coaches and substitutes.

FIFA said television pictures would be looked at and fines or sanctions would be considered if appropriate.

&lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGov.%20Arnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; signed a bipartisan state budget Friday that invests a record $55.1 billion in education - an increase of $3.1 billion this year and $8.3 billion over the last two years - and allocates $4.9 billion to create a budget reserve and to pay down the state's debt early.

Schwarzenegger credited bipartisan cooperation in coming up with a budget he was willing to sign, and do it on time, a rarity in recent California politics.

"It's amazing what can be accomplished when Democrats and Republicans work together in Sacramento," said Schwarzenegger. "I want to thank the legislative leadership - Senators &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Perata"&gt;Don Perata&lt;/a&gt; and Dick Ackerman, Speaker Fabian Nunez and Assembly Republican Leader George Plescia - for all their hard work on the budget. We put politics aside and were driven by the overwhelming desire to do what's best for the people of California. 

"I am especially proud that the budget expands preschool, and returns art, music and physical education classes to our children," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3AState%20Superintendent%20of%20Public%20Instruction%20Jack%20O%E2%80%99Connell"&gt;State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell&lt;/a&gt; said he is pleased by the budget. "The budget passed by the Legislature brings welcome support to education in California, making good on past debts to our schools and investing in sorely needed classroom programs," he said.

He had his own budget favorites: "I’m particularly pleased that the budget includes increased funding for school counselors, teacher professional development, programs targeted to helping students pass the high school exit exam, and expanded and improved student nutrition programs.

"While there are some priorities over which we may disagree, I applaud the Governor and the Legislature for a budget that makes education a top priority."

Barbara E. Kerr, president of the 335,000-member &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20Teachers%20Association"&gt;California Teachers Association&lt;/a&gt;, also likes the direction of the new budget.
“The timely approval of the new state budget is good news for our public schools and students," she said. "School districts and teachers can now plan ahead. The nearly six percent cost-of-living-adjustment will allow local schools to restore funding to education programs that have been cut over the past few years and provide for salary increases."

Still, Kerr, said, the budget doesn't go far enough. “This budget is a down payment on the debt owed to our schools. Teachers will continue to work with the governor and the Legislature to ensure repayment of the $3 billion still owed to our schools under Proposition 98 and the lawsuit settlement agreement announced last month. That money will help our schools of greatest need reduce class sizes, improve teacher training and increase parental involvement."

How the budget affects the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Haven%20Unified%20School%20District"&gt;New Haven Unified School District&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Logan%20High%20School"&gt;James Logan High School&lt;/a&gt;, or the&lt;a href="w%3A%20James%20Logan%20Courier"&gt;James Logan Courier&lt;/a&gt;, specifically is not yet clear.

&lt;a href="w%3AState%20Treasurer%20Phil%20Angelides"&gt;State Treasurer Phil Angelides&lt;/a&gt;, who is running for governor against Schwarzenegger, liked the increased education funding, and praised his fellow Democrats in the legislature for that, but criticized the entire budget for being out of balance.

“On higher education, Democrats in the Legislature did the right thing, when the governor would not, and gained a $6 per unit rollback in community college fees," he said in a statement. "That is a start. But the governor’s budget will still leave community college fees nearly double what they were just three years ago. And the budget will also leave untouched the fees at CSU and UC, which have increased by $2,000 and $5,000 respectively under Governor Schwarzenegger."

Missing from the budget, Angelides said, is funding to expand health care for low-income children. Schwarzenegger "failed to get members of his own party to agree to a budget that funds health care for more kids from low-income families on the Healthy Families program regardless of the families’ immigration status. Compassion requires – and intelligent public health practice demands – that all people residing in California have access to adequate health care,” Angelides said.

Schwarzenegger credited a strong economy that increased state revenues for providing the cash to cover the increased expenditures and set aside a $2.1 billion reserve and an additional $2.8 billion for debt prepayment. Included in that is $1.42 billion for repaying borrowed funds earmarked by the voters for transportation projects aimed at reducing traffic throughout the state. The early debt payment and the reserve account for nearly 4.7 percent of the overall budget - the highest in 25 years.

Still, Angelides said, the budget is out of balance and the state is running up more debt. “Despite his repeated pledges to ‘cut up the credit card’ Governor Schwarzenegger has produced a budget that still leaves a $3.3 billion structural budget deficit for 2006-07 and more deficits for years to come," Angelides said, "It is a budget that
will continue to shift the burden of today’s deficits onto the backs of future
generations."

The budget largely mirrors the May Revise, which has since prompted all three Wall Street credit rating agencies to upgrade the state credit rating, reducing the cost of state borrowing. One of the agencies, &lt;a href="w%3AFitch%2C%20Inc."&gt;Fitch, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, cited "California's continuing economic recovery, strong revenue performance and continued progress in reducing fiscal imbalance" when upgrading their rating on the state's general obligation debt from A to A+ last month. &lt;a href="w%3AStandard%20and%20Poor%27s"&gt;Standard and Poor's&lt;/a&gt; also raised its rating from A to A+ in May. &lt;a href="w%3AMoody%27s%20Investors%20Service"&gt;Moody's Investors Service&lt;/a&gt; raised its rating from A2 to A1 the same month.

Despite the improved credit ratings, Angelides said, the three rating agencies still have reservations about the state's fiscal future. The agencies "have corroborated my warning and that of the Legislative Analyst that while state revenues have improved, California’s fiscal condition will remain insecure until the state produces balanced budgets," he said.

Highlights of AB 1801, the Budget Act of 2006 by Assembly member John Laird (D-Santa Cruz), include:

Preschool through High School Education - The budget includes $100 million for the Governor's targeted preschool initiative, which will make preschool available to every four year old living in a low-performing school district. $50 million of this funding will be used to build and improve preschool facilities. The budget also includes $645 million to fund physical education, arts and music programs. Overall, $11,264 will be spent on each student, an increase of $516 from the current year.

Higher Education - The budget allocates $19.1 billion from all sources for higher education and eliminates tuition and fee increases at UC and CSU. California, which already has the lowest community college fees in the nation, will further lower student fees from $26 per unit to $20, effective Spring 2007.

Law Enforcement - The budget includes an additional $196 million to support law enforcement efforts, including money to fund Sexual Assault Felony Enforcement teams, 500 GPS devices to track and monitor the highest-risk parolees and four new Gang Suppression Enforcement Teams. The budget also proposes the addition of 235 California Highway Patrol positions, includes $56.4 million to replace the CHP's existing radio system and allocates $6.4 million to handle the increasing number of wireless &lt;a href="w%3A9-1-1"&gt;9-1-1&lt;/a&gt; calls. Additionally, the budget includes a $20 million investment to strengthen efforts to fight methamphetamine trafficking and $6 million to create three new California Methamphetamine Strategy program teams.

Disaster Preparedness - The budget provides $220 million to enhance California's ability to prepare for, mitigate and respond to emergencies, including money to strengthen public health response during a disaster. This includes preparations to prevent a pandemic influenza outbreak and expanding efforts to help local governments develop disaster preparedness plans.

Public Health - The budget includes $22.6 million for counties to perform outreach and enrollment activities to reach the 428,000 children who are eligible for Medi-Cal or the Healthy Families program but are not enrolled. The budget for the Healthy Families program also covers enrollment growth for 78,200 additional children.

Transportation - In addition, the Budget makes a substantial investment in improving California's transportation system. It provides $1.4 billion to fully fund Proposition 42 for the second consecutive year, and it provides an additional $1.4 billion for the early repayment of past loans from Proposition 42, for a total of $2.8 billion. Of the $1.4 billion repayment, $440 million is designated for cities and counties for local road and street maintenance that would otherwise not be funded.

The budget is the first on time budget since 2000 and the fourth in the last 20 years. The 2006-07 budget's general fund is $101.3 billion and total is $131.4 billion. For a more detailed overview of the budget, please visit www.dof.ca.gov.

Italy took their chances to take a comfortable win in their Fifa World Cup quarter-final match against Ukraine, Friday.

Gianluca Zambrotta scored the game winner after six minutes and Luca Toni netted a double in the second half to secure a semi-final game with the host nation, Germany.

Zambrotta's early goal for Italy was a 30 yard low hard swinging drive that beat the Ukraine keeper at his near post.

Italy played a very effective counter attack game ceding 58 per cent of possession to Ukraine while they equalled their opponents creativity in front of goal with seven shots on target.

Ukraine played good football in the second period and while they were still one goal down were unlucky not to net an equaliser. 
They were up against an Italian defence that had conceded just one goal in the tournament - which was an own goal - and was to complete a third consecutive shut out.

On 48 minutes Gianluigi Buffon made a match-winning save from Maksym Kalinichenko. In the process of tipping the downward header onto the post Buffon head-butted the upright.

As Ukraine upped the pressure Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro then made a crucial winning header clearance as Andiry Shevchenko lurked behind.

When Buffon saved again and Zambrotta cleared off the line from Kalinichenko Ukraine coach Oleg Blohkin rued the missed chances. A minute later an Italian attack led to a corner, taken short Totti's near-post ball met a diving Toni and it was suddenly 2-0.

Andriy Gusin then connected with a header and hit the crossbar but though the Ukraine effort was vigorous on the day they did not score.

Ten minutes after Toni's first World Cup goal, Zambrotta dribbled into the penalty area from the left side and passed the ball to Toni who tapped in his second goal from five yards.

An unsung hero of the match was Gennaro Gattuso whose hard work in midfield earned him Fifa's Man of the Match award.

<h1>World's highest railway links Tibet to rest of China</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=World%27s%20highest%20railway%20links%20Tibet%20to%20rest%20of%20China&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The first trains were flagged onto the &lt;a href="w%3AQinghai-Tibet%20Railway"&gt;Qinghai-Tibet Railway&lt;/a&gt; line, the world's highest railway line connecting the &lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibetan&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href="w%3ALhasa"&gt;Lhasa&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="w%3AGolmud"&gt;Golmud&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AQinghai"&gt;Qinghai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. At its highest point in the &lt;a href="w%3ATanggula%20Pass"&gt;Tanggula Pass&lt;/a&gt;, the railway line reaches an altitude of 5072 metres.

The line is designed for travel at speeds of 100 km/h on frozen ground to 120 km/h on non-frozen ground. The cabins are supplied with oxygen because of the thin air at the high altitudes. The windows have ultra-violet filters to keep out the sun's glare. Cooling pipes have been used to ensure the ground remains frozen.

Air trips to Tibet are expensive and road trips slow and dangerous.
Three trains, each carrying 900 passengers are scheduled to run daily along the line. The basic tickets cost 389 yuan to go from Beijing to Lhasa. The trip should take just under 48 hours. According to state television the tickets for the inaugural trip sold out within 10 minutes.

Speaking at the flagging-off ceremony in front of the Golmud railway station, the Chinese President &lt;a href="Hu%20Jintao"&gt;Hu Jintao&lt;/a&gt; said, "The project is not only a magnificent feat in China's history of railway construction, but is also a great miracle of the world's railroad history,"

The Chinese government states that it spent more than US$95 million reducing the environmental damage of this railway. Passengers will not be able to open the windows of the train to litter. There will be a rubbish train to pick up refuse from various sites along the line.

Critics claim that the railway will be used to assert control over Tibet as the line can quickly transport Chinese troops to Tibet during unrest.

They also claim that the railway will damage both the environment and the culture of Tibet. Tibet is home to many endangered species such as the Tibetan antelope. 

On Friday, 3 women from the United States, Canada, and Britain were detained for displaying a banner saying "China's Tibet Railway, Designed to Destroy" at Beijing's main station.

"It's the first direct, low-cost, quick, and easy way for migrants to arrive in central Tibet. This will lead to the overwhelming of Tibetans and competition for scarce jobs. The eventual idea is the dilution of Tibetan language, culture and identity," said Lhadon Tethong, executive director of the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;-based Students for a Free Tibet.

"The railway line itself is not a cause of concern for the Tibetan people," said Thupten Samphel, spokesman for the &lt;a href="Dalai%20Lama"&gt;Dalai Lama&lt;/a&gt;'s government in exile. "How it will be used is the main concern."

"Despite the rosy economic forecasts and dire predictions of Chinese control, the train is unlikely to touch off social disaster or commercial windfall," said Andrew Fischer, an economics researcher at the London School of Economics.

"When the railroad opens the commercial service and more people move in and out of the region, I think it will be good for the outside world to know more about Tibetan culture," Zhu, the railway official, said. "No culture can develop and thrive in a closed environment."

On July 1, 2006 at Midnight &lt;a href="w%3AEastern%20Daylight%20Time"&gt;Eastern Daylight Time&lt;/a&gt;, the purpose of the website &lt;a href="w%3AEon8"&gt;Eon8&lt;/a&gt; was revealed, turning out to be an experiment on how the public reacts to a lack of information. Eon8, prior to the revelation, was a website counting down to July 1 created by a 23-year-old web designer from Florida known only as "Mike". The bottom of the page featured links to other pages and a note on the "project status." Eon8 is often "offline" due to the heavy traffic it is receiving.

Links to other pages included a "deployment tracker," which featured a map of the world highlighting heavily populated areas, and "deployment logs," which were revealed to be arbitrary characters encoded in &lt;a href="w%3AMD5"&gt;MD5&lt;/a&gt;. Going to eon8.com/security listed a series of rejected "&lt;a href="w%3AHTTP%20referer"&gt;referers&lt;/a&gt;"; accessing the website from a link on a website that has not been approved by Eon8 would result in a rejected "referrer" page. Three other links on the main page were password-protected, however it was revealed today that there was no password. Anyone who managed to circumvent the password protection would find a page reading "This is a decoy folder. Please connect to the internal secure network."

Predictions of the purpose of Eon8 included the distribution of &lt;a href="w%3Acomputer%20virus"&gt;computer viruses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aviral%20marketing"&gt;viral marketing&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href="w%3Aalternate%20reality%20game"&gt;alternate reality game&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, plenty of references were made to the &lt;a href="w%3ABook%20of%20Revelations"&gt;Book of Revelations&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AThird%20Reich"&gt;Third Reich&lt;/a&gt;. The website's popularity spread as a result of plenty of Internet communities reacting to it, including forum posts on &lt;a href="w%3A4chan"&gt;4chan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AeBaum%27s%20World"&gt;eBaum's World&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASomething%20Awful"&gt;Something Awful&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a page on &lt;a href="w%3AYTMND"&gt;YTMND&lt;/a&gt; predicting the purpose of Eon8.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AYorkshire"&gt;Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acricket"&gt;cricketer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFred%20Trueman"&gt;Fred Trueman&lt;/a&gt;, has died at the age of 75. The first cricketer in English history to obtain 300 test match wickets, Truman died after battling lung cancer. 

Dubbed 'Fiery Fred', Trueman was born in &lt;a href="w%3AStainton"&gt;Stainton&lt;/a&gt;, Yorkshire and made his Yorkshire test debut in 1949, eventually retiring 20 years later. Over the course of his career, both for his county and his country, Trueman took in excess of 2,000 wickets.

On retirement from the game, Trueman took up the microphone and worked as expert analyst on &lt;a href="w%3ATest%20Match%20Special"&gt;♡❤Test Match Special♡❤&lt;/a&gt; (Produced by the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20Radio%204"&gt;BBC Radio 4&lt;/a&gt;) until 2000.

Speaking on Sky News (1st July 2006) former England Cricket Captain, Mike Gatting said, "He was in a league of his own, Fiery Fred will be missed."
