&lt;a href="w%3AQuaero"&gt;Quaero&lt;/a&gt; is being termed eurozone's response to the US-based internet search giants such as &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AYahoo"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMSN"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;. The project includes the French and German governments along with a host of European technology companies such as Thomson, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20Telecom"&gt;France Telecom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADeutsche%20Telekom"&gt;Deutsche Telekom&lt;/a&gt;. It is scheduled to be submitted to France's Agency of Industrial Innovation later this month. The agency which has a budget of €2 billion ($2.41 billion) hasn't specified how much of this money will be spent on Quaero. 

President &lt;a href="w%3AJacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt; announced the launch of Quaero during the French-German ministerial conference in April of last year. It is the latest in a series of initiatives by the Europeans to compete with US dominance in technology. Europe launched the Galileo satellite navigation system last month aimed at rivaling a similar system already available in the US. French broadcasters are also planning an international television network, CFII aimed at presenting the French view on world events. The network is slated to begin broadcasting in French and English to Europe, the Middle East and Africa sometime next year.

Designers hope that Quaero will be the world's most advanced multimedia search engine to locate and translate video and audio over the internet. A pretty ambitious goal even by the admission of people involved "Yes, it's highly ambitious," said Jean-Luc Moullet, who oversees the Quaero project at Thomson. "There's nothing to compare it to."

However details remain scant and mostly shrouded in secrecy. None of the key players has commented on cost and last week, Thomson, removed access to the page on its corporate web site devoted to Quaero and instructed its executives not to give any interviews for the project.

Most industry experts remain skeptical and fear that the program would be costly and unwieldy to administer and would produce no tangible commercial advances. "I'm not too confident that Quaero will be able to produce anything that the private sector isn't already offering or will develop on its own in the future," said John Lervik, chief executive of Fast Search &amp; Transfer, a Norwegian software company that provides search solutions to businesses for data stored on their corporate networks.

The South African Presidency today denied that it had been inconsistent with its explanations and defense of a holiday trip undertaken by the South African deputy president, Phumzila Mlambo-Ngcuka, during December last year, which was funded by the state.

Mlambo-Ngcuka, who was appointed as deputy president of South Africa after the previous deputy president, Jacob Zuma, was removed from the position following allegations of fraud and corruption, undertook the controversial holiday trip to the United Arab Emirates aboard a state-owned ♡❤Falcon 900♡❤ National Defense Force jet during the December holidays last year. When the facts surrounding the trip became known in early January it was criticized by a wide range of critics, including the country's leading opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the largest alliance of trade unions, COSATU. The cost of fuel alone for the use of the jet is said to amount to approximately R400,000 (at least $67,000). The total cost to the state and the South African taxpayers for the deputy president's holiday trip amounts to as much as R700,000 (at least $116,000).

The deputy president has indicated that whilst the trip was a private holiday trip, it had also been undertaken for work purposes and that she had visited projects in the UAE that she had had an interest in. The deputy president's children and the wife of Social Development cabinet minister Zola Skweyiya had accompanied her on the trip.

At least eight people have died in a fire in a multi-storied office center, namely, in the office belonging to the Russian Savings Bank (&lt;a href="w%3ASberbank"&gt;Sberbank&lt;/a&gt;), in the Russian Pacific port city of &lt;a href="w%3AVladivostok"&gt;Vladivostok&lt;/a&gt;, the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said Monday. 

A spokesman said that the blaze broke at about 12:00 local time (02:00 UTC) on the sixth floor of the building. Some of the victims died when they jumped out windows in an attempt to escape the flames. In addition to the fatalities, another 15 people were hospitalized with burns and injuries.

According to firefighters, serious breaches of fire-safety regulations were partly to blame for the deaths. A door to the attic was locked and people could not escape through an emergency exit. 

The fire has been almost extinguished. A team of investigators led by the deputy prosecutor of the Maritime Territory, Sergei Luchaninov, is looking into how the fire started.

Iraq health officials are reportedly looking into the death of a teenaged girl who died near the border with Turkey, which is believed to possibly be linked to the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; Asian bird flu.

The young woman lived near a resevoir used as a stopover for migratory birds traveling from Turkey. Her family kept domestic birds, some of which have been sick and died; it is unknown at this time if any of the birds were infected with H5N1.

The inquiry is being investigated, and blood samples have been sent to &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; for further testing. Residents in the region fear the virus may have spread from Turkey, where UN official believe the strain exists in the wild fowl population.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASunderland%20A.F.C."&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; slumped to their 14th league game without a victory despite a spirited performance against league leaders &lt;a href="Chelsea%20F.C."&gt;Chelsea F.C.&lt;/a&gt;. 

Records were set before this Sunday afternoon game kicked-off in the North-East; bookmaker's were offering the shortest odds for an away win in the history of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AF.A.%20Premier%20League"&gt;Premier League&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , as top faced bottom at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStadium%20of%20Light"&gt;Stadium of Light&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Sunderland, in the middle of a season breaking records for the wrong reasons, were hoping to avoid a result as bad as the 7-0 defeat local rivals &lt;a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C."&gt;Middlesbrough&lt;/a&gt; suffered to &lt;a href="Arsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; the day before.

Despite pre-match predictions, the Londoners looked out of sorts for much of the first-half, and it was the home side who took a shock-lead on 11 minutes. Jon Terry failed to completely clear a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJulio%20Arca"&gt;Julio Arca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; punt into the box, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiam%20Lawrence"&gt;Liam Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; pounced with a low, powerful volley in to the bottom corner.

Chelsea were not behind for long; Sunderland defenders were caught-out on 20 minutes, when a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Gallas"&gt;William Gallas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cross, which looked as though it was headed out of play, was headed back across the face of goal by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Cole"&gt;Joe Cole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Defenders were caught flat-footed, and Argentinian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHernan%20Crespo"&gt;Hernan Crespo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was first to react with a close-range header.

In the second half Chelsea began to exert authority; they dominated possession and chances and looked most likely to take the lead. Sunderland keeper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKelvin%20Davis"&gt;Kelvin Davis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , suffering criticism from Sunderland fans as of late, made a series of superb stops to deny Chelsea the lead. It was a cruel deflection off the head of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADean%20Whitehead"&gt;Dean Whitehead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which finally gave the reigning champions the lead on 70 minutes, Dutchman &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArjen%20Robben"&gt;Arjen Robben&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; providing the strike. The game's main talking point occurred moments later, as Robben jumped over advertising boards in order to celebrate the goal with the traveling fans. As stewards scrambled to remove Robben from the clutches of the jubilant Chelsea followers, referee &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Foy"&gt;Chris Foy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , working to the letter of the law, brandished a second yellow card and sent the midfield playmaker off.

10-man Chelsea held on despite a period of late Sunderland pressure. The defeat sees Sunderland remain rooted to the foot of the table on 6 points.

President-elect &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt;, who will assume office on Sunday January 22, announced on Wednesday that General &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AMarcelo%20Antezana"&gt;Marcelo Antezana&lt;/a&gt; will face trial for treason after sending 28 aging Chinese-made missiles to the U.S. for destruction at the request from the U.S.

General Antezana, who was dismissed from his position this Wednesday 18, told Bolivian media that &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; had requested the missiles amid fears that Evo Morales would win the presidency. Days later, he retracted his comments. The Defence Minister, Gonzalo Mendez, resigned over the scandal.

Morales' political party, &lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20for%20Socialism%20%28Bolivia%29"&gt;Movement for Socialism&lt;/a&gt;, has petitioned the Public Ministry to bring the transitional president &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEduardo%20Rodriguez"&gt;Eduardo Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt; to trial on charges stemming from their investigation.

Rodriguez, interim president appointed after &lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Mesa"&gt;Carlos Mesa&lt;/a&gt; resigned in June, said that he had authorized the destruction, but not the transfer of the weapons, which were the only ones of its kind in Bolivia. The missile handover was an unapproved arrangement between local soldiers and the U.S. military, according to Rodriquez. He made a formal protest to the U.S. embassy on Tuesday, he said.
Rodriguez said his decision to get rid of the weapons was based on recommendations from United Nations and the Organization of American States. The army also reported they were a safety hazard. The obsolete surface-to-air missiles were destroyed in the U.S last October.

A U.S. State Department spokesman said that a campaign to eliminate portable arms in Latin America has been on-going in an effort to keep them from falling into the hands of terrorists.

In &lt;a href="w%3ACenterton%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Centerton, Indiana&lt;/a&gt; a man is alive thanks to his 2 dogs.

Bill Burns was taking his nightly stroll with his dogs, Butch and Dusty, when he had a severe diabetic attack in a cornfield.

His dogs immediately reacted.

Morgan County sheriff's Deputy, Steve Hoffman, was on a rural road just finishing with a traffic stop, when he noticed a light shining from a cornfield. "I noticed what appeared to be an illumination or a light that was flickering and facing my direction," Hoffman said. When he got out of his car and walked to where he saw the light, he found Butch was holding a flashlight like he would a bone, in his mouth. Meanwhile, Dusty had stretched himself across Mr. Burns to try and keep him warm.

Hoffman said he then noticed that Mr. Burns was wearing a diabetic medical bracelet and immediately took him to the hospital.

Burns says that he does not remember the ordeal, but thinks that Hoffman even seeing the light is remarkable enough for him.

"It's got to be just fate or faith, one or the other," Burns said.

The dogs "definitely are the heroes in the story," said Hoffman.

Burns was in the hospital nearly 4 days before he had been released.

"Had he not had the dogs with him that evening, I think the outcome would have been a lot worse," Hoffman said.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;New Zealand Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; will be attending &lt;a href="w%3AWaitangi%20Day"&gt;Waitangi Day&lt;/a&gt; commemorations on February 6th; however she will not visit the lower Te Tii Marae, which has been a focal point for protest in recent years.

Her office has said that she would be doing a walkabout on the Treaty Grounds before attending a reception hosted by the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Governor General&lt;/a&gt; that night.

The Prime Minister hopes her attendance will be trouble free. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;Leader of the Opposition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Brash"&gt;Dr Don Brash&lt;/a&gt; is also to attend the attend a reception hosted by the Governor General and the Dawn Service. In 2004 Brash was showered with mud at the entrance of the lower Te Tii Marae.

Although this is New Zealand's national day, the commemoration has often been the focus of protest by &lt;a href="w%3AMaori"&gt;Maori&lt;/a&gt; activists, and is often marred by controversy.

This year co-ordinators will allow all media to attend the Waitangi Day commemorations. In 2003 and 2004 all Non-Maori media were banned from the Marae.

London, UK -- The Vodafone GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) Mobile Data Network within the UK was off the air for several hours, but Vodafone staff were unable to supply any details as to how or why this had happened. The incident seems to have originated within Southern England, but spread "nationwide" within a short period.

Customers were therefore unable to access data services for a protracted period, including WAP browsing from mobile phones, email from personal devices like Blackberries and Windows Mobile Messengers, and full access over data cards from laptops. 

Some criticism has been levelled at the company for failing to provide an easy source of information on the problem, with the only realistic option being to queue for a response from a call centre, as no information could be found on their public-facing website. This practice, whilst far from unique to Vodafone within the telecommunications industry, contrasts poorly with the common practice for most ISPs (Internet Service Providers), who conventionally provide a "system status" page on their website.

Sharp declines in technology bellwethers Intel and Yahoo dragged down the tech laden Nasdaq Composite Index Wednesday. The index finished at 2279.64, a drop of 23.05 points or 1 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 Index ended the day with losses of 0.38 percent and 0.39 percent to end at 10,854.86 and 1277.93 respectively.

The world's largest chipmaker fell nearly $3 or 11 percent to $22.60. Internet software giant Yahoo was down nearly $5 to close at $35.18 a loss of nearly 12 percent. Analysts blamed disappointing sales forecasts for the first quarter for today's selloff. 

A number of research firms including Citigroup and UBS handed downgrades to Intel stock today. This followed the company's failure to meet analysts’ and its own expectations for revenue and earnings during its fourth quarter earnings release yesterday. 

Thomas Thornhill lowered his stock rating to "neutral" and commented on Intel's competitive situation with arch-rival Advanced Micro Devices. “AMD is likely to remain a serious competitor to Intel and Intel’s longer-term risk profile is now higher than we previously believed”

London, UK -- Commuters in the South East today discovered that it's not only problems at Clapham Junction that can cause disruption to more travellers from more than one of the major London stations. A single gas leak near Battersea Park Junction interrupted services to and from both Waterloo and Victoria stations, the 2 main termini covering the areas "south of the river" in the metropolis.

The incident occurred around lunchtime, with trains being cancelled and delayed, and even once the leak had been repaired, the knock-on effects from the earlier disruptions caused delays to peak hour commuters returning home. 

The situation was not aided by differential information being made available on travel news sources, a phenomenon that has become a familiar story since the once-unified British Rail was split up into an infrastructure operator and a number of different Train Operating Companies (TOCs).

ABC News is reporting that a key &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Qaeda"&gt;Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; operative was killed in the U.S. airstrike in &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; which killed 18 people, including women and children, last week.

An Egyptian chemist, Midhat Mursi, 52, also known as Abu Khabab al-Masri, was identified by unnamed Pakistan officials to ABC news. The sources said he was among one of three known senior al Qaeda members present at the compound that was hit.

"He's the man who trained the shoe bomber, Richard Reid and Zacharias Mousssaoui, as well as hundreds of others," said former FBI agent Jack Cloonan.
Mursi has a $5 million dollar bounty on his head and is well-known for his chemical weapons expertise, strange alias, and red beard. 

Two Pakistani officials also reported the son-in-law of Al Qaeda's No. 2 leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was also among those killed in the U.S. airstrikes. 

Abu Ubayda al-Misri, Abd al-Rahman al-Maghrebi who was Zawahiri's son-in-law, and Mustafa Osman another Egyptian who was an associate of Zawahiri, are thought to be among those terrists that were killed. U.S. officials also say that Khalid Habib, another senior Al Qaeda operative, may have been at the site of the attack.

Pakistani officials have been searching for the gravesights of the 4 or 5 terrorists killed in the attack where three houses were destroyed, but so far have been unsuccessful. Provincial authorities say that sympathizers probably took the bodies to be buried in the mountains to prevent their identification.

"We do not have any evidence to prove that they have been killed, but we have indications that they were there and were among those bodies that were taken away," an unnamed official was quoted by the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; news agency.

Pakistani Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao had earlier stated that the Pakistani government had no knowledge of the identities of the foreigners who were believed killed in the missile attack.

U.S. counterterrorism officials had no immediate comment on the report. The White House, as of Tuesday, has not made mention of any U.S. connection with the attack, but called Pakistan a valuable ally in the war against terrorists.

Pressure group and fathers rights campaigners Fathers for Justice are to suspend their operations. The campaign leader Matt O'Connor has said last night that the group were looking into claims by the Sun newspaper that members of the group had been planning to abduct the 5 year old son of Tony Blair. 

However, O'Connor told channel 4 television that the group could no longer continue after the negative publicity that this accusation will cause. 

The group have been recently famed for their &lt;a href="w%3AFathers%204%20Justice%20protests"&gt;headline grabbing stunts&lt;/a&gt; including; throwing flour in the House of Commons at the Prime Minister and the trespassing incident at Buckingham Palace. These actions have stirred up public support for their campaign. 

O'Connor said 'After peacefully campaigning for three years to ensure children get to see their fathers, we condemn any individual who planned this appalling outrage which is anathema to our campaign.' O'Connor then added 'I have three young boys myself and couldn't think of anything more traumatic for Mr Blair, his family and his son than what is reported in this morning's Sun newspaper, however we should approach the story with caution as it carries very little information in it.' 

A Downing Street spokesperson has said that there will be no official response.

Mr O'Connor has now publicly stated that he wants to distance himself from the group. 'I don't want to be associated with an organisation getting headlines like this'. 

Fathers for Justice had been working towards removing the radical elements of its membership with an expulsion of 30 of its most extreme members. 

The Police have claimed that they were aware of the plan but knew it to have not got past the talking stage. 

This event has left the group in turmoil; they now appear to have no leader and their future is uncertain.

Stardust, a &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; space probe, returned with more than scientists bargained for.

"I didn't see anything," said &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Washington"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt; astronomer, Don Brownlee, from NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AJohnson%20Space%20Center"&gt;Johnson Space Center&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday.

But then, technicians flipped over the collection grid and scientists all around let out a huge gasp of excitement.

"It's better than we could have possibly hoped for," Brownlee said. "It exceeds all expectations. We have a huge number of impacts, and some are quite big and visible to the naked eye. It's a huge success."

In a memo from NASA, scientists said "hundreds of particles" could be seen in the collection tray. "There were two particularly large comet particles that had 'exploded' inside," said the memo.

A lot of the largest particles shattered into little bits of black debris when they landed on the collecter. But many other visible particles left tracks as they landed at 13,000 MPH and stopped fully intact. "I remember warning people not to be disappointed if these tracks were very hard to see, but they are absolutely stunning," Brownlee said.

Before they opened the collector, Brownlee admitted that no one really knew whether or not the device had actually caught any particles. "You just don't know if nature is going to cooperate or not. It has been a magic mission."

"The capsule tumbled several times when it landed by parachute in the Utah desert, but the impact didn't crack the &lt;a href="w%3Aaerogel"&gt;aerogel&lt;/a&gt;," said Brownlee.

NASA researcher Scott Sandford said the collection effort "succeeded well beyond our wildest hopes. I am not sure if it is good clean-room protocol to hug each other, but there was a lot of it going on for the first 10 minutes or so," he added.

Stardust traveled nearly 3 billion miles and went around the Sun 3 times. Stardust's mission in space lasted 7 years.

Scientists also hope to use Distributed Computing to help with looking over the samples. They will use a VM (Virtual Microscope) which will be developed by the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20California"&gt;University of California&lt;/a&gt; at Berkeley. The developers, computer scientist David Anderson, director of the &lt;a href="w%3ASETI%40home"&gt;SETI@home&lt;/a&gt; project and physics graduate student, Joshua Von Korff, are expected to design the program which is expected to go public in March.

American cable news network &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; has began to implement more personalities into its lineup, with the hirings of three prominent &lt;a href="w%3Aconservative"&gt;conservative&lt;/a&gt; commentators as contributors. 

On January 5, the weblog TVNewser reported that &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20John%20Bennett"&gt;Bill Bennett&lt;/a&gt; had been hired by the network as a political analyst. Bennett, a Republican activist, was appointed by &lt;a href="w%3ARonald%20Reagan"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt; as the Secretary of Education, and currently hosts a talk radio show, ♡❤Morning in America♡❤. Bennet came under fire in late 2005 for controversial statements made following the landfall of &lt;a href="w%3AHurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;, in which he said on his radio program: "if you wanted to reduce crime, you could—if that were your sole purpose—you could abort every black baby in this country and your crime rate would go down."

On January 17, the ♡❤Atlanta Journal-Constitution♡❤ reported that ♡❤CNN Headline News♡❤ was hiring radio host Glenn Beck to host a new primetime show, and just a day later, CNN announced that former Republican congressman J.C. Watts was joining the network as a political analyst. Beck is quoted by the group &lt;a href="w%3AFairness%20and%20Accuracy%20in%20Reporting"&gt;Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting&lt;/a&gt; as saying that "Every night I get down on my knees and pray that Dennis Kucinich will burst into flames."

In an article in ♡❤Variety♡❤, CNN executive vice president Ken Jautz touted Beck, saying "Glenn’s style is self-deprecating, cordial; he says he'd like to be able to disagree with guests and part as friends. It's conversational, not confrontational." In response, MSNBC host Keith Olbermann named Jautz the "Worst Person in the World" on his show, saying "That's cordial? Compared to who? Bill O'Reilly? Nancy Grace? Michael Savage?"

Liberal media watch group Media Matters sent out two emails to members, saying, "These three actions [hirings] raise serious questions about whether CNN has made a high-level decision to support and promote right-wing individuals, even those who have a history of promoting conservative misinformation and offensive rhetoric," commented Media Matters' David Grossman.

The media watch group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting also criticized the move in an action alert, saying "The strategy of out-Foxing Fox by signing up incendiary right-wing talk show hosts is a dangerous one, as MSNBC found when it gave a show to hate-radio star Michael Savage and had to let him go when it turned out that his TV persona spouted the same vitriol featured on his radio show," referring to an incident during a live broadcast that led to Savage's dismissal.

CNN has been in a fierce ratings competition with the &lt;a href="w%3AFOX%20News%20Channel"&gt;FOX News Channel&lt;/a&gt;, which has steadily begun gaining market share against the network, featuring several of the most-watched primetime shows.

<h1>Two-day bird flu conference draws $1.9 billion in pledges</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Two-day%20bird%20flu%20conference%20draws%20%241.9%20billion%20in%20pledges&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
In Beijing, China, 1.9 billion US dollars in pledges came from 33 countries and a host of multilateral institutions at the end of a meet co-ordinated by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;. The amount exceeded the organization's estimate of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in funds required to contain the &lt;a href="w%3Aavian%20flu"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt; over the next three years. In addition to aiding research efforts, the money is expected to help strengthen surveillance and increase the stockpiling of surgical masks and other equipment. 

The United States was the largest donor, pledging $334 million in grants. Japan pledged $159 million while the European Union pledged $120 million. The EU member nations promised an additional $138 million.

China which is home to a third of the entire world's population of birds pledged $10 million to help other countries with the effort. Jia Youling, China's chief veterinary official defended the relatively small pledge claiming that China was still a developing country and faced a serious challenge from bird flu within its borders. Premier &lt;a href="w%3AWen%20Jiabao"&gt;Wen Jiabao&lt;/a&gt; personally attended the conference and announced that the country would share more information on outbreaks in the country, including samples that will assist in tracing genetic changes.

Dr. Lee Jong-wook, the director general of the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, believes that the Chinese government was fully committed to sharing information openly and freely about bird flu cases. But he cautions that it would be difficult to stay fully informed about every health development in a country as populous as China.

Dr. Lee also expressed his concern about reports that children in Turkey have now become infected with the A(&lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;) avian influenza virus without becoming ill. Some studies suggest that the disease must become less lethal before it can cause a global epidemic, he noted. There is concern that patients may continue to infect more people by going through their daily routines if the flu symptoms remain mild.

Some scientists note that the avian flu has been known to occur among poultry in southern China since at least 1996. They are encouraged that the avian flu virus has failed to evolved into a form that is transmittable by people in all this time. This could be an indication that this would never happen. But others including officials from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt; disagree claiming that increased contact between infected poultry and people raises the odds that the virus may eventually adapt better for transmission among humans.

&lt;a href="w%3AHideaki%20Noguchi"&gt;Hideaki Noguchi&lt;/a&gt;, 38, a close aide to &lt;a href="w%3ALivedoor"&gt;Livedoor&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3ATakafumi%20Horie"&gt;Takafumi Horie&lt;/a&gt; was found bleeding in a hotel bed with cuts to his wrists on Wednesday in Naha, the capital of the southern prefecture of &lt;a href="w%3AOkinawa"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt;. He was later confirmed dead and the police suspect that he committed suicide. Hideo Sawada, the president of HS Securities, told reporters in Tokyo that Noguchi's family had identified the body.

Noguchi was a board member at Japan M&amp;A Management Co., a unit of H.S. Securities Co. The firm was raided by prosecutors earlier this week in connection with fraudulent practices at Livedoor, according to the Kyodo News agency. He was a graduate of Tokyo's Meiji University, and joined Livedoor in 2000. He had previously worked at Kokusai Securities Co. as an adviser in financing. Livedoor was publicly listed on the &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Tokyo Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt; in April 2000. Noguchi then set up the investment unit Capitalista Co., which merged with HS Securities.

News of the suicide is being featured in the Japanese media in connection with what is being termed the "Livedoor Shock". The problems at Livedoor have led to the loss of a third of its $6.3-billion value in the stock market. Livedoor maintains that its own investigation reveal that it did not violate any securities laws. 

Some view the affair as an outcome of the larger struggle between competing business cultures in Japan. Takafumi Horie is part of a new generation of Japanese entrepreneurs with little patience for the customs of a traditionally cautious business culture. Horie has shown an appetite for publicity through his internet blogs and appearances on TV shows while living a rock star lifestyle that includes private jets and actress girlfriends.

Horie is also credited with popularizing stock trading among individual investors. The practice of &lt;a href="w%3Aday%20trading"&gt;day trading&lt;/a&gt; is relatively new in Japan. The &lt;a href="w%3ANikkei"&gt;Nikkei&lt;/a&gt; index was up about 40% last year, its best performance since 1986.

A six vehicle pile up occurred on the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia%20Highway%2097"&gt;John Hart Highway (British Columbia Highway 97)&lt;/a&gt;, north of the John Hart Bridge in &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20George%2C%20British%20Columbia"&gt;Prince George&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="British%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; which disrupted traffic during the morning rush hour of March 5, 2009. 

No serious injuries arose as a result of the accident, however traffic was reduced to a single lane. Traffic control was conducted by a &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police"&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police&lt;/a&gt; officer who was at the scene at the time of the accident (7:45 a.m.). The RCMP cruiser was not one of the vehicles involved in the pile up. The crash was put under investigation by a traffic analyst.

The John Hart Highway connects Prince George,a city of 70,981 according to the 2006 census, with &lt;a href="w%3ADawson%20Creek"&gt;Dawson Creek&lt;/a&gt; over a length of approximately 250 miles (400 km). The Northwest Corridor Association saw a &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;C$&lt;/a&gt;30 million &lt;a href="w%3ADual%20carriageway"&gt;twinning&lt;/a&gt; upgrade to the John Hart bridge which spans the Nechako River, a tributary of the &lt;a href="w%3AFraser%20River"&gt;Fraser River&lt;/a&gt;. The bridge is located 5.4 kilometres (3.4 miles) north of Prince George. In March there is a traffic volume of between 11,000 to 12,000 vehicles per day at the north end of the John Hart bridge according to the the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation Average Annual Daily Traffic AADT reports between 1994 and 2000.

&lt;a href="w%3ASchapelle%20Corby"&gt;Schappelle Corby&lt;/a&gt; has been told by an &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; court that her 20 year sentence for allegedly smuggling drugs into Indonesia would be reinstated following an appeal attempt. Her lawyers had previously been successful in reducing her sentence to 15 years.

Indonesian police allege that Corby smuggled 4.1Kg of &lt;a href="w%3Amarajuana"&gt;marajuana&lt;/a&gt; hidden in a body board bag into &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;. Corby has maintained that the drugs did not belong to her and must have been placed in her bag between &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and Bali.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; baggage handlers had been caught using passenger's luggage to distribute illegal drugs.

Judges rejected her appeal last week, reinstating her original sentence at the same time.

The Indonesian supreme court has ordered that the drugs be destroyed, signalling that it is the end of any possible future appeal attempts.

Another twist has emerged in the Corby story with her 18 year old half brother arrested yesterday on charges of producing and possessing a dangerous drug, deprivation of liberty and assault occasioning bodily harm.

Corby's lawyer Hotman Paris Hutapea said that the development had "totally ruined his case". Speaking before discovering Corby's original sentence had been reinstated said he feared the development involving Corby's half brother, James Kisina, would ruin his attempts to free Schapelle.
Corby's Balinese lawyer, Erwin Siregar, disagrees with Mr Paris claiming the arrest could provide evidence to reopen her case if there is any proof or statements that the marijuana she was caught with belonged to her half-brother.

In court today, Kisina claimed that he was seeking to obtain information from known drug dealers in Brisbane which could assist in Corby's appeal.

The Iraqi government has asked the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to release 6 of the 8 Iraqi women that are currently prisoners, which Iraq claims is not a bid to get American journalist Jill Carroll freed. A commission reviewing detainee cases has recommended Monday that at least six of them be released.

A Human Rights Ministry official said the call "to free the women was not made in response to demands from Carroll's kidnappers." He then went on to say, "There was no outside pressure on the commission" to recommend releasing the women. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisal from insurgents.

Abductors holding the journalist have made demands that all female Iraqi prisoners be released or they will kill her.

The U.S. said that they currently have 8 women in security detention. But as of Wednesday night, refused to comment on whether or not the women had been released.

Carroll was kidnapped in January when insurgents ambushed her car and killed her translator. She is 28 years old. The abductors gave a 72 hour dead line and are expected to kill her tomorrow if their demands are not met.

Insurgents in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; have recently kidnapped more than 240 foreigners and killed at least 39 of them since the beginning of the war. Some estimates of the number of Iraqis kidnapped place it in the hundreds and possibly even thousands.

The &lt;a href="w%3AQatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;-based Arabic news channel, &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;, announced receipt of the audio tape purportedly from &lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20Bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama Bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;. Portions were broadcast in which Bin Laden offers a "a long-term truce" to allow rebuilding of &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; while also making threats of "new attacks" against the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

Following are several excerpts from the tape.

In a &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; press conference today, &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Press%20Secretary"&gt;Press Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; showed no fear: "We are taking the fight to the enemy and we will find them where ever they are. Terrorists view democracy as a threat. We will not let up or stop until the job is done. We will win this war on terrorism. We do not negotiate with terrorists, we put them out of business. We're working to advance freedom and democracy. We will pursue those who seek to do harm."

The CIA ran voice analyzer tests on the tape against previous tapes and confirmed that the tape is authentic and that of Bin Laden's voice. 

This tape, says Michael Scheuer, former head of the CIA's Bin Laden unit, "proves two things...he's not dead. And despite all the things we say about him being isolated and alone, he can clearly dominate the international media when he wants to."

Judith Yaphe, a former CIA Middle East analyst now at the National Defense University in Washington says, "He's saying that whatever measures we've taken, they have not affected him. He's got to reassure people that he's alive and well."

No conditions of the truce offering were present in the portion of the tape broadcast.

Al Jazeera also says that the tape was made during the Muslim holy month of December, in 2005.

U.S. officials also say the terror alert level will not be raised as of yet.

The Associated Press is also reporting that there is no unusual amounts of "chatter", which is what U.S. officials term as terrorist talk.

The UK musician, Niomi McLean-Daley popularly known as 'Ms Dynamite' has been sentenced to carry out 60 hours of community service after admitting to assaulting a policewoman.

The rap star has been fined £750 in compensation.

Sky News reports that "she had hit the officer in the face at a London police station on January 6."

According to Sky News, District Judge Timothy Workman said: "The injury sustained by that one blow were obviously more considerable than first thought.

"I accept that it was one blow and in the circumstances bearing in mind your good character, you have never been in court before, you are entitled to a discount on sentence."

According to her solicitor the catalyst for the row was the racial abuse of her sister Annabell, 18.

The BBC reports that Ms Dynamite's solicitor Anthony Burton said: "My client has absolutely no excuse for her conduct. She makes no bones about that. 

She apologises profoundly for her conduct to the officer involved, Pc Marles. "She is deeply ashamed."

During his trial today, &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; cleric &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Hamza%20al-Masri"&gt;Abu Hamza al-Masri&lt;/a&gt;, denied the claim that he had incited his followers to commit acts of murder. Instead he claimed that he had asked them to fight abroad. The charges against Abu Hamza include nine counts of soliciting to murder and three of trying to stir up racial hatred. He denies all 15 charges against him.

When questioned by his defense council he was asked if he had incited followers to kill in England. To this Abu Hamza replied "No". Abu Hamza also told the court of his feelings about racism "If you are a scholar you will never distinguish between anyone of any color. Racism is one of the greatest sins. I actually condemned it,"

The cleric also denies that he was in possession of a document which could be considered to help in the preparation of terrorist attacks.

The defense barrister warned the jury to ignore the comments of the press as they may have convicted the defendant before the trial has begun. Comments such as "Captain Hook" and "Hook off Hooky" have been used. Mr. Fitzgerald told them of "exaggeration and misrepresentation by the media".

The cleric faces nine charges under the Offences against the Person Act 1861, plus four charges under the Public Order Act 1986 of "using threatening, abusive or insulting words or 
behavior with the intention of stirring up racial hatred". The possession of video and audio recordings with the intent to be used to stir-up racial hatred, and a final charge of the possession of the Encyclopedia of the Afghani Jihad, which, is said to have information "of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism".

A district court in &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; has issued a preliminary injunction against the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; for displaying the true name of a computer &lt;a href="w%3Ahacker"&gt;hacker&lt;/a&gt; on the German &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. The family of the deceased German hacker, known as "&lt;a href="w%3ATron%20%28hacker%29"&gt;Tron&lt;/a&gt;," obtained the provisional order in Berlin on December 14. The order was corrected on December 19 because it was at first addressed to &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Petersburg"&gt;Saint Petersburg, Russia&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida"&gt;Saint Petersburg, Florida&lt;/a&gt;.

Tron became famous as the first person to &lt;a href="w%3Aencryption%20cracking"&gt;crack&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="w%3Aencryption"&gt;encryption&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3APay%20TV"&gt;Pay TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATelephone%20card"&gt;calling cards&lt;/a&gt;. He died in 1998, at the age of 26, in an apparent &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;. Questions have arisen as to the nature of the hacker's death.

The court has ordered the German Wikipedia to remove all forms of the hacker's complete civil name "Boris Floricic". The court states that this is justified by the fact that the hacker never worked under his civil name, but instead his Internet alias.

The legality of the order is in question, because the Wikimedia Foundation servers are not located in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, but instead in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. Whether the Foundation will comply or if the family's attorneys have any means to enforce the decision remains in doubt. The case prompted many German media outlets to publicly display the hacker's real name.
On January 17 the same court also issued a preliminary injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland e.V., the German chapter of the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, citing the same reasons. In that injuction, the chapter was ordered to cease redirecting &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wikipedia.de"&gt;www.wikipedia.de&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http%3A//de.wikipedia.org"&gt;de.wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt;. Wikimedia Deutschland complied, but its lawyers announced that they will appeal the decision, saying that Tron's civil name has long since been public knowledge.

A group of 43 &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Papua"&gt;West Papuan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aasylum%20seekers"&gt;asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt; found on &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20York"&gt;Cape York&lt;/a&gt; were herded on to an &lt;a href="w%3ARAAF"&gt;RAAF&lt;/a&gt; Hercules and flown to &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas%20Island"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt; Detention Centre on Thursday. The Immigration Department says the single men in the group will be detained in the remote facility, and the six women and seven children will be accommodated in staff housing.

The group left the Papuan port town of Merauke on Friday in an outrigger canoe and landed on Tuesday at Janey Creek, north of the Mapoon Aboriginal community on western Cape York, without being detected.

Police, immigration and customs officials prevented the group communicating with media in Weipa, where the group were detained in Queensland's far north. The group was kept under close guard throughout the day, with the media required to remain at least 25m away.

Officials accompanied the asylum seekers on toilet breaks and trips to the &lt;a href="w%3AWeipa"&gt;Weipa&lt;/a&gt; hospital, covering the heads of the new arrivals with blankets or jackets. 

Immigrationl officials will interview the group, assessing their claims for asylum, while at the remote island detention facility on Christmas Island, 2,600km north-west of &lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;.

The Department says the Papuans are being transferred as part of the long-standing government policy to process unauthorised arrivals offshore, not because mainland detention centres lack capacity. Immigration Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt; said the group would be treated the same as any other boat arrivals. 

John Wing from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Sydney"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;'s Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies says &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; military activity has been increasing in Papua which may encourage more people to seek asylum in Australia.

"This may be a trend that we see developing over the coming year or two as the military operations are stepped up in Papua against the local people. As in other parts of the world, the fighting and the human rights situation becomes too grim in one's homeland, he said, "these people are forced to flee to the place of nearest sanctuary and in this part of the world, for the Papuans, it's Australia."

Mr Wing says he believes a prominent student activist is part of the group of asylum seekers. He says the man has already spent time in jail for attending independence meetings and could be persecuted if he is sent back to Papua.

"Many villages have been burned to the ground; houses, clinics, schools, churches have all been destroyed by arson, by the Indonesian armed forces, and some of these refugees are from that area," he said.

The Indonesian embassy says there is no persecution in Papua. 

The 36 adults and seven children are the third boatload of asylum-seekers to land on the Australian mainland in the past four years.

A dog fell off an Interstate 96 overpass in &lt;a href="w%3ALivonia%2C%20Michigan"&gt;Livonia, Michigan&lt;/a&gt; killing 81 year-old Charles G. Jetchick.

Jetchick and a passenger, who police would not identify, were transported to St. Mary's Hospital where Jetchick died from his injuries. The passenger suffered only minor injuries.

Police say that the 60 to 70 pound (27-32 kilograms) dog was not thrown off the overpass, but "probably fell by accident while trying to avoid a car," Sgt. Michael A. Shaw of the Michigan State Police said. "We don't know and thats why we are looking for witnesses."

The dog, which fell about 16 feet (5 metres) also died due to its injuries.

Shaw has been with the State Police for 11 years and has never encountered a similar incident. "We've had rocks and other stuff like that fall off of overpasses. This would be the first dog we've had," said Shaw.

Earlier today, an &lt;a href="w%3AAtlas%20V"&gt;Atlas V&lt;/a&gt; rocket carrying the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Horizons"&gt;New Horizons&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ unmanned spacecraft probe lifted off from Pad 41 at the &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station"&gt;Cape Canaveral Air Force Station&lt;/a&gt; bound for the last unexplored planet in the solar system, &lt;a href="w%3APluto"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt;, at 11 am EST, after two scrubbed liftoffs the past two days because of bad weather.

The probe will take a nine-year, 3-billion-mile (5-billion-km) journey to Pluto, the ninth and final planet in the solar system. It is expected to take photos of the planet that are of the highest resolution ever, since current photos of Pluto are not of the highest quality, even those taken from &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;. It will also attempt to characterize the global geology and morphology of the planet and study the atmosphere of the planet.

After accelerating to 36,000 mph, it will pass the moon in nine hours. The probe will pass by Mars in April and then head on to Jupiter where it will pass by in February 2007 and continue on. Around July 14, 2015, the probe is expected to fly by Pluto and its moon &lt;a href="w%3ACharon"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt;, after which the probe could possibly make a flyby of one or more &lt;a href="w%3AKuiper%20Belt%20objects"&gt;Kuiper Belt objects&lt;/a&gt;. (KBOs).

New Horizons is powered by an onboard nuclear electric generator, known as a &lt;a href="w%3Aradioisotope%20thermoelectric%20generator"&gt;radioisotope thermoelectric generator&lt;/a&gt;, using 24 pounds (10.8kg) of &lt;a href="w%3Aplutonium"&gt;plutonium&lt;/a&gt; as its radioactive "fuel" source. Some anti-nuclear activists feared that the launch could end in an accident with radioactive material being spread over a wide area. The chances of such a disaster were calculated by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy"&gt;United States Department of Energy&lt;/a&gt; at 1 in 350.

The Tuesday liftoff was postponed because of high winds at the launch site. The Wednesday launch was stopped after a severe storm near &lt;a href="w%3ALaurel%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Laurel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; knocked out power at the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory, which hosts the flight control center for the mission.

As a side note, the probe is also carrying some of the ashes from &lt;a href="w%3AClyde%20Tombaugh"&gt;Clyde Tombaugh&lt;/a&gt;, the discoverer of Pluto.

A New Zealand newspaper reported on Wednesday the 18th of January that the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMinistry%20of%20Health"&gt;Ministry of Health&lt;/a&gt; intends to send out brochures, to about 1.4 million households in a national mail drop; on how to prepare for a &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; pandemic. It is believed that the campaign would begin in March.

The brochures will contain information on how to set up emergency kits, and hygiene guides.

The brochures will complement print, radio and television advertising, which will be running at the same time. Advertising started this week on &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Radio"&gt;National Radio&lt;/a&gt;; New Zealand's public service radio broadcaster.

Dr Ashley Bloomfield, acting director of public health, would not confirm a mail drop at this stage, but other activities for raising awareness such as more paid advertising, updates to the website and 0800 number, and "possibly" a nationwide mail drop. 

The Avian Flu &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; has killed at least 79 people since 2003.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; opposition leader and leader of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Latham"&gt;Mark Latham&lt;/a&gt; has been accused of assaulting and stealing a camera belonging to a photographer for The Daily Telegraph in Sydney.

The newspaper claims that Latham assaulted photographer Ross Schultz, injuring his wrist outside a fast-food restaurant in Campbelltown, a suburb in Sydney's South-West. It is alleged that Latham stole Shultz's camera and smashed it with a hammer when he returned home.

The Daily Telegraph claims that Latham later handed the smashed camera to Campbelltown police.

It is believed that Latham was angry that the photographer took photographs of his children playing on play equipment at the restaurant. Latham accuses the newspaper of stalking and harassment.

Mr Shultz said "He took the camera and began walking to his car," "I politely asked him to return it. He placed it on the bonnet and then turned around and threw a left hook at me."

"I evaded it easily but he wanted to go toe-to-toe with me. I just kept telling him to calm down, 'You've got kids in the car', but he was off his head. He was so worked up, I wasn't thinking of the camera." 

The Daily Telegraph claims they were working on a story to coincide with the first anniversary of Latham's resignation as opposition leader and as an MP.

Mr Latham is reported to have a history of violence, breaking the arm of a taxi driver in 2001 and in 1989 allegedly assaulting a Labor party stalwart.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADelhi%20High%20Court"&gt;Delhi High Court&lt;/a&gt; expressed its displeasure to the civic authorities on their continued failure to resolve the problem of marauding monkeys in the court premises. The court was in session when the &lt;a href="w%3Apublic%20interest%20litigation"&gt;public interest litigation&lt;/a&gt; filed by a &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; lawyer was brought to its attention.

The petitioner Mr.Nirmal Chopra argued the case and explained how the &lt;a href="w%3Asimian"&gt;simian&lt;/a&gt;s showed up during work hours and attacked people and snatched food from them. The &lt;a href="w%3ARhesus%20monkeys"&gt;rhesus monkeys&lt;/a&gt; have also been blamed for damaging furniture belonging to the lawyers and courtroom fixtures such as electrical fittings. According to Mr.Chopra &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s Wildlife Act of 1972 empowers civic authorities to kill or hunt animals when they endanger human life. He said that the lawyers from the Tis Hazari court had requested the state government and the municipality to tackle the situation but no action had resulted. 

The lawyer for the civic authority was quoted by the &lt;a href="w%3APress%20Trust%20of%20India"&gt;Press Trust of India&lt;/a&gt; as saying that catching monkeys was no longer its responsibility. The court was informed that a monkey catcher hired by the &lt;a href="w%3Amunicipality"&gt;municipality&lt;/a&gt; had required 72 stitches after being mauled during an operation. After this incident the work had to be halted because other monkey catchers refused to take up the job. 

The court gave the civic authority four more weeks to catch the monkeys that are disrupting work at the Tis Hazari courts. "If you cannot perform your statutory duty, then close down your institution" the court is reported to have told the counsel.

&lt;a href="w%3ADelhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt; is known to suffer from trouble brought on by monkeys. The animals are reported to invade homes, schools and government offices in the city. Scores of animals have moved in as the city expands into surrounding forests. In an effort to control the problem, the Delhi administration captured about 500 monkeys and took them to the outskirts of the city last year.

42 of 43 Slovak soldiers were killed as an &lt;a href="w%3AAn-24"&gt;An-24&lt;/a&gt; type aircraft of the Slovak Army crashed shortly after 8.30 pm &lt;a href="w%3ACoordinated%20Universal%20Time"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;+1 at a hill in the North East of &lt;a href="w%3AHungary"&gt;Hungary&lt;/a&gt;.

The plane was flying from &lt;a href="w%3APristina"&gt;Pristina&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AKo%C5%A1ice"&gt;Košice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASlovakia"&gt;Slovakia&lt;/a&gt; as it collided 10 km away from the border to the 800 meter high hill.

Two aircraft entered the Hungarin airspace, the captain of the second alarmed the authorities. One survivor has been found, there is no news of other surviving.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;ns and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;ers throughout the world stood still and turned out in huge numbers for their national war memorial days in remembrance of the failed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Corps"&gt;Australian and New Zealand Army Corps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ANZAC) &amp;mdash; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Gallipoli"&gt;attack on Gallipoli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; that began on 25 April 1915. The fateful attack was designed to end the &lt;a href="World%20War%20I"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; quicker by creating a supply line to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AImperial%20Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A hundred thousand died in the battle, remembered every year as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AANZAC%20Day"&gt;ANZAC Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by both nations. The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;-directed battle of Gallipoli is often seen as a defining moment in the 'birth' of Australia and New Zealand. The battlefields of Gallipoli, where so much blood was shed, has become near-sacred soil.

This is the 91st anniversary of the attack. This is the first ANZAC day where there have been no survivors left from World War I.

Around 10,000 people are turned out at the dawn service at Gallipoli.

Meanwhile dawn services have been held throughout New Zealand. The numbers of veterans may be dwindling, but the numbers of those who come to pay their respects is not. In Auckland nearly 20,000 people attended the dawn service at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAuckland%20War%20Memorial%20Museum"&gt;Auckland War Memorial Museum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . During the service, a 62-year-old veteran of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMalayan%20campaign"&gt;Malayan campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; died of a heart attack, falling face forward on to the concrete as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALast%20Post"&gt;Last Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was sounded.

In &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWellington%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , about 5000 people gathered at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACenotaph"&gt;Cenotaph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; near the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Parliament%20Buildings"&gt;Parliament buildings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Speaking at the service Royal New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association president John Campbell said, "We are honouring the Anzacs. We are not here to glorify war, but to remember that we value who we are and the freedoms we possess...They did not die in vain. They fought for peace, freedom and democracy."
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGovernor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;The Governor-General of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASilvia%20Cartwright"&gt;Dame Silvia Cartwright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , addressed the crowd, at the Wellington service saying "Soldiers, veterans, all New Zealanders who are gathered here, around New Zealand and around the world to commemorate ANZAC Day. Today is the day we grieve for our fellow New Zealanders killed in war. It is the day we honour them, and remember their sacrifice". This is her last ANZAC Day as Governor-General.

2006 is the New Zealand Year of the Veteran, and the 90th anniversary of the organisation founded by those who did return from Gallipoli – the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20New%20Zealand%20Returned%20and%20Services%E2%80%99%20Association"&gt;Royal New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Australia and New Zealand commemorate the ANZAC Day public holiday on the 25th of April every year to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the members of the ANZAC's and of all those who served their country —

Lest we Forget.

On Thursday, &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; said that it supports Iran's nuclear stance and said it "has a right to atomic technology," and said Western objections to Tehran's nuclear ambitions were "not persuasive."

It comes in the wake of demands by US and European countries for Iran to halt its nuclear fuel enrichment activities. Iran notes that its &lt;a href="w%3AIran%27s%20nuclear%20program"&gt;nuclear program&lt;/a&gt; is civilian and consistent with Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which establishes ♡❤the inalienable right of all the Parties to the &lt;a href="w%3Atreaty"&gt;Treaty&lt;/a&gt; to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes♡❤, and that it in line with Article IV, it will not abandon its enrichment efforts. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt; is part of &lt;a href="w%3Ainternational%20law"&gt;international law&lt;/a&gt; and under Article VI, requires the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and other nuclear weapons states to ♡❤pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date &lt;nowiki&gt;[the treaty was signed in 1968]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and to &lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20disarmament"&gt;nuclear disarmament&lt;/a&gt;, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.♡❤

President &lt;a href="w%3ABashar%20Assad"&gt;Bashar Assad&lt;/a&gt; of Syria, a longtime Iranian ally said he "backed Tehran's moves toward nuclear power," and wanted to strengthen the two nation's ties. "We support Iran regarding its right to peaceful nuclear technology," Assad said at a news conference with Iranian President &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;. "It is the right of Iran and any other state to own nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Countries that object to that have not provided a convincing or logical reason."

Ahmadinejad also said the two countries needed to "coordinate their positions."
Also on Thursday, Russia's Foreign Minister called for "a cautious approach to the mounting crisis over Iran's renewal of nuclear research."

The two nations have been allies for twenty-six years.

The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has been investigating allegations surrounding &lt;a href="w%3ALivedoor"&gt;Livedoor&lt;/a&gt;'s acquisition strategies and stock sales. Japanese newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AYomiuri%20Shimbun"&gt;Yomiuri Shimbun&lt;/a&gt; reports that the company may have made 4 billion yen ($35 million) in profits by following illegal takeover practices. Livedoor has been known to use acquisitions to support its rapid growth. It currently owns about 50 technology companies providing financial services and other software over the internet.

Recent investigations have centered around the acquisitions of two companies ♡❤Royal Shinpan♡❤, a consumer finance company and ♡❤Cueznet Co.♡❤ an online &lt;a href="w%3Amatchmaking"&gt;matchmaking&lt;/a&gt; firm. Livedoor announced its intent to acquire the two companies in August and September of 2004. 

According to allegations, an investment fund was used to purchase shares in the targeted companies before the announcements were made public. It is believed that after the &lt;a href="w%3Astock%20swap"&gt;stock swap&lt;/a&gt;s in October 2004, Livedoor received the shares of the two companies through this fund. The investment fund also received new Livedoor shares in exchange which were then allegedly sold off to a foreign investment fund. Livedoor is reported to have issued 12.6 million new shares for the two stock swaps.

Since Livedoor owned most of the fund, the profits from these sales were siphoned back into Livedoor. The investment fund ♡❤JMAM Salvage Ichi-go Toshi Jigyo Kumiai♡❤ was deemed a voluntary organization and hence avoided registration and disclosure regarding its investors and its investments. Concealing ownership of targeted takeover companies violates securities and exchange laws. 
A prosector commented "Stock swaps are not illegal, but it is problematic if a company makes deals aiming to make profits by selling its shares this way." 

<h3>Stock drop continues, may face delisting</h3>
Livedoor shares continued their fall for the fourth straight day on Friday. The stock has now lost about 52 percent or $3.3 billion in market capitalization since news of the investigation broke through on Monday evening.

The &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;Tokyo Stock Exchange&lt;/a&gt;(TSE) is considering delisting stocks of Livedoor Co. and its affiliate Livedoor Marketing Co. Livedoor is scheduled to submit the findings of its internal investigation to the TSE by Friday. 
"If we can confirm they violated listing regulations, we'll have no choice but to decide to delist their stocks," TSE Chairman and President Taizo Nishimuro told reporters at a news conference.

A company's delisting would seriously impact its ability to raise funds.

Western Australian Energy Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Carpenter"&gt;Alan Carpenter&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed he will become &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia's&lt;/a&gt; next state Premier. 

The top job became vacant following Premier &lt;a href="w%3AGeoffrey%20Gallop"&gt;Geoff Gallop's&lt;/a&gt; shock resignation on Monday 16th January. Contender Police Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Roberts"&gt;Michelle Roberts&lt;/a&gt; has withdrawn from the leadership race, saying Mr Carpenter has her support. 

Speaking in &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; today, Labor powerbroker &lt;a href="w%3AJim%20McGinty"&gt;Jim McGinty&lt;/a&gt; said Mr Carpenter was now "effectively" the WA premier, putting an end to a week of speculation about jockeying for the role.

"We were all shocked and saddened by Dr Gallop's announcement on Monday but to have a new premier by the end of the week is as smooth (a transition) as you could hope for," Mr McGinty said today.

Mr Carpenter will now be elected unopposed when caucus meets on Tuesday. WA Attorney-General and former Labor leader Mr McGinty says Mr Carpenter will make a great premier but it is important he does not change too much.

"In my experience when people start to try to change their appearance or their personality is when they fail," he said. "I'm sure Alan Carpenter will remain Alan Carpenter."

Alan Carpenter was born in Albany, Western Australia, on January 4 1957. After graduating from the University of Western Australia with an Arts degree (politics) in 1979, he began a career as a journalist with the Albany Advertiser newspaper. He has worked for TVW Channel 7, Perth and also ABC TV as a State political reporter.

In 1992, he became the 7.30 Report's Presenter in WA and later presented the ABC's Stateline program. In April 1996, he resigned from the ABC and gained ALP endorsement for new state seat of Willagee. He won the seat in December 1996.

Mr Carpenter has held the Shadow portfolios of Disability Services, Sport &amp; Recreation, Family &amp; Children's Services, Education and Drugs. He became Minister for Education, Sport &amp; Recreation and Indigenous Affairs in February 2001. He became the Minister for Education and Training in June 2003. Following the Gallop Government’s re-election in February 2005, he became the Minister for State Development and Energy.

Mr Carpenter said he had been well schooled for the leadership position by Dr Gallop, who shocked parliament on Monday with the announcement he was quitting to battle depression.

"I was a huge supporter of Geoff, he was an outstanding premier and to match that would be no easy feat," Mr Carpenter said.

Today, &lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20F.C"&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed that they will be adding Theo Walcott to their side, after a 12.5 million pound deal was struck, on the premise that he pass rigorous medical examinations. Although the 16-year-old striker cannot sign until he turns 17 on 16 March, seems to see this only as a formality, as the player is set to be unveiled today at Highbury.

Although there are not many other details at this moment, it is thought that he will not be able to return to Southampton on loan, due to the hectic schedule that he will have at Arsenal. Whatever way the deal may turn out, it seems that Theo's family are with him whatever he does.

The search engine &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; has been asked by the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; department of Justice to hand over its records of user activity. Google was asked for information regarding the type of search and the index of pages it had over a week. 
This evidence is being requested by lawyers who are trying to defend the constitutionality of the &lt;a href="w%3AChild%20Online%20Protection%20Act"&gt;Child Online Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;, which was struck down in 1998 by the Supreme Court. 

Google has not complied with the request prompting &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Attorney%20General"&gt;US Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto Gonzales&lt;/a&gt; to request a court order from a federal judge in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. Google has nevertheless stated that it would fight the order. Nicole Wong, the associate general counsel for Google, said "Google is not a party to this lawsuit and their demand for information overreaches," and that "We had lengthy discussions with them to try to resolve this, but were not able to and we intend to resist their motion vigorously."

Unlike its competitors, Google is taking a firm stand on this issue with no room to compromise. &lt;a href="Yahoo"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; has already said that it releases data "on a limited basis and did not provide any personally identifiable information." and &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; said that it "works closely with law enforcement officials worldwide to assist them when requested".

In fact the money will be used by these groups to carry on their terrorist activities. FARC activities include kidnappings, masacres, bombs, extortions and the drug trade.

♡❤Fighters and Lovers♡❤ is selling the T-shirts at 170 &lt;a href="w%3ADKK"&gt;DKK&lt;/a&gt; (US$27.6), from which 35 DKK (US$5.7) are to be destinated to support both armed groups.

Anna Duever, ♡❤Fighters and Lovers♡❤ PR chief, said to Spanish news agency &lt;a href="w%3AEFE"&gt;EFE&lt;/a&gt; that their objective is to ♡❤"defend freedom and social justice, which is FARC and PFLP are fighting for"♡❤. Duever believes the fact the FARC has been included by the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; in its terrorist group list is a ♡❤"political game"♡❤. ♡❤"We pay our taxes in Denmark, and that money is used for financing the troops our government has sent to Iraq. That's terrorism. Besides, in Colombia there's a regime oppressing population and torturing and killing its people"♡❤, she said.

Colombian Foreign Affairs Minister, Carolina Barco, said to local media that ♡❤"financing terrorist groups is unacceptable and goes against all the international norms. Yesterday [Tuesday 19] our ambassador contacted the Danish government, we sent a protest note and have demanded an explanation."♡❤ 

A year ago, a Danish &lt;a href="w%3ANGO"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt; named ♡❤Oprør♡❤ ("Rebelion") stated it had donated money to the Colombian guerrilla. A new antiterrorism law in Denmark may punish it.

In &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;, the Oslo and Akershus County Medical Officer has announced that it is launching an inquiry into a possible scientific hoax, involving cancer researchers from Norway, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In October 2005, the Norwegian researcher &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Sudb%C3%B8"&gt;Jon Sudbø&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; along with 13 co-authors published the study in the prestigious medical journal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lancet"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The study claimed to detect a positive effect of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aibuprofen"&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in preventing oral cancer in smokers, based on a controlled case-study, entailing several hundred patients. On the basis of this study, a broader prospective multicenter study was to be started in 2006, partly funded by the U.S. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Cancer%20Institute"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

On January 17th 2006 however, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Athe%20Radium%20Hospital"&gt;the Radium Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Norway announced that there were strong suggestions that the whole study was a hoax. The patient material presented appeared to be invented, and thus the whole study seems to be fraudulent.

The Radium Hospital in Oslo has hired an autonomous investigative committee to look into the matter, led by the Swedish &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aepidemiology"&gt;epidemiologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Anders Ekbom from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKarolinska%20Institute"&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Stockholm. The editor of the Lancet, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Horton"&gt;Richard Horton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said that this was the worst research fraud he has dealt with in his time at The Lancet.

A 15ft (4.5 meter) &lt;a href="w%3Anorthern%20bottle-nosed%20whale"&gt;northern bottle-nosed whale&lt;/a&gt; has been spotted swimming in the river Thames in Central London, UK. The "&lt;a href="w%3AThames%20whale"&gt;Thames whale&lt;/a&gt;" managed to swim up past the Thames barrier and under many bridges, reaching as far as Chelsea before it turned around just before Albert Bridge.

TV news helicopters scrambled to provide live TV footage of the whale, and many spectators lined the banks of the river. 

The whale is said to be looking healthy, although some fear that the whale may beach itself as it tried to do before rescuers forced it back into the middle of the river. Normally found in the North Atlantic, there have been sightings of a second whale near Southend.

A vet, having examined the whale, reported that the animal was not swimming purposefully, has some damage around the head area and is losing blood from numerous cuts on its underside. It was last seen floating downstream with the current; its present whereabouts are unknown.

<h1>Message in bottle travels from UK to Australia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Message%20in%20bottle%20travels%20from%20UK%20to%20Australia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A message in a bottle thrown into the sea by a four-year-old girl in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; has been found 9,000 miles away in &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

Alesha Johnson threw the bottle into the water at &lt;a href="w%3AMorecambe%20Bay"&gt;Morecambe Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALancashire"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; last July, enclosing her Heysham address, and a picture of herself. 

The note read: "If you get this message, please write back." 

This week, she received a letter from a 10-year-old from &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, who said he had found the bottle in a local &lt;a href="w%3ABoatyard"&gt;Boatyard&lt;/a&gt;.

Doreen Johnson, the manager of the nursery Alesha attends in &lt;a href="w%3AHeysham"&gt;Heysham&lt;/a&gt;, said: "We were all very excited when the letter from &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; arrived addressed to Alesha. 

"We never dreamed the bottle would go that far, it's amazing." 

The Australian boy, who said only that his name was Bob, wrote in his letter that he had asked his father to look up &lt;a href="w%3AHeysham"&gt;Heysham&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="w%3AInternet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;. 

The child did not enclose an address as he said he was moving house, but would write back when he had his new address: "We are in the middle of moving house and it’s Christmas here but when we are settled I’ll write to you again".

Nobody will know exactly how it got there but the most likely route would have been into the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, sweeping down the west coast of &lt;a href="w%3AAfrica"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Hemisphere"&gt;Southern Hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;. After rounding the &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20of%20Good%20Hope"&gt;Cape of Good Hope&lt;/a&gt; the bottle must have then crossed the &lt;a href="w%3AIndian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Oceanographers suspect the bottle could not have travelled the whole way on its own in only six months, and it must have been caught up by a ship and transported part of the way.

"It was summertime when we threw it in the sea. All the children in class were given bottles to take home in July but Alesha’s is the only one that got a reply", she said. 

"I don’t know what the other parents did with theirs. We went straight down to Morecambe Bay. Alesha was only 3 at the time. She could barely throw the cola bottle beyond her feet. I just assumed it would be washed straight back and forgot all about it."

"Then recently when I went to pick her up from nursery I was told that she had had a reply from this little boy and it had made it all the way to Australia. I couldn’t believe it. I was walking on air for about four days and was really proud. It’s made me very happy." Ms. Matthews said that Bob had made a copy of Alesha’s original note and returned it to the Time For Nursery in Heysham. He also wrote to Alesha and the family is now looking forward to learning more about him.

"I have never heard of a message in a bottle travelling so far so quickly."

Last December a message in a bottle sent from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; was washed up at &lt;a href="w%3ANewquay"&gt;Newquay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACornwall"&gt;Cornwall&lt;/a&gt;. It had been sent 18 months earlier.

&lt;a href="w%3AReporters%20Without%20Borders"&gt;Reporters Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; held a demonstration today at the &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Mosque"&gt;Grand Mosque&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; in support of &lt;a href="w%3AJill%20Carroll"&gt;Jill Carroll&lt;/a&gt; calling for her release. Present were Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur with five French ex-hostages: Florence Aubenas, Roger Auque, Jean-Jacques Le Garrec, Roland Madura and Ivan Cerieix. 

Carroll was kidnapped in January when insurgents ambushed her car and killed her translator. She is 28 years old. The abductors gave a 72 hour dead line; that is due to expire this evening, and are expected to kill her if their demands are not met.

Gold hit a 25 year peak and last traded at $553.50 an ounce.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADow%20Jones%20Industrial%20Average"&gt;Dow Jones Industrial Average&lt;/a&gt; (DJIA) slumped 213+ points today amid fears of Iran and terrorism. The index has now given up all its gains since the beginning of the year. Among its 30 components, only &lt;a href="w%3AMcDonalds"&gt;McDonalds&lt;/a&gt; ended the day in positive territory. Disappointing earnings dragged down shares of &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Electric"&gt;General Electric&lt;/a&gt; Co. and &lt;a href="w%3ACitigroup"&gt;Citigroup&lt;/a&gt; Inc. 

<h4>Fourth quarter earnings</h4>
Since the start of the Q4 earnings season, many analysts have been reducing their &lt;a href="w%3Aearnings"&gt;earnings&lt;/a&gt; expectations. &lt;a href="w%3AS%26amp%3BP%20500"&gt;S&amp;P 500&lt;/a&gt; companies are now expected to report a profit growth of 12.7 percent, compared with earlier expectations of 15.5 percent. This analysis was done by &lt;a href="w%3ABloomberg"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; using data from Thomson. Earnings growth is expected to slow down to 9.9 percent in the first quarter of this year.

Shares of GE gave up $1.35 to end at $33.33 after the firm reported its smallest earnings gain since 2004. GE is the world's second largest firm by market value. Q4 earnings rose to 55 cents a share from 54 cents while revenue rose 2.6 percent to $40.7 billion, below analysts' estimates.

The DJIA was dragged down by Citigroup, largest bank in US. Its stock fell $1.98 to $45.96. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $4.97 billion, or 98 cents a share. The earnings were below consensus estimates of $1.

<h1>Iran moves finances out of Europe's banks</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iran%20moves%20finances%20out%20of%20Europe%27s%20banks&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, has decided to pull its finances out of &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an banks and into different foreign banks. A senior Iranian official stated that this is an attempt to pre-empt possible &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; sanctions over its resumption of nuclear fuel enrichment activities. 

Comments by Iran's central bank governor Ebrahim Sheibani, carried on air by the ISNA student news agency, confirmed that Iran had started transferring funds.

"We transfer foreign reserves to wherever we see as expedient. On this issue, we have started transferring. We are doing that," Sheibani told the ISNA agency.

Ebrahim Sheibani also told the agency that the assets were being moved to an "undisclosed" location.

It is unknown exactly how much money is involved or whether or not Iran's investments in Europe would be affected by the move. Traders have said that they had already factored such a possibility into the market.

Gary Samore, an expert on Iran and vice president for international programs at the McArthur Foundation in &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, said "the move reflected concern by Tehran that the Europeans might take unilateral measures amid the crisis over its nuclear program." He also added that its decision to pull its assets from Europe "makes sense in terms of preparing for the possibility that Europe might take some measure to impose some financial sanctions. I don't know that it changes the diplomatic formula. The key issue is still the question of whether or not the Western group can engineer a formal referral to the &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;."

It is unclear if an asset freeze or other punishment is imminent in Iran, but it has happened before. The country's assets in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; have been frozen since Iranians seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its staff hostage after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

An &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; court last year had ordered an Iranian bank account to be frozen at the request of U.S. plaintiffs who were seeking compensation for terrorist acts they believe were supported by the country (Iran).

Earlier the EU drafted a resolution that calls for referring Iran to the 15-nation council. But it is said to stop short of asking for punitive measures against Iran. The &lt;a href="IAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt; is expected to meet on February 2, 2006 to discuss Europe's draft.

In a close vote, union members rejected the proposed contract negotiated by the &lt;a href="w%3ATransport%20Workers%20Union"&gt;Transport Workers Union Local 100&lt;/a&gt; (TWU) and &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Metropolitan Transportation Agency&lt;/a&gt; (MTA) after a crippling &lt;a href="NYC%20Transit%20on%20strike"&gt;transit strike&lt;/a&gt; ground New York City to a halt in December.

Calling the rejection "disappointing news to all New Yorkers", Mayor Michael Bloomberg called on the TWU and the MTA to return to the bargaining table as soon as possible. The TWU has expressed that it is ready to negotiate, but the MTA has not made any comment at this time.

After a week-long rallying effort, including radio advertisements by TUW Local 100 President &lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Toussaint"&gt;Roger Toussaint&lt;/a&gt; encouraging union members to vote for the proposed contract, the voting period ended at 12:00 EST (17:00 UTC) and ballots had been counted by 17:00 EST (22:00 UTC). The final tally was 11,227 to 11,234 against - A difference of seven votes.

After several weeks of at times contentious deliberation in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Judiciary%20Committee"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senate&lt;/a&gt; confirmed Judge &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASamuel%20A.%20Alito"&gt;Samuel A. Alito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Jr. to the &lt;a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; with 58 votes in favor and 42 against. Only one &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%20Chafee"&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="Rhode%20Island"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt;, voted against confirmation. Four &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , including former &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20Majority%20Leader"&gt;Senate Majority Leader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Byrd"&gt;Robert Byrd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="West%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, voted for confirmation. Alito was sworn-in later in the day.

Alito had been nominated by President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; following the withdrawal of his original Supreme Court nominee &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHarriet%20Miers"&gt;Harriet Miers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a criminal lawyer and close associate of Bush since before his tenure as Governor of Texas from 1994-2000. Miers, facing harsh criticism of her qualifications for a position on the high court, along with growing opposition from members of the conservative movement, elected to withdraw in October 2005. 

Alito was nominated shortly after Miers' withdrawal, and faced the Judiciary Committee in January 2006. 

With the Bush Administration facing poor approval ratings following the withdrawal of Miers, Senate Democrats put forth a strong offensive to the confirmation of Alito. They questioned Alito extensively of his record on abortion, exercise of executive authority, his opinions on various legal issues while studying at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrinceton%20University"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and his membership in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConcerned%20Alumni%20of%20Princeton"&gt;CAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; group there.

Following the Judiciary Committee's party-line vote approving Alito, efforts were spearheaded by ranking Judiciary Committee member Sen. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEdward%20M.%20Kennedy"&gt;Edward M. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;MA&lt;/a&gt;) and Sen. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kerry"&gt;John F. Kerry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;MA&lt;/a&gt;) to filibuster Alito's confirmation. However, the motion to end debate on Alito ended with a 72-25 cloture vote; Senate Minority Leader &lt;a href="Harry%20Reid"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="Nevada"&gt;NV&lt;/a&gt;) acknowledged that a filibuster was not a realistic option to stop Alito's confirmation.

Alito is the second judge to be appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court by President Bush. His first appointee, Judge &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Roberts"&gt;John Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was confirmed by the Senate in the autumn of 2005. Following the death of Chief Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Rehnquist"&gt;William Rehnquist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Roberts was immediately selected to fill Rehnquist's post. 

Alito will be replacing Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was a crucial swing vote in an ideologically divided Court. With the appointment of Alito, the Court will most likely experience a shift to the political right. How much of a shift cannot be precisely determined, as it remains to be seen how Alito will rule in cases involving critical social issues.

Alito earned a bachelor's degree in law from Princeton University, and did his graduate work at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AYale%20Law%20School"&gt;Yale Law School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Most of his bench experience has come at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThird%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals"&gt;Third Circuit Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where he has served as a justice since 1990, when President George H.W. Bush nominated him for the post. He follows current Supreme Court justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAntonin%20Scalia"&gt;Antonin Scalia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as the second Italian-American member of the high court.

<h3>Reactions</h3>

Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Schumer"&gt;Charles Schumer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="New%20York"&gt;NY&lt;/a&gt;) told the AP that the United States would "be better and stronger and more unified if we were confirming a different nominee, a nominee who could have united us more than divided us".

Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Reed"&gt;Jack Reed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="Rhode%20Island"&gt;RI&lt;/a&gt;) said he is concerned with Alito's "philosophy of the Constitution [and] his great effort of many years to expand presidential power at a time when there are real serious questions about the powers the president has".

Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArlen%20Specter"&gt;Arlen Specter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Party%20%28US%29"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;a href="Pennsylvania"&gt;PA&lt;/a&gt;), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said there are no doubts about Alito's "qualification in terms of education, professional career and his service on the court of appeals."

And in a written statement, President Bush called Alito a "brilliant and fair-minded judge who strictly interprets the Constitution and laws and does not legislate from the bench. He is a man of deep character and integrity, and he will make all Americans proud as a Justice on our highest court."

<h1>Ayman al-Zawahiri releases new tape</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ayman%20al-Zawahiri%20releases%20new%20tape&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that a tape that surfaced today is that of &lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;.

A spokesman for the CIA said, "Following technical analysis of the tape, the CIA has assessed that it is the voice of Ayman al-Zawahiri." 

The tape was posted on an internet forum that has carried Al Qaeda communiqués before.

On the tape, Zawahiri read a poem called the "martyrs of jihad". He said that he dedicates it to "Muslim brothers everywhere, to the mujahedeen brothers in Islam's fortified borderlines against the Zionist-Crusader campaign in Palestine and Iraq, Afghanistan and Chechnya and to the lions chasing the crusaders' gangs and hired hands in Afghanistan's mountains and valleys and its wounded capital, Kabul."

He then went on to say, "I am honored to present this mujahedeen poem, written by Maulai Muhibbulla al-Qandahari, who carried the pen and the sword and was known in the circles of scholars and the training camps and the battlefields of jihad."

It is still unclear as to when the tape was made exactly and it is still unclear if it has anything to do with the release of Bin Laden's tape yesterday. 

On the tape, Zawahiri makes no mention of the U.S. missile attacks that killed 18 people, including women and children, and is suspected of killing 4 terrorists last week.

A U.S. counterterrorism expert said there was "no reason to believe it was done recently. It could be something that someone pulled off the shelf and decided to post."

U.S. officials reasoned that the tapes release "might have been timed to assure his followers that Bin Laden was alive and well" just days after the U.S. air strikes.

<h3>U.S. rejects Bin Laden's Truce</h3>

On Thursday, &lt;a href="w%3AVice%20President%2C%20Dick%20Cheney"&gt;Vice President, Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; dismissed Bin Laden's truce saying that "We don't negotiate with terrorists. I think you have to destroy them."

Cheney also said that he thinks the Al Qaeda truce appeared to be a "ploy," but also added that "it is too early to draw conclusions." He also said, "I'm not sure what he's offering by way of a truce. I don't think anybody would believe him...it sounds to me like it's some kind of a ploy. This is not an organization that's ever going to sit down and sign a truce."

<h1>Vladivostok fire witnesses dispute official death toll of nine, claim at least 50</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Vladivostok%20fire%20witnesses%20dispute%20official%20death%20toll%20of%20nine%2C%20claim%20at%20least%2050&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

At 11:45am on January 16, in &lt;a href="w%3AVladivostok"&gt;Vladivostok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, a fire broke out on the three upper floors of the ♡❤Sberbank♡❤ building.

Photographs taken by eye-witnesses show people, who were trapped, dropping from 8th floor windows to their deaths. According to some reports the firemen who were dispatched to the scene were pre-occupied at the rear of the building. They had apparently been ordered to evacuate the bank and its management from the area, which was not under immediate threat.

Official Russian media initially denied the fire, accusing the reports of being false.

Russian media later confirmed 7 and then, 9 dead. Witnesses and those rescued from the burning building have claimed that the figure exceeds 50.

A maintenance employee who worked in the building was quoted as saying, "I know at least about 13 dead inside ... that's the least I've noticed, not to consider those who've dropped down ... 8 of them dropped, looking at the three already dead on the ground, but they went through the windows without hope to be rescued ... They collected and hid the dead bodies inside. I work at this building! I know its layout very well! To declare, as it become clear, a less number of the dead later." 

"My daughter worked in a justice department," - Natalia, one of the witnesses said. "She said that there were actually much more dead - up to 70. She went on the dead bodies, getting out from the building … some of them were so scorched, that it was impossible to identify them… 9 victims? That's a lie!" 

Georic, a witness: "The cops ("menty"), whom I know, say that they've been loading the dead bodies all night long."

Lelya has posted her evidence on January 21, 2006 on the web-site http://news.vl.ru/vlad/2006/01/18/tradegy/ 
"My brother worked in that building, on the 6th flour. So, the night after the fire they visited the building to collect the documents, etc. and they saw how workers transported the dead bodies. He said, there were 50-60.."

<h2>Actions of the officials</h2>

Eugenia, a witness said, "who has told you, that fireteam arrived in 3 minutes? Or in 20 minutes? My uncle worked on anouther side of the building. He personally gave a call to the fire department. They said, "ok, ok, take it easy, here we go..." as if it were just some fun for them, "nothing serious!"

Reports from the scene say the fire brigade arrived at least 40 minutes or more from the time the call about the fire was placed.

The Fire-safety Department officials state that firemen had had "objective obstacles" which hampered rescue efforts. Among them were barred emergency exits and a congestion of cars in front of the burning building. 
The mayor of Vladivostok in reply to a plea "to rescue those who are still in fire, does human life really cost nothing?" replied saying that, "human life costs nothing in Russia."

Law-enforcement authorities arrested the inspector who had checked the building in July 2004, and exposed a number of irregularities, such as barred windows in stairwells, but failed to control the elimination of these shortcomings.

Lyudmila Feofanova, CEO of the Maritime branch of "Sberbank", was arrested in Vladivostok in conjunction with the case of the fire which has killed, according to official reports, 9 and seriousely wounded 17 last Monday.

The Office of Public Prosecutor accuses L.Feofanova on failure to provide the bank with a fire-prevention system.

<h2>Mass-media coverage</h2>

The Russian official news agencies and mass-media report only 9 victims, several bank employees. 

Five days following the fire, people have launched dozens of forums and web-sites, trying to tell their side of the story. They have created lists of those believed to be killed or those that are unable to be indentified.

Australian Defence Minister, Liberal &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Murray%20Hill"&gt;Senator Robert Hill&lt;/a&gt;, 59, has resigned after almost a quarter of a century in Parliament and confirmed he will retire from the Senate. The Senator has been the longest serving leader of his party in the Upper House since Federation. 

Robert Murray Hill was elected to the Senate for South Australia in 1980. Having spent 13 years in Opposition, he was appointed Environment Minister when the Howard Government was elected in 1996. He will serve out his final few days in the Senate in the next session of parliament. 

Prime Minister Howard said Senator Hill's exit after almost 25 years in Parliament and 13 years as Liberal Senate leader would be a "huge loss" for the Government.

Mr Hill said it was good to make a decision to leave parliament before he was forced out for other reasons.

At his farewell media conference on Friday, he said he has "no regrets." Questioned over the wisdom of Australia's involvement in the Iraq war he said, "...there was a time where we saw defence simply in terms of almost hiding behind the moat. We no longer do that." 

"We go out and we look after Australia's interests and we become part of an international community that's interested in security and stability, and we're prepared to take risks to achieve those goals," he said.

The Australia Defence Association praised his efforts as defence minister, a position he has held since November, 2001. "He's easily the best defence minister of the Howard government and the best, along with (Labor's) Robert Ray since the 1970s," Defence Association spokesman Neil James said.

It's widely expected that Robert Hill will become the next Australian representative to the United Nations in New York. Senator Hill yesterday articulated a case for reform of the global body. "This Government believes in collective security, it believes in the commitments of the charter, but it would like to see the UN work efficiently and effectively," he said. 

The most likely candidates for the defence portfolio are Finance Minister Nick Minchin and Health Minister Tony Abbott.

Experts are now fearing the worst for the northern bottle-nosed whale that is still swimming in the Thames river London. The &lt;a href="w%3AThames%20Whale"&gt;Thames Whale&lt;/a&gt; was first spotted on Thursday, with widespread media coverage yesterday and huge crowds of spectators attracted to the river.

There were hopes that the whale was heading back out to sea, but these were dashed by a fresh sighting of the whale from Albert bridge in Chelsea.

Experts say that the whale is now looking increasingly distressed, with numerous cuts to its body. The whale has already been partly beached on a few occasions, but each time has managed to free itself.

According to blogger Andrew (eyedropper.co.uk), a BBC picture editor, if the whale should die it would be up to Admiral the Lord Boyce GCB OBE 'to arrange for a tooth to be extracted and sent to the Natural History Museum, and a proper burial to be made'.

Kosova President &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20Rugova"&gt;Ibrahim Rugova&lt;/a&gt;, the leader for many years of &lt;a href="w%3AKosova"&gt;Kosova&lt;/a&gt; in the most difficult process and struggle for country’s independence, died Saturday.

Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova passed away in his home in Prishtina at 11:38, close to his family members, his personal doctor, a US doctor, and his close staff. President Rugova suffered from &lt;a href="w%3Alung%20cancer"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;, diagnosed in end of August 2005. He fought his illness for months with an exceptional moral courage. The PM had called an urgent Cabinet session at 3 pm, sources say.

The death was a few days before the United Nations was to begin a Belgrade-Pristina discussions relating to the road to independence for the province. Rugova, 61, has no definite successor in his faction-ridden &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20League%20of%20Kosovo"&gt;Democratic League of Kosovo&lt;/a&gt; or head of the Kosovo negotiating team, which he was expected to lead. Western diplomats are worried about a possible messy power struggle.

The Sorbonne-educated literature professor was the architect of the decade-old passive resistance since 1989, when former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic stripped the province of autonomy. 

A statement issued by President Rugova’s Office said the public would be advised shortly concerning the details related to the events to honor the President.

Rescue teams are attempting to save the life of the whale which has been swimming in the London Thames river over the past few days. The northern bottle-nosed whale, which had gotten weaker and weaker, became beached this afternoon. Rescue teams quickly moved the whale onto an inflatable pontoon, keeping the whale in water but with its blowhole above the surface.

Experts then tried to evaluate the condition of the whale by performing ultrasound checks to see how much blubber and blood the whale has, and by taking some blood tests. The breathing rate of the whale was around four inhalations per minute.

The pontoon is currently being towed by a barge slowly downstream.

The British Divers Marine Life Rescue team lead the rescue effort. They hope to be able to release the whale in as deep water as possible, but only if it is in good enough health. If the whale is considered to be in too weak a condition to survive, it may be euthanised, experts have said.

The rescue mission is being filmed by television crews, including from helicopters, and broadcast live onto rolling news channels. Mark Stevens, a member of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue team reported on the situation live on TV using a mobile phone, direct from the scene where he was standing in the water. At one point he asked the BBC to tell their helicopter to fly higher, as the noise made the whale's breathing rate temporarily go up.

The whale sightings have captivated the British public, with spectators lining the banks of the Thames to take photographs and try and spot the whale. However, the inital surprise at seeing the whale soon turned to concern as experts fear for the whale's long term health. Initial plans to transfer the whale from the barge "Crossness" to a deep-sea ship have been abandoned as the condition of the whale deteriorates, but it is still hoped to release the whale in the Thames estuary.

<h1>Maryland Judge throws out law banning gay marriages</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Maryland%20Judge%20throws%20out%20law%20banning%20gay%20marriages&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Judge M. Brooke Murdock of the Baltimore Circuit Court in &lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; struck down a 1973 law banning &lt;a href="w%3Asame-sex%20marriage"&gt;same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, ruling the measure violated a state constitutional amendment prohibiting sex discrimination.

The decision will not allow gay couples to be immediately eligible for marriage licenses because Murdock stayed the order pending an appeal. The state's attorney general's office filed the appeal right after the ruling was made.

"Although tradition and societal values are important, they cannot be given so much weight that they alone will justify a discriminatory statutory classification," the judge stated in the ruling. "When tradition is the guise under which prejudice or animosity hides, it is not a legitimate state interest."

In making the decision, Judge Murdock wrote, "the court is not unaware of the dramatic impact of its ruling."

Ken Choe, a lawyer with the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union's&lt;/a&gt; (ACLU) Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, said "men and women were indeed treated differently under the law Judge Murdock struck down. A man can marry a woman, but a woman can't marry a woman. Same-sex couples need the same protections for their families that opposite-sex couples do." 

The ACLU hailed the ruling, calling it "a historical step toward allowing same-sex couples to legally marry in Maryland." She considered but dismissed all the state's arguments for the restriction, noting "Prevention of same-sex marriage is not rationally related to the state's interests in promoting stable families and protecting the best interests of children. ... These arguments are illogical and inaccurate."

Governor &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20L.%20Ehrlich%20Jr."&gt;Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.&lt;/a&gt; released a statement saying that that the state will "begin a vigorous appeals process. I firmly believe the institution of marriage is for one man and one woman only."

Governor Ehrlich had sent to Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. (D), a letter in response to the ruling advising him to appeal the decision and offered additional resources to support the appeal. 

"We have noted an appeal and think it appropriate that the court stayed the operation of its order," said Kevin J. Enright, a spokesman for Curran, in a statement. "We await having the decision of Maryland's appellate courts."

The Maryland House of Delegates scheduled hearings for January 31, 2006 on proposals dealing with same-sex marriages, including a proposed constitutional amendment.

John Lestitian, a plaintiff in the case, said Murdock's decision was "a step in a very long process. As a 40-year-old man, I should be able to decide who my family is."

"This is such an exciting moment," said Lisa Polyak. Her partner of 24 years, Gita Deane, was a plaintiff in the case. "Our participation in this lawsuit has always been about family protections for our children. Tonight, we will rest a little easier knowing that those protections are within reach."

The equal rights amendment in Maryland's State Constitution was ratified by voters in 1972. The marriage law which defined marriage as only between one man and one woman was approved the following year.

The lawsuit leading to the decision started when nine gay and/or lesbian couples and one individual sued court clerks in five Maryland counties for denying marriage licenses to them, citing legal, financial, and emotional harm. In July of 2004, the ACLU filed the suit challenging the state ban on same-sex marriage. 

Same-sex marriages are only legal in the state of &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, with the states of &lt;a href="w%3AVermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AConnecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; recognizing other civil unions. &lt;a href="w%3AHawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; offer some legal protections to same-sex couples, while 13 states have appoved constitutional amendments rejecting recognition of same-sex marriage. Courts in &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20State"&gt;Washington State&lt;/a&gt; are facing cases on the issue.

Following the return of the Stardust space capsule from its encounter with the &lt;a href="w%3AComet%20Wild%202"&gt;Comet Wild 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; scientists have come up with a novel approach to dealing with the samples of "interstellar dust" that have been collected; they want help from the public.
The &lt;a href="w%3AStardust%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Stardust&lt;/a&gt; spacecraft carried an &lt;a href="w%3AAerogel"&gt;aerogel&lt;/a&gt;-based dust collector, which was exposed to space in varying orientations during different phases of the mission.Only one side of the collector was exposed towards the stream of particles coming off the &lt;a href="w%3AComet%20Wild%202"&gt;Comet Wild 2&lt;/a&gt; during the encounter in 2004, while the other side was used to collect interstellar dust at an earlier point in the spacecraft's journey.

Although scientists have seen the particles captured from comet Wild 2 when they examined the aerogel, they have not examined any of the particles expected on the other side of the collector due to their smallness. They will be examined after they are found with the help of Stardust@home. It is believed that on the order of 50 interstellar dust particles impacted the aerogel, each now resting inside a tiny crater.
Stardust traveled nearly three billion miles and its mission lasted seven years. At times it was traveling at 8 miles a second. Thats fast enough to go from &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; in one minute. 
Stardust set a new all-time record for being the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth, breaking the previous record set in May of 1969 during the return of the &lt;a href="w%3AApollo%20X"&gt;Apollo X&lt;/a&gt;(10) command module. Don Brownlee of the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Washington%2C%20Seattle"&gt;University of Washington, Seattle&lt;/a&gt; said "our spacecraft has traveled further than anything from Earth ever has – and came back. We went half-way to Jupiter to meet the comet and collect samples from it. But the comet actually came in from the outer edge of the solar system, out beyond the orbit of &lt;a href="w%3ANeptune"&gt;Neptune&lt;/a&gt;, out by &lt;a href="w%3APluto"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt;."

In a move similar to some &lt;a href="w%3Adistributed%20computing"&gt;distributed computing&lt;/a&gt; projects, the analysis work for the project will be spread among volunteers on the Internet, who are being asked to participate in this scientific undertaking.

♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reporter investigated the &lt;a href="w%3AStardust%40home"&gt;Stardust@home&lt;/a&gt; project, and discussed its goals with one of its founders. Via email, he interviewed &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20P.%20Anderson"&gt;David P. Anderson&lt;/a&gt;, a founder of the &lt;a href="w%3ASETI%40home"&gt;SETI@home&lt;/a&gt; project, and one of the creators of the Virtual Microscope which will be used to search for captured particles from interstellar space.

♡❤♡I was wondering If I could get some questions answered or if you could give me some "insider" info for the project. I am aware that you are taking place in the development of the VM (Virtual Microscope)...Could I know more about that?♡❤♡
♡❤The 'virtual microscope' lets you scan through a set of images as if you were turning the focus knob on a microscope. The images are fairly large (about 100 KB each) so it's important to pre-load the images. While you're looking through one set of images, the VM is busy downloading the JPEG files for the next set.♡❤

♡❤At first we thought we'd have to do this with a Java applet or Flash program - something tricky and complicated. My contribution was to point out that it could be done fairly easily using Javascript, and I wrote a prototype of this.♡❤

♡❤♡Will this project use the BOINC Platform/Program?♡❤♡
♡❤No. We thought about using some parts of BOINC (like the database and web pages for creating "accounts") but it was easier just to do this from scratch.♡❤

♡❤♡How long will the project take?♡❤♡

♡❤It depends how many volunteers participate, and how fast they look at the 'focus movies'. It will probably be just a month or two.♡❤

♡❤♡Anyone can join but they have to take a test before they can participate. What will the test include?♡❤♡

♡❤Looking at some focus movies and deciding whether they contain a dust particle. Participants see a lot of training examples before they take the test. It's easy, not like a test in school.♡❤

♡❤♡How many will be allowed to participate?♡❤♡

♡❤No limit as of now.♡❤

♡❤♡When will the project start?♡❤♡

♡❤I think in about 2 months. It will take that long to transport the aerogel to the laboratory, and photograph it with the microscope. The software is ready to go.♡❤

♡❤♡Will the VM project analyze any of the particles or just look for them?♡❤♡

♡❤Stardust@home will only locate the particles. When they are located, they will be cut out of the aerogel and physically analyzed.♡❤

♡❤♡Thank you for your time David. And great work on the upcoming project and SETI@home.♡❤♡

Despite lots of publicity and media attention causing a last minute rush to buy tickets, there was no winner of the £85m jackpot in this week's '&lt;a href="w%3AEuromillions"&gt;Euromillions&lt;/a&gt;' lottery. This is the tenth week that no-one has won the top prize, which has 'rolled-over' to create bigger and bigger jackpots each week. Next week's jackpot now looks set to be worth around £100m, the biggest in European lottery history.

To win the jackpot, Players must match five main numbers from 1 to 50, plus two 'Lucky Star' numbers from one to nine. This week's winning numbers were 12, 15, 33, 44 and 50, with the Lucky Stars being 2 and 6.

The pan-Europe lotter is open to players in Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

The odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 76,275,360. 

If the estimated £100 million jackpot were to be shared equally amongst the populations of the countries participating, each person would receive 50p.

<h1>London whale dies</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=London%20whale%20dies&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A Northern Bottlenose whale died at approximately 19:00 GMT in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; today despite rescue efforts. The whale had previously found its way up the &lt;a href="w%3AThames"&gt;River Thames&lt;/a&gt; and into the central portion of the British capital.

Despite whales' ability to breathe out of water, their skeletons are not designed to hold their own massive body weights, and so whales cannot spend long periods of time out of water. 

The death of the whale saved the rescue team from having to decide whether it was advisable to release the whale in such a weak condition. A humane killing had been considered.

The whale managed to gather two days worth of media attention, with Londoners and people all over the world captivated by the unusual story.

<h1>Burns engages India on civil nuclear energy pact</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Burns%20engages%20India%20on%20civil%20nuclear%20energy%20pact&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

"&lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;'s position is unique, and there is a complexity and a difficulty to these talks" &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AR.%20Nicholas%20Burns"&gt;Nicholas Burns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told reporters at the end of two days of discussions with the Indian Foreign Secretary, Shyam Saran. The visit by the US Undersecretary of State is the latest in a series of diplomatic missions since July of last year, when the two countries agreed to co-operate in civil nuclear energy projects. Saran described the talks as friendly and very intensive and said "We have shared with the United States our plans for a very significant expansion of our civilian nuclear energy capability over the next few years". The two also exchanged views on regional issues surrounding &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nepal"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;.

Saran and Burns head the Indo-US joint working group on civil &lt;a href="nuclear%20power"&gt;nuclear energy&lt;/a&gt; cooperation. India is looking to nuclear energy as a solution for its growing energy requirements. The country is hoping that the discussions will lead to the lifting of restrictions on nuclear technology transfer imposed by the US since India's nuclear tests in 1998. The US has requested a number of safeguards in exchange. India has been asked to separate its military and civilian nuclear programmes, and allow the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; (IAEA) to inspect its civilian reactors while continuing its moratorium on nuclear testing. If the deal goes through, the US would be making an exception in the case of India, which is not a signatory to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NPT). The two sides claimed that there is enough good will and trust to reach an agreement while admitting to have encountered difficulties that required more work.

<h3>US engagement with India</h3>

This is the US Undersecretary's second visit to &lt;a href="New%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; since October and part of an ongoing US engagement that has recently involved others including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Secretary%20of%20State"&gt;US Secretary of State&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; and US &lt;a href="US%20Senate"&gt;Senator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Later this year, &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; is expected to bestow a state visit to the country. The trip which is currently planned for the first week of March will only be the fifth such visit by a US President to India. &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; was the last president to visit India in March 2000.

The two countries announced a significant breakthrough in July of last year when the US agreed to help India with nuclear fuel for its Tarapur reactor. This was a huge policy change since India had been denied use of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Adual-use%20technology"&gt;dual-use technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for almost three decades while it remained outside the NPT. The Bush administration defended the move by describing India as a responsible nuclear power and announced that it would work with the US Congress on passing the necessary legislation to achieve full nuclear energy cooperation with India.

The agreement has some members of the Congress concerned with opposition from both &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;. Critics believe the deal could harm efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and potentially jeopardize the NPT. The agreement also hinges on the details surrounding the separation of India's military and civilian nuclear facilities. This may not be very easy as some of the country's nuclear research facilities are thought to contribute to both fields. US senator John Kerry has supported the deal "in principle" while saying that the fine print of the agreement would need to be studied when Congress votes on the issue. Kerry is a member of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and met with the Indian Prime Minister and other senior officials earlier this month.

<h3>Emerging global, regional power</h3>

The US foreign policy towards India in the recent past shows a transformation recognizing it as an emerging global power and also an important player in regional geo-politics. Some believe that this is part of the longer term US effort to strengthen relations with Asian countries to counter the rise of China. 

Recently, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been the cause for displeasure in Washington. US alleges that it is attempting to build nuclear weapons while Iran maintains that it wants the technology only for energy purposes. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Larijani"&gt;Ali Larijani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the chief Iranian negotiator with the IAEA complained of dual standards being set by the US and cited India as an example. Iran is bound by the NPT since it is a signatory to the treaty.

US Undersecretary Burns dismissed Larijani's remarks calling them outrageous and saying that it was not possible to compare India and Iran in the nuclear sphere. "[India] has never been a proliferator, and has been very responsible in safeguarding its nuclear technology. On the other hand, you have a government and a regime in Iran, which the IAEA says for 18 years conducted secret nuclear research without revealing it to the IAEA."

India which has had a long-standing close relationship with Iran has supported the initiative taken by the European-3 to find a solution to the issues related to Iranian nuclear program. Saran said that he would not like to see a confrontation developing in a region that is so close to India and recommended developing an international consensus. 
India which is looking to secure its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; supplies has signed a deal with Iran for a $7 billion gas pipeline project. This deal has been strongly opposed by the United States. Work is expected to commence in 2007 and the project will be owned and operated by a consortium from Iran, India and &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; as well as some international energy companies.

In &lt;a href="w%3AMelville%2C%20West%20Virginia"&gt;Mellville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, the remains of two miners have been found. The two miners had disappeared at the Alma coal mine when a conveyor belt caught fire.

"We have found the two miners we were looking for for [♡❤sic♡❤] the past 40 hours," said Doug Conaway, director of the state Office of Miners' Health Training and Safety. "Unfortunately we don't have a positive outcome."

Governor &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Manchin"&gt;Joe Manchin&lt;/a&gt;, Massey Energy Chairman Don Blankenship and U.S. Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJay%20Rockefeller"&gt;Jay Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt; went to a church where the victims families were waiting to tell them the news.

"For over what 45 hours we've been together with the families, we do not have the outcome that we had desired, that we had been hoping for. We have two brave miners that have perished. These two men who perished in this mine, the 12 men who perished in the Sago Mine, I can only say to each of those families ... that they have not died in vain," Manchin said at a press conference after receiving the news.

On Monday, Manchin plans to introduce legislation dealing with rapid responses in emergencies, electronic tracking technology and mandate reserve oxygen stations for underground miners.

Manchin is expected to go to Washington D.C. on Tuesday to discuss his proposals with West Virginia's congressional delegation.

The miners became separated from their team when fire broke out. Nineteen other miners were able to escape without injury.

The two have been identified as Don Bragg, 33, and Ellery "Elvis" Hatfield, 47. They had been missing since Saturday.

<h1>Portugal to produce new Volkswagen model in 2008</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Portugal%20to%20produce%20new%20Volkswagen%20model%20in%202008&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVolkswagen"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; announced the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3APalmela"&gt;Palmela, Portugal&lt;/a&gt; factory - Autoeuropa - has been chosen to produce a new car model beginning the first quarter of 2008, but did not specify the model to be produced.

"The decision to produce a new model in Autoeuropa is the result of the competitive cost of production of the factory, well as the favorable conditions of the cooperation established by the Portuguese government and the workers," announced Wolfgang Bernhard.

&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJos%C3%A9%20S%C3%B3crates"&gt;José Sócrates&lt;/a&gt;, prime minister of Portugal, said he was "satisfied with the decision of Volkswagen to produce a new model in the factory of Palmela," and considered that the decision, "reflected the confidence [of the investors] in the Portuguese economy."

Volkswagen will reveal the new model to be produced next week. By 2008, the factory at Palmela will only be producing the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVolkswagen%20Sharan"&gt;multi-purpose vehicle Sharan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVolkswagen%20Eos"&gt;Eos&lt;/a&gt; models.

With the end of the production of the multi-purpose vehicle, the factory needs to guarantee new product lines, since the new Eos is not sufficient to maintain the current 2,790 workers.

The Volkswagen Autoeuropa produced a total of 79,896 vehicles last year, of the models &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVolkswagen%20Sharan"&gt;Volkswagen Sharan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ASEAT%20Alhambra"&gt;SEAT Alhambra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AFord%20Galaxy"&gt;Ford Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AVolkswagen%20Eos"&gt;Volkswagen Eos&lt;/a&gt;, against the 95,660 vehicles produced in 2004.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANepali"&gt;Nepali&lt;/a&gt; army has reported that six security forces and 17 Maoist rebels are now dead following an attack on Saturday night. Security forces have been detaining scores of protesters since fresh demonstrations began in Nepal's capital city of &lt;a href="w%3AKathmandu"&gt;Kathmandu&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. Five opposition leaders are also reported to be under house arrest in a preemptive move to curb rallies. The government reports that nearly 200 people were taken into custody. The claim is disputed by the opposition which puts the number much higher.

Supporters of the opposition have called for a boycott of local elections claiming them to be undemocratic and that they would only entrench the king's rule. An alliance of seven parties is demanding that &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Gyanendra"&gt;King Gyanendra&lt;/a&gt; give up the absolute power he seized last year.

A U.S. military court found Army chief warrant officer &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20E.%20Welshofer%20Jr."&gt;Lewis Welshofer&lt;/a&gt; guilty of &lt;a href="w%3Anegligent%20homicide"&gt;negligent homicide&lt;/a&gt; in the death of Iraqi Maj. Gen. &lt;a href="w%3AAbed%20Hamed%20Mowhoush"&gt;Abed Hamed Mowhoush&lt;/a&gt; during an interrogation in &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaim"&gt;al-Qaim&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syrian&lt;/a&gt; border, in November 2003.

The Iraqi general died after Welshofer shoved the general head-first into a sleeping bag, sat on him and occasionally covered the generals mouth with his hands. Welshofer's supervisor had approved this technique except that Welshofer did not tell his supervisor that he sat on prisoners.

The prosecution described the techniques Welshofer used to obtain information from Mowhoush as "&lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt;".

The defense argued that Welshofer's interrogation methods were covered by official policy. 
His unit's commander Captain William Ponce wrote in an email three months before Mowhoush died that there were no rules for interrogations yet and that "the gloves are coming off, gentlemen ... we want these individuals broken. Casualties are mounting."
Lieutenant General &lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Sanchez"&gt;Ricardo Sanchez&lt;/a&gt;, the commanding officer in Iraq, authorized new interrogation techniques which according to Welshofer included the sleeping bag method.

The jury consisting of six military officers also found Welshofer guilty of negligent &lt;a href="w%3Adereliction%20of%20duty"&gt;dereliction of duty&lt;/a&gt;, but acquitted of the more serious &lt;a href="w%3Amurder"&gt;murder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aassault"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; charges.

Two days before his death, Mowhoush was beaten with rubber hoses, allegedly by &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; subcontractors, in the presence of Welshofer and on the next day Welshofer held Mowhoush while water was poured on this face.

Welshinger testified that he had used the sleeping bag technique a dozen to two dozen times in Iraq.

The sentencing is scheduled for Monday when Welshofer faces a maximum penalty of three years in a military prison. Last year U.S. army reservist &lt;a href="w%3ALynndie%20England"&gt;Lynndie England&lt;/a&gt; was convicted of one count of conspiracy, four counts of maltreating detainees and one count of committing an indecent act and is currently serving her sentence of three years in prison. None of the charges levied against her involved the death of a detainee and her defense also argued that she was acting with consent of superiors.

In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AShaukat%20Aziz"&gt;Shaukat Aziz&lt;/a&gt; said
"There is no evidence, as of half an hour ago, that there were any other people there". 
&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; officials have previously stated that as many as eight &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; operatives were dining in &lt;a href="w%3ADamadola%20airstrike"&gt;Damadola when struck&lt;/a&gt; by United States missiles. As many as eighteen individuals were killed in the strike.

In the interview Prime Minister Aziz labelled a U.S. report that senior al Qaeda leaders were killed in a CIA attack as "bizarre".

Mr Aziz said, "The area does see movement of people from across the border. But we have not found one body or one shred of evidence that these people were there." 

"If you just reflect on what happened; first, we heard that there was a dinner meeting with all the seniors," the Prime Minister said. "I think that's a bizarre thought, because these people don't get together for dinner in a terrain or environment like that."

The U.S. network &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; reported January 18 on its Web site that the attack killed Khabab, quoting "Pakistani authorities." However a number of Pakistani officials have told CNN they cannot confirm the ABC report.

J.D. Crouch, the USA's Deputy National Security Advisor to President Bush told CNN on January 19, that there was no confirmation that any senior al Queda operatives were killed in the bombing.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABali%20Nine"&gt;Bali Nine&lt;/a&gt; have been dealt another blow with the Federal Court of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; dismissing an application for them to gain access to documents held by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; (AFP).

The application was bought to court on behalf of Scott Rush, Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens and Michael Czugaj, four of the nine Australians being held in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly attempting to smuggle &lt;a href="w%3AHeroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;.

Their lawyers have claimed that the AFP may have acted illegally by passing information onto Indonesian authorities, which led to their arrest. In Indonesia, convicted drug smugglers may face the death penalty, which Australia is opposed to.

The basis of the argument is that the AFP provided information knowing that Australians could be sentenced to death if the information was correct.

When handing his ruling down in Adelaide, Justice Paul Finn said "It is now the applicants' position that each of them, in their capacity as Australian citizens, has a substantiative legitimate expectation that the Australian government, its agencies and public officers will not act in such a way as to expose them to the risk of the imposition of the death penalty,"

"(But) there would be no arguable basis at all for any contention that AFP officers had a legal responsibility to warn any of the applicants either that they were under police surveillance or that they were exposing themselves to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty.

"Having been prepared for whatever reason to engage in criminal activity, the applicants would properly be regarded as the authors of their own harm.

"And the police would have been entitled to have treated them as no more than subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation which fell clearly within the mandated functions of the AFP."

Suspected &lt;a href="w%3ATamil_tigers"&gt;Tamil Tiger&lt;/a&gt; rebels have ambushed and killed three soldiers in &lt;a href="w%3ASri_Lanka%23Sinhala-Tamil_conflict"&gt;Sri Lanka's&lt;/a&gt; volatile eastern region, as a Norwegian peace broker flew in to the country in a last-ditch peace bid.

The patrol was ambushed with a fragmentation mine - the most recent in a series of attacks which have killed over 70 military personnel since December.

The attack came after Norwegian peace envoy Erik Solheim arrived in Sri Lanka for truce talks. As he arrived, three soldiers were killed in a landmine explosion in the east, which the army blamed on the Tamil Tigers. Rohan Abeywardene, deputy inspector general of police said the Tamil Tigers were responsible for the attack.

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have threatened to resume their armed struggle this year unless &lt;a href="w%3AMahinda_Rajapaksa"&gt;President Mahinda Rajapakse&lt;/a&gt; grants independence - which he has refused to do. The Tamil Tigers want a separate state in the north and east of Sri Lanka.

The rebels have fought the government since 1983 to create a separate homeland for ethnic minority &lt;a href="w%3ATamil"&gt;Tamils&lt;/a&gt;, accusing the majority Sinhalese-dominated state of discrimination.

The rebels say they are ready to use suicide bombers, as in the past, if war resumes. The Sri Lankan army is preparing for the worst with analysts say both sides are already engaged in an undeclared war. The Tigers, accuse the military and government-backed paramilitaries of a litany of abuses, including rape and executions of Tamil civilians and rebels.

About 65,000 people were killed in the conflict before the cease-fire. Peace talks broke down in April 2003, when the Tigers withdrew, demanding autonomy in the Tamil-majority northeast region.

Over 100 people have been killed in the escalating violence since December.

Anti-whaling activists are heading home after a month of pestering the Japanese whaling fleet near Antarctica. With dwindling food and fuel supplies, the &lt;a href="w%3AGreenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; ships Arctic Sunrise and Esperanza are heading for &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;. The Sea Shepherd's Farley Mowat has also left the area due to a refuelling cancellation.

The three ships were in the Whale Sanctuary where the controversial Japanese whaling fleet continue to hunt and kill hundreds of &lt;a href="w%3AMinke%20whales"&gt;Minke whales&lt;/a&gt;, including the endangered &lt;a href="w%3AFin%20whales"&gt;Fin whales&lt;/a&gt; - for what Japan calls "lethal scientific research." 

Greenpeace say they will now switch the focus of the campaign to shed light on the corporate entities behind the commercial whaling industry. Greenpeace New Zealand whales campaigner, Pia Mancia, said the two ships exposed the reality of the Japanese commercial whaling operation to the world. She said: "it is now time to focus action on those controlling the whaling fleet."

Greenpeace Southern Ocean Expedition Leader Shane Rattenbury said, "Logistically we cannot remain in the &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Ocean"&gt;Southern Ocean&lt;/a&gt; any longer, but this certainly isn't the last you'll hear of us... We now need the public to focus their attention on the corporates linked to the commercial whaling."

"For a month now we have dogged, delayed and disrupted the whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, and have no doubt that they have fallen far behind in their bid to slaughter 935 minke whales and 10 endangered fin whales. It is our hope that this struggle will inspire people to help us defend whales, so that it goes down in history as the last time the peaceful silence in the Sanctuary is broken by the sound of a grenade-tipped harpoon," Mr Rattenbury said.

Japan has welcomed Greenpeace's decision to leave the Southern Ocean. Hideki Moronuki from Japan's Fisheries Agency is pleased the whaling mission will no longer be obstructed: "Although Greenpeace say that they're activities are peaceful, their activities are really dangerous and illegal," he said. 

Protesters spent much of their time in the Southern Ocean in inflatable Zodiac boats, placing themselves precariously between harpoons and whales. They escaped serious injury when the Japanese allegedly rammed their vessel, and when a protester was pulled overboard by a harpoon rope. Activists were also blasted out of boats by water cannons.

The incidents caused slanging matches between Greenpeace and Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research, both arguing they had evidence the other was at fault. The Japanese say their whale cull is scientific research and that they will continue their whaling.

Greenpeace Expedition Leader Shane Rattenbury has defended the risks taken by activists during the protests. "We feel it's been a justifiable risk somebody had to come down here and do something, politics and diplomacy have failed." he said.

Japan says it's too early to tell what effect Greenpeace has had on its current research mission. The Japan Whaling Association (JWA), which promotes and protects Japan's whaling culture says, "The moratorium on commercial whaling is an anomaly." 

Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) says the whale research programs are conducted in accordance with the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. 

The ICR say they "do not, in any way, involve illegal whaling... under the IWC's ♡❤no waste♡❤ rules the by-products of the research program, including whale meat, are required ♡❤so far as practicable to be processed♡❤. It is this aspect of the program which is often inaccurately sensationalised as ♡❤illegal commercial whaling♡❤, reads a statement on their website.

<h2>Sea Shepherds head to Capetown</h2>

A second protest group - The &lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Shepherd%20Conservation%20Society"&gt;Sea Shepherd Conservation Society&lt;/a&gt; - has also left the Southern Ocean. Their ship, the &lt;a href="w%3AFarley%20Mowat%20%28Sea%20Shepherd%20vessel%29"&gt;Farley Mowat&lt;/a&gt; is also headed for Cape Town. &lt;a href="w%3ACaptain%20Paul%20Watson"&gt;Captain Paul Watson&lt;/a&gt; said: "Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd together have completed the most intensive and ambitious campaign ever mounted against Antarctic whaling activities. For 15 days, whales were prevented from being killed."

Captain Watson said he made the decision to stay in the Southern Oceans for as long as possible to continue to chase the "illegal Japanese whaling fleet across the bottom of the world," he said. "After a 4,000 kilometre chase, the Farley Mowat had reached its limit." 

The Sea Shepherds had made arrangements to refuel from a tanker scheduled to supply a fishing fleet near the French Kergulen Islands. However, the South African company supplying the tanker cancelled the tanker rendezvous, citing extreme weather conditions.

"At that point, there was no choice," said Captain Watson. "We were 2600 miles from the nearest port... We had to drop out of the chase and make for South Africa. We had no safety margin, in fact, we were short of fuel. The figures were ominous. Our chase suddenly became a race to survive."

After fuel conservation measures paid off the Farley Mowat is expected to make it to Cape Town. "We have just completed the longest voyage that this ship has made in its entire 48-year career," said 1st Officer Alex Cornelissen.

Whilst the Sea Shepherds and Greenpeace were not officially working together, 1st Officer Alex Cornelissen of the Farley Mowat said, "we believe we were working in cooperation with ...(Greenpeace). We had different roles, different tactics, and different strategies but the bottom line is that we were both opposing illegal whaling by Japan."

The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society says it will return to the Southern Ocean next year with a another, faster vessel to confront the Japanese whaling fleet. The Farley Mowat may also return to Antarctica as a secondary confrontation vessel.

The whale hunting season will continue until the middle of March. Greenpeace say they targeted this particular hunt because Japan had decided to double its quota of minke whales this year in the internationally recognised Southern Ocean whale sanctuary. 

"This is supposed to be a whale sanctuary and the Japanese government is the only one in the world which is defying the ban on whaling here," Rattenbury said. "Unfortunately so far we have seen 123 whales killed or brought back to the mother ship."

The Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research has a quota of 935 minke whales and 10 Fin whales. Fin whales are the second biggest animal on the planet, after the Blue whale. Greenpeace say they saw none killed during their actions. "So far we have only seen minkes slaughtered, we have seen no fin whales being killed," Rattenbury said.

The Greenpeace ships are expected to arrive in Cape Town around February 5th. The Sea Shepherd ship Farley Mowat is expected to arrive in Cape Town on January 25th 2006.

Nearly 300 people turned out at a protest meeting held in &lt;a href="w%3AVladivostok"&gt;Vladivostok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; on January 21st. Relatives and friends of the victims and survivors of the recent fire, as well as ordinary citizens were there and full of anger. They had come to protest against the authorities, whom they say mishandled the rescue operation in the terrible fire and have withheld the truth about the real number of dead.

The slogans at the protest read, "♡❤Who will tell us the truth?♡❤", "♡❤We want to know the truth!♡❤", "♡❤Our lives cost nothing!♡❤", "♡❤Authorities should respond!♡❤", and "♡❤Firemen are those who should be set on fire!♡❤"

The Chief of Vladivostok City Police Department colonel Nikolay Panchenko commented: "The meeting participants are sure, that the authorities hide a true number of the dead and refer to the web-site ♡❤fire.zloe.net♡❤."

The web-site "Truth about the fire in Vladivostok" has been created to spread information about the fire.

Panchenko said "We verified the published messages, but none of them was confirmed. We have ♡❤detected♡❤ the two authors of the messages. One of them has already denied everything he wrote, another is still ♡❤hiding out♡❤".

Today, a news agency in Vladivostok, which maintains another web-site where information about the fire is collected, reports they received an official order from the government services. Additional private information about people who post comments on news.vl.ru has been requested.

Some human rights experts warn that the witnesses may be persecuted in a situation where the authorities want to hide the truth, and thus to escape responsibility.

Gary Neville is likely to face an inquiry from the Football Association as complaints filter in from Liverpool Supporters present at the game. Neville, who had ran the entire length of the pitch celebrating, was alleged to remark inappropriate comments at the fans, after they had taunted him the entire game.

The true nature of these comments, however, is yet to transpire, but due to police intervention, it may be thought they were anfield related, although such claims are unfounded. Despite the fact Neville has not been formally charged, the attacks have, at least prompted police to request the referee's report so they are able to fully start correspondence with the FA.

&lt;a href="w%3ABrazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; – The &lt;a href="w%3ABrazilian%20Carnival"&gt;Brazilian Carnival&lt;/a&gt; season opened Sunday, February 6. The annual festival is scheduled to continue until Tuesday, February 15 (longer in some regions).

The samba schools parade in &lt;a href="w%3ARio%20de%20Janeiro"&gt;Rio de Janeiro&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled for the first day. The parade occurs at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ingresso.facil.nom.br/samba.htm"&gt;Sambódromo plaza&lt;/a&gt;, a place which was constructed specially for the event. Thousands of onlookers and participants are expected for the televised event, starting at 9:00 p.m. local time and continuing without interruption until Monday morning around 6:00 a.m. The parade will then restart Monday night at 9:00 p.m.

The samba schools which are scheduled to be in Sambódromo plaza Sunday, February 6 are: Mocidade, Império Serrano, Salgueiro, Mangueira, Unidos da Tijuca, Tradição and Vila Isabel. Monday, February 7, the following schools are scheduled: Porto da Pedra, Caprichosos, Viradouro, Portela, Imperatriz, Grande Rio and Beija-Flor.

Although the samba schools' parade in Rio de Janeiro is a great event of the Brazilian carnival, the Brazilian people also celebrate &lt;a href="w%3Acarnival"&gt;carnival&lt;/a&gt; in another ways: going out to the streets, going to saloons, participating in blocos and bandas and following the &lt;a href="w%3ATrio%20El%C3%A9trico"&gt;Trio Elétrico&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Sample from Turkish patient shows mutated Bird Flu virus</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sample%20from%20Turkish%20patient%20shows%20mutated%20Bird%20Flu%20virus&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
A mutated form of the Avian (Bird Flu) virus has been found in a sample taken from a Turkish patient.

The mutated form is said to make the virus easier to attach itself to humans rather than animals says a report in the ♡❤Nature♡❤ journal.

The situation is being monitored by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; but says "it is too early to know whether the virus is changing in ways that would signal the start of a human flu pandemic," says Maria Cheng a spokeswoman for the WHO. "It's one isolate from a single virus from Turkey. The sample suggests the virus might be more inclined to bind to human cells rather than animal cells, but there's no evidence that it's becoming more infectious. If we started to see a lot more samples from Turkey with this mutation and saw the virus changing, we'd be more concerned." 

However, the ♡❤Nature♡❤ report says there is a second mutation that also "signals adaptation to humans." 

Cheng also said that "flu viruses mutate all the time. For us to assign public health significance to a genetic change we need to match it to what is happening epidemiologically — how the virus is behaving — and clinically — if it's more or less virulent."

In &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; the fatality rate from the Bird Flu is 50% where elsewhere in the world reports of infection were only scattered. Entire families have been affected in Turkey and more reports come out almost every day of mild symptoms.

So far, Turkey has suffered four deaths and 21 infections. In addition to those cases the WHO reports 145 cases and 80 deaths in &lt;a href="Cambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.

"When this outbreak (in Turkey) was first reported, there was a lot of concern it was behaving differently," said Cheng. Subsequent investigation, however, has indicated no major behavioral change. 

"The team there told us that after two weeks of investigating, they haven't found substantial differences in the pattern we've seen in Southeast Asia," said Cheng.

The mutations were discovered by scientists in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20England"&gt;London, England&lt;/a&gt; in a lab.

Cheng said this may "signify the virus is trying different things to see if it can more easily infect humans. So far, we haven't seen that the virus has the ability to do this. But it's important that we continue monitoring. We would be concerned if we were seeing successive generations of spread of the virus. We haven't so far. All these people had a very clear history of contact with diseased birds."

Health officials say that so far they do not see any evidence yet that the virus can spread easily in humans.

The Bird Flu virus, strain H5N1, first started to infect humans in 1997 in &lt;a href="Hong%20Kong"&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;. In 2003 it re-emerged and it has so far been difficult to control.

In the town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWeare%2C%20New%20Hampshire"&gt;Weare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, a movement is under way to force &lt;a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; Justice &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Souter"&gt;David Souter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to sell his home for "public benefit," an expansion of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEminent%20domain%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;eminent domain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; provision in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20US%20Constitution"&gt;Fifth Amendment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Constitution"&gt;US Constitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that the Supreme Court legalized in the controversial 5&amp;ndash;4 decision in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKelo%20v.%20New%20London"&gt;Kelo v. New London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; where Souter was on the majority side. In the June 2005 decision this majority ruled that "public use" included "public benefit," stating that a local council could use the Fifth Amendment to compulsorily acquire private property for the express purpose of selling it to other private parties whose use was expected to yield increased tax revenues. The decision left many worried that homes would be seized for commercial enterprises or that the decision could be used as a means to remove minority property owners deemed inconvenient. 

The campaign to have Souter's house removed is headed by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALogan%20Clements"&gt;Logan Clements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who is petitioning to replace it with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALost%20Liberty%20Hotel"&gt;Lost Liberty Hotel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a tongue-in-cheek name for what he says will be a memorial to lost freedom. Clements already has 188 signatures to put the issue on a ballot, and only 25 are needed. Once it is on the ballot, the measure can be approved as soon as March. Weare has 8,500 residents.

So far, neither Justice Souter nor Kathy Arberg, Supreme Court spokeswoman, have commented on the matter.

A cow in the Province &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta%2C%20Canada"&gt;Alberta, Canada&lt;/a&gt;, has tested positive for &lt;a href="w%3AMad%20Cow%20disease"&gt;Mad Cow disease&lt;/a&gt;, said &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Food%20Inspection%20Agency"&gt;Canadian Food Inspection Agency&lt;/a&gt; officials on Monday.

Officials also stated that the six-year-old cross-bred cow did not make it into the human or animal feed chain.

"Last evening the...laboratory for BSE located in &lt;a href="w%3AWinnipeg"&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the presence of BSE in a cross-bred cow born and raised in Alberta," said CFIA chief veterinarian Brian Evans. "The animal was detected on the farm where it was born and no part of this animal entered the food for human consumption or feed for animal consumption purposes."

It is the fourth case to turn up in Canada since 2003. 

Evans also stated that it is too early to tell whether or not export markets would ban Canadian cows and beef.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has seen two cases of Mad Cow disease. The first was discovered in December of 2003 in the state of Washington. Officials later linked this case to Canada because the cow was born on a farm in Alberta. The second infected cow was discovered in Texas in 2005. The later case was diagnosed in &lt;a href="w%3AEngland"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; after earlier samples tested had shown conflicting results.

&lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; cancelled a media briefing on its &lt;a href="Stardust%20%28spacecraft%29"&gt;Stardust mission&lt;/a&gt;, expected to provide an update about analysis of both the "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AComet%20Wild%202"&gt;Comet Wild 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " particles and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ainterstellar%20particles"&gt;interstellar particles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gathered during the nearly seven year mission. In "MEDIA ADVISORY: M06-016," issued earlier today, the space agency announced postponement of the briefing, originally scheduled for Tuesday, January 24, 1 p.m. EST. No announcement has been made about when the briefing will be re-scheduled. NASA's stated reason for delay was to, "allow the Stardust science team additional time to assess and distribute cometary samples."

The &lt;a href="w%3AFord%20Motor%20Company"&gt;Ford Motor Company&lt;/a&gt;, the second-largest car manufacturer in America, will cut 30,000 jobs and 14 plants as part of a restructuring plan to relieve Ford after a US$1.6 billion loss last year in &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20America"&gt;North American&lt;/a&gt; sales.

The plan, called "Way Forward", the brainchild of Ford's Chief Executive Officer, &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Clay%20Ford%20Jr"&gt;William Clay Ford Jr&lt;/a&gt;., is to end Ford's North American losses by 2008. To accomplish this 30,000 jobs which make up 20 to 25 percent of Ford's North American workforce of 122,000 people will be cut and 14 plants will be closed in order to bring Ford's production capacity in line with demand.

By the end of this year, the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis"&gt;St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; plants will be closed. Atlanta makes the &lt;a href="w%3AFord%20Taurus"&gt;Ford Taurus&lt;/a&gt; sedan, which is being phased out. The St. Louis plant is one of two plants that manufactures the &lt;a href="w%3AFord%20Explorer"&gt;Ford Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, whose sales had a 29% decline in 2005. It will also close its &lt;a href="w%3AWixom"&gt;Wixom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; plant, Batavia Transmission in &lt;a href="w%3AOhio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; the Windsor Casting plant in &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; which was previously announced by Ford that it was to be closed after contract negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers union. 

The plant in &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Thomas"&gt;St. Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, Ontario plant will have one shift cut from it. The plant makes the &lt;a href="w%3ACrown%20Victoria"&gt;Crown Victoria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Marquis"&gt;Grand Marquis&lt;/a&gt; cars. On this cut of the one shift, Whitey MacDonald, chairperson of Local 1520, Canadian Auto Workers union said "There is a lot of anger here today, there is no doubt about it. Any time a plant goes to one shift, it puts them in limbo. This car has made the company millions of dollars over the years they have invested in other products and locations - we are entitled to some new investment given our track record." 

Positive news for the plant is that Ford is still committed to invest $200 million into the plant to upgrade the appearance of the two cars manufactured there. On the contrary, according to Automotive analyst Dennis DesRosier believes that the factory is still "likely" to close. DesRoiser said, "The St. Thomas plant is old, the product is old, it make sense it is on that list. This may be just a short-term reprieve, it may be look at permanent closure in two to three years."

Two more plants will close in 2008, another two in 2012. Two more plants to be closed are to be announced later this year. Also, Ford will fire 12% of its 53 executive officers.

Due to the company's current contract with the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Auto%20Workers"&gt;United Auto Workers&lt;/a&gt; union, workers at the idled plants will still be receiving their pay and benefits until Ford negotiates a new contract with the union. However, the workers may not earn what they earn today because they will not be eligible for overtime.
The UAW President Ron Gettelfinger and Vice President Gerald Bantom called say the plan is "extremely disappointing." The UAW issued statement saying "The impacted hourly and salaried workers find themselves facing uncertain futures because of senior management's failure to halt Ford's sliding market share. The announcement has further left a cloud hanging over the entire work force because of pending future announcements of additional facilities to be closed at some point in the future."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Interview%3A%20Danny%20O%27Brien%20of%20the%20Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

January's second was with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20O%27Brien"&gt;Danny O'Brien&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the &lt;a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (EFF) on 23 January in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIRC"&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

The EFF is coming off a series of high-profile successes in their campaigns to educate the public, press, and policy makers regarding online rights in a digital world, and defending those rights in the legislature and the courtroom. Their settlement with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Sony%20CD%20copy%20protection%20controversy%23Legal%20situation"&gt;Sony/BMG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the amazingly confused &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMGM%20Studios%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Grokster%2C%20Ltd."&gt;MGM v Grokster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; decision by the &lt;a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/a&gt;, and the disturbing cases surrounding Diebold have earned the advocacy organization considerable attention.

When asked if the EFF would be interested in a live interview in IRC by &lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;, the answer was a nearly immediate yes, but just a little after &lt;a href="Interview%20with%20Brazilian%20blogger%20Ricardo%20Serran%20Lobo"&gt;Ricardo Lobo&lt;/a&gt;. With two such interesting interview candidates agreeing so quickly, it was hard to say no to either so schedules were juggled to have both. By chance, the timing worked out to have the EFF interview the day before the U.S. Senate schedule hearings concerning the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABroadcast%20flag"&gt;Broadcast flag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; rule of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a form of digital rights management which the recording and movie industries have been lobbying hard for - and the EFF has been lobbying hard to prevent.

<h2>Interview questions</h2>

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] I'd like to jump into some direct questions which were suggested by people on the research page. These first ones relate to the US government and online privacy.
BULLET::::- Since 9/11 the US administration has been progressively violating privacy standards in online communications, including circumventing its own surveillance laws and developing—and possibly implementing—the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20Awareness%20Office"&gt;Total Information Awareness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; project. What is EFF's position regarding government monitoring of private communications such e-mail, instant messaging, and voice over IP?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] A related question - Will EFF be involved in cases, even as amicus, such as the cases filed by &lt;a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt; Detroit and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACenter%20for%20Constitutional%20Rights"&gt;Center for Constitutional Rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; New York, which allege the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; violated US law prohibiting wiretaps without a warrant?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] Is this in the same vein as the recent requests for Google to pony up its search database?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] Google alone of the largest search engines refused the Justice Department's demands to turn over user data. The EFF is on record as criticizing Google's privacy policy. How does the EFF feel about that privacy policy now? What does EFF feel about the other search engine's behaviour—did they comply with their own privacy policies? Does this incident reflect the strength or weakness of corporate privacy policies online?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] Does the EFF have any material or programs that seek to educate employers and companies on the advantages of privacy?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] I'd like to talk about the Sony BMG case for a bit, if that's okay. First, congratulations to EFF in regard to some of the successes in the Sony BMG case. There are some questions, clarifications about the case, however. The settlement appears to cover the XCP and SunComm software delivered on CDs. What about OpenMG XCP, DRM used by Sony BMG's SonicStage software for Sony Connect?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] Do you know if the OpenMG XCP software is mentioned at all in the agreement?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [ Wikinews] I'd appreciate that.

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- Can you disclose the terms of the settlement regarding future use of software DRM measures? Have they promised not to alter users machines in the future?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] This case also has some connection to copyright infringement&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; the XCP software included code taken from the VLC media player software, which is released under the GPL. Is EFF involved in any cases regarding this?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] Would EFF be involved in such a case if asked?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] The Sony BMG case is a content producer attempting to enforce DRM on their clients. The US FCC is trying to do the same thing on the hardware of US citizens with the Broadcast Flag. I know the EFF is involved in the lobbying on this, but I have questions which lead into this. This is a hardware issue. Does it matter on the internet?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] Isn't this already the case, considering the HDTV standard and others? Isn't standards an element of the FCCs mandate?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] Because this is a rule, not a law, how does the EFF plan to approach it in the US Congress?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] The Senate will begin hearings on this rule tomorrow. What does EFF expect to happen during this legislative process? How might this affect online communities? to get specific and personal, what does it mean to Wikinews readers and contributors?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] I understand that would be the case in the USA, but could you explain how this might affect people in the EU? or anywhere outside the USA?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] The Broadcast flag is a form of Digital Rights Management, in this case implemented by the US FCC. There are other DRM issues to talk about. In the French Parliament the DADVSI law, which relates to the implementation of the 2001 European Directive on Copyright in France, is under active consideration. Has the EFF had the opportunity to consider this law, and what is the opinion if so?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] Canada and Belgium apply heavy taxes on copying medium, and the revenues from these taxes are used to support creative artists and developers, as an alternative to supporting DRM. What does EFF feel about such a method to control fair use/fair dealing?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] There are efforts under way to develop an open standard DRM, such as a project by Sun Microsystems which is relatively fair to users. Would EFF support an open standard/open source DRM, or is the entire concept of DRM considered unacceptable in any form?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] A follow-on question from the French one&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; does eff plan to set up some chapters in Europe ?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] A follow-on question regarding the Sony BMG case&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Does EFF have a response to the Register article http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/06/eff_needs_to_die/

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] Are there any questions I should have asked you, which I did not?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Wikinews] Well, I think I'll ask MrM to unmoderate now, and let everyone mob you.
</dl>
MrMiscellanious made this room no longer moderated for normal users.

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Question] Does EFF support TOR, financially or otherwise, anymore?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Question] en.Wikipedia prevents TOR endpoints from editing on the site; does EFF consider such class-blocking an acceptable response to behavior, or is it generally inappropriate?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Question] European organisations which have similar goals like the EFF were not successful in preventing Telecommunications data retention. What conclusions does the EFF draw for their own campaigns?

</dl>

<dl>
BULLET::::- [Question] "Danny O'Brien "once successfully lobbied a cockney London pub to join Richard M. Stallman in a spontaneous demonstration of Bulgarian folk dance." Can you give details?"

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Question] Wikipedia was earlier attacked by a group, which has launched a website, claiming that Wikipedia should be upheld by law to have 100% factuality in their website (relating to an earlier case where a bogus biography was posted to Wikipedia). What is the EFF's stance on the issue?

</dl>
<dl>
BULLET::::- [Question] There is an article on de.wikipedia (German) about the hacker "Tron". His full offline name is included in the article. A German court has issued an injunction preventing the Wikipedia.de website (the website of the German Wikimedia Foundation) from linking to the de.wikipedia site, which is outside the jurisdiction of that court. What does EFF think about such extranational effects of local laws? Does a person's name, especially a figure as well known as Tron, deserve special privacy? The order was obtained based on a proposal by the deceased hacker's family. And it should be pointed out that the hacker's real name was known for a long time.

The last polls in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20election%2C%202006"&gt;Canadian election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have closed in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;BC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and so far reporting polls are indicating a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; lead, which would end a 12 year long &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Government in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

Currently all major TV news networks including CBC have projected a minority government for Harper's Conservatives with the last of BC's polls to decide just how big it will be.

Election results from reporting polls are below. Please note these include figures from those leading in polls, so these results could be subject to decreases as well.

This early election stemmed from the ruling Liberal Party government's loss in a motion of no confidence. The Liberal government has faced strong opposition from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Conservatives and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a result of an embarrassing sponsorship scandal.

&lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; have won a minority government in Canada with most stations reporting at this time. The Conservatives' win ends 12 years of a &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal government&lt;/a&gt; plagued by allegations of scandals in recent months.

Most major Canadian TV networks began to project a Conservative win at approx 3:30 a.m. UTC 
Below are the current results for polls reporting, which are still subject to frequent change. Please note this includes both officially elected and leading candidates at this time.

This ends an unusually bitter campaign, with the Conservative and Liberals both launching harsh attack commercials against each other.

In response to the defeat, former prime minister &lt;a href="Paul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; has stepped down as leader of the Liberal party.

This early election stemmed from the ruling Liberal Party government's loss in a motion of no confidence. The Liberal government has faced strong opposition from the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;NDP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABloc%20Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois"&gt;Bloc Québécois&lt;/a&gt; as a result of an embarrassing sponsorship scandal.

<h2>Maritimes</h2>
<h2>East</h2>
In Quebec, the Bloc Québécois won the great majority of seats, 51 with 42,7% of the votes, the Conservatives won 10 seats with 24,6% while the Liberals faced a wall by getting only 20,7% of the votes, which gave them 13 seats at the Parliament, down by eight from the last election. In Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier, the radio animator André Arthur was also elected as the only successful independent candidate in Canada.

<h2>West</h2>
<h3>BC</h3>

In the &lt;a href="w%3AVancouver%20Island%20North"&gt;Vancouver Island North&lt;/a&gt; riding, incumbent &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Duncan%20%28Canadian%20politician%29"&gt;John Duncan&lt;/a&gt; has been defeated by NDP member and now first time MP &lt;a href="w%3ACatherine%20J.%20Bell"&gt;Catherine Bell&lt;/a&gt;. In the previous 2004 election Bell lost by a mere 483 votes to Duncan. This could be seen as quite an upset to Duncan, who has been in power in this riding for several years and was likely to be in Stephen Harper's cabinet as he was part of Harpers shadow cabinet during the Conservatives time as opposition. Bell won this election by just 1.11%.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20Party"&gt;Australian National Party&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3AJulian%20McGauran"&gt;Julian McGauran&lt;/a&gt; left the party in order to join the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Australian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;. McGauran has made comments to the effect of stating that the Liberals have the best chance of representing regional Australia.

The Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has said that McGauran was not "poached", over suspicions in relation to an upcoming frontbench reshuffle, and the Federal Treasurer &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; welcomed McGauran's defection, with suspicion he may have orchestrated the move in order to bolster his leadership prospects. 

Many Nationals felt hurt; Victorian Nationals leader &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Ryan"&gt;Peter Ryan&lt;/a&gt; called his move the "ultimate act of treachery".

His House of Representatives brother &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20McGauran"&gt;Peter McGauran&lt;/a&gt; remains in the National Party.

Chief Warrant Officer &lt;a href="w%3ALewis%20E.%20Welshofer%20Jr."&gt;Lewis E. Welshofer Jr.&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. Army's &lt;a href="w%3A3d%20Armored%20Cavalry%20Regiment"&gt;3d Cavalry Regiment&lt;/a&gt; will not have to serve any jail time for his involvement in the death of Iraqi Maj. Gen. &lt;a href="w%3AAbed%20Hamed%20Mowhoush"&gt;Abed Hamed Mowhoush&lt;/a&gt; during an interrogation. The Iraqi general died after Welshofer shoved the general head-first into a sleeping bag, sat on him and occasionally covered the generals mouth with his hands.

On Saturday, a jury consisting of six military officers acquitted him of murder and assault charges, but found him guilty of negligent homicide and negligent dereliction of duty, charges that carry a combined maximum sentence of 3 years and 3 months. On Monday the military jurors handed down the verdict involving no prison time but imposed a $6000 fine and restricted his movements between work, worship and his barracks for 60 days.

This sentence stands in stark contrast to that of lower ranking army personal convicted for mistreatment of detainees at the Abu-Ghraib prison. Although none of the victims considered in the Abu-Ghraib cases died, the sentences handed down were significantly harsher, with former corporal &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Graner"&gt;Charles A. Graner Jr.&lt;/a&gt; serving 10 years in federal prison, former staff sergeant &lt;a href="w%3AIvan%20Frederick"&gt;Ivan L. "Chip" Frederick II&lt;/a&gt; was serving 8 1/2 years and former private first class &lt;a href="w%3ALynndie%20England"&gt;Lynndie R. England&lt;/a&gt; serving three years.

Before taking effect, the sentence must be approved by Maj. Gen. Robert W. Mixon, who cannot order a harsher sentence but may reduce it or set it aside entirely.

The Opposition has commented on the reshuffle, with Opposition Leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; stating that the Cabinet consists of "old faces" from the "uninspired to the incompetent".

A passenger train carrying at least 250 people, many of whom were children, derailed in &lt;a href="w%3ASerbia%20and%20Montenegro"&gt;Serbia-Montenegro&lt;/a&gt; and drove into a ravine Tuesday afternoon.

Close to 200 have been injured and the death toll has risen to 44. Most of the passengers were schoolchildren returning from a ski trip.

"The accident occurred because of a failure of the train's braking system," said Interior Minister Jusuf Kalomperovic.

At about 4 p.m. the four-car train derailed near Bioče, a small village nearly 15 kilometers northeast of &lt;a href="w%3APodgorica"&gt;Podgorica&lt;/a&gt; as it was emerging from a tunnel above the &lt;a href="w%3AMoraca%20River"&gt;Moraca River&lt;/a&gt;.

"The train simply went wild, out of control," said one injured passenger. "I was fine because I was in a back compartment, those in the front got the worst of it."

"It was horrible, I saw many dead and wounded around me," said another passenger from Hungary, Karman Chofu.

"I had fallen asleep when a loud noise woke me," said Stanislava Bukovic, 60, another injured passenger.

Miodrag Djurovic, the head of the main Podgorica hospital, stated that another five passengers had died overnight. Djurovic also said at least 198 people, 90 of them children, have been treated at the hospital. "The children's hospital admitted 90 children, 34 of them are still there, six have undergone surgery," Djurovic said.

Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Miroslav Ivanisevic told the media that the death toll stood at 30 and the amount injured at 135, but said those figures could rise as rescuers continue to reach victims. Ivanisevic described the wreck "as the worst rail accident in the history of Montenegro," Ivanisevic also said.

President &lt;a href="w%3AFilip%20Vujanovic"&gt;Filip Vujanovic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%2C%20Milo%20Djukanovic"&gt;Prime Minister, Milo Djukanovic&lt;/a&gt; also rushed to the site. "A terrible tragedy happened at Bioče and everything is being done to reduce the number of casualties as much as possible," Vujanovic told reporters.

Because of the accident, Montenegro's transport minister, Andrija Lompar, and National Railways chief Ranko Medenica resigned.

The driver of the train has been arrested because of suspicion of negligence.

The train was heading from the northeastern town of &lt;a href="w%3ABijelo%20Polje"&gt;Bijelo Polje&lt;/a&gt; to the Montenegrin coastal city of &lt;a href="w%3ABar"&gt;Bar&lt;/a&gt;.

The is pressing member governments to provide information concerning &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; prisons operating secretly in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.
In an interim report by the human rights council rapporteur, Swiss senator &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Marty"&gt;Dick Marty&lt;/a&gt; made public the 42-member nation's preliminary conclusions regarding CIA activity on European Union soil. 

Marty reported, "Individuals have been abducted, deprived of their liberty and transported to different destinations in Europe, to be handed over to countries in which they have suffered degrading treatment and torture." The report estimates the &lt;a href="w%3Aextraordinary%20rendition"&gt;rendition&lt;/a&gt; of "more than a hundred persons." 

But when it comes right down to it, no irrefutable evidence exists to confirm allegations that the CIA operated secret detention centers in Europe. "There is a great deal of coherent, convergent evidence pointing to the existence of a system of 'relocation' or 'outsourcing of torture'," the report stated while further noting that, "It is highly unlikely that European governments, or at least their intelligence services, were unaware."

"Our aim is to find out the truth that is being hidden from us today", he said. He adds that he is afraid of "the pressure put on the media in the United States not to report on this affair."

A researcher for &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt;, John Swift, said; "Cooperation is going to be needed if this investigation is going to succeed. European governments are at a crossroads. They can decide to cooperate with this investigation and uphold European traditions of human rights, or they can continue their romance with the CIA. But they can't do both."

The report has also been criticized for appearing to lack new content and to be incomplete. Former minister for &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; member of parliament &lt;a href="w%3ADenis%20MacShane"&gt;Denis MacShane&lt;/a&gt; has said that Marty's report "has more holes than a &lt;a href="w%3ASwiss%20cheese"&gt;Swiss cheese&lt;/a&gt;." &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;US State Department&lt;/a&gt; spokesman &lt;a href="w%3ASean%20McCormack"&gt;Sean McCormack&lt;/a&gt; has rejected the report and stated that it was an example of the "same old reports wrapped up in some new rhetoric. There's nothing new here." 

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;US Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; secretary &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chertoff"&gt;Michael Chertoff&lt;/a&gt; has stated regarding the US government that "the government acts in accordance with the law and with respect to the sovereignty of host countries in which it operates," and further stated that "The authorities are free to investigate what they want to investigate but we should not allow ourselves to be distracted from the need to identify, prevent and protect against terrorist acts of violence."

The group &lt;a href="w%3AAmnesty%20International"&gt;Amnesty International USA&lt;/a&gt; is calling for the US Congress to create a commission to investigate detention and interrogation practices. The United States neither confirms nor denies the existence of secret detention centers.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Allegations%20of%20three%20candidates%27%20drug%20ties%20resurface%20in%20Haitian%20presidential%20race&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
According to the Miami Herald, sources in the United States and in Haiti are saying that at least 2 of the potential presidents who are running in the &lt;a href="w%3AHaitian%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;upcoming Haitian elections&lt;/a&gt; have ties to the trafficking of cocaine, and 3 candidates for all positions. The Miami Herald names the 2 presidential candidates as &lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Philippe"&gt;Guy Philippe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADany%20Toussaint"&gt;Dany Toussaint&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Philippe"&gt;Guy Philippe&lt;/a&gt; is the rebel leader who participated in the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Haiti%20rebellion"&gt;2004 Haitian rebellion&lt;/a&gt; which ousted former president Aristide. Philippe has long been thought to be part of the trafficking of cocaine through Haiti, back to his days a police chief in &lt;a href="w%3ACap%20Haitien"&gt;Cap Haitien&lt;/a&gt;. Two top U.S. officials say that Philippe was once recruited to be an informant but he turned them down due to the traffickers paying him more. Philippe denies the rumors and claims that there is no evidence of his involvement in any smuggling activities. 

&lt;a href="w%3ADany%20Toussaint"&gt;Dany Toussaint&lt;/a&gt; has also long been linked to the trafficking business, dating to his time as a chief of police under Aristide's government. He has always denied the allegation.

The named last suspect is &lt;a href="w%3AYouri%20Latortue"&gt;Youri Latortue&lt;/a&gt;, a candidate for Senate in &lt;a href="w%3AGonaives"&gt;Gonaives&lt;/a&gt; which is a major drug smuggling area. Youri Latortue is also the nephew of interim Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AG%C3%A9rard%20Latortue"&gt;Gérard Latortue&lt;/a&gt; and is currently working as security chief. He is nicknamed Mr. 30 Percent due to the fact that he charges 30 percent in exchange for government contracts. The Prime Minister has defended his nephew saying that he trusts him. Youri allegedly has ties to smugglers in Gonaives who control the trafficking at the seaport.

According to the U.S. State Department, about 8 percent of cocaine manufactured in Colombia travels through Haiti before reaching the United States.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Study%3A%20Partisan%20political%20thought%20is%20predominantly%20unconscious%20and%20emotional&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A recent study led by Dr. Drew Westen, a Professor of Psychology at &lt;a href="w%3AEmory%20University"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt; has concluded that political &lt;a href="w%3Apartisans"&gt;partisans&lt;/a&gt; use an "almost entirely emotional and unconscious" thought process when digesting damaging information about a favored political candidate.

The experiment used &lt;a href="w%3AFunctional%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; scans of 30 men who self-identified as either a committed Republican or Democrat. The subjects were given a series of conflicting quotes by either President Bush or Senator Kerry, and covered such topics as the &lt;a href="w%3AEnron"&gt;Enron&lt;/a&gt; scandal and the current state of &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Security"&gt;Social Security&lt;/a&gt;. The quotes were doctored to maximize the apparent contradiction, but were presented as factual.

The results suggests that many seemingly rational political decisions are strongly influenced by unconscious emotional reactions. Such conclusions match well results from &lt;a href="w%3AAdvertising%20psychology"&gt;advertising psychology&lt;/a&gt; which say that purchases are also not as rational as people believe. Past fMRI studies have found that &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat"&gt;Democrat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; partisans tend to experience different emotions when shown an image of a preferred candidate.

Westen will present his results next month at a meetings of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in &lt;a href="w%3APalm%20Springs%2C%20CA"&gt;Palm Springs, CA&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Disney buys Pixar</h1>

&lt;a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;The Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt; has finalized a &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;7.4 billion deal to acquire its long-time partner &lt;a href="Pixar"&gt;Pixar&lt;/a&gt; in an all stock buy-out. The deal will make &lt;a href="Steve%20Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt;, current Pixar and &lt;a href="Apple%20Computer"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; CEO, Disney's largest shareholder with about 7% (valued at over $3.5 billion) and a member of the board of directors. 

The merger was speculated all day Tuesday on the stock market and the announcement came just after trading closed for the day. Terms of the merger include Pixar's &lt;a href="John%20Lasseter"&gt;John Lasseter&lt;/a&gt; becoming Disney's new chief creative officer in charge of animation at the combined Disney-Pixar Animation Studios, as well as principal creative advisor at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney%20Imagineering"&gt;Walt Disney Imagineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the unit of the company responsible for research and development of Disney theme parks worldwide.

Jobs purchased what became Pixar for $10 million in 1986 from &lt;a href="George%20Lucas"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/a&gt;'s computer animation division at Lucasfilm. ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToy%20Story"&gt;Toy Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, its first feature film, came a decade later, and began a long string of animation hits, including ♡❤Finding Nemo♡❤. Such successes proved to be increasingly elusive for Disney to manage on its own. The partnership between the two studios had become shaky in recent years, as former Disney head &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Eisner"&gt;Michael Eisner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; clashed with Jobs over the renewal terms of their agreement. In 2003, prior to his dismissal from Disney, Eisner infuriated Pixar's creative team by predicting ♡❤Finding Nemo♡❤ would be a failure. Steve Jobs broke off negotiations in January 2004, having told one executive previously, "I don't see how the relationship can continue as long as Eisner is there."

According to former employees of the &lt;a href="w%3AHalliburton"&gt;Halliburton&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary &lt;a href="w%3AKellogg%2C%20Brown%20and%20Root"&gt;KBR&lt;/a&gt; and internal company documents, coalition troops at a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; military base in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; may have been exposed to contaminated water and the company purportedly blocked efforts to alert the U.S. military.

"We exposed a base camp population (military and civilian) to a water source that was not treated," reads a July 15, 2005 memo by William Granger, KBR's official in charge of water quality in Iraq and also Kuwait.

"The level of contamination was roughly two times the normal contamination of untreated water from the Euphrates River," Granger said in documents distributed amongst the press by Democrats, who are holding a public inquiry into the allegations.

Halliburton issued a statement stating it had found "no evidence to substantiate allegations made by these former employees."

Ken May, another former KBR employee, said that instances of diarrhea and stomach cramps were numerous.

Halliburton stated that their own inspection found no contaminated water, and no medical evidence to substantiate the claims of illness. According to Marine Corps Major Tim Keefe &amp;ndash; a military spokesman &amp;ndash; a military medical unit found nothing out of the ordinary with regards to the water quality. Keefe stated, "The allegations appear not to have merit."

Water expert Ben Carter, of &lt;a href="w%3ACedar%20City%2C%20Utah"&gt;Cedar City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, wrote, "It is my opinion that the water source is without question contaminated with numerous micro-organisms, including Coliform bacteria. There is little doubt that raw sewage is routinely dumped upstream of intake much less than the required two mile distance."

Carter said that after he told company officials that they should notify the military, "They told me it was none of my concern and to keep my mouth shut," he said. 

"They brushed it under the carpet," Carter said. "I told everyone, 'Don't take showers, use bottled water.'" 

According to a July 14, 2005 report authored by Jennifer Dellinger, it is claimed that Halliburton's public relations department was aware of the problem, a statement from the department is claimed to state, "I don't want to turn it into a big issue right now, but if we end up getting some media calls I want to make sure we have all the facts so we are ready to respond."

&lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Bros.%20Entertainment"&gt;Warner Bros. Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; (a division of &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner%2C%20Inc."&gt;Time Warner, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3ACBS%20Corporation"&gt;CBS Corporation&lt;/a&gt; announced today the merger of their two struggling television networks together to form one jointly owned network which will debut this fall.

The new network, which is to be called &lt;a href="w%3ACW%20Network"&gt;CW&lt;/a&gt; (for CBS-Warner) will replace &lt;a href="w%3AUPN"&gt;UPN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20WB"&gt;The WB&lt;/a&gt; networks, which will shut down. The network will be a 50-50 partnership between CBS and Warner Brothers. The network will be carried on stations owned by the &lt;a href="w%3ATribune%20Company"&gt;Tribune Company&lt;/a&gt;, amongst others.
The merger is in response to the struggling of both networks, neither of which have attracted much viewership away from the big four networks since they being formed in the early 90s. However each have had some strengths. The WB has been more popular with younger viewers and has had hits with television shows ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASmallville%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Smallville&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AGilmore%20Girls"&gt;Gilmore Girls&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. UPN has recently received critical acclaim for its sitcom ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AEverybody%20Hates%20Chris"&gt;Everybody Hates Chris&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and World Wrestling Entertainment's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASmackdown%21"&gt;Smackdown!&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has been a mainstay since it debuted on the network. The new network's schedule will be announced in May; until then the networks will operate their schedules independently. The new network is planning to target the 18-34 age bracket in prime time, and will contain both shows from the WB and UPN.

With UPN's 12 affiliated station, together with Tribune's 16 stations gives the new network coverage over half of the country. The Tribune stations that will be apart of the new network is WGN in Chicago, WB flagship station, WPIX in New York and KTLA in Los Angeles. WPIX will become the flagship station of the new network. Tribune will relinquish its 22.5% stake in the WB in return for a 10-year affiliation agreement with the network in turn.

Dawn Ostroff, currently the president of UPN, will become president of entertainment and John Maatta, currently the chief operating officer of the WB, will become chief operating officer of the CW.

&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; is referencing the conditions of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , as justification for defending what it believes is its right under Article IV of the NPT to have nuclear technology and hold on to its developing nuclear program, despite great pressure from the West and others to abandon certain nuclear technological capabilities. Article IV defines ♡❤...the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I and II of this Treaty.♡❤

The ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ reported today that Tehran is planning a retaliation contingency against &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; should the country go forward with a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities in early March, as Ariel Sharon said may occur, before he suffered a debilitating stroke in December 2005.

General Mostafa Mohammad Najjar, Iran's minister of defense, articulated Teheran's position on any military action against Iran's nuclear capability, saying that "Zionists should know that if they do anything evil against Iran, the response of Iran's armed forces will be so firm that it will send them into eternal coma, like (Ariel) Sharon". He also proceeded to question the resolve of the United States and Israel to attack Iran on the grounds of violating international conventions concerning nuclear energy.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government says that it wants Iran to comply by discontinuing uranium enrichment in its facilities, and said Iran will be sent to the &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt; (UNSC) over this dispute if Tehran maintains its refusal to comply with the international community

Both sides are clearly determined in their position, which leads to an interesting development of &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohammad elBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IAEA), saying that the US and other nuclear powers should themselves disarm as well if they don't want to be hypocrites, ♡❤ArabicNews.com♡❤ reports. Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty states that: ♡❤Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.♡❤ The United States has signed the NPT, but Israel has not.

Another development which may foment further controversy also came Wednesday when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed the United States for a series of bombings in Ahvaz, a town near the border of Iraq, which left at least nine civilians dead. "Traces of the occupiers of Iraq is evident in the Ahvaz events. They should take responsibility in this regard," Ahmadinejad remarked to Iranian state television stations today.

<h1>New report details strain on US Army</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20report%20details%20strain%20on%20US%20Army&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A report commissioned under a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; contract to ascertain the effects of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInvasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wars on recruitment of personnel into the &lt;a href="United%20States%20of%20America"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Army has been completed. Written by a retired U.S. Army officer and executive director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Andrew Krepinevich, it was not publicly released. Upon inquiry, a copy was provided to the ♡❤&lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤

As part of the conclusions reached in the Krepinevich report, it notes a drop in Army recruiting for the year 2005, a first since 1999, which came after the Army recently adopted policies of offering increased enlistment incentives. The report states that the Army is unable to maintain troop deployment to Iraq for a period adequate to disable the insurgency occurring there, and is faced with declining recruitment and re-enlistment rates. 

In an Krepinevich interview , he said the Army remains an effective force and has plans to expand the number of available combat brigades for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. The conditions described by the report are listed as being triggered by simultaneous force restructuring, training requirements, and troop deployment requirements as well as the length of the engagement. Krepinevich also said in the interview that he believes the reason that Pentagon officials do not publicly state that the reduction in troop levels was prompted by stress on the Army; "That gives too much encouragement to the enemy."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Joulwan"&gt;George Joulwan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , former NATO commander and retired four-star general in the US Army detailed his observations in an interview given on ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ in December of 2005; "Whether they're broken or not, I think I would say if we don't change the way we're doing business, they're in danger of being fractured and broken, and I would agree with that."

Defense Secretary &lt;a href="Donald%20H.%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald H. Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;'s comments made in a news conference at the Pentagon one day after the Associated Press article was published declared that the report "is just not consistent with the facts." He continued and stated of the US Army that "The force is not broken," and that such thoughts were "almost backward." 

He supported this with the following comments "The world saw the United States military go halfway around the world in a matter of weeks, throw the Al Qaida and Taliban out of Afghanistan, in a landlocked country thousands and thousands of miles away. They saw what the United States military did in Iraq. And the message from that is not that this armed force is broken, but that this armed force is enormously capable." 

He acknowledged the unique requirements of the campaigns in Iraq and in Afghanistan with the statement that "There is no question if a country is in a conflict and we are in the global war on terror, it requires our forces to do something other than what they do in peacetime."

On the matter of the review of US defense strategy planned for February 2006, he stated that it was "the next step in a long line of bold changes." 

US &lt;a href="US%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Representative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Murtha"&gt;John Murtha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; incited controversy when he called for an early exit from Iraq in the fall of 2005, arguing in part that the US Army was "broken, worn out."

<h1>Fears about Songhua settled</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fears%20about%20Songhua%20settled&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Following an explosion in November of 2005, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASonghua"&gt;Songhua&lt;/a&gt; river was contaminated with &lt;a href="w%3ANitrobenzene"&gt;nitrobenzene&lt;/a&gt; and similar chemicals. Its clean-up by The State Environmental Protection Administration and others was covered previously on ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The State Environmental Protection Administration Minister Zhou Shengxian has said that "The water quality of the Songhua River will not exceed national standards on a large scale during the spring thaw, and fish in the river and from pounds along the banks are safe to eat." Zhou further guaranteed that livestock near the river banks and products from such livestock to be safe to eat, and that the growth of crops will not be inhibited by use of water from the Songhua River for irrigation.

Concerns of residents that the possible release of remnants of nitrobenzene that may have been trapped in the ice and in the sediment might occur and endanger the safe utilization of the river after the influence of a period of being frozen have been settled. 

Zhou said that research indicated only a small amounts of the toxic chemical within the ice and that the quantity that could be entrapped in the sediment was limited by its structure as composed mostly of sand. These characteristics and the inevitable high flow rate of the river once the winter's ice melts in the spring will allow the water to be safe said Zhou, referencing an interim assessment of the river spill done by a consortium which began the assessment on December 13 2005.

Chen Jining of &lt;a href="w%3ATsinghua%20University"&gt;Tsinghua University's&lt;/a&gt; Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, commented that "Even in the rare cases when levels are beyond standards in some places, we also have the technology in place for example, &lt;a href="w%3AActivated%20carbon"&gt;activated carbon&lt;/a&gt; to ensure safe drinking water supplies."

Zhou has also stated that the joint program with &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; to monitor boundary rivers will continue. The front of the pollution from the explosion has been predicted to reach the estuary of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmur%20river"&gt;Armur&lt;/a&gt; river in Russia near the end of January 2006.

The BBC News Website and a Civil Liberties organization are claiming that the BBC Persian website has been blocked by the government of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.

Reports indicate that the cities of Shiraz and Zahedan are unable to access bbcpersian.com. As of press time no explanation has been given for the block. The BBC said that it would approach the Iranian government to ask about getting unblocked.

Iranian internet providers routinely block pornographic and anti-Islamic websites, but they also block some pro-reform websites and blogs, sometimes permanently. This follows a history of alleged censorship - in 2004 the pro-reform ♡❤Emrooz♡❤, ♡❤Rooydad♡❤ and ♡❤Baamdad♡❤ online newspapers were reported to have been shut down or blocked often.

An international group of 73 scientists using 4 projects (&lt;a href="w%3AProbing%20Lensing%20Anomalies%20Network"&gt;PLANET&lt;/a&gt; led by Jean-Philippe Beaulieu and Martin Dominik, RoboNet led by Michael
Bode and Keith Horne, &lt;a href="w%3AOGLE"&gt;OGLE&lt;/a&gt; led by Andrzej Udalski, and &lt;a href="w%3AMOA"&gt;MOA&lt;/a&gt; led by Phil Yock) from 32 institutions in 12 countries have discovered the smallest Earth-like planet yet.

The new planet is about 25,000 light years away and is close to the center of the &lt;a href="w%3AMilky%20Way"&gt;Milky Way&lt;/a&gt;.

The discovery was announced in the journal ♡❤♡♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANature%20%28journal%29"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡♡❤. The journal also states the planet was found using a method called &lt;a href="w%3AGravitational%20microlensing"&gt;gravitational microlensing&lt;/a&gt;, which detects small planets with a mass like that of &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AGravitational%20microlensing"&gt;Gravitational microlensing&lt;/a&gt; is where a light from a distant star is bent and magnified by the gravitational field of a foreground star. The presence of a planet around the foreground star causes light from the distant star to become momentarily brighter.

However, scientists say that the cold temperatures on the planet make the chance of finding any life on it "unlikely."

"We may predict with reasonable probability that microlensing will discover planets with masses like that of Earth at a similar distance from their stars and with comparable surface temperature," said study co-author &lt;a href="w%3ABohdan%20Paczynski"&gt;Bohdan Paczynski&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="w%3APrinceton%20University"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;.

So far the planet only goes by &lt;a href="w%3AOGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb"&gt;OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb&lt;/a&gt;, and takes about ten years to orbit its parent star, a &lt;a href="w%3Ared%20dwarf"&gt;red dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, a star that is smaller and much cooler than our own &lt;a href="w%3Asun"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt;.

Scientists say the new planet, which is about five and a half times the mass of &lt;a href="w%3AEarth"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;, could either have a rocky core and a thin atmosphere, or be a small ice/gas world like &lt;a href="w%3ANeptune%20%28planet%29"&gt;Neptune&lt;/a&gt;, but in either case, its "very large orbit and cooler parent star, makes it a very cold world."

The predicted surface temperature is -220&amp;deg; Celsius (-364&amp;deg; F), which means that should it have a rocky core, the planet may more closely resemble a massive version of &lt;a href="w%3APluto"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt; with a surface of frozen liquids and gas. Otherwise the planet would be a liquid mass, wrapped in clouds of ice crystals and gas, much like &lt;a href="w%3ANeptune%20%28planet%29"&gt;Neptune&lt;/a&gt;.

"This is very exciting and important," said Professor Michael Bode from &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20John%20Moores%20University"&gt;Liverpool John Moores University&lt;/a&gt;, a principal investigator for the RoboNet project which helped to collaborate on the research. "This is the most Earth-like planet we have discovered to date, in terms of its mass and the distance from its parent star. Most of the other planets that have been discovered are either much more massive, much hotter or both."

This is the third planet in two years that scientists have found using gravitational microlensing.

In the past, more than 150 planets outside our solar system were found using a technique known as the &lt;a href="w%3Aradial%20velocity"&gt;radial velocity&lt;/a&gt; method. This method observes a wobble in stars caused by the planet's gravitational effects.

At &lt;a href="w%3AMcClellan-Palomar%20Airport"&gt;McClellan-Palomar Airport&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACarlsbad%2C%20California"&gt;Carlsbad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ACessna%20Citation"&gt;Cessna 560 twin engine jet&lt;/a&gt; skidded off the runway and burst into flames immediately after. Four people were killed in the accident.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reports that the plane had run through a barricade and fell down a 100-150 foot cliff, which left parts of the plane in a trail behind it. It then hit the side of the Carlsbad Airport Self-Storage building before it came to a stop in a twisted metal ball of flame. 

One of the victims was Janet Shafran who was the wife of Ketchum City Councilman Steven Shafran. The Union Leader, a &lt;a href="w%3AManchester%2C%20New%20Hampshire"&gt;Manchester, New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, also reports that another one of the victims was Frank H. Jellinek, Jr., of Hampton, N.H. According to the Union Leader, Jellinek was one of the state's most prominent corporate executives. Jellinek Jr. was chairman emeritus of Fisher Scientific in Hampton since Aug. 2, 2004.

By the end of the day Tuesday, the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20County"&gt;San Diego County&lt;/a&gt; Medical Examiner's office had not yet confirmed the identities of the two pilots who were also killed. They are believed to be local residents.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Ambassador to &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, David Mulford, has reportedly hinted that the U.S. civil nuclear energy pact with India may face problems getting approved by Congress if India refused to vote against &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; at the upcoming meeting of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; nuclear watchdog committee.

The nuclear pact was made after a July 2005 policy shift by U.S. President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; that offered cooperation in India's development of civilian atomic power industry in exchange for its support of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's (IAEA) nonproliferation standards.

The U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stated at a Wednesday briefing that, "The ambassador was expressing his personal opinion about what the potential political outcome might be. He was giving his personal assessment of how the Congress might react to such an action by India." McCormack added that, "We certainly would encourage and hope that they (India) vote for referral this time around."

The IAEA is scheduled to meet February 2 to discuss Iran's referral to the &lt;a href="U.N.%20Security%20Council"&gt;U.N. Security Council&lt;/a&gt; over its resumption of uranium enrichment. The U.S. claims that Iran's nuclear program is aimed at developing weapons, a claim that Tehran denies.

India's foreign ministry rejected any attempt to tie its stance on Iran to the deal with the U.S. on acquiring nuclear know-how.

India has previously supported the IAEA's declaration in September of 2005 that Iran had failed to comply with its international obligations. 

The U.S. also opposes the negotiations, begun in 1994, on a proposed gas pipeline between India and Iran which is intended to provide India with increased energy capacities.

Pop star Michael Jackson was caught by photographers dressed in women's clothing in a shopping mall in the Gulf state of &lt;a href="Bahrain"&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;. Jackson was dressed in a black ♡❤abaya♡❤ (a traditional full-length robe), a veil covering his face, dark sunglasses and gloves. Jackson was accompanied by three young, Western-looking children, their faces covered with black veils, and an adult woman wearing an ♡❤abaya♡❤ over jeans, her face partly covered, and bodyguards.

After Jackson was recognized, he reportedly said "Please, No!" and the unidentified woman asked photographers to back off. Photographers continued to take pictures while mall security guards escorted Jackson and his entourage out through a back door, where they got into a white Lexus with darkened windows. A picture published by The Australian shows an adult completely covered in black, holding the hand of a young child whose face is covered. Mall officials confirmed that it was Michael Jackson.

Jackson has been a guest of the royal family since June 2004, after he was acquitted of sexually molesting young cancer patients who visited his &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; ranch, Neverland, in 2003.

Firefighters in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; continue to battle blazes across rural Victoria which threaten up to 25 communities. Major fires of concern are near the Grampians National Park, La Trobe Valley and Gippsland.

The Grampians fire has destroyed 24 homes so far. Soaring temperatures and winds up to 50 km/h have fanned the Grampians blaze.

<h1>Hamas wins Palestinian election</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hamas%20wins%20Palestinian%20election&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

This morning, &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; leaders announced that they had an "outright majority" in the 132-seat Palestinian Legislative Council. "Hamas has won more than 70 seats in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;, which gives it more than 50 percent of the vote," said Ismail Haniyeh, a leader of Hamas.

In order for Hamas to have a majority, they needed at least 67 seats. Ismail Haniya, a senior Hamas leader, said they "expected to win at least 70 seats."

Just hours after the statement, and based on results that Hamas supplied from representatives at polling stations, Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Qurei"&gt;Ahmed Qurei&lt;/a&gt; of Fatah and his cabinet submitted their resignations. "This is the choice of the people. It should be respected. If it's true, then the president should ask Hamas to form a new government," said Qurei. "For me, personally, I sent my resignation."

Although Qurei submitted his resignation, the party has not officially conceded defeat, but do acknowledge the claim ahead of official results.

&lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; has been in control of the Palestinian government for decades now, and on Wednesday, exit polls released after the polls closed, had shown that the Fatah party had a narrow lead in the elections.

However preliminary results based on 95% of the votes cast give Hamas' Change and Reform Party 76 seats, leaving Fatah with 43 seats. The remaining 13 seats went to several minor parties and independents.

Turnout was generally high, over 70% in all regions except Jerusalem, where turnout was less than 50%. Palestine's Central Elections Commission has stated that Israeli authorities prevented electoral arrangements in Jerusalem from meeting "the required standards for free, fair and transparent elections".

Mushir al-Masri, who won the election said in regards to Israel, "negotiations with &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; are not on our agenda." He also stated, "recognizing Israel is not on the agenda either now."

Hamas also stated that it has no intentions of disarming and says, "Hamas does not plan to change even one word," in the groups charter, which calls for the destruction of the Israeli political system.

&lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt;, the current President of the Palestinian Authority, was not affected by the election results but has said that he, "might resign if unable to pursue a peace policy." Abbas has been the President of the Palestinian Authority for only a year.

Abbas is also expected to ask Hamas to form the new government.

<h3>Clashes between Hamas and Fatah Supporters</h3>

Hamas supporters raised their flag and rushed the Parliament after the news that the group won the election. 

As Fatah supporters tried to take down the green Hamas banners that were placed on the building, both groups threw rocks and broke windows in the Parliament building. Thousands of Hamas supporters cheered and whistled as the green banners were raised again. This is the first confrontation of the two groups since elections ended yesterday.

<h3>Results praised in Middle East, but US and EU are cautious</h3>

Hamas is labelled as a terrorist group by both the European Union and the United States State Department, and now will be the ruling faction of the Palestinian Authority, this creates difficulties for US and EU participation in efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The Washington Post reported last week that the US secretly channelled US$2 million
to Fatah in the final weeks of the campaign.

United States Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; repeated the US/EU call for Hamas to reject violence and recognize Israel, and reminded that the US still considers Hamas a terrorist group. Elmar Brok, a senior member of the EU Parliament, said that the EU may cut off aid to the Palestinians if Hamas institutionalizes terrorism once it takes control of the government.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking through a spokesman, stated that Britain "can only do business with people who renounce terrorism."

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was quoted as saying "It is a very, very, very bad result."

However, media and government outlets throughout the Middle East such as Iran and Lebanon, who consider Hamas to be in a defence struggle, praised the result of the elections. "The Palestinian people faithfully chose the option of resistance and are to fully support it," said Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi. And some governments such as Sweden and Japan praised the democratic system at work in Palestine. Sweden's Foreign Minister Laila Frievalds said that the elections were a "a protest against those in power who have not done enough, a reaction to the incapacity to lead the political process forward," though she stated Sweden's commitment to the EU's call for Hamas to end its violent ways if peace negotiations can continue.

Ayyoub Muhanna, 29, who owns a spare parts shop in Lebanon said; "This is a victory to all the region's free people; the Palestinians gave their vote to the party that gave of its blood."

In a move aimed to prevent fines stemming from its antitrust lawsuit filed by the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Commission"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; (EC), &lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; announced that it will be releasing portions of the &lt;a href="w%3ASource%20code"&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; operating system. 

The EC ruled in March 2004 that Microsoft had abused its position in the low-end server and media player market, and required that Microsoft "disclose complete and accurate interface documentation which would allow non-Microsoft work group servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PCs and servers". Microsoft reacted by making available 12,000 pages of technical documentation and up to 500 hours of technical support, but the EC came to the conclusion that it was not enough.

Announcing that "we are putting our most valuable intellectual property on the table so we can put technical compliance issues to rest", Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith asserted that Microsoft would be superseding the EC's requirements as a sign of good faith. "While we are confident that we are presently in full compliance with the Decision, we wish to dispel any notion that Microsoft’s technical documents are insufficient", said Smith.

The EC responded in a memo that it will study Microsoft's reply to the Statement of Objections once it receives the full details. However, EC Competition Commissioner spokesman Jonathan Todd commented that "it would be premature to conclude access to the source code would resolve the problem of the lack of compliance with our decision."

A similar offer was made by Microsoft in August 2002 during its antitrust lawsuit filed by the United States Department of Justice and several states' Attorneys General. The resulting "Microsoft Communications Protocols Program" had suffered continuous criticism regarding excessive cost, paperwork, and non-disclosure agreements. It is unclear at this time if Microsoft's planned "Work Group Server Protocol Program" will suffer from the same issues if accepted by the EC.

Microsoft is expected to return to the EC courts in April.

According to a report in the &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%20Post"&gt;♡❤Bangkok Post♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; government's Public Relations Department is considering blocking the website of Manager Online as a possible instigator of "social chaos".

The report claims that a document was submitted to the Communications Authority of Thailand urging a block be issued against the site as the current calls for participation in anti-government rallies by outspoken government critic &lt;a href="w%3ASondhi%20Limthongkul"&gt;Sondhi Limthongkul&lt;/a&gt; may be a threat to social order.

Other reports claim that CAT Telecom cut off a live satellite broadcast by Sondi on the ASTV satellite network on Tuesday evening during a discussion related to a planned anti-government rally on February 4.

&lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada's&lt;/a&gt; next Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;, said that Canada will be deploying three new armed icebreaking ships to patrol the Arctic passage and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters. Harper also said Canada will be establishing an underwater network of "listening posts" in the Arctic waters. 

"The United States defends its sovereignty; the Canadian government will defend our sovereignty," Harper said. "It is the Canadian people that we get our mandate from, not the ambassador of the United States."

Harper was responding to comments by the U.S. Ambassador, David Wilkins, who said yesterday; "We don't recognize Canada's claims to those waters. Most other countries do not recognize their claim."

The &lt;a href="w%3Anorthwest%20passage"&gt;arctic passage&lt;/a&gt; is melting and commercial ships are able to cut 2,480 miles in distance off of the trip from Europe to Asia when compared to using the &lt;a href="w%3APanama%20Canal"&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition to the icebreakers, Harper announced a $1.7 billion deep-water port.

Firefighters in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; have received a mixed blessing overnight as storms crossed the state.

The Anakie fire in the state's west received a fair amount of rain helping firefighters to contain the fire.

The Kinglake fire North-East of Melbourne also received rain, but helped firefighters very little.

The large Grampians fire in the state's west and the fire at Moondarra in the Gippsland region did not receive any rain. The storms did however spark two spot fires alongside the Grampians fire.

<h1>Saudis boycott Danish dairy produce</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Saudis%20boycott%20Danish%20dairy%20produce&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On January 26, 2006, a massive boycott of dairy produce from started in &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; over what is perceived as a &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; attack on Muslim values. The Saudi ambassador to Denmark has been recalled for consultations.

The Danish/&lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; dairy company Arla is facing a massive loss after a spreading boycott of its produce in Saudi Arabia. Four Saudi retail chains have already removed Arla products from the shelves. One retail chain has placed yellow warning tape (common fare for accidents and crime scenes) over Arla products. There have been cases reported of Arla delivery trucks being attacked by stones thrown from bystanders. Marianne Castenskiold, a senior consultant for &lt;a href="w%3ADansk%20Industri"&gt;Dansk Industri&lt;/a&gt;, expressed a fear that the boycott will spread to other countries in the region and have detrimental effects on other Danish products. Denmark is one of the leading exporters of agriculture in northern Europe, whose economy is heavily dependent on foreign trade and investment.

The boycott has been announced at Friday prayer services in Saudi mosques since January 20, 2006, obviously helping to foment popular support of the nation's response to Denmark's alleged ignorance of Muslim values. On at least one occasion, a delivery truck has been greeted by thrown stones. 

<h3>Background</h3>
The boycott is a response to the publication of an article in a major Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten. In its September 30, 2005 issue, the paper printed 12 drawings of the Muslim prophet &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammed"&gt;Muhammed&lt;/a&gt;, as a response to previous news reports that the publisher of a forthcoming childrens' book about the prophet had had difficulty in finding an illustrator, due to fear of extremist reactions; drawings of the prophet are prohibited by Islamic Law (see &lt;a href="w%3Aaniconism"&gt;aniconism&lt;/a&gt;). In an attempt to start a debate over freedom of speech in Denmark, the newspaper printed 12 drawings of the prophet. Four of these were of a satirical nature, with one showing the prophet with a turban hiding a lit bomb.

The immediate reactions to the publication of the drawings included ambassadors from 12 Muslim countries demanding that the Danish Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAnders%20Fogh%20Rasmussen"&gt;Anders Fogh Rasmussen&lt;/a&gt;, denounce the newspaper. Rasmussen rejected this demand, stating that "Danish freedom of speech does not allow the government to control what newspapers print". He further noted that the only possible legal action against the newspaper would be one under the charge of blasphemy.

A debate ensued over the following months about freedom of speech and its value in relation to avoiding religious taboos. In mid-December 2005, a delegation from several Danish Muslim organizations went on a tour in several Middle-Eastern and Arabic countries, reportedly to gain sympathy for their point of view. Several reports state that during the tour the difficulties faced by Muslims in Denmark were grossly overstated.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Motors"&gt;General Motors Corporation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (GM) has posted its first annual loss since 1992. GM reported losing &lt;a href="US%24"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;4.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a total loss of $8.6 billion for the entire year.

GM admitted Thursday night that the loss could swell further as it pays pensions and healthcare costs to thousands of former workers. GM warned that the amount calculated for last year is preliminary and could rise before it is officially reported to the US securities and exchanges commission in March.

The loss was far greater than analysts predicted. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFord%20Motor%20Company"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the second of the big three American car manufacturers, beat predictions earlier in the week. In contrast, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToyota%20Motor%20Corporation"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is expected to report that it will beat last year's profit of $11 billion. 

GM's automotive division lost $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by losses in North America. This has been attributed to GM's shrinking market share, which has been taken by Japanese manufacturers &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToyota"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANissan"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

A further $1.3 billion was lost in restructuring charges. As part of the restructure, GM plans to cut 30,000 jobs and close 12 facilities by 2008.

An aide for Kirk Kerkorian, GMs largest individual investor (at 9.9%), has called on the company to halve its $1.1 billion annual dividend, cut executive pay and sell &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASaab"&gt;Saab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h1>Queensland's biggest oil spill in 35 years</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Queensland%27s%20biggest%20oil%20spill%20in%2035%20years&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A oil spill in &lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has been described as a tragedy for the area's marine life and the biggest oil spill in 35 years. The clean-up is expected to take up to a week and cost more than AU$3 million.

The spill occurred in &lt;a href="w%3AGladstone%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Gladstone&lt;/a&gt; Harbour on the central Queensland coast, late on Tuesday night, after 25,000 litres of heavy fuel poured from a coal carrier. The accident happened when a &lt;a href="w%3Atug"&gt;tug&lt;/a&gt; rammed into a Korean coal carrier, rupturing its fuel tank. 

Several government agencies and four skimmer vessels were called in after the "Tom Tough" struck the Korean-owned, Panamanian-registered bulk coal carrier "Global Peace" - puncturing its fuel tank as it was about to berth.

"It'll just annihilate the stocks plus everything up and down the food chain in relation to what the different fishermen catch," local fishing spokesman Warwick Sheldon said. "It's right in the middle of the commercial banana prawn fishing season at the moment – this has the potential to just wipe out their stocks."

Queensland Premier &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Beattie"&gt;Peter Beattie&lt;/a&gt; said an investigation was under way to determine whether anyone would be prosecuted. "There will be no cost to the taxpayer because of the law," he said. The clean-up costs will be met by the ship's owners in accordance with &lt;a href="w%3AAdmiralty%20law"&gt;international maritime law&lt;/a&gt;.

The Wildlife Protection Association of Australia (WPAA) says the spill inside the harbour occurred in the worst place possible. "It's probably the worst place that we could ever have a spill because it's inside the harbour," said WPAA president Pat O'Brien. "It's an area where there's a whole range of animals there that'll be affected by it. There's dugongs and porpoises and animals like that, that breathe air, that come to the surface regularly. Turtles again too, they'll finish up with oil all over them."

It is the worst oil spill in Queensland since the Oceanic Grandeur ran aground in the &lt;a href="w%3ATorres%20Strait"&gt;Torres Strait&lt;/a&gt; in 1970 and the second spill in Gladstone's Harbour within a week. About a tonne of oil spilled in the harbour last week.

A marine investigator from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating the incident. Investigation leader Peter Foley says the type of oil involved has added to problem. "It's certainly more difficult to control than perhaps crude oil because it tends to be around the same specific gravity or same density as sea water," he said.

<h1>West Papuans refugees forced to fly 4000ks despite tuberculosis fears</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=West%20Papuans%20refugees%20forced%20to%20fly%204000ks%20despite%20tuberculosis%20fears&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

West Papuan asylum seekers, who arrived in Australia last week, were forced to make a 4000 kilometre journey to Christmas Island despite suspicions they had tuberculosis. The West Papuans were flown to Christmas Island on an RAAF Hercules last week.

Two of the group, a man and his child, have now been flown the 2,600 kilometres to Perth, Western Australia from the remote Indian Ocean island. Air force personnel had initially refused to fly them, concerned that the flight crew's health would be at risk.

"It's a complete farce, absurd" said one health official. "It has not only posed an unnecessary health risk, it has been hideously expensive." 

The West Papuans were among a group of 43 refugees found last week on the far north-west coast of Cape York in Queensland. They had made a five-day journey from the Indonesian province in an outrigger canoe. They arrived with banners accusing Indonesia's military in the province ruled by Jakarta of genocide and intimidation. Their 25m traditional boat was fitted with an outboard motor and was flying the outlawed West Papuan flag. 

Amid media scrutiny and the disapproval of the Indonesian government, the boat people underwent health checks before being sent to Christmas Island. X-rays and other medical examinations strongly indicated that at least one man had tuberculosis, yet the group were flown to Australia's Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre. 

Upon landing at the Island, health officials recommended the patients be transferred to Perth. However, the crew of the RAAF Hercules refused to take them, saying they were not "adequately equipped".

A Department of Immigration spokesman (DIMIA) said an alternative flight was arranged. "At this stage there has been no positive diagnosis for tuberculosis," the spokesman said.

The removal of the asylum seekers to Christmas Island has been met with fierce criticism from many refugee rights groups and opposition parties, who say it was impractical, potentially traumatising and hugely expensive. The Immigration Department says it has interviewed most of the asylum seekers but won't say if they have made formal asylum claims.

<h3>Criticism</h3>
 &lt;span style="display:none"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Rallies in Sydney, Melbourne, Darwin, Canberra and Brisbane were held this week, in support of the West Papuan asylum seekers. Refugee rights advocates protested the forced transfer to the remote Christmas Island facility. 

Melbourne auxiliary bishop Hilton Deakin told about 130 people demonstrating outside DIMIA headquarters in Melbourne that, "we know that already the Indonesian authorities, in Canberra and beyond, are trying to get to them."

Yet the he Indonesian embassy in Canberra denied making any approach, saying: "I can guarantee that there has been no contact whatsoever, it hadn't been requested, it was never even sought."

But the Immigration Department has confirmed that "a junior delegation" from the embassy went to Weipa last Thursday seeking access to the asylum seekers. A spokesman for the Immigration Department said the Indonesians arrived in Weipa on Thursday but by then the Papuans had already been put on a plane for Christmas Island. The West Papuans were told they had a right to Indonesian consular assistance if they choose. "Not one has chosen to do so," the spokesman said.

"The majority of these 43 people are leaders for free expression and self-determination and possible independence because of the oppression from which they suffer," Bishop Deakin said. "Massacres, rapes and all the rest of it have gone on in that country for almost 30 years."

He called on the Australian Government to cancel its training program with the Indonesian military.

Democrats leader Lyn Allison said the Australian Government had "got it wrong on this issue". The 43 asylum seekers had been "whisked off" before they could tell their story, she said.

Greens Senator Kerry Nettle has called on the government to grant access to Papuan asylum seekers. The senator says they should not be in detention and they certainly should be allowed to communicate with the outside world. 

Senator Nettle will go to Christmas Island this weekend to meet the imprisoned West Papuans. She said the immigration department is obligated under the Migration Act to allow her to meet them.

<h3>New Zealand Support</h3>

Meanwhile New Zealand Greens have offered to take the asylum seekers. "New Zealand can show the Howard government how to be compassionate, as we did back in 2001 when we took some Afghan asylum seekers from the Tampa," the New Zealand Green Party Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Keith Locke says.

"It is shocking that the West Papuan refugees, having survived 450 kilometres of open water in a flimsy craft, are now bundled off to a Christmas Island detention camp - well out of range of those Australians who wish to help them," he said. 

"Under refugee law these Papuans deserve special consideration, having come directly from their claimed country of persecution, Indonesia, not via a third country, as is the case with most asylum seekers in this part of the world.

"The Papuans certain have a good prima facie case. I know from my own visit to West Papua last April that there is substantial and ongoing harassment of the local people, particularly those who assert their right to political self-determination," said Mr Locke. 

On Friday last week Indonesian security forces shot dead one Papuan protester, and wounded two others, in the Paniai district, where the 43 asylum seekers originate.

<h1>Aboriginal Sovereignty Day Declared</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Aboriginal%20Sovereignty%20Day%20Declared&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Representatives of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian_Aboriginal_Sovereignty"&gt;Australian Aboriginal Sovereign Nations&lt;/a&gt; at a gathering in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;, have declared that the 26th of January would be known as Aboriginal Sovereignty Day. January 26th &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20%20Day"&gt;(Australia Day)&lt;/a&gt; is Australia's official national day - commemorating the landing of the First Fleet in Sydney Cove in 1788.

While the rest of the country celebrated the Australia Day holiday with medals, barbecues, fireworks and beer under the Union Jack and Southern Cross, hundreds of people at the &lt;a href="w%3AAboriginal_Tent_Embassy"&gt;Aboriginal Tent Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in Canberra lit a ceremonial fire and discussed the land that once belonged to their ancestors. 

&lt;a href="w%3AIndigenous_Australians"&gt;Indigeneous Elders&lt;/a&gt; have gathered this week at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy for the Corroboree for Sovereignty convergence, in response to what they say is the continual Government threat to control the historical Tent Embassy site.

The gathering identified the 34-year-old Tent Embassy on the grounds of &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Parliament%20House"&gt;Old Parliament House&lt;/a&gt; in Canberra, as a significant place of social, spiritual and political importance to Aboriginal Peoples - a symbol of the assertion of Aboriginal Sovereignty. The Aboriginal Embassy, not considered an official embassy by the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment_of_Australia"&gt;Australian government&lt;/a&gt;, has come under review recently in a bid to remove the campsite and dwellings originally founded on Australia Day in 1972.

The Tent Embassy calls on all Aboriginal Sovereign Nations to "stand up against the illegal occupation of our country and continue to resist the oppression of our people." The Tent Embassy say that "until there is true justice for our people, these issues will not go away and we will continue to resist."

Members of the Embassy will take a sacred fire to Melbourne in March for the 2006 "Stolenwealth Games" campaign, in an effort to highlight the plight of Aboriginal people. The fire will contain a "message of peace, healing and justice, and create a focal point for unfinished business."

The group calls on all Aboriginal Nations to send representatives to the Embassy to commemorate and review the issues of Land Rights in Australia. The Tent Embassy also announced the establishment of the National Tribal Law Council.

The High Court of Australia has on a number of occasions rejected any actual legal notion of Aboriginal sovereignty.

<h3>"Invasion Day"</h3>
Indigenous leaders, including Marji Thorpe, &lt;a href="w%3AGary_Foley"&gt;Gary Foley&lt;/a&gt;, Robbie Thorpe and Michael Mansell claim that &lt;a href="w%3ANative_Title"&gt;Native Title&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AReconciliation_Australia"&gt;Reconciliation&lt;/a&gt; haven't adequately addressed Indigenous rights. They say: "Native Title has mainly embroiled Indigenous peoples in complex legal processes where they have (generally unsuccessfully) had to prove their fundamental human rights to the land."

The campaigners, known as the Black GST, say the process "puts the onus on Indigenous peoples to somehow prove continuous connection with their land, an impossible task in many situations given the effects of our dispossession and attempted genocide."

On Australia Day the diverse and vibrant group marched peacefully through Canberra, gathered at the Embassy on the lawns in front of Old Parliament House and called for recognition of indigenous sovereignty over the land.

"We're wanting to let all the people know that all the land in Australia has been given back to the Aboriginal people... and the sovereignty now lies with all Aboriginal nations," a spokesperson Robert Corowa said at the Embassy. 

To many Indigenous and Non-Indigenous people, Australia Day is labelled "Invasion Day" - in recognition of the colonisation of the continent by the British, he said. "We call it invasion day. The most important thing is that everybody in Australia who's now living here... we strongly encourage them to come to the Aboriginal Tent Embassy and place a leaf in our fire."
Legal director of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre (TAC), Michael Mansell, says the current Australia Day celebrations should be scrapped and a new national day chosen. Mansell said Australia Day would forever remain a racist blot on Australia's political landscape as long as the event was held on the anniversary of the landing of the First Fleet.

"There can never be reconciliation between whites and Aborigines so long as the anniversary of the coming of white people is the basis for celebrating Australia Day," he said. "A fair and just society cannot be built on celebrating gains by one race at the expense of another."

Mr Mansell has also reported the theft of an Aboriginal sign from the TAC premises. The sign reading: "♡❤AUSTRALIA DAY Yes, let’s celebrate: MURDER, INVASION, RAPE, THEFT♡❤" was removed on the 25th of January hours after being installed on the Launceston premises.

Mansell says that he will replace the sign in an effort to "the obvious need to expose the myth, as expressed in the national anthem, that Australia is a free and fair country" and called for "white society" to punish the offenders.

"This is another instance of the continuing trend in Tasmania of racist attacks on both people and property by extreme elements of white society who don't like the truth, who don't like Aborigines and other races. As with the racial attacks on middle Eastern people in Sydney, these Tasmanian incidents show how Australia under the Howard government is becoming more openly xenophobic," he said.

<h3>Flag Burning</h3>
Activists in Brisbane yesterday burned an Australian flag to protest against celebrations marking European settlement in Australia. Around 300 protesters staged an "Invasion Day" demonstration. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie condemned the action.

"I don't care whether they're black or white ... I don't believe we should burn the Australian flag, particularly at this time (when) we all know we live in an unsettled world," he said. 

One protester said he believed the wrong flag had been burned: "I just felt deep down that it should have been the British flag they burnt not the Australian one."

<h3>Compulsory National Anthem</h3>

The Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre has strongly opposed the compulsory singing of the Australian national anthem in schools. 

NSW Premier Morris Iemma wants to make it compulsory for NSW schoolchildren to sing the national anthem each day before class. The plan has strong support from both sides of Parliament in Tasmania as well as the Multicultural Council of Australia and the Australian National Flag Association.

However some Aboriginal support groups say forcing the singing of the national anthem diminishes individual enthusiasm for participation. 

Michael Mansell says, "more importantly, the anthem is about the white people and immigrants and excludes Aborigines." He said the words "for we are young and free" were a clear reference to the last 200 years of colonisation by Europeans and dismissed the ownership of the country by Aboriginal people.

A large and dangerous fire has broken out on &lt;a href="w%3ATable%20Mountain"&gt;Table Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.

Dry and windy conditions have swept the fire around the base of the mountain, pushing it towards the bordering suburbs in the City Bowl and &lt;a href="w%3AVredehoek%2C%20Cape%20Town"&gt;Vredehoek&lt;/a&gt; area with furious flames reaching ten meters into the air.

A number of houses along the border of the reserve are being threatened as the fire heads around the mountain from the cable car station towards the southern suburbs.
Thick smoke and high winds are hindering fire-fighting efforts and causing havoc with the traffic around the area. Heynes helicopters, contracted to fight fires on the mountain, are assisting from the air. However since the main water reservoirs near the Vredehoek area are shrouded in smoke and water must be retrieved from the harbour instead.

So far one elderly woman has reportedly died due to &lt;a href="w%3Asmoke%20inhalation"&gt;smoke inhalation&lt;/a&gt; and many others may be at risk as they attempt to defend their homes. Firefighters have been attempting to bring the situation under control throughout the night but the blaze continues unabated.

The cause of the fire is still uncertain. However a 36-year-old &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; man has been placed under arrest for allegedly dropping a lit cigarette whilst on the mountain.

Fires in the area are an annual problem and may threaten to destroy the delicate indigenous &lt;a href="w%3Afynbos"&gt;fynbos&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem. Opinions about the effects of the fires on the mountain vary, however, with some specialists indicating that regular fires could cause permanent damage to the ecosystem whilst others believe that the fynbos is actually partially reliant on the heat of the fire to set off the shedding of seeds.

In previous years the area around and &lt;a href="w%3AFishhoek"&gt;Fishhoek&lt;/a&gt; have been ravaged by fires of similar intensity. The scars of those fires still remain.

Former German president &lt;a href="w%3AJohannes%20Rau"&gt;Johannes Rau&lt;/a&gt; has died on Friday morning in his home in Berlin at the age of 75, his office announced. Rau had been president of Germany from 1999 till 2004. He had a heart disease for a long time and had to undergo twice a surgery after leaving office. He is survived by his wife and their three children.

Rau was born on January 16, 1931 in &lt;a href="w%3AWuppertal"&gt;Wuppertal&lt;/a&gt;. He first joined the ♡❤Gesamtdeutsche Volkspartei♡❤ in 1952. After the party had been dissolved, he followed his political mentor &lt;a href="w%3AGustav%20Heinemann"&gt;Gustav Heinemann&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany"&gt;Social Democratic Party of Germany&lt;/a&gt; (SPD). He was elected member of the state legislature of &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Rhine-Westphalia"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; in 1958 and became governor of the state in 1978. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the chancellorship in 1987. He resigned as governor in 1998 when his party promised to nominate him for the presidential elections. During his presidency, Rau became the first German head of state to speak in the Israeli &lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Tributes</h3>
His successor, president &lt;a href="w%3AHorst%20K%C3%B6hler"&gt;Horst Köhler&lt;/a&gt;, ordered that a state funeral for Rau be held on February 7. He said Germany "has lost a distinctive politician, a great president and a man who made the world more humane."

Chancellor &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Merkel"&gt;Angela Merkel&lt;/a&gt; said Germany "has lost an exceptional personality".

The governor of North Rhine-Westphalia, &lt;a href="w%3AJ%C3%BCrgen%20R%C3%BCttgers"&gt;Jürgen Rüttgers&lt;/a&gt;, called Rau a "great governor" to whom the state and its people owe a great deal. 

SPD chair &lt;a href="w%3AMatthias%20Platzeck"&gt;Matthias Platzeck&lt;/a&gt; said the Social Democrats lost "an irreplaceable friend, who was one of the most outstanding and popular politicians of our country. [...] We will miss him."

Israeli president &lt;a href="w%3AMoshe%20Katsav"&gt;Moshe Katsav&lt;/a&gt; called Rau a "great friend of the Jewish people and of the state of Israel".

The latest poll from Finnish newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AHelsingin%20Sanomat"&gt;Helsingin Sanomat&lt;/a&gt; in co-operation with Gallup puts the two remaining candidates - incumbent president &lt;a href="w%3ATarja%20Halonen"&gt;Tarja Halonen&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;) and former minister of finance &lt;a href="w%3ASauli%20Niinist%C3%B6"&gt;Sauli Niinistö&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20Party"&gt;Coalition Party&lt;/a&gt;) - in a dead heat, heading into the second and final round of the Finnish presidential election on Sunday. 51% of the respondents supported Halonen, while 49% supported Niinistö. The result is within the margin of error at 3%. Approximately 24% of those questioned refused to state who they will vote for. 

Previous polls had given Halonen - who received about 46% of the votes in the first election nearly two weeks ago against runner-up Niinistö's 24% - a larger lead, though the movement is within the margin of error. In a poll conducted by Finnish TV channel MTV3 on Tuesday Halonen and Niinistö were supported by 55% and 45% of the respondents, respectively.

The Finnish presidential elections are completed in at most two rounds. If no candidate receives a majority of the votes in the first round, the two top candidates compete in a run-off election two weeks later.

A major earthquake occurred at 1:58AM Saturday off the coast of &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;. It originated from the &lt;a href="w%3ABanda%20Sea"&gt;Banda Sea&lt;/a&gt;, roughly 195 kilometers from &lt;a href="w%3AAmbon%20City"&gt;Ambon City&lt;/a&gt;. The earthquake measured 7.7 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter%20Scale"&gt;Richter Scale&lt;/a&gt; and occurred at a depth of about 341 kilometers said the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;.

The quake sent people running for their lives as fears mounted that the quake might have caused a massive &lt;a href="w%3Atsunami"&gt;tsunami&lt;/a&gt;.

But good news came as the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; said in an e-mail advisory, "this earthquake is located outside the Pacific. No destructive tsunami threat exists in the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt; or elsewhere based on historical earthquake and tsunami data."

No deaths or major injuries have been reported as of yet.

In December of 2004, a major earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 struck just off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a major tsunami, killing nearly 300,000 people and leaving millions more homeless.

Earthquakes frequently take place in the area due to it being positioned on a volcanically active region referred to as the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Ring%20of%20Fire"&gt;The Ring of Fire&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AO%27Reilly%20Media"&gt;O'Reilly Media&lt;/a&gt; is opening up editing of its books through Safari Books Online, the company's joint venture with the Pearson Technology Group. 

The company is allowing ordinary people to buy access to&lt;a href="w%3A%20manuscripts"&gt;manuscripts&lt;/a&gt; before they are finalized.

Customers are given access to software to that allows them to make notes on the manuscripts, to expose errors, or make suggestions.

The project is intended to improve the content, find technical errors and make sure that examples make sense and are relevant, rather than proofreading. The service is similar to the ordinary nightly builds of open source software projects. 

The manuscripts will be updated as the author and editor make changes.

A beta version of the service, named ♡❤Rough Cuts♡❤, has four books available and O'Reilly intends to add up to eight more in the first quarter of 2006.

Customers get an "evolving manuscript", a manuscript that hasn't "been fully edited, subjected to final technical review, or formatted for print." 

The books will become available between two to six months prior to the intended publication date.

Yesterday saw the inauguration of a new president of &lt;a href="Honduras"&gt;Honduras&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATegucigalpa"&gt;Tegucigalpa&lt;/a&gt;, the nation's capital. &lt;a href="w%3AManuel%20Zelaya"&gt;Manuel Zelaya&lt;/a&gt;, a former bank director and congressman, defeated &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Honduras"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href="w%3APorifirio%20Pepe%20Lobo"&gt;Porifirio Lobo Sosa&lt;/a&gt; in a hotly contested presidential election in November 2005. His &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Honduras"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, however, still remains the de facto minority in Honduras, since the National Party shares an alliance with the &lt;a href="w%3AChristian%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Honduras"&gt;Christian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;.

Zelaya replaces former President &lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Maduro"&gt;Ricardo Maduro&lt;/a&gt;, who served one term in office from 2002-2006. He inherits a nation that is dealing with serious issues concerning crime and poverty. Maduro established himself as a hardliner towards gang violence in Honduras, most notably regarding the highly dangerous &lt;a href="w%3AMara%20Salvatrucha"&gt;Mara Salvatrucha gang&lt;/a&gt;. While he did a great deal to crack down on violence in his term, he also drew sharp criticisms from human rights groups for his methods, which did not include the use of rehabiliation programs. 

Zelaya and the Liberals promised such reforms, but he also promised to double the Honduran police force during his tenure, as well as create 400,000 jobs between now and 2010, when his term expires. He has also stated his support for a new free trade agreement with the United States, in addition to planning new policies to improve agriculture production, still the primary export of the Honduran economy.

Mr. Zelaya served as a national congressman from 1985 to 1998, and was instrumental in implementing the so-called "Open counties program" which increased decision-making powers of municipalities, a plan he says will grow further during his administration. He has been known as a wealthy landowner who carried himself with a sort of bravado both in Congress and on the campaign trail, often dressed in cowboy boots and Stetson hats. He has also worked in engineering, in addition to his successful careers in agriculture and politics.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) approved the use of an inhalable form of &lt;a href="w%3AInsulin"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; for treating both forms of &lt;a href="w%3ADiabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in adults. The product, manufactured by &lt;a href="w%3APfizer%20Inc."&gt;Pfizer Inc.&lt;/a&gt; is called &lt;a href="w%3AExubera"&gt;Exubera&lt;/a&gt; and is a inhaled powder form of &lt;a href="w%3ARecombinant%20DNA"&gt;recombinant&lt;/a&gt; short-acting human insulin (rDNA). 

Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that, when released into the blood, controls the upper limits of glucose presence in the bloodstream. Diabetics cannot produce (enough) insulin on their own, and have to control their blood sugars by appropriate diet, exercise and medication. Untreated Diabetes can have a serious adverse effect on health, it can lead to higher risk of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, retinal damage and diabetic shock, which can be fatal. Insulin has been used for the treatment of diabetes for many years now, but some patients find it difficult (and costly) to use as it has to be injected into the body, usually several times a day. Currently, about five million Americans take insulin injections. Also, the use of any form of insulin can cause blood sugar to drop below safe levels, a condition called &lt;a href="w%3AHypoglycemia"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the use of insulin must be accompanied by a careful and regular monitoring of blood sugar levels.

The FDA has issued guidelines that the inhalable form should not be used by smokers, patients with asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema as tests have shown that its use can reduce the &lt;a href="w%3Avital%20capacity"&gt;breathing capacity&lt;/a&gt; of the lungs. Other side effects associated with Exubera therapy seen in clinical trials included cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, and dry mouth. The FDA has given its approval on the basis of safety studies of short-term use and studies of its effects over long-term use are underway. 

Pfizer has said the product wouldn't be widely available until June or July and that exact prices haven't been set. A Pfizer spokesperson has said that the price will be "competitive" to injected insulin.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Defense Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged in a document called the "&lt;a href="w%3AInformation%20Operations%20Roadmap"&gt;Information Operations Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;" that the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon's&lt;/a&gt; information packages meant for foreign consumption are often "consumed by our domestic audience."

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Security%20Archives"&gt;National Security Archives&lt;/a&gt;, a private non-profit research group obtained the document through a &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt; request and made it public this month.

"Secretary Rumsfeld's road map says the American people can't be protected from the Pentagon's &lt;a href="w%3APsychological%20operations"&gt;psychological operations&lt;/a&gt; abroad but it doesn't matter as long as he's not targeting the American public. It's the collateral damage theory of propaganda," said the director of the National Security Archive at &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Washington%20University"&gt;George Washington University&lt;/a&gt;, Thomas Blanton.

The role of PSYOP, according to the document itself, is an effort by the military to "convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence the emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals."

Pentagon spokesman &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Di%20Rita"&gt;Lawrence Di Rita&lt;/a&gt; said the Pentagon was not comfortable with propaganda "bleeding back" from overseas to the United States. "We're not OK with it," Di Rita said. "First of all, we're not lying. We're talking about truthful, accurate information, so that's baloney." Di Rita said.

The document said that "psyops," are restricted by policy and executive order from targeting US audiences, US military personnel and news agencies and outlets. "However, information intended for foreign audiences, including public diplomacy and PSYOP, increasingly is consumed by our domestic audience and vice-versa."

"Information Operations Roadmap" said in part: "The increasing ability of people in most parts of the globe to access international information sources makes targeting particular audiences more difficult. Today the distinction between foreign and domestic audiences becomes more a question of USG (U.S. government) intent rather than information dissemination practices." 

Information used in psychological operations "will often be replayed by the news media for much larger audiences, including the American public...The likelihood that PSYOP messages will be replayed to a much broader audience, including the American public, requires specific boundaries be established," the document stated.

After seven weeks in the &lt;a href="Southern%20Ocean"&gt;Southern Ocean&lt;/a&gt; disrupting the &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese &lt;a href="whaling"&gt;whaling&lt;/a&gt; fleet, a &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; registered anti-whaling ship, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFarley%20Mowat"&gt;Farley Mowat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has been detained by &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n authorities.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASea%20Shepherd%20Conservation%20Society"&gt;Sea Shepherd Conservation Society vessel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , its captain &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Watson"&gt;Paul Watson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and his crew, have been detained indefinitely. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20African%20Maritime%20Safety%20Authority"&gt;South African Maritime Safety Authority&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (SAMSA) have placed a guard on the gangplank and are patrolling the ship. 

The Farley Mowat, which sailed from Melbourne, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on December 6, was detained in Cape Town harbour, following a request from the Canadian government. A SAMSA official said the ship did not have the required certification.

"They don't have the right certificates for the skipper, the first-mate or the chief engineer," an official said. According to SAMSA, the detention adheres to Canadian maritime laws and followed correspondence from Canada, who requested that the authorities check the ship. 

According to Scoop Independent, the ship and crew have been detained due to the &lt;a href="International%20Maritime%20Organization"&gt;International Maritime Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s ISPS Code. Under Canadian maritime law, both the captain and first officer should be Canadian nationals. Captain Paul Watson is Canadian, First Officer Alex Cornelissen is Dutch. 

SAMSA claims that the Farley Mowat was ♡❤not in possession of an international ship security certificate or a ship security plan♡❤. 

This means the ship allegedly does not comply with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Ship%20and%20Port%20Facility%20Security%20Code"&gt;International Ship and Port Facility Security Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ISPS Code) &amp;mdash; a comprehensive set of measures to enhance the security of ships and port facilities. The code was developed in response to the perceived maritime threats to ships and port facilities in the wake of the &lt;a href="9/11%20attacks"&gt;9/11 attacks&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

The official said the detention was in line with Canadian maritime laws and followed correspondence from Canada requesting the authorities check the ship.

However, Captain Paul Watson says political pressure from Japan is behind the detention of the boat. He says he does not have the necessary documentation required by officials as the boat is registered as a yacht and not a commercial vessel.

<h2>Confrontation on the High Seas</h2>

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhaling%20in%20Japan"&gt;Japanese whalers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are currently in the Antarctic catching whales for the &lt;a href="Institute%20of%20Cetacean%20Research"&gt;Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research&lt;/a&gt; (ICR)'s JARPA II lethal research program - a practice condemned internationally by anti-whaling nations. After samples have been taken, the remaining whale meat is sold as a delicacy. 

During the last six weeks in Antarctica, the Farley Mowat has intercepted the Japanese whaling fleet, chasing the whalers over 4,000 miles. Sea Shepherd say the whalers spent 15 days running from them, and that "no whales were killed as the fleet attempted to put as much distance between the whalers and whale defenders as possible." 

During one confrontation the Farley Mowat crew claim it sideswiped the Japanese whaling fleet supply vessel Oriental Bluebird and ordered it to leave from the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.
Sea Shepherd Conservation Society say they will return to Antarctica in December 2006 with a faster long-range vessel. "We discovered that when we can catch them, we could stop their whaling activities. If we can secure a faster ship we will be able to shut them down completely. We will be making every effort to secure a faster ship so that we can return and intervene more effectively against their illegal killing operations," said Captain Paul Watson.

Institute of Cetacean Research in Tokyo councilor Dan Goodman say that Australia, New Zealand, and other anti-whaling nations should support Japan's commitment to its scientific research. 

Japan announced at last year's meeting of the &lt;a href="International%20Whaling%20Commission"&gt;International Whaling Commission&lt;/a&gt; (IWC) this summer its JARPA II program that includes the killing of 935 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinke%20Whale"&gt;Minke whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and 10 endangered &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFin%20whale"&gt;Fin whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

In 2007-08, Japan will raise its self-imposed kill quotas to include 935 Minke whales, 50 fin whales, and 50 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHumpback%20Whale"&gt;Humpbacks whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Mr. Goodman said Japan had to kill the whales because certain kinds of data – including how old whale populations are, how old whales are when they reach sexual maturity, how long whales live for, and what they eat – cannot be obtained using non-lethal methods.

"These are the kinds of data required to improve management measures for the resumption of commercial whaling," Mr. Goodman said. "Of course the anti-whaling scientists don't believe this kind of data is required because they do not want to see a resumption of commercial whaling."

Dr Gales, head of Australia's delegation to the scientific committee for the IWC, said after years of research the Japanese should have concluded by now that piked (minke) whales eat krill. "They're asking for support for science that has no support," he said.

Next year, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society say they intend to return to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in Antarctica to do some research of their own; "We need to research more effective law enforcement measures to shut down this criminal operation that is posing as a research project," said Captain Watson.

<h1>Australia's million-dollar-a-month Nauru detention centre for two refugees</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australia%27s%20million-dollar-a-month%20Nauru%20detention%20centre%20for%20two%20refugees&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The cost of maintaining the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Government's &lt;a href="w%3ANauru%20detention%20centre"&gt;refugee detention centre&lt;/a&gt; on the tiny island republic of &lt;a href="w%3ANauru"&gt;Nauru&lt;/a&gt; is now estimated at AUD1 million per month. The centre is currently home to just two &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href="w%3ARefugee"&gt;asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt; who were found to be refugees, but refused protection by &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Immigration"&gt;Australian Immigration&lt;/a&gt; after receiving an adverse security assessment from the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Organisation"&gt;Australian security agency&lt;/a&gt;, ASIO.

Immigration officials say the Nauru camps are being maintained in a state of readiness, complete with dozens of staff, in case they are needed for future asylum-seekers. The "million dollar a month" figure is more than six times the official estimate given after the last big group of asylum seekers left the island late last year.

The group of 25 asylum seekers were accepted by Australia after nearly five years detained on the island. The decision to release the group followed a September visit to Nauru by former immigration minister John Hodges with mental-health experts, who said that "the precarious mental health of many of the detainees required urgent attention." The delegates said some men were being constantly monitored for suicide risk or self-harm.

The last two asylum seekers on Nauru say they are hitting rock bottom - after their friends were granted refugee and humanitarian visas. Both men say they are beyond the point of despair, insisting that they cannot understand why they received adverse security assessments. 

"Sometimes I feel that we are a piece of rubbish that everyone is trying to get rid of," Mohammed Sagar told Melbourne's &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Age"&gt;Age&lt;/a&gt; newspaper. "We feel we are caught in the middle of a situation. It is too much to bear," said Mr Sagar, who insists neither he nor Mohammad Faisal are security risks. 

"We strongly reject the finding and we believe it is unfair and unjustified. I have not said or done anything to cause harm in any way to an individual, let alone a whole country."

Mr Sagar said there was no longer an interpreter at the facility and this accentuated the men's problems. The pair are also concerned that they will lose other support, including access to a psychiatrist, when responsibility for the centre shifts from the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Organisation%20for%20Migration"&gt;International Organisation for Migration&lt;/a&gt; (IOM) to Australian and Nauru authorities in March.

"I feel I am very alone on this very tiny piece of land in the middle of the sea," Mohammed Sagar, 29, said in November. Mohammad Faisal, 25, said: "My only option now is just to keep going with medication and sit alone inside my room and cry."

<h3>Accusations</h3>
Faisal and Sagar say they had been been accused of not being co-operative in interviews with an ASIO officer in January, a charge they emphatically denied. "I am wondering why those officers didn't mention earlier that I haven't been co-operative," wrote Sagar. "Why they waited four months to tell me this. I feel it is a psychological war. And they waited all this time just to put me under mental pressure."

They had reportedly made "anti-Western" and "anti-Australian" comments during an interview with ASIO officers. 

"I've never expected that I would some day get such an accusation thrown on me, because it's terrible," said Mr Sagar. "I have never been in a police station, for a small fight even. How come to be a security threat for a whole country? It's terrible. I can't imagine it, even. I'm living in limbo. To think there is a possibility, even 1 per cent, to get a rejection, makes me feel very, very bad," he said.

Mr Faisal says he has a problem with his eyes which he believes could be treated in Australia. "I am enduring all this just to get freedom and be treated as a human being. If I didn't have a problem, I would go back (to Iraq) and would not endure this terrible situation here. I don't want human rights to be given to me. I want animal rights."

<h3>Million-dollar-a-month</h3>
This week a &lt;a href="w%3ADIMIA"&gt;DIMIA&lt;/a&gt; spokesman said "preliminary estimates" of the cost of maintaining the Nauru facilities in a contingency state were "around $1 million a month". The spokesman said the cost of maintaining the centre was not affected by the presence of the two men. 

Australian Democrats Senator &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Bartlett"&gt;Andrew Bartlett&lt;/a&gt; said the cost was absurd. He said it was crucial that the two men on Nauru not be forgotten: "They can't just be left in limbo."

Critics say there are no grounds for maintaining the facility, bearing in mind the &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas%20Island"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt; immigration facility with a capacity for over 200 people — and is currently building a AUD300 million 800-bed centre there.

The Howard government has negotiated with Nauru and &lt;a href="w%3APapua%20New%20Guinea"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; for the detention camps to remain in operation, and has indicated that it will re-activate the two camps if people smuggling resumes. Prime Minister John Howard hails the use of offshore detention as an "outstanding success" 

<h3>Appeal</h3>
Senator Bartlett said the pair should be allowed to appeal against the findings to the &lt;a href="w%3AAdministrative%20Appeals%20Tribunal"&gt;Administrative Appeals Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, like those who received adverse security clearances on Australian soil. "It's obviously not tenable to keep two people stuck on an island in the middle of the Pacific on their own," he said. Labor immigration spokesman Tony Burke said: "Nauru should be shut down. It's a waste of money, and it's appalling to leave these two languishing."

An Immigration Department spokesman said officials were working closely with the Nauruan Government "to find a resolution to the situation".

Mr Sagar said he had suffered from depression and frustration over the past four years, but it was much harder now. "We had friends we could talk to to pass the time," he said. "Now I feel as if time has stopped." He expressed gratitude to Australians who had written letters of support. 

Among those expressing concern is Mohammad al-Zirjawi, who was freed in August said, "they will go crazy in the camp alone." Mr Zirjawi suffers from depression, but says he is trying to make a fresh start.

Refugee advocate Marion Le says the ordeal has been a shockingly long period of detention for those on Nauru. She said, "it's been in my opinion an unmitigated disaster."

The Immigration Department said in November that the Government was working to resolve the cases of the two final Nauru asylum seekers.

The roof of a trade hall in &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolian%20Katowice"&gt;Metropolian Katowice&lt;/a&gt; (district &lt;a href="w%3AChorz%C3%B3w"&gt;Chorzów&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKatowice"&gt;Katowice&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; has collapsed. Officials said there are at least 67 fatalities and at least 160 people were injured. More than 125 people are still believed to be trapped inside the building. 

"Luckily nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene, as people tried to break windows in order to get out. People were hitting the panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable. One of the panes finally broke, and they started to get out by the window," said survivor Franciszek Kowal.

Victims have been transported to hospitals in the mining area.

The trade hall was holding a pigeon exhibition &lt;a href="http%3A//www.golab.mtk.katowice.pl/en_index.php"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the collapse is believed to have been caused by large amounts of snow on the roof. At least 500 people were believed to be inside when the roof collapsed.

Jaroslaw Wojtasik a spokeman for the Katowice fire brigade said, "the weight of snow likely caused the roof to cave in at about 5:30 p.m., less than two hours before the event was scheduled to close for the evening."

"From our crisis centres, we have found there are about 20 fatalities. We don't know if foreigners are among them," said Andrzej Gąska, spokesman for the regional police department.

Rescuers are concerned that people trapped may die from hypothermia due to the freezing temperatures (currently about -15 degrees Celsius in &lt;a href="w%3AChorz%C3%B3w"&gt;Chorzów&lt;/a&gt; ).

People standing outisde the building were helping rescuers and those that were injured into emergency vehicles.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Tunnel%20under%20U.S.-Mexico%20border%20trafficked%20in%20people%2C%20drugs&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The combined efforts by agents from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Border Patrol have led to the discovery of a 2,400-foot (732 metre) tunnel between the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. 

An investigation into a suspected drug smuggling operation in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; yielded tips which led to the discovery Tuesday by Mexican authorities of the nearly half mile long passage. The tunnel opens to the surface inside a small warehouse on the Mexican side of the border near the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATijuana"&gt;Tijuana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; airport. On the U.S. side, it surfaces inside a huge 48,222-square-foot (4480 m) warehouse at Otay Mesa, a town located near a &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia%20State%20Route%20905"&gt;border checkpoint&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ABaja%20California%20Peninsula"&gt;Baja area&lt;/a&gt; of California.

Bales of &lt;a href="w%3AMarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; weighing nearly 2-tons were seized by Mexican agents from that side of the tunnel, while U.S. agents confiscated 200 pounds (91Kg) at the other end. There are no reports of arrests.

On Wednesday, a second tunnel was discovered this month in the San Diego area when a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle got stuck in a &lt;a href="w%3ASinkhole"&gt;sinkhole&lt;/a&gt;. The ground collapsed from the weight of the vehicle. The crude and shallow tunnel was found in an unfinished condition near the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Ysidro%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20California"&gt;San Ysidro&lt;/a&gt; border crossing. It originated from a vacant lot in Tijuana, and is the 21st tunnel to be found over the last four years.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military documents indicate that the U.S. Army has taken and incarcerated wives of suspected enemy fighters for "leveraging" purposes against their husbands; but Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a U.S. command spokesman, said only &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i women who pose an "imperative threat" are being held.

A U.S. intelligence officer claimed that, in one instance, the young mother of a nursing baby was locked up and in another case, one American colonel suggested to another colonel that they lure the husband of a kidnapped wife by putting a note on the family's door telling him "to come get his wife."

Female detentions by coalition forces have become more of an issue since kidnappers seized American journalist Jill Carroll and demanded that all Iraqi women detainees be freed.

Thursday the U.S. military did free five women. All of the released women had been accused of "aiding terrorists or planting explosives," but an Iraqi government commission found there was insufficient evidence to continue holding them.

Hind al-Salehi, an Iraqi human rights activist, claims that U.S. units sometimes detained wives to pressure men into turning themselves in.

Busho Ibrahim Ali, Iraq's deputy justice minister, denied Ali's claims and said hostage-holding was a tactic used under the regime of Saddam Hussein and that "we are not Saddam." 

However, newly released &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; documents said; "During the pre-operation brief it was recommended by TF personnel that if the wife were present, she be detained and held in order to leverage the primary target's surrender," wrote a 14-year veteran intelligence officer. The intelligence officer said he objected, but that when they raided the house a senior sergeant, who was the team leader, seized her anyway.

"The 28-year-old woman had three young children at the house, one being as young as six months and still nursing," the intelligence officer wrote.

In the released documents most names and signatures are blacked out.

In a second e-mail, a staff officer asked another officer, "What are you guys doing to try to get the husband — have you tacked a note on the door and challenged him to come get his wife?"

The deputy commander of the brigade advised his higher command two days later, "As each day goes by, I get more input that these gals have some info and/or will result in getting the husband. These ladies fought back extremely hard during the original detention. They have shown indications of deceit and misinformation."

The reply was, "CG wants the husband."(CG meaning commanding general).

Johnson said this indicated justification for the detention of the woman, "It is clear the unit believed the females detained had substantial knowledge of insurgent activity and warranted being held."

John Patrick Ford, the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; prisoner who testified at &lt;a href="w%3ASchapelle%20Corby"&gt;Schapelle Corby’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; drug trafficking trial, has been convicted of 11 charges relating to the rape and assault of a woman.

Ford’s trial was postponed to allow him to travel to Bali in the custody of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; officers to testify that he had overheard a jailhouse confession. Ford alleged he had heard another prisoner claim ownership of the &lt;a href="w%3Amarijuana"&gt;marijuana&lt;/a&gt; found in Corby’s possession. He told the Balinese court that Corby was the victim of an Australian domestic inter-airport drug-smuggling operation. She is currently serving a 20-year prison term after being convicted in that case. 

In December 2005, a County Court jury convicted Ford of 11 charges, including rape, intentionally causing injury, threatening to inflict serious injury, false imprisonment, aggravated burglary, burglary, making threats to kill and stalking, but a suppression order issued by the court prevented publication of the convictions until the pre-sentencing hearing on Friday, January 27, 2006. 

Ford’s lawyer, Tom Danos, told the hearing that Corby had written to Ford thanking him for risking his own welfare by agreeing to testify. Danos urged the court to be lenient in sentencing Ford, claiming that his victim had effectively forgiven him for his crimes and that he deserved a lighter sentence for co-operating with authorities investigating the Corby case.

Ford has been attacked twice in jail since testifying at Corby’s Bali trial. Since returning from Bali in March, 2005, Ford has remained in &lt;a href="w%3Asolitary%20confinement"&gt;protective custody&lt;/a&gt;, to prevent further attacks. Danos claimed that this would make any jail sentence particularly difficult for his client.

County Court Judge Margaret Rizkalla adjourned the pre-sentencing hearing to a date yet to be set.

Throughout China and the world's &lt;a href="w%3AChinatowns"&gt;Chinatowns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADragon"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; dancers danced and &lt;a href="w%3Afireworks"&gt;fireworks&lt;/a&gt; went off to mark the arrival of the new year. 

In the &lt;a href="w%3AChinese%20lunar%20calendar"&gt;Chinese lunar calendar&lt;/a&gt;, the Chinese Year of the Dog ends on February 17, 2007, making it 385 days long, or 13 months. The last time a Chinese year was this long was in &lt;a href="w%3A1944"&gt;1944&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Rural%20Fire%20Service"&gt;New South Wales Rural Fire Service&lt;/a&gt; officers called to extinguish a small bushfire in the Tomerong State Forest, about 210 kilometers south of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, discovered two oil drums containing burning body parts.

The firefighters called nearby &lt;a href="w%3ANowra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Nowra&lt;/a&gt; police who established several crime scenes in the area. It is believed the drums contained the remains of two people who police believe lived in the area.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Police"&gt;NSW Police&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASuperintendent%20%28police%29"&gt;Superintendent&lt;/a&gt; Kyle Stewart told the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; that officers were confronted with an horrific scene. "[It was a] fairly horrific scene, the two bodies were on fire at the time, or the barrels in which they were located, were on fire when the RFS responded and certainly that doesn't add to the pleasantness of the situation," he said.

A 27-year-old man and a 36-year-old woman have presented themselves to police. Police say they are assisting detectives with their inquiries.

&lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;♡❤ABC News♡❤&lt;/a&gt; anchorman and his camera operator Doug Vogt have been seriously injured in an explosion. Early reports indicate that both men sustained head injuries in the blast.

Woodruff was evacuated to the Balad Airbase, 68 kilometers north of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; and is currently undergoing surgery. "Bob and Doug are in serious condition and are being treated at a U.S. military hospital in Iraq," ABC said in a statement. 

Reports say Woodruff was taping a report inside an Iraqi mechanized military vehicle near Taji, Iraq when the vehicle ran over and detonated an &lt;a href="w%3AImprovised%20explosive%20device"&gt;improvised explosive device&lt;/a&gt;. ABC also reports that exchanges of small arms fire took place shortly after the explosion. &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;♡❤MSNBC♡❤&lt;/a&gt; reports that Woodruff and Vogt were wearing body armor and helmets when the explosion occurred, measures that may turn out to have saved their lives. The &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated_Press"&gt;♡❤Associated Press♡❤&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that the two men were standing in the hatch of the vehicle at the time of the explosion, and that no other people were injured.

Woodruff and Vogt had been embedded with the 4th Infantry Division that was accompanying an Iraqi Army unit.

ABC also said that both Woodruff and Vogt were wearing body armor and helmets.

The U.S. military headquarters in Baghdad has confirmed the attack took place. However, no further information has been made available.

Vogt, a 46-year-old &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, is an &lt;a href="w%3AEmmy"&gt;Emmy&lt;/a&gt;-award winning cameraman for ABC News with 25 years of experience.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3ACommittee%20to%20Protect%20Journalists"&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists&lt;/a&gt;, 61 journalists have been killed in the line of duty in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003.

Woodruff became the permanent co-anchor of ABC's ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20News%20Tonight"&gt;World News Tonight&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, with &lt;a href="w%3AElizabeth%20Vargas"&gt;Elizabeth Vargas&lt;/a&gt; on January 3, 2006, replacing the late &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Jennings"&gt;Peter Jennings&lt;/a&gt;.

Today an uncommon snow storm covered much of &lt;a href="Portugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;. Apart from mountainous regions, snow is usually a rare vision in this south European country because flat terrain and a Mediterranean climate. However, January 2006 saw a cold wave sweeping across Europe, and since early morning snow fell in seaside towns like &lt;a href="w%3AFigueira%20da%20Foz"&gt;Figueira da Foz&lt;/a&gt;, in central Portugal, and the storm reached record south locations such as &lt;a href="w%3AAlgarve"&gt;Algarve&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3ALisbon"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;, the Portuguese capital, received snow for the first time in 52 years. Other towns with a record snowfall were &lt;a href="w%3ALeiria"&gt;Leiria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASantar%C3%A9m%2C%20Portugal"&gt;Santarém&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A%C3%89vora"&gt;Évora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASet%C3%BAbal"&gt;Setúbal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APortalegre"&gt;Portalegre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASesimbra"&gt;Sesimbra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APalmela"&gt;Palmela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AF%C3%A1tima%2C%20Portugal"&gt;Fátima&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APombal"&gt;Pombal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAbrantes"&gt;Abrantes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATorres%20Novas"&gt;Torres Novas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AOur%C3%A9m"&gt;Ourém&lt;/a&gt;.

Highways and roads were closed in much of central and south Portugal. In Montejunto, one hundred people were evacuated from their vehicles. The storm caused electricity to be cut in &lt;a href="w%3AElvas"&gt;Elvas&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of the &lt;a href="w%3AAlentejo"&gt;Alentejo&lt;/a&gt; region. A number of car accidents and fallen trees were reported to have only resulted in minor injuries. In Lisbon, the city government demanded subway stations to remain open overnight, so that homeless people could find shelter.

At 1500 GMT, phone companies saw a record level of calls and text messages due to surprised people contacting and warning each other.

Edits by &lt;a href="w%3AMassachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; congressman &lt;a href="w%3AMarty%20Meehan"&gt;Marty Meehan's&lt;/a&gt; staff on his &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; article spurred a &lt;a href="w%3ALowell%20Sun"&gt;Lowell Sun&lt;/a&gt; story and a subsequent Wikipedia investigation of all Internet addresses assigned to the &lt;a href="w%3ACongress%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;Congress of the United States&lt;/a&gt;.
While edits from the Capitol are not generally news, the biographical article for Mr. Meehan was carefully edited, removing negative comments while expanding with content from the congressman's political flyer. The &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; which made these edits has an extensive editing history on Wikipedia, and has been repeatedly blocked in past months for article vandalism and violation of Wikipedia policies (&lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DSpecial%3ALog/block%26amp%3Bpage%3DUser%3A143.231.249.141"&gt;Wikipedia's log of 143.231.249.141 being blocked from editing&lt;/a&gt;).

Wikipedia administrators, alerted to the Marty Meehan article edits, realized that many edits to politically-sensitive articles had been made from IP addresses assigned to the US Capitol building, and have begun an investigation into all edits from such addresses.

<h2>Editing history</h2>
<h3>Editing from U.S. House computers</h3>
At the center of the investigation are edits by the IP address &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3A143.231.249.141"&gt;143.231.249.141&lt;/a&gt;, which is the proxy through which most of the U.S. House Internet traffic passes. Jon Brandt, spokesman for the Committee on House Administration confirmed House ownership of the IP &lt;a href="http%3A//www.thetranscript.com/headlines/ci_3452611"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. An aide for Rep. Meehan made two edits to the article on Meehan's biography. &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DMarty_Meehan%26amp%3Bdiff%3D19100228%26amp%3Boldid%3D17926016"&gt;The first&lt;/a&gt; was on July 18, 2005 and replaced the article with his official biography, which was biased towards Meehan. &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DMarty_Meehan%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D32874128"&gt;A later edit&lt;/a&gt; on December 27, 2005 removed text referring to Mr. Meehan's pledge to only run four terms, or 8 years.

The text that was removed said "He also ran on a platform of &lt;a href="w%3Aterm%20limits"&gt;term limits&lt;/a&gt;. However, after serving four terms as US Congressman, the number of terms he pledged that he and no other congressman should serve out, he has since gone back on his word and now is adamently [sic] against the idea of term limits for Congressmen." 

The text was replaced with: "His fiscally responsible voting record since then has earned him praise from citizen watchdog groups."

Congressman Meehan has served seven terms as Representative of his home state of Massachusetts.

Most of the edits from Capitol Hill IPs have not been harmful edits. Many edits have been made which were neutral, correcting factual, spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. A sampling of both positive and harmful edits to politically-related articles are included here. 

The communications director for Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Wilson%20%28U.S.%20politician%29"&gt;Joe Wilson&lt;/a&gt; took a different approach to editing Rep. Wilson's article. She contacted Wikipedia founder &lt;a href="w%3AJimbo%20Wales"&gt;Jimbo Wales&lt;/a&gt;, who advised that she supply a biography on the Wikipedia article's discussion page, rather than edit the article directly, for other Wikipedia editors to check and to incorporate into the article itself. After she added the official bio to Wilson's discussion page, Wikipedia editors used it and several other sources to expand the article substantially.

<h4>Further investigation</h4>

Following the reports of the edits from the House IP address, a so-called ♡❤checkuser♡❤ (a check of confidential information to determine the accounts used by staffers coming from that IP) was performed to determine what users logged-in with an account edited from the House IP address, and the edits made by all of those users were checked as well. They all showed little bias and no vandalism. &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DWikipedia%3ARequests_for_CheckUser%26amp%3Boldid%3D37773415%23143.231.249.141_.28talk_.E2.80.A2_contribs_.E2.80.A2_page_moves_.E2.80.A2_block_user_.E2.80.A2_block_log.29"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h3>Editing from Senate computers</h3>
Unlike the U.S. House, computers from the U.S. Senate are assigned individual IP addresses. To identify possible vandals, the edit history for all senators was checked, and a list of 25 addresses was extracted. While some had good faith edits, others showed unacceptable behaviour.

The entire 156.33.x.x netblock is for Senate use only &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch%3Fip%3D156.33.148.107"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h2>Wikimedia Foundation and Wikipedia response</h2>
The attention of Wikipedia administrators was drawn to the pattern of edits to Wikipedia articles by Congressional staffers at 18:47 on January 29. In response, Wikipedia administrators began a systematic examination of all edits to articles made from IP addresses that have been assigned for use by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.

Administrators found several places where edits from U.S. Senate IP addresses had been to articles on Senators.

Following online discussions using IRC, Wikipedia administrator &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AFireFox"&gt;FireFox&lt;/a&gt; blocked the U.S. House of Representatives' Wikipedia editing privileges for one week while the issue is discussed. The block was lifted shortly thereafter by a dissenting admin. &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DSpecial%3ALog%26amp%3Btype%3Dblock%26amp%3Bpage%3DUser%253A143.231.249.141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

While the Wikimedia Foundation has not yet issued a statement regarding this, Jimmy Wales was quoted by the AP discouraging the removal of facts. "You don't delete it," Wales said. "If they wanted to put in their side of things, that would seem ethically relevant, rather than just omitting it."

A man and a woman have been charged with the murders of two people whose bodies were found burning in oil drums in the Tomerong State Forest, about 210 kilometers south of &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday.

The bodies were found by &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales%20Rural%20Fire%20Service"&gt;New South Wales Rural Fire Service&lt;/a&gt; officers who were called to extinguish a small bushfire. The firefighters notified the local &lt;a href="w%3ANowra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Nowra&lt;/a&gt; police who established several crime scenes in the area. The crime scenes are believed to include an area surrounding a burnt out vehicle believed to belong to the victims, a house where the murders are thought to have occurred, and areas in the State Forest.

27-year-old Stacey Lea-Caton voluntarily attended Nowra Police Station and told officers he had witnessed a man and woman being tied up in a house in Nowra and he feared they were about to be murdered by another man and woman.

Police then attended a property in Calymea Street, Nowra, where 36-year-old Kim Leanne Snibson agreed to accompany them to the station for questioning. 

Lea-Caton and Snibson have both been charged with two counts of murder and faced Nowra Local Court today.

&lt;a href="w%3AMagistrate"&gt;Magistrate&lt;/a&gt; Doug Dick issued a suppression order on the identities of the victims, but refused Snibson’s request for a suppression order on her identity to protect her children who attend a local school, saying the court processes must be transparent.

Lea-Caton appeared briefly in the court dock but Snibson refused and remained in the cells.

They did not apply for bail and both were remanded into custody to appear in court on April 10.

<h1>Steve Kubby, co-author of California Proposition 215, grows dangerously ill in US custody</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Steve%20Kubby%2C%20co-author%20of%20California%20Proposition%20215%2C%20grows%20dangerously%20ill%20in%20US%20custody&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Kubby"&gt;Steve Kubby&lt;/a&gt; who was facing extradition from &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, returned to &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested, and is now in custody in Placer County, California Jail, pending a hearing today. He is a medical cannabis patient who relies on the drug to regulate the symptoms of malignant &lt;a href="w%3Aphenochromocytoma"&gt;phenochromocytoma&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer of the adrenal gland which can cause the level of adrenaline in his system to fluctuate out of control. If left unregulated, this can result in sudden, fatal heart attack, stroke, pneumonia, and a variety of other conditions.

Kubby was arrested on arrival at San Francisco International Airport Thursday night on behalf of the Placer County Sheriff's Department, having exhausted his extradition appeals in Canada. He was taken to San Mateo County Jail, pending transport to Placer County Jail. While at San Mateo County Jail, he was reportedly denied access to medication and sufficient bedding. On arrival at Placer County Jail, his blood pressure was dangerously high, and so was given &lt;a href="w%3AMarinol"&gt;Marinol&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ATHC"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; synthetic.

Communication with Kubby is highly restricted. According to his wife, Michele, Kubby has been placed in solitary confinement, denied access several times to sufficient bedding to keep him warm, and denied access to the cannabis which, according to several experts on his universally fatal condition, has been solely responsible for keeping him alive for decades. The Marinol he is being given partially mitigates his symptoms, but does not completely control them. He now grows dangerously ill.

In particular, he relates how he was ordered by prison medical staff to take beta-blockers for his blood-pressure. Due to the episodic nature of the adrenaline spikes causing the high blood-pressure, according to all of his doctors, the beta-blockers would likely kill him once the spikes dropped. In an interview by phone with journalist Pat McCartney over the weekend, Kubby reported that, for refusing the beta-blockers, he was coerced into signing a waiver absolving the prison of liability, and has since been refused all care, including even &lt;a href="w%3ATylenol"&gt;Tylenol&lt;/a&gt; for pain management. 

Activists concerned with medical marijuana, human rights and prison reform will hold a rally at noon today in front of the Placer County Superior Courthouse, where Steve Kubby is scheduled to be arraigned on violation of probation charges.

Kubby was a co-author of California's &lt;a href="w%3AProposition%20215"&gt;Compassionate Use Act of 1996&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Proposition 215. He fled to Canada in 2001 to escape the possibility of incarceration for an extended period without access to cannabis, a possibility which, in both his and expert medical opinion, would certainly prove fatal.

Blitzer pressed al-Zahar who then stated that the blue lines on the &lt;a href="w%3AFlag%20of%20Israel"&gt;Israeli flag&lt;/a&gt; represent the two rivers.
Al-Zahar said that the new &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; state would include &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASinai%20Peninsula"&gt;Sinai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; and part of &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and that the Knesset lays out the expansion plan. He went on to challenge Blitzer to ask Israeli leaders about the matter.

When the topic turned to whether Hamas has the goal of destroying Israel, the Hamas leader said that it was Israel who has atomic weapons so it is more likely that Palestine would be destroyed than Israel.

In a reaction to the ongoing controversy over the September publication of cartoons by the &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten"&gt;Jyllands-Posten&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, gunmen from the &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; assaulted a &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU) office in the Gaza Strip on Monday, prompting Denmark to warn citizens to avoid travel to Saudi Arabia.

The Danish newspaper issued an apology to Arab countries later Monday through Petra, a Jordanian news agency, for publishing the series of 12 cartoon depictions of the prophet &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Mohammad&lt;/a&gt;, some of which characterized him as a sort of terrorist.

The EU office was assaulted in an ordeal that lasted approximately 30 minutes. No one was reported injured and no shots were fired. The gunmen, a group of approximately 15 masked men armed with anti-tank launchers, automatic weapons, and hand grenades, burst into the office of the international observers and then withdrew several minutes later, remaining outside to keep the offices closed.

The gunmen demanded apologies from both Denmark and from Norway, where the cartoons were republished this month, threatening that citizens of those countries would be prevented from entering the Gaza Strip.

Refugee rights advocates and Australian Parliamentarians on &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas%20Island"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt; have expressed alarm at the &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20of%20Indonesia"&gt;Indonesian Government's&lt;/a&gt; direct request to Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; for the return of 43 Papuan &lt;a href="w%3Aasylum%20seekers"&gt;asylum seekers&lt;/a&gt;, who arrived on &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20York%20Peninsula"&gt;Cape York&lt;/a&gt; by boat on January 18th. Rob Wesley-Smith from ♡❤Australians for a Free West Papua♡❤ said the asylum seekers escaped because their lives were threatened, and would certainly face death if forced to return. 

Indonesian President &lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt; has assured Mr Howard that the group will not be prosecuted if they are returned.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Papua"&gt;West Papuan&lt;/a&gt; asylum seekers are currently being detained in an &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20immigration%20detention%20facilities"&gt;Australian Immigration Detention Centre&lt;/a&gt; on the remote Christmas Island, 2,600 kilometres off Perth, Western Australia. The group claims &lt;a href="w%3Agenocide"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of the Indonesian Government.

The Federal government flew the 36 adults and seven children to Christmas Island, where the families were put into immigration department housing and the single men in the detention centre.

Rob Wesley-Smith says the asylum seekers should be dealt with according to Australian law. 

"The people have escaped... because their lives are at risk," he said. "Their fathers have been killed, one of them was in jail for a number of years himself, and this is the reality of the situation in West Papua - so no way should they go back - they'd be killed."

Supporters of the "West Papuan 43" say that the West Papuans "are entitled to the support of community groups and their fellow country people. They should also have easy access to translators, medical care and independent legal assistance."

The Indonesia Human Rights Committee has called on the Government to plea for the immediate release of the asylum seekers into the Australian community, and for their claims to be processed fairly and as expeditiously as possible.

Immigration Minister Senator &lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt; said it was not always possible to keep women and children out of detention.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Green%20Party"&gt;New Zealand Green Party&lt;/a&gt; has called for some of the asylum seekers to be processed in New Zealand.

<h2>Case for asylum</h2>

Mr Wesley-Smith says they have legitimate claims for refugee status. "There's evidence that some have been mistreated and tortured and they're a cohesive group and strongly politically motivated, and that there is no way that they would be seen as a group to be sent back - that that's just a preliminary assessment," he said.

The 43 asylum seekers told of graphic, disturbing accounts of beatings and torture by Indonesian military, during interviews with Immigration officers over the past week.

According to The Melbourne Age newspaper, an Immigration source said the refugees had a "very strong case" for refugee status. "Some of what has come out of the interviews has been absolutely heart-wrenching," the source said. The group described accounts of vicious bashings while in prison and attacks on villages and livestock in retaliation for the Papuans agitating for independence. 

Despite human rights organisations and academic reports, detailing thousands of deaths and even "genocide", Indonesia says "abuses no longer occur in West Papua." 

Under the control of the Indonesian military an estimated 100,000 West Papuans have lost their lives over the last four decades. Two days after the West Papuan refugees arrived in Australia, Indonesian troops opened fire in the Paniai district, killing a 13-year-old and wounding two others.

West Papuan leaders and academics say that the indigenous people may be wiped out because of new threats such as an HIV/Aids epidemic and the unchecked environmental devastation caused the exploitation of forestry and mineral resources.

<h2>Australian government responses</h2>

The Australian government have yet to make a decision on the asylum seekers, the general affairs counsellor of the Australian Embassy said in Jakarta.

"There is no decision yet, not at all," Elizabeth O'Neill said. She said verification and interviews by Australian authorities were "standard procedure" and valid for anybody arriving in the country without official documents. The process, she said, was in line with United Nations Conventions and Australian laws.

She said the two governments have had good relations since the &lt;a href="w%3A2002%20Bali%20bombing"&gt;Bali bombing in October 2002&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3A2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake"&gt;tsunami in December 2004&lt;/a&gt;. Reports in Jakarta media say John Howard has given assurance to Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono that the handling of the West Papuan group, who's territory is under Indonesian authority, would not disturb the relation between the two countries.

"Prime Minister Howard has even reiterated his support that Papua is part of the Indonesian sovereignty, and promised to have close communication both at the high level, ministerial and official levels to handle the case without disturbing our relation," said a spokesman.

A &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Department of Immigration&lt;/a&gt; spokesman said lawyers were currently interviewing the West Papuans on Christmas Island about their asylum claims.

<h2>Background: Australia's Pacific Solution</h2>

The Papuans' boat was only the third boat of asylum seekers to arrive on the mainland since 2001. Asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent to remote detention centres for processing, in what the Howard Government calls the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Solution"&gt;Pacific Solution&lt;/a&gt;.

Australia's borders are protected by &lt;a href="w%3AMandatory%20detention%20in%20Australia"&gt;mandatory detention&lt;/a&gt; legislation. The Australian government detains all persons entering the country by boat without a valid visa, including children. Since the late 1990’s unathorised arrivals have been transferred to one of the Australian immigration detention facilities on the Australian mainland, or to Manus Island, Nauru or Christmas Island as part of the Pacific Solution. Mandatory detention remains a very controversial aspect of Australian immigration policy.

A High Court decision in 2005 means that detention can also be indefinite - the Court ruled that the government had the right to keep a Palestinian asylum seeker in detention, even without any prospect of release.

Greens senator &lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Nettle"&gt;Kerry Nettle&lt;/a&gt; visited Christmas Island at the weekend and talked with some of the Papuans. She called on the Government to move the group to the Australian mainland, where there is an established West Papuan community.

A &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australian&lt;/a&gt; teacher has confessed to having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student.

24-year-old Bridget Mary Nolan pleaded guilty to three charges of &lt;a href="w%3Astatutory%20rape"&gt;unlawful sexual intercourse&lt;/a&gt; with her male student. Facing a maximum of seven years imprisonment for each charge, Nolan pleaded with the &lt;a href="w%3AAdelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20Court%23Australia"&gt;District Court&lt;/a&gt; to show leniency, claiming that she had been vulnerable, lonely and depressed because her boyfriend had left her for another woman.

Nolan, a music teacher, told the court she invited the boy to her house to discuss a kiss which had occurred between the pair on a school camp. The pair then had sex on three occasions, allegedly at the boy’s instigation. Nolan claims she engaged in the relationship out of fear that the boy would retaliate and report her, causing her to lose her job.

Nolan’s lawyer, Joana Fuller, told the court that Nolan was a secondary victim. "There's more than one victim (here), in what is clearly a sorry tale. These offences occurred not, as is often the case, as a result of a deliberate, premeditated exploitation of a student-teacher relationship. (Nolan) was lonely, she was depressed, she was heartbroken. She was utterly vulnerable at the time these offences were committed,” Fuller said.

The boy’s mother told the court the relationship had deeply affected her son. She said that his grades had dropped and that he has lost friends and been subjected to torment, harassment and humiliation by other students. "I will never forgive you for causing my beautiful son so much hurt and humiliation," she told Nolan.

The prosecutor urged the court not to suspend Nolan’s sentence, saying that she had repeatedly abused her position of trust.

Judge Gordon Barrett adjourned the case for sentencing in March.

WTLV news channel in &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; reports an explosion that released radioactive materials at &lt;a href="w%3AUnison%20Industries"&gt;Unison Industries&lt;/a&gt;, located at 7575 Baymeadows Way. One person was injured, according to the report. 

Unison spokesperson Wayne Moles said "We believe one cylinder of gas may have exploded". The cylinder was filled with &lt;a href="w%3AKrypton"&gt;krypton gas&lt;/a&gt; according to AP. Firefighters say at least 40 people became exposed to the low-level radiation. All are undergoing decontamination measures. 

Unison manufactures aviation equipment and military applications like ignition generators for Tomahawk cruise missiles.

The &lt;a href="Qatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArabic%20language"&gt;Arabic language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; television network &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aal-Jazeera"&gt;al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has aired a new tape of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's second-in-command, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In his first video appearance to mention the Peshawar province missile attack in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, Al-Zawahri refers to the alleged strike on himself and calls &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;, a "butcher" and a "failure".

On the tape, al-Zawahri says he survived an American air strike targeting him in eastern Pakistan on January 13. The air strike killed 13 villagers and led to widespread demonstrations in Pakistan for the alleged deaths of civilians. The U.S. has made no official claim of responsibility for the cross-border attack from &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

"Butcher of Washington, you are not only defeated and a liar, but also a failure. You are a curse on your own nation and you have brought and will bring them only catastrophes and tragedies," Zawahri said, referring to President Bush. "Bush, do you know where I am? I am among the Muslim masses."

al-Zawahri also threatened the citizens of &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; and the U.S.A. in the tape; "The lion of Islam, Sheik &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOsama%20bin%20Laden"&gt;Osama bin Laden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , may God protect him, offered you a decent exit from your dilemma. But your leaders, who are keen to accumulate wealth, insist on throwing you in battles and killing your souls in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and Afghanistan and — God willing — on your own land."

A U.S. counterterrorism official said to ♡❤AP♡❤ reporters on condition of anonymity, that the message broadcast by al-Jazeera indicates that al-Qaeda believed it was important to show that al-Zawahri is alive. The U.S. official also noted that the video was delivered quickly, demonstrating al-Zawahri's ability to get his message out even faster than bin Laden. As al-Zawahri make a reference to Osama Bin Laden's offering of a truce, it appears this tape is recorded not more than 12 days ago, which make a very short time according to al-Qaeda standards.

It has been widely reported, but not confirmed, that some al-Qaeda operatives were killed by the U.S. airstrike on the village of Damadola in Pakistan.

&lt;a href="Bosnia"&gt;Bosnia&lt;/a&gt;'s new international administrator has taken office after being selected by the European Union's foreign ministers. Christian Schwarz-Schilling, a German diplomat, said he hoped he would not require full use of his extensive powers and that the Bosnian authorities would take on the burden of building the country's future.

Mr Schwarz-Schilling told the press that he intended to scale back the overarching powers of his office and allow existing Bosnian political institutions to take control. He said he wanted "to bring the population to the point of taking real ownership of their institutions and not relying on the high representative as a governor to do this job.” Although he refused to comment on the performance of the more assertive departing governor Lord Ashdown, he did complain of "a top-down approach. It is important than I have done ten years of bottom-up work as a mediator. I am a bottom-up person."

Lord Ashdown said in an interview today that, while proud of his achievements in Bosnia, he profoundly regrets that the notorious war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are yet to be arrested.

The first case of &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; was announced today by the country's Health Minister, Abdel Mutalib Mohammed. The preliminary result was reportedly from a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; military laboratory in Cairo; the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; are expected to seek confirmation of this from a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; laboratory.

The victim was Shangen Abdul Qader, a 15-year-old girl from the northern Kurdish village of Raniya. Her suspected &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; infection killed her on January 17. The death of the girl's uncle is also believed to be under investigation due to him having symptoms that may indicate flu.

The area of Iraq where the suspected deaths occurred borders Turkey where there have been 12 confirmed cases of which four resulted in death. Turkey's last reported victim, Fatma Ozcan, was also aged 15.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; are spending more than they are earning, pushing the national savings rate to lows not seen since the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Depression"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Commerce%20Department"&gt;Commerce Department&lt;/a&gt; released a report saying that personal savings fell to a negative 0.5% in 2005. 

This means that people spent everything they earned and more. This is the third time that the savings rate has been negative, the previous two times were both during the Great Depression in 1932 and 1933. The savings rate has been declining since 1984 when it stood at 10.8%, in 2004 it was 1.8%.

&lt;a href="w%3ACoretta%20Scott%20King"&gt;Coretta Scott King&lt;/a&gt;, wife of slain civil rights leader &lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Luther%20King%20Jr"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr&lt;/a&gt;. has died at the age of 78. Coretta King, tireless crusader for civil rights, died in her sleep.

Mrs. King, who had been diagnosed with terminal ovarian cancer, died late on Monday in &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, where she had been seeking treatment, a spokeswoman for the family told Reuters. 
"Mrs. King was in Mexico for observation and consideration of treatment for ovarian cancer," the spokeswoman said. "She was considered terminal by physicians in the United States. She and the family wanted to explore other options." King died at Hospital Santa Monica, a holistic health center in Mexico.

News of her death led to tributes across &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, including a moment of silence in the Georgia Capitol and piles of flowers at the tomb of her slain husband. Flags at the King Center - the institute devoted to the civil rights leader's legacy - were lowered to half-staff.

Dubbed the "first lady of the civil rights movement," Mrs King suffered a debilitating stroke and heart attack in August. She was last seen on January 14 at a dinner marking the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, where she received a standing ovation.

As she recalled in her autobiography ♡❤My Life With Martin Luther King Jr♡❤., Mrs. King felt she had to step fully into the civil rights movement after her husband's assassination.

After graduating from Antioch College in Ohio in 1951, she enrolled in the graduate program at Boston's New England Conservatory of Music. It was there she met her future husband, a young preacher and doctoral student at Boston University. They were married in 1953.

Mrs. King had an influence on the civil rights movement for over half a century. She pushed and goaded politicians to have her husband's birthday observed as a national holiday. Following her husband's assassination in 1968, she fought to bring national recognition to King Jr. For over a decade, she lobbied to make King's birthday a federal holiday, and in 1983 the bill was signed into law. Three years later, the USA observed the first King holiday.

She created a memorial and a forum in the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta. The center has archives containing more than 2,000 King speeches.

Coretta Scott was born April 27, 1927, near Marion, Alabama. "It was awful," she said of living in Marion. "Every Saturday we would hear about some black man getting beat up and nothing was done about it." 

The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who in 1968 broke the news of King's death to Coretta, described her as a "freedom fighter". "She walked with her husband during the ordeal of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Their home was bombed, she endured the hate and violent anger toward their family. And she had to endure the constant knowledge that each time he left their home, he might never return," said Jackson. "She was the part of him that made him complete."

In 1969 she founded the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta and used it to confront hunger, unemployment, voting rights and racism. "The centre enables us to go out and struggle against the evils in our society," she often said.

She also accused movie and TV companies, video arcades, gun manufacturers and toy makers of promoting violence. Coretta King has became a symbol in her own right of her husband's struggle for peace and brotherhood. 

In his State of the Union Address, US President George W Bush remembered Mrs King, saying her "lasting contributions to freedom and equality have made America a better and more compassionate nation."

Mrs. King is survived by her four children, Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter and Bernice. The family issued a statement thanking the public for an outpouring of support.

Jennifer San Marco allegedly shot and killed herself, as well as an ex-neighbor and six postal workers at the Santa Barbara Processing and Distribution Center in &lt;a href="w%3AGoleta%2C%20California"&gt;Goleta, California&lt;/a&gt; says &lt;a href="w%3ASanta%20Barbara%20County"&gt;Santa Barbara County&lt;/a&gt; Sheriffs department. Authorities say that Marco believed that she was threatened by a conspiracy among the workers at the facility.

Sheriff Sergeant Erik Raney has said that Marco apparently left writings in her &lt;a href="New%20Mexico"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; desert home "alluding to a vague plot involving the mail-sorting plant, a local medical facility and the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department. She obviously felt that the post office was out to get her in one way or another," he said. "That establishes as good of a motive (for the killings) as we can determine at this point."

Raney said that the writings were described to him as "ramblings," but Raney says, "they alluded to a conspiracy."

In her home, investigators also found a check payable to 'cash' with the notation "will," which could indicate that Marco left a will, "and that may shed more light on what's happened here," said Raney.

Marco has a history of mental illness, but was still able to purchase a firearm and ammunition from Ace Pawn and Antiques, owned by Paul Castillo.

Castillo said, "she (Marco) bought the gun for $325.00 without saying why she needed the weapon. She filled out an application for a background check, which didn't turn up any problems, and picked up the gun two days later."

In a first ever effort in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate the presence of &lt;a href="w%3AZebra%20mussel"&gt;Zebra mussels&lt;/a&gt; in a large body of water, the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (&lt;a href="w%3AVDGIF"&gt;VDGIF&lt;/a&gt;) announced on Monday that a private pond in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Prince%20William%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Prince William County&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; is undergoing water treatment using a chemical potash of &lt;a href="w%3Apotassium%20chloride"&gt;potassium chloride&lt;/a&gt; in concentrations high enough to kill invasive and native shellfish species.

The pond at the Millbrook Quarry will undergo treatment for three to four weeks in an effort to eliminate an infestation of zebra mussels, a condition of its waters that was confirmed by state environmental officials in 2002. The treatment is not expected to pose a threat to non-molluscan aquatic wildlife, vegetation, or land-dwelling creatures at the site. Officials expect the one-time treatment process will provide protection from the possibility of future infestation for 33 years.

The entire body of water will be treated with potassium chloride to a level of 90 &lt;a href="w%3A%20Parts%20per%20notation"&gt;ppm&lt;/a&gt;, well below the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;’s (EPA) standard of 250 ppm for potable water. There are no expected health risks for humans, or contamination of drinking water wells in the immediate vicinity.

The freshwater Zebra Mussel species is a threat to native mussels of the region because of their high reproduction rate and their ability to attach themselves in clusters to native mussels, which kills them since they are prevented from opening and closing their shells to feed or burrow. Bottom-dwelling marine species are often covered by the Zebra Mussel.

Measures to prevent the spread of zebra mussels vary by region where the species is present. In &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, boat owners who launch water craft on reservoirs that serve as sources of drinking water are required to register their boat for use only on those reservoirs, to reduce chances of the mussel being transferred from other waters. Drinking water treatment and power production facilities where the mussels are present must regularly treat their systems to keep them clear of decaying debris that fouls intake pipes.

Zebra mussels were first discovered in &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; in 1988, in &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Saint%20Clair"&gt;Lake Saint Clair&lt;/a&gt;, a lake between &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Erie"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Huron"&gt;Lake Huron&lt;/a&gt;. By 1990 they appeared in all of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Lakes"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that the mussels were accidentally brought over from &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; on the hulls of ships.

The long awaited &lt;a href="w%3AInternet%20Explorer"&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/a&gt; 7.0 beta preview was &lt;a href="http%3A//www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie7/ie7betaredirect.mspx"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; to the public on January 31. 

Large amounts of the architecture, including the security framework, have been completely overhauled. Partly as a result of these security enhancements, the browser will be a stand-alone application, rather than integrated with the Windows shell. 

The final Beta 2 is scheduled by Microsoft to be released in April, with the full version scheduled for the Summer of 2006.

According to Microsoft's announcement, the beta will only run on &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP%20Service%20Pack%202"&gt;Windows XP Service Pack 2&lt;/a&gt; systems, but the final release version is intended to be able to run on &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Vista"&gt;Windows Vista&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20XP%20Professional%20x64%20Edition"&gt;Windows XP Professional x64 Edition&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AWindows%20Server%202003"&gt;Windows Server 2003&lt;/a&gt; as well.

<h3>New features</h3>

Version 7 includes a number of new features. 

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Improved rendering engine -♡❤♡ Internet Explorer's rendering engine, codenamed ♡❤Trident♡❤ has been completely rewritten to compete with the faster rendering engines of ♡❤Opera♡❤ and ♡❤Firefox♡❤.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Tabbed Browsing -♡❤♡ users can now have several web pages in the same window via "tabs".
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Quick Tabs -♡❤♡ enables users to view thumbnail images of all open tabs in one view.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Tab Groups -♡❤♡ enables users to organize multiple tabs in the same category as a single Tab Group that can be saved as a Favorite and the user can open all the sites in the Tab Group with a single click on the arrow to the right of the folder.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Page zoom -♡❤♡ enables users to increase or decrease the page size for easier viewing.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡IDN support♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡RSS Support -♡❤♡ Version 7.0 now supports &lt;a href="w%3ARSS"&gt;RSS&lt;/a&gt;, which allows users to gather "news feeds" from web sites that have RSS support. Microsoft implements RSS in a shared library, known as a DLL, so that third party developers can develop their own RSS-enabled applications.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Alpha transparency -♡❤♡ Version 7.0 now has native support for &lt;a href="w%3APNG"&gt;PNG&lt;/a&gt; alpha transparency. This allows certain image (PNGs) to have opaque areas that can blend in with other images and text.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡OpenSearch Extensions - ♡❤♡ Users of version 7.0 can now use search engines by typing in search terms directly from the browser's toolbar.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Administration improvements - ♡❤♡ All previous and new features are manageable via Group Policy, including the Phishing Filter and all browser add-ons.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Improved CSS support -♡❤♡ Version 7.0 has improved &lt;a href="w%3ACSS"&gt;CSS&lt;/a&gt; support, which means Internet Explorer will now render pages closer to the method defined by the &lt;a href="w%3AW3C"&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt;, a standards body for World Wide Web technologies. This means web page designers and developers will have an easier time designing web sites and applications to look the same on all web browsers.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Improved AJAX functionality -♡❤♡ Applications that use a web development technique called &lt;a href="w%3AAJAX"&gt;AJAX&lt;/a&gt; to make interactive web applications will run more efficiently because Microsoft has included support for its main component, the &lt;a href="w%3AXMLHttp"&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/a&gt; Object, into the browser. Previous versions of Internet Explorer required a helper application, called an &lt;a href="w%3AActiveX"&gt;ActiveX&lt;/a&gt; Object to implement this functionality (a good example of an AJAX application is Google's popular &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle%20Maps"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; application.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Enhanced security -♡❤♡ Microsoft has attempted to fix a number of security issues with how Internet Explorer behaves. This includes:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Protected Mode - In Protected Mode, Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista is completely unable to modify user or system files and settings.
BULLET::::- Internet Explorer 7.0 is a stand-alone application, rather than integrated with the Windows shell like version 6.0. This means that you can no longer open a folder, type in a URL and get a web page.
BULLET::::- URL Handling Protections.
BULLET::::- Protection Against Cross-Domain Scripting Attacks.
BULLET::::- Anti-Phishing and Anti-Spoofing filters.
BULLET::::- Security Status Bar - color-coded visual and icons cues to the safety and trustworthiness of a Web site.

Today, the nominees for the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3A78th%20Academy%20Awards"&gt;78th Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt; were announced in Los Angeles, California.

Best Picture nominees this year are ♡❤Brokeback Mountain♡❤, ♡❤Capote♡❤, ♡❤Crash♡❤, ♡❤Good Night, and Good Luck.♡❤, and ♡❤Munich♡❤. The director of each of these films received director nominations. Nominees include George Clooney (♡❤Good Night, and Good Luck.♡❤), Paul Haggis (♡❤Crash♡❤), Ang Lee (♡❤Brokeback Mountain♡❤), Bennett Miller (♡❤Capote♡❤), and &lt;a href="Steven%20Spielberg"&gt;Steven Spielberg&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Munich♡❤). This is the first time since 1981 that every Best Picture nominee also received a nod for Direction.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ABrokeback%20Mountain"&gt;Brokeback Mountain&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ leads this year's Oscar pack overall, with eight nominations. ♡❤Brokeback♡❤ is followed by ♡❤Crash♡❤, ♡❤Good Night, and Good Luck.♡❤, and ♡❤Memoirs of a Geisha♡❤, who each earned six. ♡❤Capote♡❤, ♡❤Munich♡❤, and ♡❤Walk the Line♡❤ each received five nominations. ♡❤King Kong♡❤, ♡❤Pride and Prejudice♡❤, and ♡❤The Constant Gardener♡❤ picked up four nominations, while ♡❤Cinderella Man♡❤, ♡❤The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe♡❤, and ♡❤War of the Worlds♡❤ pick up three. ♡❤A History of Violence♡❤, ♡❤Hustle &amp; Flow♡❤, ♡❤Mrs. Henderson Presents♡❤, ♡❤North Country♡❤, ♡❤Syriana♡❤, and ♡❤Transamerica♡❤ each received two nods each.

Best Animated Feature Film nominees are ♡❤Howl's Moving Castle♡❤, ♡❤Tim Burton's Corpse Bride♡❤, and ♡❤Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit♡❤. None of these films used primarily CGI-animation, the first year this can be claimed, since the 2001 creation of the award category. ♡❤Corspe Bride♡❤ marks both Tim Burton and Mike Johnson's first nominations. ♡❤Wallace &amp; Gromit♡❤♡s Steve Box is celebrating his first nomination, while co-producer Nick Park has three Oscars for Best Animation Short, a fourth nomination, of which he lost to himself in 1990. Hayao Miyazaki won the Best Animated Feature award in 2002, for ♡❤Spirited Away♡❤.

Uniquely neither animation powerhouse, Disney or DreamWorks, is directly nominated in the category. Disney's Buena Vista Entertainment distributes Miyazaki film ♡❤Howl's Moving Castle♡❤, while DreamWorks distributed ♡❤Wallace and Gromit♡❤, animated by Aardman Animations.

Best Foreign Language Film nominees include Italian film ♡❤Don't Tell♡❤, France's ♡❤Joyeux Noël♡❤, Palestine's ♡❤Paradise Now♡❤, Germany's ♡❤Sophie Scholl - The Final Days♡❤, and South Africa's ♡❤Tsotsi♡❤. Italy has been up for an Oscar 27 times, France 34 times, and Germany has had six nominations. This is only South Africa's second nomination, with the first coming last year, and Palestine's first ever Academy Award nomination.

Nominees for Best Documentary Feature are ♡❤Darwin's Nightmare♡❤, ♡❤Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room♡❤, ♡❤March of the Penguins♡❤, ♡❤Murderball♡❤, and ♡❤Street Fight♡❤. ♡❤March of the Penguins♡❤, produced in France, actually grossed more than any of the Best Picture nominees, the first time in history such an occurrence has happened.

The top 19 films in box office received a total of only 14 nominations, with a majority of these in the categories of Visual Effects, Sound Mixing and Sound Editing.

Perhaps one of the most interesting stories for Hollywood as a whole, is the tremendous success of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AParticipant%20Productions"&gt;Participant Productions&lt;/a&gt; in its first year of operation. eBay founder &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AJeff%20Skoll"&gt;Jeff Skoll&lt;/a&gt;'s movie house produced nominees ♡❤Good Night and Good Luck.♡❤ (6), ♡❤North Country♡❤ (2), ♡❤Syriana♡❤ (2), and ♡❤Murderball♡❤ (1). The company aims to fund feature films and documentaries that promote social values while still being commercially viable.

The 78th Academy Awards presentation will be held on Sunday, March 5.

<h1>President Bush delivers 2006 State of the Union Address</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=President%20Bush%20delivers%202006%20State%20of%20the%20Union%20Address&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; delivered his annual &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20the%20Union%20Address"&gt;State of the Union Address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday.

<h2>Bush's speech</h2>

Bush opened the speech to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by honoring &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACoretta%20Scott%20King"&gt;Coretta Scott King&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , wife of civil rights activist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMartin%20Luther%20King%20Jr."&gt;Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who died on Monday. 

Bush emphatically claimed that terrorism was still a serious threat, citing the 2004 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeslan%20school%20hostage%20crisis"&gt;Beslan school hostage crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Bush also urged what he felt was the need for American troops to continue &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;their presence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Iraq, to ensure what he described as the successful transition of the Iraqi government.

In reference to the victory of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20legislative%20election%2C%202006"&gt;recent Palestinian elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Bush urged its leaders to disarm and recognize Israel as a sovereign state.

Talking about foreign policy, Bush said Iran is held hostage by a clerical elite and that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Iran"&gt;it is not a democracy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He also alleged that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction%23Nuclear%20weapons"&gt;Iran has ♡❤nuclear ambitions♡❤&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and said the world "must not permit the Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons." 

Bush outlined an economic plan that he claims would cut the budget deficit in half by 2009, if successful. Bush said that by cutting over 140 programs that were "performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities", that the government would save over &lt;a href="United%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;14 billion. Bush briefly touched on the upcoming problem of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Security%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Social Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ; with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APost-World%20War%20II%20baby%20boom"&gt;baby boomers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reaching retirement age, Bush urged Congress to bypass partisan differences in order to save the program. In a rare break from the usual preplanned format of the speech, Bush received applause from Democrats when he announced that "Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security".

Bush talked about the need for affordable health care. These plans include expanding the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHealth%20savings%20account"&gt;health savings account program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , allowing health insurance to be more portable for workers changing jobs. Bush also urged Congress to support medical liability reform, which he said would help doctors forced out of practice by the high price of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALiability%20insurance"&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Bush also introduced an energy plan to reduce oil dependency. The ♡❤Advanced Energy Initiative♡❤ would allocate federal funds for research in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aclean%20coal"&gt;clean coal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; technology, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASolar%20power"&gt;solar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWind%20power"&gt;wind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; energy, and for research in the use of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACellulosic%20ethanol"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHydrogen%20economy"&gt;hydrogen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; fuel in vehicles, Bush stated. The President also described his support of funding "additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn, but from wood chips and stalks or switch grass."

On the topic of education and jobs, Bush introduced the ♡❤American Competitiveness Initiative♡❤. This plan would allocate more than $136 billion over the next ten years to increase research in the physical sciences sector, provide job skills training for workers in these areas, and improve the quality of math and science education. He urged Congress to make temporary tax relief permanent. He also mentioned that he would like Congress to pass the power of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aline-item%20veto"&gt;line-item veto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which was given briefly to President &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, before being &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClinton%20v.%20City%20of%20New%20York"&gt;declared unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 1998 by the Supreme Court, six to three.

Bush closed the address emphatically claiming what he called the historic courage of Americans, and saying that in Iraq, "like Americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well."

<h2>Democratic Rebuttals</h2>

The &lt;a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Democratic&lt;/a&gt; rebuttal, delivered by &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Kaine"&gt;Tim Kaine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , criticized Bush's speech, saying that Bush had failed to uphold his previous promises, and that his administration had caused many of the problems that Bush promised in his address to fix. Kaine also stated that the Democratic Party had previously introduced many policies similar to Bush's, but these policies had not been supported by &lt;a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition to Kaine's speech, a second rebuttal, delivered in Spanish, was given by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; mayor &lt;a href="Antonio%20Villaraigosa"&gt;Antonio Villaraigosa&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>T-shirts prohibited</h2>
&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACindy%20Sheehan"&gt;Cindy Sheehan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who became an anti-war activist after her son was killed serving in Iraq and gained recognition in 2005 for her protests outside &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrairie%20Chapel%20Ranch"&gt;Bush's ranch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Texas, was arrested in the House gallery by Capitol Police Officer Mike Weight about fifteen minutes before the speech. Initial reports claimed that she had attempted to unfurl an anti-war banner; in fact, Sheehan wore a t-shirt with the words, "2,245 dead. How many more?" Sheehan had been invited to the speech by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALynn%20Woolsey"&gt;Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-CA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . In contrast, Beverly Young, the wife of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Young"&gt;Rep. Bill Young (R-FL)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was ordered to leave the gallery but not arrested during Bush's speech because she was wearing a shirt with the words, "Support the Troops Defending Our Freedom." Sheehan is charged with unlawful conduct in violation of D.C. Code §10-503.16(b)(7), a misdemeanor prohibiting demonstrations in the Capitol carrying a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $500 fine. Capitol Grounds Regulations defining the prohibited activities allow "wearing Tee shirts, buttons, or other similar articles of apparel that convey a message."

On Wednesday, Capitol Police dropped charges against Sheehan and apologized for ejecting her and Young. "The officers made a good faith, but mistaken effort to enforce an old unwritten interpretation of the prohibitions about demonstrating in the Capitol," Chief Terrance Gainer said in a statement.

A class action suit has been filed on Tuesday by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AElectronic%20Frontier%20Foundation"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (EFF) against the telecom giant &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAT%26amp%3BT"&gt;AT&amp;T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The suit, filed in &lt;a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, alleges that AT&amp;T violated federal laws by collaborating with government to eavesdrop on &lt;a href="United%20States%20of%20America"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; citizens.

The Bush Administration and NSA have come under fire over the issue. They defend the program by saying they are only listening in on suspected terrorists.

The EFF claims that AT&amp;T turned over 2 databases consisting of their subscribers' communication and internet usage records.

Attorney Kevin Bankston representing the EFF said the government could not conduct their surveillance without the help of companies like AT&amp;T. He also said their goal is to tell AT&amp;T that it is not in their fiscal best interests, along with not being legal, to cooperate with the President's wiretap program.

According to the class action suit, AT&amp;T granted "access to all or a substantial number of the communications transmitted through its key domestic telecommunications facilities, including direct access to streams of domestic, international and foreign telephone and Internet communications." The lawsuit is seeking damages of $22,000 for each AT&amp;T customer in addition to punitive fines.

AT&amp;T is also facing scrutiny from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Communications%20Commission"&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and possibly fines for failing to properly certify that customer records were safeguarded.

<h1>Rumsfeld explains renaming of war</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Rumsfeld%20explains%20renaming%20of%20war&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense"&gt;Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; explained to &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; reporters today why the term, "the long war" should be used instead of the "&lt;a href="w%3Awar%20on%20terror"&gt;war on terror&lt;/a&gt;." President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; used the new term last night during the State of the Union address.

Rumsfeld stated, "what we're trying to do is tell the truth," and he says the truth is that "just as the &lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt; lasted a long time, this war is not something that's going to just go away."

On ♡❤CNN♡❤, General Kimmitt of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;U.S. Army&lt;/a&gt; was asked yesterday about the "long war" categorization by Rumsfeld and President Bush. Kimmitt's response was; "Well, first of all, the president's exactly right and the secretary of defense is exactly right. It will be a long war. It's a fight against al Qaeda and its associated movements...How do we fight that? It's quite simple. We fight it internationally. We fight it interagency. And we fight it with persistence. And we fight it with patience. And it's going to take a long time. ..But we have got to stay in there long enough to make sure that, when we do hand off, we hand off to competent forces and not just run for the doors before the job is done." 

This is not the first occasion that the Bush administration has sought to rename terms and phrases connected with the war on terror. The most recent example is President Bush using the phrase "terrorist surveillance program" to describe the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s practice of domestic wiretapping while bypassing court-ordered warrants.

The term "long war" has also been used to describe a &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20War%20%28Ottoman%20wars%29"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; between the Habsburgs and the Ottoman Empire from 1593 to 1606 or as a &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20War%20%2820th%20century%29"&gt;concept&lt;/a&gt; describing several wars in the 20th century as one long war.

&lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%252C_New_South_Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt; Regional Council, the local government responsible for the city of Bathurst and its surrounds in Central Western &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; yesterday revealed it had received a development application for the new Bathurst Base Hospital.

The new hospital is to be built behind the current hospital on the same site and is expected to cost the New South Wales government AUD96 million. The Bathurst Hospital will be the first in the Bathurst-Orange-Bloomfield redevelopment project.

The new hospital will have 149 beds, up from 85 for the current hospital. The hospital will also feature a mental health unit - previously psychiatric patients had to travel to Orange to the Bloomfield Hospital for treatment.

The Bathurst Hospital is expected to have state-of-the art facilities and will share some services with the to be constructed Orange Base Hospital.

The Bathurst Regional Council has approved the demolition of 12 buildings on the hospital site for enabling works. The hospital site is heritage listed although council decided that as the buildings do not contribute to the streetscape they may be demolished.

The demolitions are expected to take place late next month and will take around six weeks to complete. A temporary driveway will then be built to replace the current service entry for food and linen as it will become part of the work site.

Upon completion of the new hospital, the current ward block will be demolished leaving the original building from the late 19th century intact. The original building is expected to become an education centre and consulting rooms.

The original building was opened in 1834. Since then the facility has undergone numerous upgrades and add-ons, with the present ward block being opened in stages from 1978 to 1982.

Other buildings expected to be retained include the Daffodil Cottage (a cancer care centre) and the original Nurse's quarters known as Poole House.

Scientists say &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s hot summer has had a devastating effect on Queensland's &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Barrier%20Reef"&gt;Great Barrier Reef&lt;/a&gt;. Coral reef specialists are comparing the severity of the damage to the worst case ever recorded in 2002.

&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Queensland"&gt;University of Queensland&lt;/a&gt; scientists say they were shocked by the reef's condition and are concerned the entire reef may be at risk of destruction from global warming.

Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg said most of the reefs they saw were completely bleached. "Going down to 10 metres, every piece of coral was a glowing white colour - all that brown colour had disappeared and that was surprising for us," he said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Conservation%20Foundation"&gt;Australian Conservation Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s Don Henry is worried. "The important thing from this warning is that we're starting to see this damage to the reef from warmer waters and climate change happen more often and more extensive," he said. "There's going to be a point when the reef just doesn't recover."

With February, the hottest month, just ahead, this is a critical time. The last severe cases of bleaching occurred in 1998 and 2002, the last leaving more than 5 percent of the reef destroyed.

Professor Hoegh-Guldberg, a renowned coral expert, said he was amazed at the damage to corals on the Keppel islands. "Corals at the Keppels are completely bleached and we are only halfway through January," he said.

The Great Barrier Reef is a big attraction for Australia’s tourism industry, which employs 6 per cent of the country’s workforce and contributes 12 per cent of exports. Paul Marshall, manager of the Great Barrier Reef marine park said "We are going to be pretty lucky to escape coral deaths in the southern Great Barrier Reef." 

The Reef's future looks even darker following a report by climate scientists. The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; Meteorological Office report, ♡❤Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change♡❤, suggests that a two-degree warming would also see 97 percent of the world's coral reefs lost, lower crop yields, put 2.8 billion people at risk of water shortage and the total loss of summer &lt;a href="w%3AArctic%20Sea"&gt;Arctic Sea&lt;/a&gt; ice, sparking the extinction of the polar bear and walrus.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation"&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/a&gt; (FBI) is currently investigating if a possible civil rights violation was committed by a &lt;a href="w%3Asheriff%27s%20deputy"&gt;sheriff's deputy&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Bernardino%20County"&gt;San Bernardino County&lt;/a&gt; after the shooting of an unarmed U.S. &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAir_Force_Security_Forces"&gt;Security Force officer&lt;/a&gt;.

The military policeman, Senior Airman Elio Carrion, 21, was shot while on leave after serving a six month deployment in Iraq. The incident took place on Sunday, in &lt;a href="w%3AChino%2C%20California"&gt;Chino, California&lt;/a&gt;, after a short police chase. Carrion was the passenger of Luis Fernando Escobedo, 21, when police began chasing Escobedo's blue &lt;a href="w%3AChevrolet%20Corvette"&gt;Chevrolet Corvette&lt;/a&gt; for speeding. The car reached over speeds of 100 mph (160 km/h) during the short five minute chase.

After the chase ended in a crash near his house, Jose Luis Valdez began taping the accident aftermath. The grainy, low-quality &lt;a href="w%3Avideotape"&gt;videotape&lt;/a&gt; shows Carrion laying on the ground with the officer standing over him. The deputy appears to say, "Stay on the ground." The deputy then seems to say "Get up" several times. Carrion then said, "I'm going to get up." As Carrion begins to rise, the deputy fires three shots which hit Carrion in the chest, leg and side. After Carrion is hit he said, "I mean you no harm." The deputy responded by shouting "Shut the fuck up" twice, and then "You don't get up!" A neighbor is heard saying, "You told him to get up." The video shot by Valdez was given to police, with a copy sold by him to television station &lt;a href="w%3AKTLA"&gt;KTLA&lt;/a&gt;.

Carrion is now in the hospital and in good condition. 

Cindy Beavers, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department stated the deputy has been put on paid leave. Beavers also mentioned that Sheriff Gary Penrod had invited the FBI to join the investigation. The FBI released a statement confirming this. 

Penrod issued a statement on Monday saying, "As with all investigations, the circumstances involved in this shooting will be reviewed, it would be inappropriate for me to make any additional comments until the investigation is completed."

Experts say the video is open to interpretation. 

Last week, in a similar but unrelated incident, a news helicopter caught footage of &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri"&gt;St. Louis, Missouri&lt;/a&gt; police officers using what appears to be excessive force on a suspect in detaining him.

On Wednesday, doctors inserted a feeding tube into &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;'s stomach.

"Tonight Prime Minister Ariel Sharon underwent a &lt;a href="w%3Agastrostomy"&gt;gastrostomy&lt;/a&gt;, a process in which a tube is inserted into the stomach for feeding. The procedure was carried out under anesthetic and was successful," said Ron Krumer, a spokesperson for Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital where Sharon is continuing to be treated for a major stroke he suffered on January 4, 2006. He then added that, "the Prime Minister is still in a critical but stable condition."

Doctors say that the chances are slim that he will return to consciousness or return to a meaningful level of activity. As a result it is expected Sharon will be unable to serve as Prime Minister anytime in the future. Currently his position is being filled on an interim basis by Deputy Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;.

Sharon, who had been Prime Minister of the State of Israel since 2001, suffered a massive stroke on January 4 during the run up to a new series of Israeli parliamentary elections. His centrist &lt;a href="w%3AKadima%20Party"&gt;Kadima Party&lt;/a&gt; faced fierce competition from the conservative &lt;a href="w%3ALikud%20Party"&gt;Likud Party&lt;/a&gt; (which he split off from in late 2005) and the democratic socialist Labour Party.

Australia's Foreign Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;, says the Federal government will contribute another 200 troops to assist the Dutch military in a former &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; stronghold. Australia also pledges $150 million in aid for the reconstruction of &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. 

"We have 190 at the moment, special forces, we've got another 110 going there to provide additional support for them with two helicopters, and this would be another 200 on top of that." Mr Downer said.

Speaking outside a two-day international donors conference in London, Mr Downer said Australia's commitment to Afghanistan was not as large as some countries, but it would nevertheless make a big difference.

He said Australia would build on the millions it has already spent in Afghanistan, with a new pledge of $150 million over 5 years through aid agency AusAID. Canberra has spent 110 million dollars in the war-torn country since the coalition invaded in late 2001.

Mr Downer joined world leaders in London for the signing of the Afghanistan Compact: "a road-map for international donors and the Government of Afghanistan to work together to rebuild the country into a stable and democratic state."

Australia's latest troop commitment, for a provincial reconstruction team in conjunction with the Netherlands, will take its total in Afghanistan to 500 troops. Downer said that the troops would probably be sent to take part in a proposed provincial reconstruction team with Dutch soldiers in the southern province of Uruzgan as early as July.

"July, August would be the pencilled-in planning at the moment, so that would involve Australia sending around 200 troops over and above the troops we already have in Afghanistan," he said. 

Mr Downer said Afghanistan still had a security problem but things were going in the right direction.

"We know how important it is for the new democratic government in Afghanistan and the new free and democratic processes there to survive, and every country that possibly can needs to give support to Afghanistan," he said.

Under the compact, Afghanistan has pledged to meet targets in security, governance, rule of law and human rights, and economic and social development in return for military and financial aid from its international partners.

Australia also has about 900 troops in Iraq. About 450 of the soldiers are guarding Japanese forces in southern Samawa, which Japanese media reports said could end by May.

Downer said Australia would "wait and see" what Japan would do before deciding whether to bring its Samawa troops home or redeploy them elsewhere in Iraq. 

Australia has already committed some 300 troops and support personnel to Afghanistan.

<h1>Ruddock hints at Australia Card</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Ruddock%20hints%20at%20Australia%20Card&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; Attorney-General &lt;a href="w%3APhilip_Ruddock"&gt;Philip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; says he may introduce plans to make Australian citizens carry an &lt;a href="w%3AIdentity_document"&gt;identity card&lt;/a&gt; to avert terrorist attacks. "I'll make an announcement soon and that could be this week," Ruddock said. "It depends upon when I'm fully satisfied about the issues that we want examined."

According to a recent poll of 1200 people, over 50 percent would support a national identity card. A Newspoll in The Australian newspaper found that 31 per cent of voters were opposed to the ID card.

Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn_Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; refloated the possibility of an "&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia_Card"&gt;Australia Card&lt;/a&gt;" after the July 7 London suicide bombings. British Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is considering introducing cards identifying Britons by fingerprints and iris scans. 

Australia last debated a national ID card (to cut down on tax avoidance), the ♡❤Australia Card♡❤, in 1987, but was defeated in the Senate after public outrage. Mr Howard, then in opposition, opposed the card, but now says times have changed. "This is an issue that ought to be back on the table...in the wake of something like the terrible tragedy in London," Howard told a news conference in June last year. 

Australia has been on medium terror alert since 2001. While there hasn't been a major terrorist attack on Australian soil, Prime Minister John Howard says it's a "possibility." 

Mr Ruddock is expected to announce this week the terms of an independent inquiry into an ID card, citing national security and fraud prevention as key concerns. The inquiry will investigate the possible benefits of such a card in combating terrorism and fraud, and whether it could be introduced at a reasonable cost.

Opposition public accountability spokesman Kelvin Thomson said he was unsure whether it would help Australia's fight against terrorism as there was no great evidence to suggest ID cards assisted those countries that already had them. 

Australian Privacy Foundation chief Anna Johnston said the poll was good news for those who opposed the ID card. She said the lower level of support for the ID card compared with 1986 showed that people were better informed.

"I would suggest that this shows the Government is already on very shaky ground on this proposal if there is only this very small majority of people in favour of it," Ms Johnston said. "Because as more details emerge about what is actually being put forward, support will drop."

Attorney-General Philip Ruddock, said that policy should not be dictated by public opinion. 

Advocacy groups say that work had already started on creating a coalition of lobby groups in readiness for a campaign. "We're starting to marshall our resources now," Ms Johnston said. "Like the Australia Card debate, we are looking to establish a broad coalition of people across the political spectrum and from all walks of life."

Ruddock's comments have been slammed by security experts, who say national ID cards do not make Australia any safer and could have the opposite effect. 

James Turner, security analyst at Frost &amp; Sullivan Australia, said: "ID cards cannot protect us from terrorism because an ID card cannot indicate intention. It's like signature based anti-virus, the AV signature can only point out the currently known viruses; and an ID card can only identify currently known baddies."

Jo Stewart-Rattray, director of information security at Vectra Corporation said: "As far as its goal being to protect us from terrorist attacks, I don't think so. The bad guys will always find a way to propagate their own version of these cards. It is not protecting us against terrorist attacks by any means."

Stewart-Rattray's comments echoed those of ex-MI5 chief Dame Stella Rimington, who recently said ID cards were "useless" at fighting terrorism. "If we have ID cards at vast expense and people can go into a back room and forge them they are going to be absolutely useless. ID cards may be helpful in all kinds of things but I don't think they are necessarily going to make us any safer," said Rimington.

Bruce Schneier argued that ID cards will not help improve security and would have the opposite effect. He says the card will require an "immense database" with "enormous" security risks.

"The security risks are enormous. Such a database would be a kludge of existing databases; databases that are incompatible, full of erroneous data, and unreliable. As computer scientists, we do not know how to keep a database of this magnitude secure, whether from outside hackers or the thousands of insiders authorised to access it," wrote Schneier.

Roger Clarke, of the Australian Privacy Foundation asked whether the "billions it would cost would be worth it", especially considering the "enormous intrusions into the affairs of the majority of law-abiding citizens".

According to Privacy International, around 100 countries have compulsory identity cards. They also stated that "virtually no common law country has a card".

In recent days, there has been a notable increase in nuclear attack drill activities in &lt;a href="w%3ALA"&gt;LA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHouston"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt; and the state of &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.

Sources in the Houston Police Department have disclosed that they are running these nuclear disaster drills across the city of Houston, Texas.

"In the last week I have multi-checked with sources of mine in the Houston Police Department and confirmed that HPD has been running nuclear disaster drills," said Capt. Eric May, as he warned of a possible nuclear attack that might occur in the Texas City or Houston metro area. Capt. Eric May also mentioned that a likely target could be the British Petroleum plant in Texas City, Texas.

Local citizens have also noticed ongoing SWAT exercises involving numerous government agencies in the area, including Homeland Security, the HPD and the Pasadena Police Department.

"After leaving the Texas City police station, I noticed one thing really strange, as I counted at least 11 different types of official police and government vehicles parked in the police lot. I have never seen this before and it has me a little worried. What are they planning?" said local resident John Watkins.

Besides this increased activity in the Houston area, there have been reports that the &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20America"&gt;Bank of America&lt;/a&gt; has been in contact with &lt;a href="w%3AHomeland%20Security"&gt;Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; officials discussing the topic of how to deal with customers in the case of a pending "national disaster." Employees of the bank have been ordered to remain silent, as ones from all levels have been told of the proper procedures to take. Employees in both Houston and LA have disclosed they were recently told not to distribute certain things from safety deposit boxes in the event of a national emergency, including gold, silver and firearms. They were, however, allowed to hand out important papers to asking customers.

It seems as if &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Petroleum"&gt;British Petroleum&lt;/a&gt; may also be conducting nuclear disaster exercises in the Houston area, as an email from an alleged BP employee has surfaced on the internet. Although his identity has not been proven as of yet, he states that he holds the position of a "building monitor" and has never had any responsibilities before. However, on Friday, January 27th, he was called into a meeting and told that he had best get his men ready for some disaster drills to be starting in the next week.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; government is also running a nuclear disaster drill in the Charleston, SC area from January 31st to February 2nd. The organizers said that nuclear drills should not frighten citizens, but should instead encourage them to learn how to protect themselves in the event of an attack. It should be noted that the government has run other nuclear disaster tests before, including one last summer called "Sudden Respond '05." Therefore, this increase of disaster drills may just indicate that the government is taking the threat of a nuclear attack seriously and not necessarily that there is one impending.

Ten puppies with bags of liquid heroin surgically implanted into their bellies were having seizures in a drug bust in &lt;a href="w%3AMedellin%2C%20Colombia"&gt;Medellin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, said authorities. 

"They utilized a wide range of smuggling, the most repulsive of which was the use of puppies," said John P. Gilbride, head of the DEA's New York office.

"There have been cases of animal cruelty that have led to the discovery of drug labs, but not to the extent of an animal being used to carry drugs, especially a puppy," said &lt;a href="w%3AASPCA"&gt;ASPCA&lt;/a&gt; spokeswoman Jo Sullivan.

Investigators believe that the dogs were used to smuggle heroin into New York on commercial flights. The drugs were then to be distributed and sold along the East Coast.

"Ten puppies, including Labrador retrievers, were rescued during a 2005 raid on a farm in Colombia," said the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Drug%20Enforcement%20Agency"&gt;United States Drug Enforcement Agency&lt;/a&gt; (DEA) on Wednesday. The Agency also announced that they had made more than 30 arrests. 

Authorities believe that a veterinarian, Andres Lopez Elorez (who is also believed to be a fugitive in &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;), opened the bellies of at least six of the ten puppies, inserted 500&amp;nbsp;mL bags of liquid heroin, and then stitched them back up. Three puppies had died due to infections after the drugs were removed. A total of 3&amp;nbsp;kg of heroin were recovered from six puppies. The bags were found using &lt;a href="w%3Aultrasound"&gt;ultrasound&lt;/a&gt;.

"The surviving dogs are still alive and well, we're told," said Gilbride. "I think it's outrageous and heinous that they'd use small, innocent puppies in this way. This investigation identified the individuals who were responsible for overseeing and smuggling millions of dollars worth of heroin from Colombia to the East Coast."

The investigation revealed that the smugglers, whose ring was based in Medellin, not only used people and puppies to conceal their drugs, but also body creams, aerosol cans, and the linings of purses and luggage.

A tipster is said to have led authorities to the puppies.

It is not known how many puppies were actually used in the smuggling operation.

Three dogs were adopted by Colombian police. At least one of those puppies will be trained to sniff for drugs.

About 24 kilograms of heroin was seized in recent raids in Colombia which have resulted in more than 20 arrests and another ten in custody in New York. A total of at least 24 kilograms have been seized in these raids.

After the block from Wikipedia expired, the House of Representatives user continued to edit the article on Chris Shays. Chris Shays had co-sponsored a bill with Marty Meehan, whose staffers had previously been found to have been negatively editing Wikipedia entries, The American Civil Liberties Union said of the bill "key elements of Shays-Meehan violate the First Amendment right to free speech because the legislation contains provisions that would violate the constitutionally-protected right of the people to express their opinions about issues through broadcast advertising if they mention the name of a candidate." All mentions of the bill were removed from the article. Also removed was a paragraph about Chris Shays raising $70,000 with House Speaker Dennis Hastert at a country club event.

Again, the IP address was blocked for an eight-hour period.

Wikipedia edits in Congress are not coming from the House of Representatives alone. An edit from the Senate in July removed references to a plagiarism scandal with Senator &lt;a href="Joe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;, who has informally said he may seek a Democratic nomination for president in 2008.

IP addresses from the &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Justice"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Marines, and the Navy are listed on the site as having made several cases of vandalism. Some examples of vandalism from the Department of Justice IP ranges involve articles on &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DOpie_and_Anthony%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D19315167"&gt;TV and radio shows&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DJulio_Lugo%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D32294159"&gt;baseball player&lt;/a&gt;, or just &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DTalk%3AUnited_States_Marshals_Service%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D31652746"&gt;complaining about their work&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to accusations of vandalism, there have also been accusations of government employees introducing perceived bias, political spinning, or misinformation into Wikipedia articles by adding or removing information.

These cases include articles on an &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DDaniel_O%27Connell%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D993895"&gt;Irish politician&lt;/a&gt;, and in the George W. Bush article, introducing accusations of Hugo Chavez being a dictator, and removing information covering the George W. Bush substance abuse controversy. In addition, a person using a Department of Justice IP address edited a page covering indicted former Republican Majority Leader &lt;a href="Tom%20DeLay"&gt;Tom DeLay&lt;/a&gt;. The editor removed two paragraphs stating a judge ruled that Tom DeLay had broken state law by not disclosing over $600,000 of fundraising money, a &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DTom_DeLay%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D24265474"&gt;quote from Tom DeLay in which he stated that it drives the Democrats crazy wondering why the Republican Party institutes pro-Israeli policy&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DTom_DeLay%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D24265634"&gt;subsection&lt;/a&gt; on controversies involving DeLay's relatives. Edits to &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s article were done within the span of an hour. Edits to Tom DeLay's article were made within an hour as well, although followed by a shorter, minor second session of editing later that day.

An editor using a CIA IP address is accused of &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DMahmoud_Ahmadinejad%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D31483775"&gt;vandalizing an article on the current president of Iran&lt;/a&gt;. Editors using Marine and Navy IP addresses based in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APensacola%2C%20Florida"&gt;Pensacola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; are accused of vandalizing an article on a &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DBreach_of_Trust%26amp%3Bdiff%3D37830661%26amp%3Boldid%3D37550047"&gt;rock song&lt;/a&gt; and on former U.S. president &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DBill_Clinton%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D14898987"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, and accused of adding racist comments to articles on an &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DDanny_Glover%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D21222764"&gt;actor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DMartin_Luther_King%252C_Jr.%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D37685895"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, and adding comments that are perceived to &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DUnited_States_Navy%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D37555768"&gt;criticize the men and women in the Navy reserves&lt;/a&gt;.

The IP addresses of the Department of Justice, the CIA, and the Navy and Marines stationed in Pensacola, Florida were found using the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Registry%20for%20Internet%20Numbers"&gt;American Registry for Internet Numbers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.arin.net/index.shtml"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;. Neither the government nor the Wikimedia Foundation have released an official statement.

The U.S. House of Representatives' IP address is not the first governmental address to have been blocked after accusations of disrupting Wikipedia. The IP address belonging to a subdivision of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in Alberta, Canada was blocked for three months since late 2005. An IP address belonging to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGerman%20Bundestag"&gt;German Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been repeatedly &lt;a href="http%3A//de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DSpezial%3ALog%26amp%3Btype%3Dblock%26amp%3Bpage%3DBenutzer%253A193.17.243.4"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; from the German Wikipedia after accusations of vandalism, including &lt;a href="http%3A//de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DSex%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D9991631"&gt;sexually explicit comments&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Report details British billionare donations to Australian political party</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Report%20details%20British%20billionare%20donations%20to%20Australian%20political%20party&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
An &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian_Electoral_Commission"&gt;Australian Electoral Commission (AEC)&lt;/a&gt; report has revealed that British billionaire Michael Ashcroft made a record AU$1 million donation to the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal_Party_of_Australia"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; of Australia. The AEC is legally required to make public the identities of major donors to political parties.

The controversial donation by &lt;a href="w%3ALord%20Ashcroft"&gt;Lord Ashcroft&lt;/a&gt; (deputy chairman of the British Conservative Party), to the Liberals in 2004, is believed to be the biggest single donation from an individual in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; politics. His donation pushed the Liberal Party's total for 2004-05 to $66.5 million. 
&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian_Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats'&lt;/a&gt; senator Andrew Murray expressed alarm at the foreign donation. "There is no such thing as a free lunch," he said. "Foreign interference and influence in Australian domestic politics is absolutely unacceptable. Donations from overseas entities and foreigners must be banned outright."

Senator Murray has calculated that between 1998-99 and 2002-03 a total of $607,178 was paid to Australian political parties from foreign entities. He is concerned that foreign foundations can elude Australian disclosure laws. 

"I don't know about you, but I've never met a businessman ever that will give you that amount of money without expecting something in return," Senator Murray said. 

Australian Electoral Commission figures have also finally disclosed the backers behind the new right-wing religious party, &lt;a href="w%3AFamily_First"&gt;Family First&lt;/a&gt;. Craig Winkler, chief executive of software firm MYOB, gave $200,000 to the party, while Dan Daniels, a Victorian pharmaceuticals millionaire, contributed $95,000.

The federal Opposition say around $8 million given to the Liberal Party in 2004-05 will remain undisclosed under looming changes to the rules governing political donations.

"If the Liberal Party receives the same level of donations next year, up to $8million in secret donations will flow to Liberal Party coffers with no public scrutiny," Opposition spokesman for state affairs Alan Griffin said. 

Prime Minister John Howard led the Liberal/National coalition to its fourth consecutive election victory in 2004. The win has boosted the Liberal government’s majority, giving it control in both houses of parliament.

Ashcroft, 59, who is also the largest individual donor to the British Conservative Party, serves with Howard on the conservative International Democrat Union committee.

Fourteen bodies were found on Thursday by police in &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Iraq Interior Ministry, the bodies appeared to have been tortured. Each one had been blind-folded and had their hands tied behind their back. The men, all civilians, were stabbed repeatedly, had marks on their wrists which suggests their wrists were tied together, and all of the victims had gunshot wounds to their heads.

Eleven of the men were found in the back of a truck. The other three were found near a road in Rustamiya on the southeastern outskirts of the capital. 

Police do not yet know the identities of the men.

Shi'ite-led Interior Ministry security units are being accused by Sunni leaders for carrying out retribution killings against the Sunnis; however, the ministry denies the charges.

&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Baker"&gt;Tom Baker&lt;/a&gt;, one of the ten actors to play &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Doctor"&gt;The Doctor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;'s long-running television series &lt;a href="w%3ADoctor%20Who"&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;, has become the voice of the new &lt;a href="w%3ABT%20Group%20plc"&gt;BT&lt;/a&gt; text messaging voice service, which translates a text message sent from a mobile phone to a BT landlines into a voice messages heard by the receiver as an answerphone message.

Baker's voice will replace the earlier computer-synthesized voice that was previously used. BT said that his voice was chosen as it was instantly recognisable. It took him 11 days to record 11,593 phrases and sounds which could then be broken down and reassembled by a computer to make new words. It then took five months to process these recordings to make a workable service.

BT have said that there will be no barriers as to what Tom Baker's voice can 'say', including rude words. "What appeals to me most is the thought that I will be bringing good news to people whether it is a cheeky message, a birthday greeting, or just a quick hello," said Baker.

The service, which can only be received by those with a BT line, costs nothing to receive voice messages, and text messages are charged at the normal rate.

BT GROUP revealed that texts to landlines had soared 70 per cent in volume on the first day that Tom Baker's voice was used to deliver messages, and have now passed the three million mark in just ten days.

An oil spill in north-west &lt;a href="Estonia"&gt;Estonia&lt;/a&gt; has, according to scientists in the country, killed an estimated 5,000 birds across the Baltic countries of Estonia, &lt;a href="Latvia"&gt;Latvia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Lithuania"&gt;Lithuania&lt;/a&gt;.

The oil spill, which occurred on January 31, killed 2,000 birds just off the coasts of the nearby Vormsi and Osmussaar islands. Finnish authorities have also reported that birds in the Nordic countries have also been affected.

The oil spill occurred on the coast of the northern &lt;a href="w%3AHarjumaa"&gt;Harjumaa&lt;/a&gt; region of Estonia, and has been credited to a &lt;a href="Liberia"&gt;Liberian&lt;/a&gt; tanker heading toward &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. By the end of the first 24 hours following the spill, authorities had already picked up 400 dead birds, killed by contact with the oil.

The coasts of Estonia have historically been a Winter flocking place for birds from across North and Central Europe, due to the suitable climate for many species. The spill could endanger numbers, especially if the death toll continues to increase in the next few days.

<h1>New South Wales set to adopt harsher anti-cannabis laws</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20South%20Wales%20set%20to%20adopt%20harsher%20anti-cannabis%20laws&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; Premier &lt;a href="Morris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; has proposed strengthening the states anti-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACannabis%20%28drug%29"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; laws. The government is undertaking a complete rewrite of such laws in response to concerns voiced by some health professionals about the link between the drug and mental health issues. The proposed legislation will also increase jail sentences for those convicted of growing cannabis &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACannabis%20%28drug%29%20cultivation%23Hydroponic%20cultivation"&gt;hydroponically&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

"There is growing evidence of a link between long-term cannabis use and the incidence of severe mental health problems," said Mr Iemma. 

Under the plan the current cannabis cautioning system, introduced in 2000, is to be reviewed. Cannabis users would be required to attend counseling to "understand the link between cannabis use and mental illness" to avoid being charged for their first offence. At present those issued with their second cautioning notice are required to call a counseling service. 

<h2>Revised Penalty System</h2>
Current penalties do not distinguish between hydroponic cultivation and other forms of cultivation. The new set of penalties proposed by Mr Iemma include:
<ul>
BULLET::::- $220,000 fine and/or 10 years gaol for growing 5-49 hydroponic plants (same as present)
BULLET::::- $385,000 fine and/or 15 years gaol for growing 50-199 hydroponic plants (currently this is given to those found growing 250-999 plants)
BULLET::::- $550,000 fine and/or 20 years gaol for growing 200 hydroponic plants or more (currently given for growing in excess of 1000 plants)
BULLET::::- Two years gaol for theft of electricity to power hydroponic growing houses
BULLET::::- 12 months gaol for those found with any form of cannabis on their premises (for a first offence)
BULLET::::- Five years gaol for those found with any form of cannabis on their premises (for a second offence)
BULLET::::- Creation of child endangerment offences for parents who allow their children inside hydroponic grow-ops.
<h2>Hydroponic cultivation</h2>
Those found hydroponically growing cannabis will be hit particularly hard by the new laws. Mr Iemma defended the government's proposals by referring to expert advice on the effects of this type of cannabis on users. "Regular cannabis use can exacerbate mental illnesses and associated criminal activity. Experts tell us that potent, hydroponically grown cannabis is a particular problem," he said.

The content of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATHC"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in cannabis changed sharply in the 1970s with the rediscovery and spread of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACannabis%20%28drug%29%20cultivation%23Sinsemilla"&gt;sinsemilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; technique, wherein the material used by the unfertilized female plant to create seeds is diverted to the production of trichromes, which contain THC. Potency rates have risen slowly but steadily since then with the refinement of various cultivation techniques. These techniques also have resulted in much greater yields. 

The concentration of THC in cannabis as related to genetics, correct nutrient supply and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACannabis%20%28drug%29%20cultivation%23Reproductive/flowering%20phase%20of%20growth"&gt;precise lighting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may be controlled by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACannabis%20%28drug%29%20cultivation%23Hydroponic%20cultivation"&gt;hydroponic cultivation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , however these conditions are also regularly met using soil-based growing techniques. 

Under the new laws hydroponic cannabis houses will be subjected to the same search and warrant powers as those which are used for the manufacture of amphetamines and heroin. 

<h2>Support and Concerns</h2>
Dr John Currie from Drug and Alcohol Services at Sydney's Westmead hospital supports the government's position, telling ABC "there is growing evidence that the long term use of cannabis can cause mental illness, whether you're predisposed to it or not". 

"Equally as worrying for us is that just ordinary people who don't have a mental health problem can still get trouble when they do have long term use of cannabis" said Dr Currie. 

The Prime Minister has also accused cannabis of playing a role in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s mental health problems. "I think we are paying a dreadfully heavy price for the abuse of what was so called recreation and socially acceptable drugs despite the clear evidence, unaccepted until a few years ago, that these things were doing massive damage within our community," Mr Howard has said in parliament.

Mr Howard signaled that he supported the move in New South Wales to increase penalties for cannabis, especially hydroponic cannabis which the NSW government claims is stronger. "I welcome the change in direction of many of the states," he said.

The Mental Health Council of Australia has warned the government of over-estimating the role of cannabis in mental health. John Mendozza, the Councils Chief Executive, told ABC "I don't think we should overstate the role of cannabis in the nation's mental health crisis. It is a factor, but it is not the reason that we now face a mental health crisis."

The government's claims are based in part upon an Australian study conducted in 2002, which found regular use of cannabis among teen-age girls to be predictive of later anxiety and depression, though not that among boys. A different study published in 2005 actually found that those who suffer with depression and use cannabis "for medical reasons" reported less depressed moods. 

Research has shown that cannabis use is risky for adolescents with an abnormal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACOMT"&gt;COMT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; gene (which occurs in about 25 percent of the population of Northern European descent). Compared to the rest of the population, those with the abnormal gene and who smoke cannabis regularly during adolescence have an increased risk of developing &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aschizophrenia"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; later in life, though none of these factors separately predicts the illness. 

<h2>Opposition and Concerns</h2>
On the other hand, New South Wales' government proposals has been met with stiff opposition from various factions, including parts of the medical community. Doctor Alex Wodak, of the Australia Drug Law Reform Association in an interview with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;Australian Broadcasting Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said "I think many people, not just me, see this as more motivated by concern about the March 2007 elections than any public health measure."

"If governments were really serious about cannabis and in favour of draconian responses for a drug which after all, doesn't cause any deaths, then what would they do about a drug that causes 19,000 deaths in Australia a year - namely tobacco?" asked Dr Wodak. 

The NSW laws contrast with calls from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; for a relaxation of anti-cannabis laws. State leader Sandra Kanck said, "politicians and media commentators are getting on the bandwagon, saying we need to recriminalise the personal use of marijuana. That would make around 476,000 South Australians - 40 per cent of the population - retrospective criminals. About 75,000 people in the state would break the law each week if marijuana was criminalised. We need to recognise that drugs are used, and have appropriate policies to deal with that. Prohibition didn't work in America in the 1920s and it won't work now". 

<h2>Anti-Cannabis laws in other Australian jurisdictions</h2>
&lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Western%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital Territory&lt;/a&gt; already distinguish between cannabis which is grown hydroponically or using artificial light and conventional cannabis for possession offences.

South Australia also goes one step further by having separate penalties for cannabis possession in public and in private. In South Australia possession of up to 20 cannabis plants for personal use is punishable by a $500 fine.

When compared to other jurisdictions the Australian Capital Territory has the lightest penalties for cannabis offences. Penalties for cannabis possession range from $100 for possessing 25 grams of leaf or 2 or less "non-artificially cultivated" plants to a $5,000 fine and/or 2 years gaol for possessing an amount of cannabis not covered by the above.

The &lt;a href="Northern%20Territory%2C%20Australia"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt; has some of the toughest anti-drug laws in Australia when contrasted with other states. A person can receive a 25 year gaol sentence for having more than 20 plants in their possession.

<h2>Cannabis policy directions in other Western countries</h2>
The NSW government's decision to introduce tougher penalties for cannabis cultivation and possession comes at a time when other Western countries are relaxing their laws in this regard.

In the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, anti-cannabis laws vary greatly from state to state with respect to personal use, medical cannabis and cultivation. Cannabis is still broadly prohibited under the federal &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AControlled%20Substances%20Act"&gt;Controlled Substances Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the federal government selectively enforces the law so as to frustrate various forms of legalization at state and local levels, for example in ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGonzales%20v.%20Raich"&gt;Gonzales v. Raich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. 

Personal cannabis use in the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; is subject to a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADrug%20policy%20of%20the%20Netherlands"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of official tolerance, though it remains technically illegal. The Netherlands regulates the sale of cannabis in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACoffeehouse%23Cannabis%20coffee%20shops"&gt;coffee shops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , though the non-tolerance of cultivation above five personal plants creates an irregularity of supply (the so-called "back-door problem"). Legislation is under consideration to address this by regulating commercial cultivation. The current Protestant government has sought to limit the number of coffee shops, and in border towns bar sales to foreigners. 

Certain provinces of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; have adopted a policy of non-enforcement of anti-cannabis laws against personal use, to the point that in the Vancouver and Toronto areas, operation of cannabis cafés is tolerated, though they are not permitted to sell. Cultivation is still aggressively interdicted. The city of &lt;a href="Vancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; has drafted a licensing model similar to the Netherlands, which has not yet gone into force. The recent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20election%2C%202006"&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have brought a minority Conservative government, which may bring reversals in liberalization of cannabis laws. 

In the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; cannabis has been &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACannabis%20reclassification%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom"&gt;reclassified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a Class C drug, making it less likely for an individual to be arrested for possession. There is political pressure in the UK to either schedule strong cannabis separately or reverse the rescheduling altogether, citing the alleged dangers. On the dangers of strong cannabis, there is a similarity of public discourse especially between the UK and Australia.

Computer security experts warn that a malicious &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20worm"&gt;computer worm&lt;/a&gt;, dubbed "Kama Sutra," is set to wreak havoc this Friday, February 3rd on Microsoft Windows computers worldwide. Kama Sutra is designed to destroy files that end in .doc, .zip and .pdf.

The Kama Sutra worm has been spreading through cyberspace since January 16, packaged in emails with subject headings such as: "give me a kiss" and "crazy illegal sex."

When users click an email attachment, their PCs become infected with destructive, self-replicating software. The worm affects Microsoft Windows operating systems and is programmed to go to work on the third of every month, overwriting or corrupting Microsoft files and others such as Portable Document Format (PDF) files.

"This one can damage your office files, your Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and your PowerPoint presentations," Tino Klironomos, a computer retailer, said. "(The files will be) all gone, history."

Computer security company LURHQ reports that there may be hundreds of thousands of machines already infected with the worm, which also goes by the monikers "BlackWorm," "CME-24," "Blackmal," "Mywife.E" and "Nyxem."

To prevent the worm, Windows users should arm themselves with anti-virus software. People can also protect their PC with up-to-date anti-virus gear and firewall protection. Free anti-virus tools are available from many anti-virus organisations. These tools can detect and remove the Kama Sutra worm from an infected machine. 

Experts say: "Make sure your virus definitions are up to date. Besides being careful about opening email messages and attachments, users should back up their most valuable computer files on an external device such as a CD, zip drive or DVD."

Steve Bass at PC World says: "Stop worrying. If you update your virus program signatures regularly, and do a weekly AV scan, I don't think you have much to worry about..." 

Other advice is not to open any messages with the subject headers "crazy, illegal sex", "give me a kiss" and "hot movie."

The worm will not affect machines running on non-Windows operating systems such as &lt;a href="w%3AMac%20OS%20X"&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AGNU/Linux"&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Effects</h3>
Many security systems reported a very small amount of vandalism, even though the threats were very high.

<h1>RU486 Abortion pill hearings begin in Australia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=RU486%20Abortion%20pill%20hearings%20begin%20in%20Australia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian_Senate"&gt;Australian Senate inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into the abortion pill &lt;a href="w%3AMifepristone"&gt;"RU486"&lt;/a&gt; has started public hearings in Melbourne. A controversial conscience vote on the issue to overturn laws which prohibit Australian women's access to the drug, will be held in Federal parliament on February 9.

The Senate committee is considering a bill to remove ministerial control of the &lt;a href="w%3AAbortifacient"&gt;abortifacient&lt;/a&gt; drug Mifepristone - or RU486. Health Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony_Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; says the issue of whether to allow women access to the drug "is one of principle." Abbott, who is against abortion, insists he is the right person to control the drug's use in Australia.

Besides its use internationally as an "abortion pill", there may also be a small chance that it may help treat various other medical disorders including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and inoperable brain tumours amongst other conditions. Mifepristone is effectively banned in Australia, with Minister Abbott controlling whether it is made available. 

The bill, sponsored by a group of female senators and MPs, would hand Mr Abbott's powers over to the &lt;a href="w%3ATherapeutics_Goods_Administration"&gt;Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)&lt;/a&gt; - the body that controls all other pharmaceutical drugs in Australia. The bill seeks to have the TGA determine the drug's availability and not the Health Minister.

&lt;a href="w%3ALyn_Allison"&gt;Democrats Leader Lyn Allison&lt;/a&gt;, said she was "cautiously confident" the parliament will overturn the current arrangements when the conscience vote takes place. "Those who are in favour of the bill are saying this is a choice that ought to be available to women and that on the basis of the studies that have been done overseas it is at least as safe as surgical termination," Senator Allison said.

Reproductive Choice Australia (RCA)say that medicine is placed at the whim of politics, saying that over 80% of Australians are pro-choice. A national survey found 87% of women aged 18 to 49 support a woman’s right to choose.

RU486 is available in much of western Europe and North America, but was effectively banned in Australia under laws initiated by now-retired pro-life senator &lt;a href="w%3ABrian_Harradine"&gt;Brian Harradine&lt;/a&gt;.

Christine Read, medical director of family planning group FPA Health, said Misoprostol, also known as Cytotec, is across the world to invoke contractions to expel the fetus after a woman had taken RU486. "It is used extensively in obstetrics and gynaecology for termination of pregnancy and to induce labour, so it's used in the medical management of miscarriage," Dr Read said.

Dr Sharman Stone, said yesterday the issue was not about Misoprostol, but rather that "the TGA should make the decision about any drugs - that is its job. Any other conversations about other drugs are simply irrelevant to this argument," Dr Stone said.

&lt;a href="w%3AFamily_First_Party"&gt;Family First&lt;/a&gt; senator &lt;a href="w%3ASteve_Fielding"&gt;Steve Fielding&lt;/a&gt; says lifting a ban on RU486 would pave the way for do-it-yourself home abortions. "RU486 is different to other drugs in that it is an abortion drug which could see do-it-yourself home abortions," he said in a statement. "The question is, should policy be made by bureaucrats or our elected leaders?

Senator Fielding claims Australians are worried about the high number of abortions in Australia, as reflected in submissions received by the Senate committee.

On Monday the committee will move to Sydney for a final day of hearings.

<h1>Federal judge calls EPA head's post 9/11 conduct &quot;conscience-shocking&quot;.</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Federal%20judge%20calls%20EPA%20head%27s%20post%209/11%20conduct%20%26quot%3Bconscience-shocking%26quot%3B.&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Federal judge, Judge Deborah A. Batts refused to grant former &lt;a href="w%3AEnvironmental%20Protection%20Agency"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; (EPA) head, &lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Todd%20Whitman"&gt;Christine Todd Whitman&lt;/a&gt;, immunity from a class-action lawsuit brought by people in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. The suit seeks to hold Whitman personally liable for her actions as EPA administrator and the suit claims that thousands of people (including children) were "unnecessarily exposed" to airborne &lt;a href="w%3AAsbestos%23Asbestos-related_diseases"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt; and other hazardous substances.

"Whitman's deliberate and misleading statements made to the press, where she reassured the public that the air was safe to breathe around lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, and that there would be no health risk presented to those returning to those areas, shock the conscience." the judge said in her 83-page ruling. "Shock the conscience" is a legal standard that lawsuits must meet to hold U.S. government officials personally responsible for their actions.

"No reasonable person would have thought that telling thousands of people that it was safe to return to lower Manhattan, while knowing that such return could pose long-term health risks and other dire consequences, was conduct sanctioned by our laws," Batts said. The statements by Whitman came two days after the &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; in New York City that brought down the twin World Trade Towers. 
Batts noted that the EPA and Whitman repeatedly reassured residents that the air seemed safe to breathe. The EPA's own internal watchdog discovered that the agency gave misleading assurances apparently at the urging of &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; officials.

Bloomberg News states that calls to Whitman's consulting firm and to the EPA weren't immediately returned.

<h1>Tensions continue to rise in Middle East over &quot;Mohammad Cartoons&quot;</h1>

The publishing of a series of &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;cartoons&lt;/a&gt; of the Prophet &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad"&gt;Mohammad&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="w%3ACopenhagen"&gt;Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; newspaper sparked a string of harsh and in some places violent reactions in the Middle East, forcing European leaders to try to calm the situation.

This backlash started in late September 2005, when the &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten"&gt;Jyllands-Posten&lt;/a&gt; published a dozen cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad. The images ranged from serious to comical in nature; a particularly controversial cartoon portrays Mohammad with a bomb wrapped in his turban. The Jutland-based newspaper states that the images were meant to inspire some level of public debate over the image of Islam in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, and had no direct aim of offending anyone.

However, many Muslims follow the doctrine of &lt;a href="w%3AAniconism"&gt;aniconism&lt;/a&gt; concerning the portrayal of Mohammad. This tenet of Islam states that the Prophet Mohammad should not be depicted in any type of art, regardless of the intent of the piece. This belief, along with the potentially insensitive nature of some of the caricatures, have caused offense to many Muslims in the Arab world.

In the past month, the controversy over these cartoons escalated. The cartoons were re-published last month in &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; (where the latter two nations have large Muslim populations), and have begun to re-circulate throughout the Middle East. 

Many Danish companies have been targeted for boycotts. As ♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reported last week, Arla Foods, Denmark's top dairy company, has seen their sales fall to zero in some Middle East nations. Carrefour, a French retail chain, has pulled all Danish products from its shelves in the region. Earlier this week, protests were held throughout the region, including the Gaza Strip in Jerusalem, where &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; supporters led an assault and protest that surrounded the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; offices for &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;.

Hamas members, some armed with guns, stormed the EU office (which is primarily staffed by Arabs) and demanded apologies from EU member states, saying they would otherwise face serious consequences. "It will be a suitable reaction, and it won't be predictable," said Abu Hafss, a member of the Al Quds Brigade (an affiliate of the group &lt;a href="w%3AIslamic%20Jihad"&gt;Islamic Jihad&lt;/a&gt;), in a press conference outside the EU offices. And the Abu al-Reesh Brigades, a group related to the late Yassir Arafat's &lt;a href="w%3AFatah"&gt;Fatah&lt;/a&gt; party, warned that EU member states had 10 hours to apologize for the cartoons or their citizens would be "in danger".

Jamila Al Shanty, a newly elected Hamas legislator, stated that more rallies will be planned in protest of the cartoons. "We are angry - very, very, very angry," Al Shanty said today, adding that "No one can say a bad word about our prophet."

The Iranian newspaper Hamshari daily has stated that on February 8 it will publish anti-semitic cartoons in response to the Danish cartoons, apparently failing to notice that Denmark has only a tiny Jewish population, since most escaped to Sweden during the World War II &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;. The newspaper says that the cartoons will lampoon the Holocaust despite denials by the Iranian government that the Holocaust even happened.

♡❤Jyllands-Posten♡❤, the newspaper that first published the cartoons did issue an apology to Arab countries on Monday, shortly after the EU office incident. But with the support of the government of Denmark, the newspaper had earlier defended its actions fiercely, citing the universal right to free press, and its duty to serve democratic traditions by inspiring debate. Indeed, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Prime Minister of &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;, said "We are talking about an issue with fundamental significance to how democracies work." In fact, some European pundits have placed more fault on Muslims for refusing to "accept Western standards of free speech and pluralism". When the cartoons were originally published in 2005 they were intended to highlight and redress the unequal restrictions applied to Islamic content in European newspapers in comparison with content referring to other religions. The cartoons are also self-referential, with one character in the cartoons writing in Arabic on a blackboard "Jyllands-Posten's journalists are a bunch of reactionary provocateurs", and another cartoon showing a cartoonist having to work in hiding because one of the cartoons he is drawing includes an image of the Prophet &lt;a href="w%3AMohammad"&gt;Mohammad&lt;/a&gt;. The text around the cartoons stated:

However, some world leaders have elected to help defuse what could be a major social crisis in Europe and the Middle East. France's foreign minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said that freedom of the press should be exercised "in the spirit of tolerance", sentiments which were echoed by United Nations General Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt;. Ursula Plassnik, foreign minister of Austria, said that the European community must "clearly condemn" acts which insult religion. And &lt;a href="w%3AHamid%20Karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt;, president of Afghanistan, warned Europe that "any insult to the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) is an insult to more than one billion Muslims and an act like this must never be allowed to be repeated." 

Rasmussen, in an interview with Arabic TV Al arabia, said that "...Danish government condemns any expression and any action which offends people's religious feelings..." and also said that he does not understand why, as the cartoons were originally published in September, the situation has only truly started to deteriorate in the past week.

In Denmark, there are counter-demonstrations by moderate Muslims saying they don't want the images banned. Munira Mirza commented that many Muslims "want to be able to say: 'Hey we're not children, we can handle criticism, we don't need special protection - we're equal'. Many don't want to be treated as a special group, seen as worthy of more protection from criticism than other groups because of their apparent victim status."

Religious satirist Stewart Lee commented that ♡❤Jyllands-Posten♡❤ had "tried to deal with a subject they don't know enough about, and this is one of the teething problems of the cross-over of cultures in the world. I'm sure the level of offence is far greater than would have been intended."

<h3>In France</h3>
The director (Directeur de publication) of "&lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20Soir"&gt;France Soir&lt;/a&gt;", a French national newspaper was fired in response for publishing a cartoon titled: "Yes, we have the right to (joke about) characterise God" (Oui, on a le droit de caricaturer Dieu). The "France-Soir" web site is presently offline. The cartoon is partially visible on a nouvelobs.com website. 

Today, &lt;a href="w%3ALib%C3%A9ration"&gt;Libération&lt;/a&gt;, another French national newspaper, is publishing two of the "Mohammad Cartoons". Other newspapers across France are asking for their rights to freedom of the press to be defended.

&lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Hebdo"&gt;Charlie Hebdo&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known satirical newspaper, will publish articles to support cartoonists, &lt;a href="w%3Afreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt; and freedom of the press.

The general reaction in France seems to be that most citizens except religious people (Catholics, Muslims...) are astounded by the level of anger against the "Mohammad Cartoons".

<h3>In Australia</h3>
On February 9 2006 Queensland Premier Peter Beattie gave The Courier Mail Newspaper his blessings in publishing the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons/depictions of Muhammad stating that he is a firm believer in free speech and ones freedom of expression.
On the very same day he got his legal representative to write to the author of this site photoduck.com demanding he censor material relating to him and his Government.

<h3>Online</h3>
Although many newspapers have not republished the cartoons in order to avoid backlashes, the drawings have appeared on the Internet and are being revealed at a number of Web sites and blogs. On January 30th, Fox News contributor &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Malkin"&gt;Michelle Malkin&lt;/a&gt; placed the drawings on her blog, and encouraged others to do the same.

<h1>Indonesia warns Australia over West Papuan asylum seekers</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Indonesia%20warns%20Australia%20over%20West%20Papuan%20asylum%20seekers&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;'s ambassador to &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has warned that relations between the two neighbors could be "strained" if the Howard Government grants political asylum to a group of refugees from the troubled Indonesian province of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Papua"&gt;West Papua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The 43 West Papuans, pro-independence activists and their families, arrived on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACape%20York"&gt;Cape York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Australia on January 18 after a five-day voyage in an outrigger canoe. They were later taken to an immigration detention facility on &lt;a href="Christmas%20Island"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt;, a remote Australian territory in the Indian Ocean.

A spokesman for the group says they fear they will be killed if returned to Indonesian-controlled Papua, where a pro-independence movement has been operating since the 1960s.

Jakarta's ambassador warned of strained relations if they are granted asylum. Indonesia's ambassador, Teuku Mohammad Hamzah Thayeb, said the group had nothing to fear from Indonesian authorities. Asked if granting asylum to the group would strain Australia/Indonesia relations, Thayeb said: "I would hope it will not, but it certainly would have an effect. That's why we have to manage this together and find a solution." President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASusilo%20Bambang%20Yudhoyono"&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has also guaranteed the group's safety should they return.

Queensland National Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarnaby%20Joyce"&gt;Barnaby Joyce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who met with the 43 refugees on Christmas Island, said they appear to have a genuine asylum claim and had been persecuted because of their Christian beliefs. "There are documented cases of members within their families being shot," he said. "There's certainly on the record experiences of them being jailed and tortured so I think they would be under risk if they went back," he said.

The group, which includes seven children, arrived carrying a banner accusing Indonesia of terrorism and genocide in the province. Indonesian troops have been repeatedly accused of rights abuses in Papua province, which was taken over by Jakarta in 1963. Over 100,000 Papuans, one-sixth of the population, have died in military operations. 

Immigration Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said, "if they ask for protection we will consider the claim appropriately and if it is appropriate to offer it, we will offer it." 

The leader of the asylum seekers, Herman Wainggai, says the Indonesian military treat indigenous Papuans "like animals". Mr Thayeb disagreed: "We have changed fundamentally within ourselves," he said. 

Indonesia offered Papua special autonomy in 2001 in an effort to quell unrest from the Melanesian population in the resource-rich area. Mr Wainggai described the Papuan autonomy as a "sham", and said there have been many reports of the Indonesian military "murdering and raping people, and destroying villages since autonomy came into force."

Papua controversially became an Indonesia province after a vote in 1969 overseen by the United Nations called the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAct%20of%20Free%20Choice"&gt;"Act of Free Choice"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The Act of Free Choice was drafted by the UN and gave every adult the right to vote on the issue of independence. However, only 1022 people hand-picked by the Indonesian authorities were allowed to vote. Reinforcing the dubious nature of the poll, the voters gave 100 per cent approval to become part of Indonesia.

Indonesia's ambassador said there was no reason for the West Papuans to seek asylum as they were not criminals. 

The Australian Greens said the Indonesian ambassador's assurances that West Papuan asylum seekers would be safe if they returned home should not be believed.

"The new Indonesian Ambassador's assurances about the safety of West Papuan refugees if they are returned to Indonesia are not credible," Senator Nettle said. "The escalating repression of the independence movement and generalised suppression of the people of West Papua is well documented." 

"The Australian government should not give in to Indonesian pressure," Senator Nettle said.
Senator Joyce said the group of native West Papuans were Christian, which meant they are ethnically, religiously and politically isolated after an influx of Indonesians to the province.

Pharmaceutical giant &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AEli%20Lilly%20and%20Company"&gt;Eli Lilly and Company&lt;/a&gt; is currently engaged in a war of words with John Mack, editor of the monthly newsletter ♡❤Pharma Marketing News♡❤. Mack and Eli Lilly are debating the origin of the &lt;a href="w%3ATadalafil"&gt;Cialis&lt;/a&gt; Blog, a long-running Web site containing information about the popular anti-impotence medication Cialis. The Web site features information about Cialis' clinical trials and commentary from Lilly ICOS executives. 

Mack has suggested that Eli Lilly and Company sponsors the Cialis Blog. However, Lilly ICOS has asserted that it has nothing to do with the Web site. 

Mack disputed Eli Lilly's version of events calling the Cialis Blog "too far-fetched to be believed" and an example of Lilly's "incredible incompetence." Another blog, Envisioning 2.0, notes that the "Cialis blog is not endorsed by the powers that be at Lilly ICOS, according to Lilly spokesperson Kindra Strupp." 

♡❤Pharmaceutical Executive♡❤ first mentioned the Cialis blog in an October 2004 article about pharmaceutical blogging. The author of the story assigned responsibility for the blog to Lilly ICOS without attribution. 

Other bloggers have posted comments on Envisioning 2.0 and Mack's Pharma Marketing Blog suggesting that the Cialis Web site may be unofficial. They cite evidence from a WHOIS search indicating that Mircea Piturca of Romania apparently registered the blog. 

Mack and bloggers commenting on the debate have all urged Eli Lilly to take action against the site. They all believe it is in the company’s best interest to have the site shuttered.

<h1>Egyptian passenger ferry sinks in Red Sea</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Egyptian%20passenger%20ferry%20sinks%20in%20Red%20Sea&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An investigation has been commenced by &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; into the Friday sinking of one of El Salam's passenger ferries in the Red Sea. M/V al-Salam Boccaccio 98 was carrying 1408, including many Egyptians returning from work in &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;. The ship left from the port of Dubah in Saudi Arabia enroute to the port of Safaga in Egypt. On the west coast of Saudi Arabia during the night a sandstorm occurred due to high winds.

David Osler of &lt;a href="w%3A%20Lloyds%20List"&gt;Lloyd's List&lt;/a&gt; has said of the ship that "It's a roll-on, roll-off ferry, and there is big question mark over the stability of this kind of ship," he continued and said that "It would only take a bit of water to get on board this ship and it would be all over. ... The percentage of this type of ferry involved in this type of disaster is huge." 

Mamdouh Ismail, head of Al-Salaam Maritime Transport Company, stated that another one of El Salam's ferries, Saint Catherine received a distress call from one of the lifeboats of the Boccaccio when it arrived in Dubah from Safaga. The Saint Catherine notified its company headquarters, and El Salam reported it to Egyptian authorities.

According to a statement given to the ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ by Ismail, the ferry was carrying 96 crew members, 1,200 Egyptians, and 112 other passengers. A Transport Ministry spokesman has stated that 314 people have been rescued. More than 185 bodies have been recovered from the sea according to an Egyptian police official who has requested anonymity.

Four rescue ships from Egypt arrived Friday afternoon, approximately ten hours after the sinking of the 35-year-old ferry in the night near the Egyptian port of Hurghada. Aid from &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; was initially refused. Later, both the British HMS Bulwark and the US P3-Orion maritime naval patrol aircraft were recalled, but due to its distance at the later time, the request for the return of the Bulwark was called off by Egypt.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; television station &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204%20News%20%28Britain%29"&gt;Channel 4 News&lt;/a&gt; and newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; have reported that they have obtained a secret transcript of a meeting between &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and British &lt;a href="w%3Aprime%20minister"&gt;prime minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; on January 31, 2003, two months before the beginning of the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; war. The memo has been viewed by &lt;a href="w%3APhillipe%20Sands"&gt;Phillipe Sands&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of international law at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20College%20London"&gt;University College London&lt;/a&gt;, and by Channel 4 news. Last year, Professor Sands reported on doubts about the legality of the invasion in Iraq voiced by government lawyers, which eventually forced the British government to publish the full legal advice given to them by the attorney general.

According to the two sources, the transcript suggests that the &lt;a href="w%3Ainvasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; was already decided at the point of the meeting, and that Bush had stated that "the diplomatic strategy had to be arranged around the military planning". Blair is reportedly quoted as responding that he is "solidly with the president and ready to do whatever it took to disarm Saddam".

The memo from the sources also states that Bush suggested "flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft planes with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in UN colours", so that "if Saddam fired on them, he would be in breach [of UN resolutions]".

According to the memo, President Bush said he "thought it unlikely that there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and ethnic groups".

The British government did not deny the existence of the memo last night, but insisted that "the prime minister only committed UK forces to Iraq after securing the approval of the House of Commons in a vote on March 18, 2003." It added that they "do not comment on the prime minister's conversations with other leaders."

The BBC reported that Chief spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Security%20Council"&gt;National Security Council&lt;/a&gt; Frederick Jones said that "the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; would not comment on what was said or not said in alleged private conversations between Mr Bush and foreign leaders," and added that the White House "was not going to re-litigate how the nation went to war". 

The purported document has not been confirmed as authentic by either government so far.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; swimmer &lt;a href="w%3ALeisel%20Jones"&gt;Leisel Jones&lt;/a&gt; has broken two swimming world records this week. Swimming at the Australian trials in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Games"&gt;Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;, Leisel knocked over one second off her old 200 m breast stroke world record, coming in at 2:20.54.

Two days later she did it again, this time knocking almost half a second off the 100 m breast stroke. Finishing in 1:05.71 she regained the 100 m record from Jessica Hardy, who had beaten Leisel's old record in the semi-finals at last years World Championships in &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;.

Also at the trials, Libby Lenton set a new 100 m freestyle world record of 53.42 and Jade Edmistone reduced the 50 m breast stroke record to 30.31.

The 'Kama Sutra' worm is set to strike today. The worm is programmed to activate itself on the third of every month - overwriting or corrupting Microsoft Office Word documents, Microsoft Office Excel spread sheets, and Portable Document Format files. Experts say the worm, also known as "BlackWorm," "CME-24," "Blackmal," "Mywife.E" and "Nyxem", can be avoided simply by having and updated anti-virus program and doing a weekly scan.

The publishing of a series of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a Copenhagen newspaper, starting in September 2005, sparked a string of harsh and violent reactions in the Middle East. The controversy recently escalated, with many European companies being boycotted in the Middle East and Hamas members storming the EU office demanding apologies from EU member states.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Pentagon%27s%20Quadrennial%20Defense%20Review%20released&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; released its findings from its &lt;a href="w%3AQuadrennial%20Defense%20Review"&gt;Quadrennial Defense Review&lt;/a&gt; today. This review focuses mainly on defining and identifying weak points in &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; defenses, and prescriptions for improvements in those areas. 

This review, known as the Quadrennial Defense Review because Congress requires it every four years, does not alter the Pentagon's approach in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. It also leaves intact the Defense Department's broader strategy for keeping the U.S. military big enough to fight other major conflicts.

The plan proposes a 4.8% boost to the Department of Defense budget, eliminates no major weapons programs and includes an 8 percent overall increase for weapons (to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;84 billion) for the budget year starting Sept. 30. This review excludes the Energy Department's nuclear weapons programs.

Overall, there was an emphasis on finding ways to adopt a more indirect approach to the war on terror; a shifted emphasis from performing tasks to enabling other countries to perform. Some of the specific proposals include:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Expansion of special operations forces by 15%; the Army's Green Berets and the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20Navy%20SEALs"&gt;Navy SEAL&lt;/a&gt; commandos, for example, who are trained in specialized warfare skills that are often utilized covertly in cooperation with the armed forces of small countries.

</ul>

<ul>
BULLET::::- An increase by 3,700 (or about one-third) of &lt;a href="w%3Apsyops"&gt;psychological warfare&lt;/a&gt; and civil affairs units. These are in heavy demand in Iraq and Afghanistan because of their role working with local civilian authorities to build trust and influence perceptions of U.S. forces.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Building new partnerships in the "War on Terror" by increasing time spent training other armies, navies and air forces, particularly in places, where U.S. troops have not traditionally operated. This in turn, will call for an increased mastery of other languages and better knowledge of foreign cultures.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- More officers serving stints in foreign militaries to better develop long-term relationships and regional expertise.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The creation by the Navy, of a force of small boats that can be utilized in inland waterways abroad to help countries build their own maritime forces to combat terrorists.

</ul>
Other highlights include:

<ul>
BULLET::::- A proposed 10 percent reduction in the fleet of Minuteman III land-based nuclear missiles, from 500 to 450 missiles. Also, the conversion of some nuclear missiles on Trident submarines to non-nuclear missiles within two years. The Pentagon did not specifically state how many are to be converted.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- A five-year, $1.5 billion program to develop medical countermeasures for bioterrorism threats.

The &lt;a href="w%3APresidency%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush Administration&lt;/a&gt; said Thursday that it will request a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense"&gt;Defense Department&lt;/a&gt; budget of US$439.3 billion for 2007. This is an increase of over 4%. This does not include a planned supplemental bill to fund ongoing actions in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

The proposal's details are still not final, but the budget that &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; will submit next week will be for planning purposes. $2.3 billion of the budget will go to preparing for a &lt;a href="w%3ABird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; epidemic.

Many weapons programs were tweaked but no major weapon system was cut. Funding for unmanned aircraft will be increased.

An aging ferry deemed unsafe sank in the &lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Sea"&gt;Red Sea&lt;/a&gt; on Friday with about 1400 people on board, mostly &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ians who travel back and forth to &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; to work as guest workers.

Egyptian President &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Hosni Mubarak&lt;/a&gt;'s spokesman, Suleiman Awad, said there were not enough lifeboats, and questions were raised about the safety of the old ship that had 220 cars on it as well as the passengers. "The speed with which the ship sank and the lack of sufficient lifeboats indicate there was some deficiency," Awad said.

"It's a roll-on, roll-off ferry, and there is big question mark over the stability of this kind of ship," said David Osler of Lloyds List. "It would only take a bit of water to get on board this ship and it would be all over. ... The percentage of this type of ferry involved in this type of disaster is huge."

Tens of thousands of poor Egyptians work in &lt;a href="w%3APersian%20Gulf"&gt;Persian Gulf&lt;/a&gt; countries for years to earn money. They travel by ship as it is a cheaper option than flying.

&lt;a href="w%3ATuberculosis"&gt;Tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; does not frequently make headlines, but it kills about two million people each year. In a new effort to fight the disease, the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership on January 27 requested US$31 billion for a Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis, which the Partnership claims would prevent an estimated 14 million TB deaths during the next ten years.

To kick-off the funding drive, &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; pledged to donate US$600 million. "Every 15 seconds somebody dies of TB, avoidably, preventably," said &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Chancellor of the Exchequer &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, who helped launch the Plan at the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Economic%20Forum"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; in Davos, &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. "I welcome the &lt;a href="w%3AGates%20Foundation"&gt;Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement today. For far too long, world leaders have ignored the global tuberculosis epidemic, even as it causes millions of needless deaths each year," said Brown.

"The Global Plan is fundamental for &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, where tuberculosis was declared an emergency by 46 countries in 2005," said &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigerian&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AOlusegun%20Obasanjo"&gt;Olusegun Obasanjo&lt;/a&gt;.

Tuberculosis is a contagious disease caused by bacteria that spread through the air and usually attack the lungs. One-third of the world's population is now infected, and 5-10% of infected people suffer active TB disease sometime during their lives. Left untreated, each person with active TB will infect on average between ten and 15 people every year. 

TB is active worldwide, though most deaths are in Southeast Asia and Africa. 

Drugs in use for more than four decades can cure the disease. The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Bank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; ranked a common TB-treatment strategy, called DOTS, as one of the "most cost-effective of all health interventions". 

A childhood vaccine against tuberculosis has been available for more than 75 years.

"This is a disease with a huge impact that is completely treatable and preventable," said Dr. Peter Small, a member of the Stop TB coordinating board. "It's not that we can't do something about it, it's that we've chosen not to."

In addition to limited funding, the fight against TB has also been hampered in recent years by two developments. Because &lt;a href="w%3AHIV"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; weakens the immune system, people who have the virus that causes AIDS are much more likely to become ill with tuberculosis than those who are HIV-negative. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV/AIDS.

The second problem lately has been the evolution of drug resistance among many strains of the bacteria that cause tuberculosis. Some strains, called multi-drug resistant, are immune to the effects of more than one drug.

Stop TB claims that full funding of the Plan will help achieve the &lt;a href="w%3AMillennium%20Development%20Goal"&gt;Millennium Development Goal&lt;/a&gt; to have "halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of tuberculosis." The Plan aims to provide:

<ol>
BULLET::::1. Improve treatment access--prevent 14 million TB deaths and provide treatment to 50 million people.
BULLET::::2. New drugs--develop and distribute the first new TB treatment regimen in nearly 40 years.
BULLET::::3. New vaccine--develop a safe, affordable vaccine to improve upon the existing vaccine, which has been in use since the early 1900s.
BULLET::::4. New diagnostics--develop efficient, effective, and affordable diagnostic tests for TB--the first in more than a century.

</ol>
"We have a unique historic opportunity to stop tuberculosis," said Dr. Marcos Espinal, Executive Secretary of the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership. "The challenge now is for people to work together in putting the plan into action, in order to stop one of the oldest and most lethal diseases known to humanity. This plan tells the world exactly what we need to do in order to defeat this global killer."

There has already been significant progress against TB over the past several years. Since 2000, estimated spending on tuberculosis control in the 22 hardest-hit countries has increased from US$800 million to US$1.2 billion; as a result, the number of patients receiving TB treatment in these countries more than doubled.

According to Stop TB, implementing the new Plan will require US$56 billion over ten years--US$47 billion for expanding access to treatments already available, and US$9 billion for research and development of new diagnostic tools, drugs, and vaccines. The total number is US$31 billion more than the amount Stop TB estimates will be spent if current funding trends continue. The investment, the group insists, would have a profound effect on the number of tuberculosis cases averted and lives saved.

&lt;a href="w%3AYork_Chow"&gt;Dr York Chow&lt;/a&gt; says new laws will be introduced to restrict movement of poultry. "It's not just Hong Kong, he said. "This virus will exist in neighboring areas, southern China as well as Hong Kong," Dr Chow said. "Since different kinds of wild birds and chickens have this virus, we can be quite sure that this virus is endemic in our birds," he said.

Health bureau spokeswoman Sally Kong later clarified Dr Chow's comments, saying the Secretary meant that bird flu was endemic in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; - but not in Hong Kong specifically. Whilst Bird flu is considered endemic in &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Laos"&gt;Laos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cambodia"&gt;Cambodia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, international standards require that countries be certified as 'endemic' by test results showing a cycle of disease recurrence in an area. Mrs Kong said Hong Kong does not meet such standards. 

York Chow said the government intends to ban individual households from raising chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, turkeys and quails. The legislation to ban private ownership could be in place next week. Current Hong Kong legislation allows private poultry ownership of up to 20 birds. Under the law change, the current exemption will be removed. The unauthorised keeping of poultry will be an offence warranting fines of up to $100,000, however, those keeping commercial racing pigeons in new towns and villages may be exempt.

Dr Chow encouraged the surrender of backyard poultry to the Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Conservation Department. Those who want to keep birds before the new legislation comes into effect must have them vaccinated against avian flu. The Government may set a date for the central slaughtering, Dr Chow said.

Permanent Secretary for Health, Welfare &amp; Food, Carrie Yau, stated that the risk of a bird flu outbreak still exists even if chickens are vaccinated - as the virus may mutate. She asked private poultry give their birds to the Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Conservation Department. 

She stressed there will not be any compensation.

The department visited 35 villages and 1,500 households in Sha Tau Kok and the North District in the past two days, with 113 chickens collected and another 112 vaccinated. The department's Acting Assistant Director Thomas Sit said most backyard poultry owners do not implement biosecurity measures. He called on owners to surrender their poultry.

The Customs &amp; Excise Department has stepped up patrols to prevent the inflow of smuggled chickens.

The &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; tabloid ♡❤&lt;a href="%3Aw%3AEkstraBladet"&gt;Ekstra Bladet&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has published a 43-page document allegedly used by Danish Islamists in an international tour meant to involve the Arab world in a backlash against the Mohammad Cartoons. 

The document contains several "extra" cartoons showing Mohammad as a pig, Mohammad sodomised by a dog and Mohammad as a pedophile. These cartoons have been said to be fabrications intended to heat up the issue.

The recent surge of indignation among many Muslims occurred three full months after the original publication of the cartoons.

The last few months have seen the number of land conflicts involving indigenous people increase rapidly. &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; has 400,000 "first people", many of whom express that they need more respect.

Hundreds of Indians occupied eight plots of land last week in an attempt to reclaim what they claim is their property. They were calling themselves victims and they threatened to destroy power lines.

In the southern region of Brazil, around a dozen Indians were injured in a police operation which apparently led to the destruction of two villages on land which is the focus of a legal dispute with the Aracruz Cellulose company.

There have been incidents throughout Brazil. The Amazon jungle in the north, and in the southern state of Catarina where eight Indians were arrested for property invasion and aggression.

The indigenous people have organized themselves over the past three decades. They have become a "political force", said Rubem de Almeida a local anthropologist.

The government of Brazil have been somewhat successful in bringing about improvements which improve the reality for the indigenous communities.

Some of the indigenous people say they can't simply wait for the mainstream; so in April of this year there are major demonstrations planned.

The &lt;a href="IAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt; board has passed a resolution to report &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt;. The decision by the 35-nation board came on Saturday. 

The resolution was made without waiting for the director of the IAEA, &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, to finish preparing a report on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran%27s%20nuclear%20program"&gt;Iran's civilian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;allegedly military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) nuclear programs for the regular IAEA meeting scheduled for March 6. According to &lt;a href="al-Jazeera"&gt;♡❤al-Jazeera♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, ElBaradei refused to accept pressure from Western states to finish his report in advance of the March 6 meeting. ElBaradei said in written responses to requests by the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; member states that he had given Iran until the meeting in March to answer questions to IAEA enquiries, stating, ♡❤Due process, therefore, must take its course before &lt;nowiki&gt;[we are]&lt;/nowiki&gt; able to submit a detailed report♡❤. ElBaradei also said that another IAEA verification mission was due in Iran shortly and that he had only in mid-January sent extra questions to Iran based on what diplomats called newly released intelligence.

The text of the resolution, made without the results of the report, which will only be ready in March, requires ElBaradei to report to the Security Council "steps Iran needs to take to dispel suspicions about its nuclear ambitions."

The resolution states that there are serious concerns about Iran's nuclear program. It also notes, "Iran's many failures and breaches of its obligations," (to the non-proliferation treaty) and expresses "the absence of confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes." 

The resolution also states that Iran is to:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Re-establish a freeze on uranium enrichment and related activities;

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Consider whether to stop construction of a heavy water reactor that could be the source of plutonium for weapons;

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Formally ratify an agreement allowing the IAEA greater inspecting authority and continue honoring the agreement before it is ratified; and

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Give the IAEA additional power in its investigation of Iran’s nuclear program, including "access to individuals" for interviews, as well as to documentation on its black-market nuclear purchases, equipment that could be used for nuclear and non-nuclear purposes and "certain military-owned workshops" where nuclear activities could take place

</ul>
The resolution calling for the referral was apparently drafted by several members states of the European Union together with the United States. Political analyst Joshua Frank claims that the US is not interested in diplomatic means of limiting Iran's possible shift towards nuclear weapons development and that the major reasons are Iran's oil supplies and plans to open an International Oil Bourse in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apetroeuro"&gt;petroeuros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which would challenge the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apetrodollar"&gt;petrodollar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , on March 20, 2006.

The agency vote sets the stage for future action by the top U.N. body. &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; insisted, in casting their votes with the majority, that future votes on deliberations should wait until at least March. The outcome could include economic and political sanctions. This process of successive escalation of the tension between Iran and the Western members of the Security Council was described by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Blix"&gt;Hans Blix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , responsible for about 700 inspections for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aspin%20%28public%20relations%29"&gt;spin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and momentum♡❤. He was in favour of ♡❤inducing Iran to forego enrichment♡❤ but also recommended that the United States give a similar commitment not to attack Iran with either conventional or nuclear weapons, just as it apparently has to &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;.

27 of the 35 nations on the board voted for the referral.

Three nations that voted against the resolution: &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. Five other countries &lt;a href="Algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belarus"&gt;Belarus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, abstained. 
Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20weapons"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; state obliged under Article VI of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to destroy its own, existing nuclear weapons, said that the IAEA vote showed "the international community's determination to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East."

<h3>Iranian reactions</h3>
After the decision, Iran said today that it would "immediately" begin the steps to "restart full-scale uranium enrichment" and "curtail" the powers of the IAEA inspectors.

Javad Vaeedi, deputy Iranian nuclear negotiator, said in a press conference after the vote, "After this decision, Iran has to immediately bring into force its parliamentary law to suspend voluntary implementation of (the watchdog agency's) Additional Protocol (on snap inspections) and (pursue) commercial-scale enrichment which until today was under full suspension." He also said, "this resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on legal or technical grounds."

Iran has also said that a proposed deal by &lt;a href="Moscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; to enrich Iranian uranium is dead. 

"There is no adequate reason to pursue the Russian plan," said Vaeedi. "Commercial scale uranium enrichment will be resumed in Natanz in accordance with the law passed by the parliament."

Iran had said that it will "end cooperation with IAEA", if referred to the Security Council. 

As of January 31, 2006, the Deputy Director General for Safeguards of the IAEA had reported that ♡❤Iran has continued to facilitate access under its Safeguards Agreement as requested by the Agency, and to act as if the Additional Protocol is in force, including by providing in a timely manner the requisite declarations and access to locations.♡❤

A &lt;a href="w%3ABHP%20Billiton"&gt;BHP Billiton&lt;/a&gt; nickel mine at Leinster, 645Km northeast of Perth, &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; has halted operations after the death of a mine worker. WA Police say Mark Quinn, 32, an employee of mining contractor MacMahon's, working about 900 metres underground, was killed in an explosion.

The cause of the explosion is not yet known. Department of Community and Employment Protection investigators have travelled to the site from &lt;a href="w%3AKalgoorlie"&gt;Kalgoorlie&lt;/a&gt; to conduct an inquiry.

Global resources giant BHP Billiton Ltd./Plc, says employees are being briefed and counselled over the incident. The mine will remain closed until the investigation is complete. Police will prepare a report for the coroner. 

According to media reports, no-one else was injured in the explosion - the cause of which is not yet known. The accident comes almost two years after a BHP Billiton worker died in a gas explosion at the Boodarie iron plant in Port Hedland, WA. The plant was then abandoned after the incident in May 2004.

In April 2004, a man was killed at BHP Billiton's Nelson Point facility, also at Port Hedland in WA. In May 2000 a truck driver was killed at a BHP Pilbara iron ore operation in WA. BHP Billiton employ some 37,000 people at over 100 operations in 25 countries.

Coal mines in the United States' &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; district were also suspended earlier this week, due to increased amounts of miners' deaths.

&lt;a href="w%3ARio%20Tinto%20Group"&gt;Rio Tinto Group&lt;/a&gt;, the world's third-largest miner, say they will return a record annual profit of over AU$5.32 billion to shareholders, following surging commodity prices - doubling the group's profit. Earnings from operations jumped 118 percent last year.

The London-based company unveiled a net profit of 58 per cent on the previous year. The result was boosted by increases in commodity prices driven by demand from &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;. Chinese interests account for around 15 percent of Rio Tinto's sales.

Rio Tinto's CEO, Leigh Clifford said demand for iron ore remains strong. Prices for the steelmaking raw material and metalshave climbed to records amid rising demand from China. 

"China clearly continues to have a major impact on what they are doing," said Tim Barker at BT Financial Group. "With commodity prices as strong as they are at the moment, and not showing any signs of a change of direction, one would think there is still room for some improvement in earnings in 2006," he said.

The company produced 65 million tons of iron ore in the second half, 15 percent more than a year ago. Rio and other miners last year secured a record 71.5 percent price increase.

Rio Tinto say they are studying further mine expansion and will invest around $9 billion to meet the global demand led by China. Projects include expanding WA iron ore mines, its coal mine in NSW and copper interests in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;. 

Other investments would see the expansion of a titanium dioxide project in &lt;a href="Madagascar"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, in the Cortez Hills gold venture in the USA, and in the Argyle Diamonds underground mine development in North West Australia.

The &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; embassies in &lt;a href="w%3ADamascus"&gt;Damascus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; have been set alight by crowds numbering in the thousands. Reports indicate both embassies have been destroyed by fire. The building hosting the Danish embassy also contained the embassies of &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.

The Danish embassy was initially torched, at a time when it was reportedly empty. Officials and staff had been evacuated. Attempts to disperse the protest outside the embassy using tear gas were carried out by Syrian police and it is reported that a number of protesters were taken to hospital.

The attacks on the embassies may have been provoked by text messages which reportedly circulated among Syrians claiming that Danes would burn copies of the &lt;a href="w%3AQur%27an"&gt;Qur'an&lt;/a&gt; in a Copenhagen square. Some of those who gathered outside the embassies in Damascus were reported to have been chanting, "With our blood and souls we defend you, O Prophet of God. There is no god but God and Muhammad is the messenger of God."

Earlier in the week, text messaging circulated in Egypt that said;
"Denmark wants to burn the sacred Qur'an Saturday in Copenhagen in response to the Muslim boycott," and "Send (this message on) and you will be rewarded," the text said.

Despite claims in the text messages that the holy book of Islam would be burned on Saturday, there were no reports to indicate that it occurred.

Authorities have killed the man sought in connection with an attack on patrons of a gay bar in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Bedford%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;New Bedford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday night, February 1. Jacob D. Robida, 18, of New Bedford was wanted on suspicion of three counts of attempted murder and hate crimes.

Robida entered Puzzles Lounge around 11:30 pm Wednesday night and asked if it was a gay bar. The bartender said yes and served Robida a drink acquired with a fake ID.

After finishing the drink and ordering a second one, Robida moved to the back of the bar where a game of pool was being played and started swinging a hatchet at a customer's head. While the bartender was calling the police, Robida struck a second patron with the hatchet and then pulled out a gun shooting the first victim in the face and the second twice in the head. A third person was also shot.

Robida was captured Saturday February 4, 2006 in Norfork, Arkansas after a gunfight with police. A police chase began after Robida killed a police officer who pulled him over for a routine traffic stop. After his car was spotted on Arkansas Highway 201 he was chased into Norfork and stopped at a police barricade. Once stopped Robida killed the passenger in his car and fired on police. At this point the police returned fire and shot Robida twice in the head, and he was then taken to a hospital in Springfield, Missouri.

Robida died at 3:38 a.m. Sunday February 5, 2006 as a result of his injuries. The female passenger who was traveling with Robida and was killed before the shoot out with police has been identified as Jennifer Rena Bailey of Charleston, West Virginia. She appears to have had a prior relationship with Robida, however his reason for picking her up and later killing her is still unknown.

Twelve Merlin have been purchased; in three different models: six SAR (for use with Search &amp; Rescue), four in CSAR (for deployment of troops to zones out of the country) and two in SIFICAP (for Fisheries Control).

The Merlin is capable of carrying more than 3 tons, its maximum speed is 309 km/h and it has a range of 1390 km. The Merlin is the helicopter used for the transportation of the president of the United States &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and other VIP's.

Four Puma operating in the Azores and in Madeira will continue in service, for the next few months, until the last four Merlin CSAR helicopters are delivered. The air force is currently considering using these four onboard a future logistic support ship. (&lt;a href="w%3ALanding%20Platform%20Dock"&gt;LPD&lt;/a&gt;)

A ceremony was held at the Air Base of Montijo, attending was Portuguese minister of National Defence, Luís Amado. He said during the ceremony that the old Puma might be converted for civilian protection missions, such as &lt;a href="w%3Afire%20fighting"&gt;fire fighting&lt;/a&gt;.

"The Government will decide the future of the Puma helicopters on the board of appreciation that is being done with other sectors of the Government, namely the Ministry of Internal Administration, in the possibility of the Puma being adapted for other missions, for example on the scope of the civilian protection".

The Merlin, was purchased in 2001 by the Government of &lt;a href="w%3AAnt%C3%B3nio%20Guterres"&gt;António Guterres&lt;/a&gt;. The two first helicopters arrived in February 11 of last year, being held in February 24 an official ceremony in the Montijo Air Base, attending both the president of the Portuguese Republic, &lt;a href="w%3AJorge%20Sampaio"&gt;Jorge Sampaio&lt;/a&gt;, and the then minister of National Defense, &lt;a href="w%3APaulo%20Portas"&gt;Paulo Portas&lt;/a&gt;.

They have cost the Portuguese Government &lt;a href="w%3AEuro"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;446 million, (approximately US$536 million). This deal has given €60 million in counterparts, relatively in orders of production in the workshops of &lt;a href="w%3AOGMA"&gt;OGMA&lt;/a&gt;. It's expected that this sum will grow to almost a total of €315 million.
<h2>Most recent mission</h2>

At dawn on Thursday, a Puma took off from the Lajes Air Base to the Hekabe, a ship that was 250 km from the cost of the &lt;a href="w%3ATerceira%20Island"&gt;Terceira Island&lt;/a&gt;, in Azores, evacuate a &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; sailor with the symptoms of a appendicitis. After refuelling in &lt;a href="w%3AFaial"&gt;Faial&lt;/a&gt; the helicopter reached the ship at 0825 UTC. Seventy minutes later the Puma landed on the Faial Island Airport and the patient went to the Horta Hospital.

<h2>Removal of dangerous cargo</h2>
During December 21 and 22 an SA330 Puma helicopter, from the Lajes Air Base, was called to aid in the transportation of dangerous substances from the Russian ship "CP Valour" to land. The ship wrecked on December 9, 2005, near the &lt;a href="w%3AFaial%20Island"&gt;Faial Island&lt;/a&gt;, due to bad weather conditions, and had in its manifest some containers considered dangerous.

&lt;a href="w%3APictou%20Island%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29"&gt;Pictou Island&lt;/a&gt; had 2,000 to 3,000 seals on it when struck by a "severe" storm that buried the tiny &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; island in snow and created rough ocean effects Wednesday and Thursday.

Jane MacDonald, an island resident, said that she woke up Thursday morning to see "wall to wall seals" and their puppies "decimated" by the storm.

MacDonald commented, "The seal puppies were literally swept away into the water because their mothers couldn't get them to higher ground. A wave would hit and the pup went under. The mother pushed it up with her nose, and then another wave would hit."

"After the sixth or seventh wave, the pup didn't come up," MacDonald said. "The more you watched, the worse it got. The mothers struggled so hard to save their babies and it just couldn't be done, I'd never seen anything like that."

The spouse selection aid program created by former minister and doctor of psychology John Van Epp has been adopted by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army"&gt;US Army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChaplain"&gt;chaplains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Since the onset of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; campaign in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, 56,000 of the active duty, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Army%20Reserve"&gt;Army Reserve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; personnel have been divorced. The program titled "No Jerks" was adopted with the intent of providing Army personnel subject to periods of long deployment with effective advice for consideration in the selection of spouses who are able to adapt to the circumstances that military service causes in regard to the potential family stresses of possible injury also.

Army spokeswoman Martha Rudd has said in regard to marrying in to the military that "not everybody is cut out."

Van Epp said of the high divorce rates and increased prevalence of domestic violence that "Settings like military bases are incubators ... They try to hatch ... relationships extremely fast." Epp sent 200 program workbooks to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; in January 2006.

Among 23 militants that broke out of a jail in &lt;a href="Sana%C3%A1%2C%20Yemen"&gt;Sanaá&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Yemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, were 13 &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; members, two of which were convicted for the bombings of the &lt;a href="w%3AUSS%20Cole%20%28DDG-67%29"&gt;USS ♡❤Cole♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and the French supertanker ♡❤&lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALimburg%20%28tanker%29"&gt;Limburg&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, said &lt;a href="Interpol"&gt;Interpol&lt;/a&gt;.

Interpol released a "urgent global security alert" after the men escaped. The alert calls the escapees "dangerous individuals." 

Interpol's Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said in the alert that at least 13 of the 23 men were, "convicted al Qaeda terrorists, some of whom were involved in attacks on U.S. and French ships in 2000 and 2002. Their escape cannot be considered an internal problem for Yemen alone. Unless Interpol Red Notices are issued urgently for these fugitives and unless the world community commits itself to tracking them down, they will be able to travel internationally, to elude detection and to engage in future terrorist activity."

Noble also added that "Al Qaeda terrorists have been deemed a serious threat to the entire world community by the U.N. Security Council, by Interpol and by a wide range of countries."

Noble said that he issued the alert himself because, "the escape and unknown whereabouts of Al-Qaeda terrorists constituted a clear and present danger to all countries."

Reports also say among the escapees are top militants &lt;a href="w%3AJamal%20Ahmed%20Badawi"&gt;Jamal Ahmed Badawi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFawaz%20al-Rabeiee"&gt;Fawaz Yahya Al-Rabeei&lt;/a&gt;. 

Interpol says the men had escaped by digging a 220-foot long tunnel which took them to a mosque.

Rabeie is the leader of the group responsible for the ♡❤Limburg♡❤ explosion in 2002 which killed one &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;n crew member, injured 12 others and spilled 90,000 barrels of oil into the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGulf%20of%20Aden"&gt;Gulf of Aden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . He was facing the death penalty. 

Badawi was serving a 15 year sentence for the bombing of the Cole in 2000 which killed 17 sailors. He was sentenced in May of 2003. After his sentencing Badawi declared, "This is an unjust verdict, this is an American verdict. There are no human rights in the world, except for the Americans. All the Muslims in the world are being used to serve American interests." 

Terrorists used an inflatable raft to carry out the attack on the ♡❤Cole♡❤.

Additionally, reports suggest that Abu Assem al-Ahdal, a leading Al-Qaeda official in Yemen, may also be among those that have escaped.

The man who was suspected of attacking three men in a gay bar in Massachusetts died early Sunday morning after being shot in a gun battle with &lt;a href="w%3AArkansas%20State%20Police"&gt;Arkansas State Police&lt;/a&gt;.

Jacob D. Robida, 18, fled Massachusetts on Friday after a warrant was put out for his arrest in the aforementioned gay bar attack. Along the way he picked up his girlfriend, 33-year-old Jennifer Rena Bailey, in &lt;a href="w%3ACharleston%2C%20West%20Virginia"&gt;Charleston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="West%20Virginia"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;. Robida was pulled over in a traffic stop by &lt;a href="w%3AGassville%2C%20Arkansas"&gt;Gassville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; Police Officer Jim Sell. Sell asked Robida to get out of the car, and Robida shot him three times before getting back in the car and leaving. A witness called 911, but Sell died at the scene.

Robida led &lt;a href="w%3ABaxter%20County%2C%20Arkansas"&gt;Baxter County&lt;/a&gt;, Arkansas sheriff's officers and Arkansas State Police officers on a high-speed chase. Robida ran over spike strips in Norfolk and drove on two flat tires for a while. He ultimately wrecked his car into some parked vehicles while trying to avoid a roadblock on Arkansas State Road 5. Robida shot at the officers, who returned fire, shooting Robida twice in the head. Bailey was killed in the gunfight; though some witness said Robida shot her before firing on the officers, an autopsy and forensic investigation will determine how she died.

Robida was rushed to Cox-South Hospital in &lt;a href="w%3ASpringfield%2C%20Arkansas"&gt;Springfield&lt;/a&gt;, Arkansas, where he was pronounced dead at 3:38 a.m. CST (0938 UTC).

Former &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Latham"&gt;Mark Latham&lt;/a&gt; has been issued with court attendance notices for assault, malicious damage and stealing from person by Campbelltown Police.

The notices follow an altercation between Latham and a Daily Telegraph photographer on January 19.

Police briefs allege that Latham snatched the photographer's camera worth $12,000 and started to walk to his car. 

When the photographer demanded that Latham return his camera, Latham is alleged to have thrown a punch at the photographer, but did not injure him. 

Police later found that the camera had been destroyed.

Sydney's Daily Telegraph said following the incident last month that it intended to claim $12,000 against Latham for damage to a camera carried by its photographer.

Latham is due to appear in Campbelltown Local Court on March 22.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;Catholic&lt;/span&gt; priest Andrea Santore, 61, who was based at the Trabzon Santa Maria Catholic Church was shot dead during prayer in the northern &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; province of Trabzon on Sunday. The murderer, a 17-18 year old man is being sought by the police. The killer entered the church at 3:45 pm and shot the Italian priest from behind. Andrea Santore was praying at the time.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the assassination of a Catholic priest. Many people in Turkey associate this incident with the current crisis over the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in European papers.

In &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; Sunday, protesters set fire to the building housing the &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; mission. About 200 people were detained by police, 30 were injured and at least one person died according to officials. Prime Minister Fuad Saniora said 76 &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syrians&lt;/a&gt;, 35 &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20people"&gt;Palestinians&lt;/a&gt; and 38 Lebanese were arrested.

Ghazi Aridi,Lebanese Information Minister, said that the Lebanese government had unanimously "rejected and condemned the ... riots," which "harmed Lebanon's reputation and its civilized image and the noble aim of the demonstration." 

"The Cabinet apologizes to Denmark," said Aridi.

Four-hundred protestors threw fire bombs and stones at the Danish embassy in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; today as part of continuing reaction to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMohammad%20cartoons"&gt;Mohammad cartoons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , originally published in &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. Iranian &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ariot%20police"&gt;riot police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were sent in, but several protestors made their way into the embassy and burned documents before being removed. Tear gas was used against the demonstrators, at least nine of which were injured.

Denmark has repeated its request to the Iranian government for better protection of its embassy. Iran's minister of trade has halted all trade between the two countries. It is rumored that Iran is planning to review its trade ties with all of the countries in which the cartoons have been published. Iran's ambassador in Denmark has returned to Iran.

Demonstrators also attacked the &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;n embassy in Tehran today, as a protest against the Austrian newspaper that published the cartoons, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKleine%20Zeitung"&gt;Kleine Zeitung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Windows were broken, but no fires were reported. 

Demonstrators were also fueled by the &lt;a href="IAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt;'s treatment of Iran's nuclear arms program.

At 11:18 a.m., February 6 2006, &lt;a href="Stephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as prime minister of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, Canada. That same day at approximately 11:22 a.m. with the Her Excellency the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada present, Stephen Harper signed in his new cabinet. Swearing in of each cabinet minister is currently happening (February 6th 2006, 11:25 a.m.) and being broadcast live on television stations such as Global Television and Rogers Telecommunication CPAC Channel.

At 12:27 p.m. the swearing in of cabinet ministers was complete and the Governor General officially signed in the cabinet. Canada now has a new government that will be directed by the Conservative Party. The Conservatives Party according to Global News "have not been sworn into government since Brian Mulroney in 1984." 

One member of the Liberal Party has crossed over to the Conservatives. David Emerson crossed the floor, even though he was elected two weeks earlier as a Liberal. For this he has been admitted into the cabinet by Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

BHP Billiton Ltd says its underground Leinster nickel mine in &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;, where a contractor was killed in an explosion last week, will stay shut until the outcomes of a government investigation are released.

A BHP spokesman in Perth refused to estimate how long company and government officials will take to investigate the incident. "These investigations can go on for quite some time and the mine will remain closed for that same length of time, said Brian Watt. "But it's difficult to speculate"

Watt declined to comment on how much damage the underground explosion caused to the mine, or how much time would be needed to bring the operation back on line once a decision to resume is made.

BHP Billiton have confirmed the death at the Leinster Nickel Operation, north of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia - 950 km north east of Perth. BHP said the incident occurred late in the afternoon of Friday, February 3. 

Mark Quinn, 32, from Broken Hill in far western New South Wales and an employee of MacMahon’s, was fatally injured. He was working approximately 900 meters underground when an explosion occurred. BHP said in a media release that there were no other persons injured as a result of the incident.

The cause of the explosion is not yet known. Operations at Leinster have been stopped and employees at site are being briefed and counseled.

BHP Billiton is the world's third largest nickel producer, with the Leinster mine producing up to 45,000 metric tons of nickel concentrates a year.

Following speculations that Leinster's closure may lead to a nickel shortage, a spokesperson told ♡❤Reuters♡❤ that BHP Billiton had sufficient nickel concentrate stockpiled to last until the mine reopens. 

The Western Australian government has described the fatality rate in the mining industry as "deplorable and atrocious". 

John Bowler, Western Australia's Employment Protection Minister says he will consider implementing changes to improve the safety record of the mining industry. Mr Quinn's death is the third underground fatality and the fourth mining death this financial year. 

The new Minister, John Bowler, says he will consider implementing any changes needed to improve safety in the industry.

Staff members of the offices of &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;United States Senators&lt;/a&gt;, using Senate-linked &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP addresses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , have been editing &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, a free online encyclopedia that allows its users to edit its content. In some cases, they have removed facts from the articles. 

Using the public history of edits on Wikipedia, &lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt; reporters collected every Senate IP address from which Wikipedia edits had been made as of February 3, then examined where the IPs came from and the edits that were made from computers connected at those addresses. IP, or Internet Protocol, addresses are unique numbers electronic devices use to communicate with each other on an individual basis.

The investigation showed the vast majority of edits from Senate IPs were beneficial and helpful to Wikipedia. Examples include the creation of the articles on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClick%20Back%20America"&gt;Click Back America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which organizes students to promote &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amicrofinance"&gt;microfinance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the developing world, and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%27s%20Tomb"&gt;Washington's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which was designed to hold the body of first U.S. President George Washington within the White House Capitol building; and significantly expanding the article on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aclosed%20sessions%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate"&gt;closed sessions of the United States Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in November. Dozens of small corrections have been made to grammar, spelling, or small facts &amp;mdash; many of them related to the Senate.

Senators' staff members have sometimes had to fight to correct inaccuracies. An &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DJay_Rockefeller%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D35558785"&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DJay_Rockefeller%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D35558785"&gt;Jay Rockefeller&lt;/a&gt;'s article by his staff removed information which may have been biased or untrue. The staff member who edited said, "Apologies, I was new to using Wikipedia, and I didn't fully realize the workings of the website," after other users continuously reinserted the information. The staffer removed the suspect paragraphs 12 times until another Wikipedia user finally removed the information. Four days later, Wikipedia founder &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; got involved.

The Senators' offices were contacted about this article, but no response was received before press time.

<h3>&lt;a href="Joe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Staffers in the offices of Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Biden"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who, according to his changed Wikipedia biography, "announced in mid-June 2005 that he will seek the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2008 if he believes his message and vision for the country resonate with Americans," &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DJoe_Biden%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D18895030"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; a paragraph about a 1996 plagiarism scandal, as well as changing the section regarding a possible 2008 candidacy to read very positively. A second staffer &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DJoe_Biden%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D18838864"&gt;toned down and removed information&lt;/a&gt; about other plagiarism issues as well. The same addresses from Biden's office edited the article on &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DHamas%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D37894692"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;, which has recently won a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council, and is listed as a terrorist organization by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Israel, and the United States, to give its first two paragraphs a more biased stance by removing information about its social welfare programs.

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConrad%20Burns"&gt;Conrad Burns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</h3>

References, citations, and descriptions of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AConrad%20Burns"&gt;Conrad Burns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ' use of the word "ragheads" were &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DConrad_Burns%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D9630281"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from Wikipedia's article, as was mention of legislation, co-sponsored by Burns, that would reduce Native American tribal sovereignty. These were replaced by a paragraph titled "A Voice for the Farmer". The citations supported the discussion of Senator Burns's legislative record regarding &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atribal%20sovereignty"&gt;tribal sovereignty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorm%20Coleman"&gt;Norm Coleman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</h3>

The staffers of Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorm%20Coleman"&gt;Norm Coleman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DNorm_Coleman%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D36971408"&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; a description of Coleman as a liberal Democrat in college to an "activist Democrat," and then to "an active college student." They removed references to Coleman's voting record during his first year of Congress, which lined up with President Bush 98% of the time, which cited &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACongressional%20Quarterly"&gt;Congressional Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They also removed a reference to Coleman being persuaded by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKarl%20Rove"&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to run for senator instead of governor in 2002.

"When you put 'edia' in there, it makes it sound as if this is a benign, objective piece of information," said Erich Mische, Senator Coleman's Chief of Staff, to the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. Mr. Mische admitted the Senator's office had made the edits, and he would take responsibility for removal of the sentence about the voting record. "That probably should have stayed in there."

"It appears to be a major rewrite of the article to make it more favorable. If they're trying to edit in such a way to change the public record, that's a problem," Jimmy Wales said to the Associated Press about the incident.

According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Paul%20Pioneer%20Press"&gt;St. Paul Pioneer Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , "Coleman's decision to run for senator, rather than governor, was sealed during a walk with President Bush in the White House's Rose Garden," rather than Karl Rove. Rove had actually persuaded the former House majority leader of Minnesota and current governor, Tim Pawlenty, not to challenge Norm Coleman in the Senate elections. Still, other portions of the edit removed references to Karl Rove entirely, and their citations, while accentuating the positive side of several issues, including changing "a budget bill that cut funding from a number of programs" to "a deficit-reduction bill."

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADianne%20Feinstein"&gt;Dianne Feinstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</h3>

The California block of Senate IP addresses made &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DDianne_Feinstein%26amp%3Bdiff%3D14472702%26amp%3Boldid%3D14274251"&gt;several edits&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADianne%20Feinstein"&gt;Dianne Feinstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; article, removing reference to her membership in the Trilateral Commission and to her net worth, with husband &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20C.%20Blum"&gt;Richard C. Blum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but also adding an extensive list of awards.

Even more problematic than the edits to the article about Dianne Feinstein, however, were those made to the article about her husband. References to a 1992 fine for failing to disclose Mr. Blum had guaranteed her campaign loans &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DRichard_C._Blum%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D16104560"&gt;were removed&lt;/a&gt;, along with citations, and a paragraph regarding a conflict of interest debate from 1997 when Mr. Blum had invested millions of dollars in Chinese businesses when Ms. Feinstein was campaigning in the Senate to lift trade sanctions against the country. Mr. Blum later announced he would donate all profits from his Chinese investments to charity.

<h3>&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Harkin"&gt;Tom Harkin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</h3>

The staffers of Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Harkin"&gt;Tom Harkin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DTom_Harkin%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D29513020"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; a paragraph relating to Harkin's having falsely claimed to have flown combat missions over North Vietnam, and his subsequent recantation after inquiries by the ♡❤Wall Street Journal♡❤ and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABarry%20Goldwater"&gt;Barry Goldwater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Another paragraph &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DTom_Harkin%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D34936211"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; related to a supposed pro-Israeli stance.

<h3>Other edits to Senate articles</h3>

Wikinews reporters also discovered that a handful of miscellaneous vandalism edits had been made to some Senators' articles. Vandalized articles included those of &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DTom_Coburn%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D32138840"&gt;Tom Coburn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DHarry_Reid%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D13576827"&gt;Harry Reid&lt;/a&gt;. The edits to Reid's were made three times, while the Coburn vandalism was made two times, after it had been restored to a prior version. An &lt;a href="http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DSantorum_controversy%26amp%3Bdiff%3Dprev%26amp%3Boldid%3D28998340"&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt; to an article about a controversy over Senator Rick Santorum's statements about Constitutional rights to privacy with regards to sexual acts, seemingly coming from Rick Santorum's staff members, removed a reference to an effort to redefine Santorum's last name as a neologism meaning "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex."

<h2>IP address mapping</h2>

The U.S. Senate Sergeant at Arms owns the IP block 156.33.0.0 to 156.33.255.255. Requests to learn the mapping of these thousands of IPs were not responded to at press time. However, the lower 100 blocks of addresses appear to be mapped to the 100 Senators based on their state's alphabetical listing. This was partially confirmed using e-mail responses from the offices of Senators; where the originating computer was connected to the network directly and was not a part of block 222 (a section which seems to be reserved for servers), the IP addresses matched the predicted pattern.

When examining the edit behavior of IPs it also tended to match the predicted pattern. IPs which were assigned to Florida had edits to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Nelson"&gt;Bill Nelson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMel%20Martinez"&gt;Mel Martinez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other Florida-related pages primarily, while those assigned to California had edited &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADianne%20Feinstein"&gt;Dianne Feinstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Edits coming from the U.S. House of Representatives were less traceable because they came through a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aproxy%20server"&gt;proxy server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ---meaning they all showed up under one IP address.

The search engine &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; announced the removal of the official German &lt;a href="w%3ABMW"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt; web site from its search results today. Google is reported to have removed the website due to the use of a trick to raise its website ratings in the search engine's results.

The online version of Forbes magazine reported that the German word for used car, ♡❤Gebrauchtwagen♡❤, appeared 42 times in a &lt;a href="w%3ADoorway"&gt;doorway&lt;/a&gt; web page created by the German car manufacturer. Doorway web pages contain many keywords designed to attract &lt;a href="w%3AWeb%20crawler"&gt;search robots&lt;/a&gt;. The page presented to Google's robot for indexing was significantly different from the page presented to the site's visitors.

According to a recent blog post by Matt Cutts, one of Google's software engineers, this technique is "a violation of our webmaster quality guidelines." These guidelines encourage webmasters to "avoid tricks intended to improve search engine rankings."

BMW reacted to the measure by claiming that it had no intention of manipulating the search results, but instead used the doorway pages with the objective of "offering a better service" to those looking for used cars.

Shortly after ending its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (&lt;a href="IAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt;), the government of &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has now ordered the IAEA to discontinue some of its surveillance of Iran's nuclear facilities. Tehran has also asked the agency to remove any and all signage from their nuclear sites by the end of next week.

This is in response to the Saturday resolution by the IAEA to report Iran to the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, which was made without waiting for the director of the IAEA, &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, chairman of the IAEA, to finish preparing a report on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran%27s%20nuclear%20program"&gt;Iran's civilian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;allegedly military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) nuclear programs for the regular IAEA meeting scheduled for March 6. ElBaradei had given Iran until March to answer IAEA questions. By a vote of 27 to three (with five abstentions), and without the information in ElBaradei's report planned for March 2006, the IAEA recommended that the matter of the Iranian nuclear program be brought before the Security Council.

The recommendation claims that there are serious concerns about Iranian nuclear aims, and the agency does not have confidence that the program is intended solely for civilian or other non-military use. Although the meeting was taken without waiting for ElBaradei's March report, the recommendation requests ElBaradei to make his report anyway, including a list of "steps Iran needs to take to dispel suspicions about its nuclear ambitions" by March 6.

The IAEA's resolution calls for Iran to reinstate a freeze on its nuclear programs, consider ending construction of a plutonium-producing heavy water reactor, and to continue allowing the IAEA's purposes and actions in Iran. However, the council will not implement any further action until ElBaradei makes his full report on March 6.

ElBaradei also reported to the IAEA Monday that Iran would also demand a reduction in the amount of facilities inspections from the agency, and that they would discontinue their agreement to the Additional Protocol of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NPT) if the agency reported Iran to the Security Council. This protocol entitles the IAEA to hold unannounced inspections of facilities, increased surveillance capability, and placing IAEA seals on nuclear equipment.

Other diplomatic ventures are being planned. On February 16, Iranian officials will meet with the Russian government in Moscow to discuss the possibility of &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; enriching uranium for export to Iran in exchange for a halting of its nuclear enrichment program. And Wang Guangya, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;'s ambassador to the UN, said Monday that "Even with the adoption of this IAEA resolution, it is the belief of most of the members there that a diplomatic solution is the way out within the framework of the IAEA."

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; State Department declared last week that Jeny Figueredo Frias, the chief of staff to the &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/a&gt; Ambassador, was ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3APersona%20non%20grata"&gt;persona non grata&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ and given 72 hours to leave the country. "We don't like to get into tit-for-tat games with the Venezuelan government like this, but they initiated this and we were forced to respond," said department spokesperson, Sean McCormack. 

The earlier action by Venezuela had been the February 2 expulsion of U.S. naval attache, John Correa. Accusations were made that he had been passing secrets from the country's military to the Pentagon.

Tensions between Venezuela and the United States have been on the rise lately, resulting in several verbal broadsides from notable figures on both sides of the conflict. 

In an interview with the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AMiami%20Herald"&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; compared the Venezuelan President, &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Hitler"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/a&gt;, "He's a person who was elected legally -- just as Adolf Hitler was elected legally -- and then consolidated power and now is, of course, working closely with Fidel Castro and Mr. Morales and others."

On February 5th, Chavez responded with a similar comparison, saying "I think Hitler could be a nursery baby next to &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;." He told a rally of supporters that Bush was "worse than Hitler" and vowed to buy more arms to defend his nation as their diplomatic relations deteriorated. 

Jeny Figueredo received a "hero's welcome" in Venezuela upon her return Monday. "I'm not a victim, I feel proud," said Figueredo. Speaking to a crowd of supporters gathered in &lt;a href="w%3ACaracas"&gt;Caracas&lt;/a&gt;, she shouted: "Down with imperialism!"

According to Figueredo, she had become a very uncomfortable person for the Bush administration as she was in charge of managing Venezuela's plans for subsidized oil to the poor US underclass.

Tensions have also increased due to &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain's&lt;/a&gt; sale of weaponry to Venezuela, including U.S. technology. The United States has attempted to block these sales.

<h1>Hamshahri newspaper plans cartoon response</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Hamshahri%20newspaper%20plans%20cartoon%20response&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The Iranian newspaper &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hamshahri.net/"&gt;Hamshari daily&lt;/a&gt; has stated that it will publish &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Semitism"&gt;anti-Semitic&lt;/a&gt; cartoons in response to the Danish &lt;a href="Tensions%20continue%20to%20rise%20in%20Middle%20East%20over%20%26quot%3BMohammad%20Cartoons%26quot%3B"&gt;Mohammad cartoons&lt;/a&gt;. The newspaper, owned by the Tehran city council, says that the anti-Semitic cartoons will lampoon the &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;, following denials by the Iranian government that the Holocaust even happened, and will show "America and Israel's crimes and plundering". The newspaper has launched an international competition to find the most suitable caricatures about the Holocaust.

Farid Mortazavi, the paper's graphics editor, said to the Guardian newspaper that "♡❤The western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression, so let's see if they mean what they say and also print these Holocaust cartoons♡❤." 

Mr Mortazavi said that the February 8 edition of the paper would invite cartoonists to enter the competition, with gold coins as prizes for the 12 winning artists -- the same number of cartoons that appeared in the conservative Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten lighting the touchpaper for fury which has swept around the Islamic world.
According to the article alongside the original "Mohammad cartoons" in the &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten"&gt;Jyllands-Posten&lt;/a&gt; newspaper in late September 2005, the cartoons were intended to show that:

Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has criticised the argument of freedom of speech employed by European newspapers to justify publication of the cartoons.

Anti-Semitic cartoons will be chosen rather than anti-secular or anti-Christian cartoons for the response to the Danish newspaper despite the fact that &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; has only a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/da.html"&gt;small Jewish population&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Denmark.html"&gt;between 6000 and 7000&lt;/a&gt;.

In related events, Mr Jahjah of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.arabeuropean.org/"&gt;Arab European League&lt;/a&gt; have launched a similar ♡❤Freedom of Speech Campaign♡❤ in which they hope to demonstrate that European News Media are only willing to publish anti-Muslim cartoons, and will not publish anti-Christan or anti-Semitic cartoons. The first of these cartoons (drawn by Nabucho) is shown on this page. 

Paul Belien of the Brussels Journal noted that "The three AEL cartoons posted so far have been very instructive in that they have all mocked the Nazi persecution of the Jews and the Holocaust, as if Mr Jahjah wants to emphasize that &lt;a href="w%3AIslamofascism%20%28term%29"&gt;islamofascism&lt;/a&gt; is indeed the ideology he adheres to."

<h1>Military presence increased in Melbourne for 2006 Commonwealth Games</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Military%20presence%20increased%20in%20Melbourne%20for%202006%20Commonwealth%20Games&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Police Chief Commissioner Christine Nixon has warned of an increase in police and military activity in &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, in preparation for the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Commonwealth%20Games"&gt;Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;. Officials say a major security sweep of Melbourne is underway at the athletes' village.

A 24-hour temporary police station inside the 20-hectare &lt;a href="w%3AParkville%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Parkville&lt;/a&gt; site will be staffed by 109 officers. The station will house a monitoring centre for the village's &lt;a href="w%3ACCTV"&gt;closed-circuit TV&lt;/a&gt; network. Melbourne's newest police station, keeping tabs on nearly 6000 athletes and officials from 71 countries will operate for seven weeks.

Ms Nixon said people should not be alarmed. "They will be seeing, over the next month or two, an increase in some air activity and perhaps military on the streets coming into place for the support they'll give to the Games." Commissioner Nixon says the defence forces have an important role to play. 

"You won't certainly see an armed soldier walking down the streets of Melbourne, that's not the security level that we have and the presence that we need," she said. "Military will be there, they'll be checking trucks and cars going into venues, they'll be doing all of that."

More than 150 Defence Force personnel and police moved on to the village site on Tuesday. Games Minister Justin Madden said the sweep would continue until athletes arrived at the village on March 5. Sweeps of all venues will take place before the Games begin.
More than 1200 defence staff have been seconded to the Games security team. &lt;a href="w%3AF/A-18%20Hornet"&gt;F/A-18 Hornet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3AUH-60%20Black%20Hawk"&gt;Black Hawk&lt;/a&gt; helicopters will enforce a 75km no-fly zone around the MCG. 

Every vehicle that enters the village - and every other venue - will have to first pass through a bomb search bay that includes X-ray machines. Army security sweeps are continuing across all venues. These, combined with comprehensive bag and personal checks at Games time, are seen as the best way to guard against a terrorist strike.

"If people ring up and say, 'Oh look, there's a bomb in it', we'll be pretty much able to say 'no, there's not'," Commissioner Nixon said. 

While security is being stepped up at the village, Ms Nixon said there is no direct threat to the Games overall. "We have a medium-level of security at these Games," she said. "The risk assessment is we have no direct threat to the Games, no evidence at all."

The &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; Government has declared Birrarung Marr, Alexandra Gardens, Albert Park and the Yarra River to be official Games venues, giving police the power to enforce tough anti-protest laws. A similar ruling on Yarra Park - home to the MCG - will also come into effect.

Games laws provide for fines of $2000 for offences such as blocking access, erecting signs, kicking stones or throwing missiles in "venues".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZacarias%20Moussaoui"&gt;Zacarias Moussaoui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the only member of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;September 11, 2001 attacks&lt;/a&gt; to be brought to trial, was removed four times from a Monday court session in &lt;a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Alexandria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; where jury selection is underway for the penalty phase of the trial over his guilty pleas to conspiracy. Moussaoui disrupted the proceeding with verbal outbursts directed at the judge.

Appearing before the U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema at the Albert V. Bryan United States Courthouse, the citizen of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; Moussaoui began calmly by saying with a heavy French accent that, "I want to be heard by this court before the proceedings start."

Judge Brinkema warned Moussaoui that it was not the proper time for him to speak. But Moussaoui, 37, who was unrestrained by shackles and wearing a green jump suit labeled with the word "PRISONER" across the back, said "These lawyers are not my lawyers," referring to the defense team led by federal public defender Gerald Zerkin. "Everybody here know that these people do not represent me."

The unsolicited comments prompted the judge to dismiss him. Moussaoui offered no resistance as he was led away by marshals, but shouted over his shoulder to the judge, "I don't want them to represent. I'm al-Qaida; they are American. They are my enemies." He said of the proceeding, "This trial is a circus."

A jury pool of 18 members, six of whom will serve as alternates, will be selected from the group of 500 potential jurors who appeared Monday. Four court sessions were convened that day to begin sorting through the candidates, and Judge Brinkema allowed Moussaoui to return for each of the three remaining sessions. She instructed potential jurors, "If any of you feel that that outburst or the way he conducted himself might affect the way in which you would go about judging this case, you need to clearly put that statement on the jury questionnaire."

These instructions were repeated to each group of potential jurors after Moussaoui conducted similar outbursts during the remaining sessions, which resulted in his further dismissals.

Moussaoui, in a surprise, pleaded guilty in April to six conspiracy charges of terrorism, leading to yesterday’s start of the jury selection to decide whether he will spend the rest of his life behind bars, or be executed for his involvement in the 9/11 attacks. 

Moussaoui was arrested on immigration charges three weeks prior to the attacks. The prosecution contends that he could have prevented the attacks by alerting authorities to the &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; plans while he was jailed in &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; after his arrest.

Demonstrators today attacked a &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norwegian&lt;/a&gt; peacekeeper base in Meymaneh, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFaryab%20Province"&gt;Faryab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , north-west &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. The demonstrators fired at the base, threw hand grenades and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMolotov%20cocktail"&gt;molotov cocktails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 32 Norwegian, 16 &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href="Latvia"&gt;Latvian&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href="Iceland"&gt;Icelandic&lt;/a&gt; peacekeepers were present at the camp during the attack, say the Norwegian Defence Forces.

According to local authorities, says &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMTV3"&gt;MTV3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , four demonstrators were killed. The amount of injured demonstrators varies between five and 30, depending on the source. In addition, five Norwegian peacekeepers were injured. The original attack consisted of around 700 demonstrators, says &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAgence%20France-Presse"&gt;AFP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . There was a 'core' team of around 30 armed demonstrators within the crowd.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Security%20Assistance%20Force"&gt;ISAF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; peacekeepers fired teargas and warning shots in response to the demonstrators' attacks. &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; has, according to &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, sent 120 reinforcements. Fighter airplanes have fired warning shots around the crowd. According to some sources, Afghani police and military were sent to the area as well.

The purpose of the demonstration remains unknown, say the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFinnish%20Defence%20Forces"&gt;Finnish Defence Forces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but it is believed that the demonstrations have a connection with the Muhammad cartoons published by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten"&gt;Jyllands-Posten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Parliament&lt;/a&gt; resumed sitting February 7, 2006, with the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; Federal Opposition attacking the Government during &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt; over its involvement and knowledge of illegal kickbacks being paid by &lt;a href="w%3AAWB%20Limited"&gt;AWB Limited&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ASaddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt;.

Opposition leader, &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;, and Shadow Foreign Affairs minister &lt;a href="w%3AKevin%20Rudd"&gt;Kevin Rudd&lt;/a&gt; asked all of the Opposition's questions during Question Time and focused solely on the &lt;a href="w%3AOil-for-Food"&gt;Oil-for-Food&lt;/a&gt; program. 

One item of interest during the session was a statement to the Parliament on March 25, 2003, where the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; had said "...the oil for food program has been immorally and shamefully &lt;a href="wiktionary%3Arort"&gt;rorted&lt;/a&gt; by Saddam Hussein"; questions arose when the Prime Minister first knew of the rorts taking place and what action he took into investigating AWB. The Prime Minister has stated that he "[denies] that the government turned a blind eye" to warnings that he has received and at the time "it was common between the government and the opposition that the AWB was an organisation of total integrity and repute."

Beazley later moved a censure motion against the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Vaile"&gt;Mark Vaile&lt;/a&gt;, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; for their "failure" to investigate warnings and their "gross negligence in allowing AWB to provide AU$300 million to the Saddam Regime". The motion failed along party lines.

<h1>Journals tackle scientific fraud</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Journals%20tackle%20scientific%20fraud&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After a rapid succession of cases of major &lt;a href="w%3Ascientific%20misconduct"&gt;scientific fraud&lt;/a&gt;, scientific journals are questioning the effectiveness of the current &lt;a href="w%3Apeer%20review"&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt; system and asking what their role should be in policing fraud.

Less than a month after the confirmation that &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korean&lt;/a&gt; scientist &lt;a href="w%3AHwang%20Woo-Suk"&gt;Hwang Woo-Suk&lt;/a&gt;'s cloning results were falsified, another case was discovered. A &lt;a href="Norway"&gt;Norweigian&lt;/a&gt; researcher had made up patient histories of about 900 people for a study on cancer. Richard Horton, the editor of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lancet"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, in which the research appeared, has responded to the scandal, "Peer review is a great system for detecting badly done research, but if you have an investigator determined to fabricate an entire study, it is not possible to pick it up." 

While carefully examining the data for every publication would be prohibitively expensive, several techniques to screen for falsified data have been developed. For example, images can be checked for after-the-fact manipulation. The scandals have led to some readers looking more carefully at suspicious papers for evidence that the data are human-manufactured. &lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Hendrik%20Sch%C3%B6n"&gt;Jan Hendrik Schön&lt;/a&gt;'s fraud was partly revealed due to just such analysis by readers in 2002.

Some institutions are taking further steps to prevent fraud. In October, &lt;a href="w%3AEmory%20University"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt; introduced a tip line where people can anonymously report suspicions of scientific misconduct. So far, five investigations have been launched based on reports to the tip line.

While many are working to deter future scandals, some scientists have pointed out that such fraud does not discredit all science. Dieter Imboden, the president of the &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Swiss&lt;/a&gt; National Science Foundation's Research Council, has said: "Bear in mind that every experiment will be repeated at some stage and it is one of the important principles of science that only things which can be verified independently by different groups are considered to be safe scientific facts."

The Albuquerque Academy eighth grade basketball team used tough defense to close out the 2005-2006 season with a win, 46-30 over Los Lunas.

The Chargers spread things evenly in the first quarter; five players scored for the team in the period. Both forward Jon Cabarrus and guard Dylan Gordon followed their own shots and scored on putbacks. Forwards Xavier Moya and Chris Thompson provided tough inside defense on one possession. While Los Lunas managed several rebounds, they were unable to get any baskets over the outstretched arms of Moya and Thompson.

Cabarrus scored on another putback for his fourth points of the game late in the quarter, helping Academy to a twelve to eight lead at the end of the first.

The second period was a low scoring one for both teams. The Chargers scored just nine points, but also held Los Lunas to only three. Both offenses were struggling when guard Andrew Matthew stole the ball and made a pass to Gordan, who threw another pass to fellow guard Jordan Fleisher, who took the ball and scored on a layup.

With a minute in the half, reserve Matt Brown took a pass and drove the length of the court for a layup. Academy ended the second half with a twenty-one to eleven lead.

Academy again spread the ball around in the second half, with eight Charger players scoring. Leading the way in the second half was Patrick Zacharias, who scored seven points in the half.

Gordon connected with Thompson on a play that gave Thompson a layup. Gordon stole the ball away from Los Lunas and made a pass to Thompson while sandwiched between two Los Lunas defenders. Thompson received the pass under the basket and scored on a layup.

Los Lunas came back with a three pointer by #24 and some layups by other players. The quarter ended with Academy still holding the lead, 33-22.

AA was again playing tough defense midway through the fourth quarter until #32 hit a three pointer, sparking a small Los Lunas rally, but it was not enough to overcome the offense and defense of the Chargers. 

Zacharias scored on a tip in of a Gordon shot that hung on the rim and fell out. Zacharias was also fouled on the shot and made the free throw to complete the three point play. Team manager Lincoln Stanfield also saw action in the game, and even scored his first points of the season at the end of the fourth quarter. With less than fifteen seconds left, Stanfield received a pass underneath the basket. His shot didn't fall, but he was fouled with seven seconds left. Stanfield's first free throw bounced up after hitting the rim but didn't fall through. His second shot bounced high in the air two times before falling through the hoop. Stanfield threw his arms up in celebration over his made shot, putting an end to Academy's 14-1 season.

An order given by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury"&gt;U.S. Treasury Department&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ASheraton%20Hotel"&gt;Sheraton Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMexico%20City"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt; to expel 17 &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuban&lt;/a&gt; officials visiting the capital has sparked political outrage and has been strongly condemned by the &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; government.

Mexico's Foreign Relations Department has started a probe and warned that it could fine or even close the hotel if it can prove the hotel violated Mexican laws.

The Cuban officials visited Mexico last week to attend a meeting with &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; energy executives. They moved to another Mexico City hotel on Saturday after the Sheraton Hotel evicted them.

According to Kirby Jones, president of the U.S. - Cuba Trade Association, the U.S. Treasury Department pressured the hotel's owner, Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide, claiming it was violating a 1961 law that bans U.S. companies from doing business with Cubans.

The looming debate on whether the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Health Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATheraputic%20Goods%20Administration"&gt;Theraputic Goods Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (TGA) should regulate mifepristone, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARU486"&gt;RU486&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has entered the Australian Senate, February 8. A &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afree%20vote"&gt;free vote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is due to be conducted on this issue.

The first speakers have been all women speaking in support of passing control from the Health Minister to the TGA: &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20Party"&gt;Australian National Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFiona%20Nash"&gt;Fiona Nash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALyn%20Allison"&gt;Lyn Allison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AClaire%20Moore"&gt;Claire Moore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . They have drawn attention to the fact that abortion is already legal in Australia, the inappropriateness of a Parliament minister to regulate a single drug versus a scientific and independent body, and if RU486 is an unsafe drug then the TGA will not approve the drug. Petitions were presented by Moore with the undersigned stating "medical experts, not the health minister" should regulate the drug.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Australian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGary%20Humphries"&gt;Gary Humphries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; then spoke, stating that the bill is a "mistake", not because of the possible risks, or that the TGA is unfit to perform the evaluation, but because RU486 is "not just another drug", "facilitating a medical procedure that is not just a medical procedure". &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Nettle"&gt;Kerry Nettle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spoke in favour of the bill, making mention of views of others on the supposed &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Apush%20polling"&gt;push polling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of some groups opposing the bill. Liberal Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Minchin"&gt;Nick Minchin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the new Leader of the Government in the Senate, spoke in support of Humphries and his views, and "was not persuaded to support [the] bill", and expressed his "conservative" views that life begun "from conception onwards". &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFamily%20First%20Party"&gt;Family First Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Senator &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteven%20Fielding"&gt;Steven Fielding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; spoke out against the bill also, likening the TGA as comprising of "unelected bureaucrats". He further commented that Family First cannot consider the social policy issues without considering social views, and drew attention to the TGA's response in the earlier Senate inquiry that the TGA "cannot consider social and ethical issues". Fielding drew attention to the guillotine being placed on the debate of the bill and the attitudes of the non-Government senators earlier criticising the Government on the industrial relations legislation being "rammed through" late last year.

Other senators, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGuy%20Barnett"&gt;Guy Barnett&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Lib.), &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHelen%20Polley"&gt;Helen Polley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Labor), also later spoke against the bill; Senators &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJudith%20Adams"&gt;Judith Adams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Lib.), &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARuth%20Webber"&gt;Ruth Webber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Labor) spoke in support.

A six year old boy in the first grade at Downey Elementary School in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrockton%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Brockton,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; was suspended for touching a female classmate.

The boy allegedly touched the girl underneath the waistband of her pants briefly while in class. The boy was suspended for three days but hasn't returned afterwards because he feels uncomfortable about returning. His mother is trying to transfer him to another school.

The Brockton Superintendent of Schools, Basan Nembirkow, says "take all allegations of sexual harassment seriously and conduct investigations. The principal is trained to handle these situations and assisted as needed by the district sexual harassment officer."

A spokesperson for the Brockton Public Schools, Cynthia McNally, said "unfortunate this situation has gotten this kind of publicity...wouldn't have suspended the boy without conducting an investigation."

♡❤♡Paris, France- ♡❤♡ The French satirical weekly &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ACharlie%20Hebdo"&gt;Charlie Hebdo&lt;/a&gt; reprinted in its Wednesday February 8, 2006, issue the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;cartoons originally printed in Jyllands-Posten&lt;/a&gt;, representing caricatures of the Muslim prophet &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMuhammad"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;. Charlie Hebdo is known for its ferocious critical tone and general hostility towards organized religion.

Charlie Hebdo normally prints 140,000 copies; 160,000 were printed of these issues, but were sold out before midday. The paper announced an exceptional re-issue of 160,000 the next day. According to ♡❤Le Figaro♡❤, the final printout could exceed 400,000.

Some French Muslim associations had tried to obtain an injunction against the publishing of the paper, claiming that the cartoons incited to racial and religious hatred, but the court rejected their request on procedural grounds, as recommended by the public prosecutor. The judge, Jean-Claude Magendie, remarked that the 1881 law on the Press is very formal in order to protect the rights of defense with respect to &lt;a href="w%3Afreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt;.
The French government had law enforcement officers, many equipped for riot control, guard the outside of the parisian offices of the paper, should some protesters try to disrupt public order. However, at mid-day, no protesters could be seen. Charlie Hebdo is normally highly critical of police action and extraordinary security measures.

Another French satirical weekly, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALe%20Canard%20encha%C3%AEn%C3%A9"&gt;Le Canard enchaîné&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ did not publish the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons because they were, according to it, "not very fun and not very original", but published series of cartoons mocking Islamists (those exploiting the Muslim faith for political purposes). The ♡❤Canard♡❤ called them "Satanic drawings", in a probable allusion to ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Satanic%20Verses%20%28novel%29"&gt;The Satanic Verses&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a novel whose author was sentenced to death by Islamists.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and relatives of Jaber Elbaneh, 38, a member of the &lt;a href="w%3ALackawanna%20Six"&gt;Lackawanna Six&lt;/a&gt; and former resident of &lt;a href="w%3ALackawanna%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Lackawanna, New York&lt;/a&gt;, are trying to find out if he is one of the 23 members of Al-Qaeda who escaped from a &lt;a href="Yemen"&gt;Yemeni&lt;/a&gt; prison on Friday, February 3, 2006.

The ♡❤Yemeni Times♡❤ reported Tuesday that one of the men that had escaped was Gaber Al-Bana'a which authorities say could be Elbaneh. The Middle Eastern Media Outlets have spelled his name many different ways, and the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; FBI office is investigating the latest accounts and reports that refer to Elbaneh. "We're making inquiries and trying to get some answers," said FBI spokesman Paul M. Moskal. Elbaneh has a US$5 million dollar bounty on his head.

A &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; official said, "Jaber Elbaneh was a member of the cell and was among those who escaped from prison in Yemen. Elbaneh never returned to the US after his training in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. The other six of the Lackawanna cell were arrested when they returned to the U.S.."

The ♡❤Lackawanna Six♡❤ are a group of American-born men of Yemeni descent, arrested in Lakawanna New York, who pleaded guilty after admitting they attended an al-Qaida training camp. They had traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 and were arrested in Lackawanna, near Buffalo, in 2002. Their sentences range from seven to ten years. The members of the cell also included Mukhtar Al-Bakri, Sahim Alwan, Faysal Galab, Shafal Mosed, Yaseinn Taher, Yahya Goba and Jaber Elbaneh, who was in a Yemeni prison.
