The body of missing student Ryan Katcher has been found in a truck at the bottom of a lake in &lt;a href="w%3AOakwood%2C%20Illinois"&gt;Oakwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;. The 19 year-old, who attended the University of Illinois, went missing on 5 November, 2000 after a party.

Emergency workers found Katcher’s vehicle in about 50 feet of water almost 100 feet off shore in Clear Lake in Kickapoo State Park. They were testing new equipment at the time of the finding. “Basically, ESADE (Emergency Services and Disaster Agency) had purchased some new equipment and was experimenting with it,” a spokesperson said.

County Coroner Peggy Johnson said the black truck's good condition and the lake's cold water preserved Katcher’s body inside for when rescue crews made their discovery.

A spokeswoman for Ryan’s family issued a statement on behalf of his mother, Linda Katcher. "The search for Ryan is over, and she would like to thank everyone for their support and for never giving up. She appreciates everyone’s prayers."

The city hall building in was evacuated after fire alarms were activated.

"Smoke detectors went off on the 13th and 27th floors. Among other things we lost all communications out of the building. Something cut off communications, something set off those alarms and cut power to elevators," said Mike Lombardo, Buffalo's fire commissioner.

Police and fire crews arrived on scene to discover a power surge in the 27th floor knocked out all communications between the police and fire departments in the city for nearly two hours. Fire crews had to use emergency stairways to examine the building for fire and evacuees of the 32-story building had to use emergency stairways to evacuate because elevators in the building were not functioning properly.

According to Lombardo, "it looks like we have no fire whatsoever [in the building]" and that all 2,800 workers were allowed to return to work shortly after 12:00 p.m.

"We've been able to re-set things...we feel very confident that there's no other problems," added Lombardo.

No one was injured during the incident.

A 39 year-old man working at a coal mine at Lidsdale, near &lt;a href="w%3ALithgow%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Lithgow&lt;/a&gt; in the Central West of &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; was found dead on Wednesday. It is believed he was struck by a ruptured hydraulic hose.

The man was discovered by a colleague at around 4:30PM and was around 8 kilometres underground from the mine's entrance. According to police, the man was collecting oil samples when the accident occurred.

Police and the NSW Department of Primary Industries are conducting an investigation into the incident and will prepare a report for the coroner.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Nasrallah"&gt;Hassan Nasrallah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the leader of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , claims that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the result of an American-Israeli conspiracy to attack &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and gain control over the state as a part of a "new Middle East". In the 28-minute speech on &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aal-Manar"&gt;al-Manar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; television July 26 Nasrallah alleges that in the project for a new Middle East the United States seeks the removal of all resistance groups that pose a threat to its procurement and control of the area's wealth and resources.

In the June 2 edition of London-based magazine al-Watan al-Arabi it is claimed Hezbollah received intelligence that Olmert had obtained a green light from Bush in the event of an open confrontation between Hezbollah and Israel. That is alleged to have happened in May when Israeli Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; paid his first visit to Washington as head of the state of Israel and met President George W. Bush. Based on that knowledge Hassan Nasrallah delivered a "Strategic Defense Plan," to the National Dialogue Committee (al-Hiwar al-Watani). The plan outlined what Hezbollah should do in the event of an Israeli air, land, or sea assault on Lebanon.
The Hezbollah leader claims in the al-Manar speech that both the United States and Israel planned using the element of surprise to invade Lebanon in late-September early-October. Nasrallah says they discovered this warplan and Hezbollah used the kidnapping of the Israeli soldiers to enter into the conflict directly and remove the surprise factor.

According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%20Chronicle"&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; an Israeli army officer, at an off-the-record briefing, presented a war plan last year to some Think Tanks in Washington. Several journalists and diplomats were told of Israel's plans for a three-week campaign in Lebanon. There was no plan, according to this scenario, to reoccupy southern Lebanon on a long-term basis. It is not clear if Hezbollah obtained this information.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGerry%20Steinberg"&gt;Gerald Steinberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , professor of political science at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABar-Ilan%20University"&gt;Bar-Ilan University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , says "Of all of Israel's wars since 1948, this was the one for which Israel was most prepared". Professor Steinberg continued "In a sense, the preparation began in May 2000, immediately after the Israeli withdrawal, when it became clear the international community was not going to prevent Hezbollah from stockpiling missiles and attacking Israel. By 2004, the military campaign scheduled to last about three weeks that we're seeing now had already been blocked out and, in the last year or two, it's been simulated and rehearsed across the board."

According to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALa%20nouvelle%20r%C3%A9publique"&gt;La nouvelle république&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a french speaking Algerian newpsaper, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABenjamin%20Netanyahu"&gt;Benjamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , head of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALikud"&gt;Likud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , met secretly the 17 and 18 of June at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABeaver%20Creek"&gt;Beaver Creek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's Conférence of the American Enterprise Institute. Dick Cheney give his agreement to Israel to destroy &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Netanyahu reported to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

<h1>Obrador declares himself President, plans protests</h1>
♡❤♡July 27, 2006♡❤♡

Mexican presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AAndres%20Manuel%20Lopez%20Obrador"&gt;Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador&lt;/a&gt;, who lost the vote count to his rival &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Calderon"&gt;Felipe Calderon&lt;/a&gt; by 0.57%, declared victory in &lt;a href="w%3AMexican%20general%20election%2C%202006"&gt;the elections&lt;/a&gt; and vowed that he and his supporters will continue protesting. "I am already president," he said in a television interview "I won the presidential election. I am president of Mexico by the will of the majority of Mexicans."

Protests in favour of Obrador have grown increasingly confrontational. This week, protestors marched in front of the Mexican stock exchange, blockading the entrance. Obrador is expected to announce a campaign of civil disobedience at a rally in central Mexico City on Sunday. He and his supporters are pressuring Mexico's &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Electoral%20Tribunal"&gt;Federal Electoral Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; to issue a recount of every vote cast in the election.

Presidential Candidate Obrador believes that President Vicente Fox and Presidential Candidate Calderon are responsible for what he believes to be election fraud.

Calderon has rejected Obrador's call for a recount, saying that the election was fair.

A man wielding a machete entered a &lt;a href="w%3APenrose%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Penrose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; gun shop, Small Arms International, this morning at about 10.00 a.m. The man was shot in the stomach by a pistol, he is now in a stable condition after being taken to hospital for surgery.

Allegedly the shooter was the store manager, who is the son of the owner of the gun shop. The owner, Ray Carvell, said that his son "feared for his life. [My] son was clearly terrified and acted in self defence."

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;New Zealand Police&lt;/a&gt; are speaking to four witnesses.

Simon Scott, Detective Senior Sargeant, said "police have yet to decide if there is any criminal liability."

&lt;a href="w%3AFloyd%20Landis"&gt;Floyd Landis&lt;/a&gt; , who came in first in the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tour%20de%20France"&gt;2006 Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;, has tested positive for abnormal ratio of testosterone/epitestosterone, the Phonak team said on their website. Landis' "A" sample, taken after Stage 17 was positive, and his place on the Phonak team will be based on the lab results of the "B" sample.

This statement by the Phonak team came after yesterday's statement from the UCI that an unidentified cyclist had failed a drug test during the tour. Landis has been suspended by the Phonak team, and if he fails the second set of tests, he will be fired and could be stripped of the Tour title. 

Under regulations set by the World Anti-Doping agency, a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone greater than 4:1 is considered a positive result and subject to an investigation. Until recently the cutoff was at 6:1. The natural ratio of &lt;a href="w%3Atestosterone"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3Aepitestosterone"&gt;epitestosterone&lt;/a&gt; is generally about 1:1.

&lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda's&lt;/a&gt; second in command, has released a new videotape calling for a holy war against the "Zionists and crusaders" and saying that "the war with Israel does not depend on ceasefires."

"Oh Muslims everywhere, I call on you to fight and become martyrs in the war against the Zionists and the crusaders. The war with &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; does not depend on ceasefires... It is a jihad for God's sake and will last until religion prevails ... from &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. My fellow Muslims, it is obvious that Arab and Islamic governments are not only impotent but also complicit...and you are alone on the battlefield. Rely on God and fight your enemies...make yourselves martyrs," said Zawahiri.

Zawahiri also said that the entire planet is an "open battlefield," and that "we [al-Qaeda] will attack everywhere." He claimed that the rockets Israel is using to take out &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; are supplied by the "countries of the crusader coalition. Since they are attacking us everywhere, we will attack everywhere," he said. "We cannot just watch these shells as they burn our brothers in Gaza and Lebanon and stand by idly, humiliated," Zawahiri added.

In the video, an image of the burning World Trade Center towers could be seen in the background and the images of two other militants, Mohammed Atta and Mohammed Atef, were also present.

Zawahiri also makes reference to the three Israeli soldiers that were kidnapped saying, "The 10,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israel's prisons do not move anything while three Israeli prisoners have shaken the world." 

This is the tenth message Zawahiri has made since the beginning of 2006.

The trial of &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; has been adjourned until 16 October, which is when the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20Special%20Tribunal"&gt;Iraq Special Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is expected to pronounce its judgment. 

Hussein and seven co-defendants are on trial charged with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Acrimes%20against%20humanity"&gt;crimes against humanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after Hussein allegedly ordered his military forces to kill 148 people from the village of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADujail"&gt;Dujail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; following an attempted assassination of the former &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraqi&lt;/a&gt; leader in 1982. 

Prosecutors at the trial want the death penalty for Hussein and two co-defendants. At a hearing yesterday, Hussein said that if he was found guilty and condemned to die, he would prefer to be shot rather than hanged. He also claimed that he had been taken to court against his will. 

The former dictator did not appear in court for the final session of his trial today, but he is due to stand trial on 21 August to judge his part in the infamous &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnfal%20campaign"&gt;Anfal campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , where groups of Iraqi &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKurds"&gt;Kurds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were murdered in the 1980s.

As Hussein's defense team has been boycotting the trial demanding better security after three of their numbers were murdered, the court has selected replacement lawyers. Iraq’s former Vice-President &lt;a href="Taha%20Yassin%20Ramadan"&gt;Taha Yassin Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;, today refused to allow the appointed representative to stand for him. "I do not know who this lawyer is or his name," he said. The other defendant was Awad Hamad al-Bandar, the former chief judge of the court. 

Like he did yesterday, Judge Raouf Abdel Rahman again slated Hussein’s defense lawyers for avoiding the court. "They're sitting abroad now generating fame by issuing political statements on television stations as if this case is a political one. This behavior will harm you, the defendants. This is a criminal case, not a political one," Mr Rahman warned. Most of Hussein's legal team is based in &lt;a href="Amman"&gt;Amman&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. 

His trial started in &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; on 19 October 2005.

&lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; has denied claims made by &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20Abbas"&gt;Mahmoud Abbas&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; soldier, &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt;, 19, captured on June 25, will be released.

"Nothing has changed in the case of the Israeli soldier. The file remains in the hands of the resistance factions and not in the hands of any politician even if that politician is Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas]. We heard this news from the press and our stance remains as it was: The case is in the hands of resistance fighters," said spokesman for the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Ubaida.

Ubaida also said that handing over the soldier doesn't come "free. No politician dares to demand handing the soldier over without a return."

Abbas was quoted as saying earlier in a press conference, held in Rome, by an Italian translator that talks were leading to an "imminent solution" that would allow for the release of the soldier. "With regards to the issue of the abducted Israeli soldier, I have reiterated that there are ongoing efforts that lead us to believe in an imminent solution. I hope that the soldier is in good health and can soon return to his family," said Abbas, according to the official Italian translator.

However; the Associated press quoted Abbas as saying that "intense negotiations" were taking place.

Under the agreement, Rutgers will also coordinate a team of four university-based centers at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Southern%20California"&gt;University of Southern California&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AUIUC"&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; at Urbana-Champaign and the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Pittsburgh"&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;. Plans call for a total of $10.2 million in funding over three years for Rutgers and these institutions to advance efforts aimed at identifying common patterns from numerous sources of information.
According to Fred Roberts, director of Rutgers' Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS), the efforts will "develop real-time streaming algorithms to find patterns and relationships in communications, such as among writers who may be hiding their identities, and to rate information sources for their reliability and trustworthiness." The computer applications developed by the program will focus on analyzing data from public sources, including news stories, open-source web logs, and other accessible information, to quickly identify emerging indicators of possible terrorist activity.

Six hundred Tube passengers had to be moved to safety in &lt;a href="w%3Awest%20London"&gt;west London&lt;/a&gt; tonight after a &lt;a href="w%3Alandslide"&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt; close to a station on the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Underground"&gt;London Underground&lt;/a&gt;.

A spokeswoman said: "London Underground is currently assessing the impact of an embankment landslip between Boston Manor and Northfields. Initial indications are that three to four tonnes of debris has ended up on the track. An eastbound Piccadilly Line train came into contact with the debris at Boston Manor station." 

A replacement bus service is operating between Northfields and Heathrow. Tube tickets can also be used on &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Connect"&gt;Heathrow Connect&lt;/a&gt; rail services from &lt;a href="w%3AEaling%20Broadway"&gt;Ealing Broadway&lt;/a&gt;. 

Staff at London Underground are trying to clear the debris overnight in the hope of resuming service on the line on Friday morning.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20National%20Party"&gt;New Zealand National Party&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Brash"&gt;Dr. Don Brash&lt;/a&gt; says that they only want immigrants who accept the "bedrock values" of New Zealand society. Brash said to the Association for Migration and Investment: "&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; should not welcome those who want to live here but reject core aspects of the country's culture."

Dr. Brash says that the following are the "bedrock values":
<ul>
BULLET::::- Acceptance of democracy,
BULLET::::- The rule of law,
BULLET::::- Religious and personal freedom,
BULLET::::- Legal equality of the sexes,
BULLET::::- Speak English, or learn it quickly.

</ul>
"If you don't accept these fundamentals then New Zealand isn't the place for you. Many migrants to New Zealand in recent times have come from cultures that do not share the same 'bedrock values'," said Brash.

&lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Cunliffe"&gt;David Cunliffe&lt;/a&gt;, Immigration Minister, said: "The National Party leader's comments are pejorative and insulting."

On Monday, the result of a counter-analysis of &lt;a href="w%3AFloyd%20Landis"&gt;Floyd Landis&lt;/a&gt;' B-sample, as requested by the Americans, will be announced.

Landis, who came in first on this year’s &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;, has previously tested positive for an abnormally high testosterone balance in his blood stream. This led to claims that he was involved with doping, in order to improve performance.

According to &lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Lef%C3%A9v%C3%A8re"&gt;Patrick Lefévère&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the Association of professional cycling teams, "Our sport's survival is at stake"..."We can no longer afford to have teams or riders who just won't learn still starting races."

Landis continues to deny any wrongdoing.

"I want the result to be made public immediately, I see no reason why not," Landis said. "I'm proud that I won the Tour because I was the strongest guy there"

An &lt;a href="w%3Aearly%20medieval"&gt;early medieval&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AChristian"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APsalter"&gt;Psalter&lt;/a&gt; (prayer book) was discovered in a bog in the &lt;a href="w%3AMidland%20Region"&gt;Midland Region&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AIreland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; on July 25, 2006, prompting some to term it the Irish version of the &lt;a href="w%3ADead%20Sea%20scrolls"&gt;Dead Sea Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3APsalter"&gt;psalter&lt;/a&gt; was found by a worker excavating &lt;a href="w%3Apeat"&gt;peat&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="w%3Abog"&gt;bog&lt;/a&gt;. The worker immediately covered the book with damp soil, as exposure to dry air after so many centuries of dampness might have destroyed it. He was praised by Dr. Patrick Wallace, director of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Museum%20of%20Ireland"&gt;National Museum of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, for doing that. The book was found open to the page of &lt;a href="w%3APsalm%2083"&gt;Psalm 83&lt;/a&gt;.

The Psalter is currently kept under refrigeration at the National Museum while researchers determine how to open the book without damaging the book's pages and possibly destroying it.

Canada: ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20One%3A%20Making%20a%20Music%20Star"&gt;The One: Making a Music Star&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was cancelled today, just over a week after its debut. Overall it aired only four episodes.

&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Broadcasting%20Company"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;'s (American Broadcasting Company) show site for ♡❤The One♡❤ says, “There are no plans for additional episodes. Thanks to all who participated in and supported The One!”

According to an interview with the host over the phone from &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ACFRB%20%28AM%29"&gt;CFRB 1010&lt;/a&gt; Toronto; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Stroumboulopoulos"&gt;George Stroumboulopoulos&lt;/a&gt; said that "he was not surprised because he thought maybe that the show's message didn't come across making viewers not understanding the show." "He also said that he is happy that he is still hosting ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACBC%20News%3A%20The%20Hour"&gt;CBC News: The Hour&lt;/a&gt;♡❤." Stroumboulopoulos has said, however, that he was only taking ♡❤The One♡❤ as a "summer job," and does not plan to stop hosting ♡❤The Hour♡❤.

&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt; is now considering a Canadian version of the show.

"It's too early to tell," said Kirstine Layfield, CBC's executive director of network programming. "We're not under any pressure to make immediate decisions."

Layfield said a decision would be made in a few weeks. 

If CBC goes ahead, it would launch its own Canadian version of the show this fall. 

"The Canadian version of ♡❤The One♡❤ is still in early development," Layfield said, adding that the CBC has learned from the American version. "We'll use that when we take a look at what we're going to be doing with the Canadian version."

♡❤The One♡❤ only got 236,000 Canadians viewers for its debut episode, and pulled in 938,000 total viewers. It drew 3.2 million U.S. viewers and finished fifth in its time slot. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer%3Fpagename%3Dthestar/Layout/Article_Type1%26amp%3Bc%3DArticle%26amp%3Bcid%3D1153345816038%26amp%3Bcall_pageid%3D970599119419"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; According to &lt;a href="w%3ANielsen%20Media%20Research"&gt;Nielsen Media Research&lt;/a&gt;, 150,000 Canadians tuned in Tuesday nights show. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer%3Fpagename%3Dthestar/Layout/Article_Type1%26amp%3Bc%3DArticle%26amp%3Bcid%3D1153950610905%26amp%3Bcall_pageid%3D968867495754%26amp%3Bcol%3D969483191630"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

This is the first and, so far the only version of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AStar%20Academy"&gt;Operación Triunfo / Star Academy&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ format to not be completed before the end of the series. Since ABC and &lt;a href="w%3AEndemol"&gt;Endemol&lt;/a&gt; were running a contest with a prize of a recording contract someone will eventually be declared "the One." Just how a winner will be declared is still being discussed. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.variety.com/article/VR1117947513%3Fcs%3D1%26amp%3Bs%3Dh%26amp%3Bp%3D0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

A Blog entitled ♡❤Liverpool Evil Cabal♡❤ and supposedly written by insiders of the &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20City%20Council"&gt;Liverpool City Council&lt;/a&gt;, going by the &lt;a href="w%3Anom%20de%20guerre"&gt;nom de guerre&lt;/a&gt; 'Tony Parrish', is causing a stir in the &lt;a href="England"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;. 

The Blog is apparently blocked by the council to prevent staff from reading it during office hours. The council has also extended the block to its public access terminals in places such as libraries, affecting the Internet access of residents of Liverpool.

Liverpool City Council has often been described as a &lt;a href="w%3ABear%20pit"&gt;Bear pit&lt;/a&gt; for its volatile nature and has been anxious to throw off the image generated in the early 1980s by &lt;a href="w%3AMilitant%20Tendency"&gt;Militant Tendency&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADerek%20Hatton"&gt;Derek Hatton&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AJewish%20Federation"&gt;Jewish Federation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Seattle"&gt;Greater Seattle&lt;/a&gt; building in &lt;a href="w%3ASeattle"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; was the site of a shooting on at around 4 pm on July 28. A gunman who walked into the building shot one person dead and wounded five others. 

According to witnesses the man walked up to the building and shot a woman in the leg. He entered the building to go onto the roof and fire one shot before walking back inside and firing several more shots.

Most employees were able to escape through the backdoor.

After a few minutes the gunman surrendered to police through 911.

According to Amy Wasser-Simpson, the federation's vice president, the man shouted, "I'm a Muslim American; I'm angry at Israel," before shooting.

An employee who wished not to be identified spoke of the shots fired, “It went 'Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!' and then we heard a woman scream.”

“One of the receptionists told me that he shot her and then demanded that she call 911.”

“I saw one friend –– she had been shot twice in the stomach and was bleeding,”

All of the victims were women between 19 and 43. One of the wounded was 20 weeks pregnant.

"They have sustained wounds to the knee, groin, abdomen and arm. Three of the five have been taken to the operating room," said Pamela Steele, spokeswoman for the Harbourview Medical Center.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; will be working with local authorities on the case.

The building has tight security. It was surrounded by a fence, it has bullet proof windows and all visitors must be buzzed in by reception.

The month long election campaign in the run up to this weekend's elections in the &lt;a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt; has ended, with a one day break before voting can begin Sunday.

The fiercely fought campaign began on June 29th and involved no less than 9,707 parliamentary candidates and 33 presidential candidates. Canvassing ended yesterday with a mass rally in support of the current president &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJoseph%20Kabila"&gt;Joseph Kabila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Kabila, who became the youngest head of state in Africa in 2001, used his final speech before voting to claim credit for taking the D.R. Congo to its first democratic elections in over 40 years. "I can say to you without false modesty: mission accomplished" he told crowds of around 50,000 on Friday, "We've reunited and pacified the country. It is also a message of hope, and for peace and development and security after the polls."

The international community is taking a keen interest in the elections &amp;mdash; the first since 1961. However, the July campaign has been marred by violence and accusations of fraud on all sides. 

International observers, such as the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarter%20Centre"&gt;Carter Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , expressed concern that the incumbent President's domination of the media would undermine the campaign. Several hundred people protested at alleged irregularities in the polls on the 18th of July, which ended in 7 people being killed in police clashes. One candidate has also fled to &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; after violence. 

This Thursday, 6 people were killed in election related incidents in the capital, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKinshasa"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and yesterday, Kabila's presidential guards killed an opposition candidate's bodyguard in a gunfight. 

The &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; has deployed its largest ever peacekeeping force &amp;mdash; 17,000 &amp;mdash; to monitor the elections, costing over $460 million. Despite troubles, the deputy U.N. representative in the country, Ross Mountain, said the Democratic Republic is ready for tomorrow's polls. 

50,000 polling stations have been set up around the country, for the 25.6 million voters, with over 60,000 Congolese police and 1,700 international observers in place to monitor voting.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; have defeated the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australian Wallabies&lt;/a&gt; for the second time this year and have retained the &lt;a href="w%3ABledisloe%20Cup"&gt;Bledisloe Cup&lt;/a&gt;, winning 13-9. The win extends New Zealand lead on Tri Nations table, now seven points ahead of Australia, with the All Blacks on 13 and the Wallabies on 6. South Africa are on zero. The match was played at &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASuncorp%20Stadium"&gt;Suncorp Stadium&lt;/a&gt; and was time the All Blacks had played there, in ten years.

Australia had the early lead, scoring a penalty goal first up through &lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20Mortlock"&gt;Stirling Mortlock&lt;/a&gt;. The All Blacks struck back quickly though, with winger, &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Rokocoko"&gt;Joe Rokocoko&lt;/a&gt; scoring the only try of the match, beating several defenders on his way to the line. &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carter%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Daniel Carter&lt;/a&gt; added the conversion, to give the All Blacks an 7 - 3 lead. Carter and Mortlock each added a penalty before half-time, leaving the score 10 - 6 at the interval.

The second half was very close, as was the first, with only 6 points being scored. A Daniel Carter dropped goal gave New Zealand breathing space, with Stirling Mortlock replying with a penalty. The final 10 minutes of the match saw Australia attempt to break the All Blacks defence, but failing to.

Earlier in the week Australian coach, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Connolly"&gt;John Connolly&lt;/a&gt;, stated that the new All Blacks haka &lt;a href="w%3AHaka_of_the_All_Blacks%23Kapa_O_Pango_.28the_new_All_Blacks.27_haka.29"&gt;Kapa O Pango&lt;/a&gt; should be banned, causing &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Kapa%20O%20Pango%20controversy"&gt;much controversy&lt;/a&gt;, citing that the throat slitting gesture at the end is a bad example.

Australia take on &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; next week at &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra%20Stadium"&gt;Telstra Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Australia picked up a bonus point from the match from losing within 7 points.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; was mobbed by protesters in &lt;a href="w%3APerth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, angry at the stance he has taken on the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Middle%20East%20conflict"&gt;recent conflicts&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.

Leaving a &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal party&lt;/a&gt; conference at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in the West Australian capital, Howard was mobbed by 200 protestors angry at his support for &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and the Australian government's lack of action.

Protestors kicked, punched and threw projectiles at the Prime Minister's vehicle as police struggled to keep the angry mob under control. One protestor managed to break off the Australian flag attached to the front of Mr Howard's vehicle.

Protestors, demanding a cease fire in the Middle East, chanted "we want peace" and handed out flyers proclaiming "Cluster bombs are used by Israel to burn our families in &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. Is this fair?"

Police were taken by surprise at the speed by which the protest escalated into violence. "We were surprised by the approach. It was supposed to be a peaceful demonstration," one officer said. "It had been peaceful up to that point."

Police arrested two men and charged them with disorderly conduct.

Prior to the protest, Mr Howard told his party conference that two things must happen before peace can be realised in the middle east:

"The first is that there must be conditional acceptance throughout the entire Arab world, without exception, of Israel's right to exist in peace and stability behind secure and internationally recognised boundaries."

"The entire Arab world, including &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, must give up forever the idea that the Israelis can be driven from their land."

"The second condition is that there has to be a equally unconditional acceptance, including on behalf of the Israelis, of the need and the justice of an independent &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20Palestine"&gt;Palestinian state&lt;/a&gt;."

"There has to be a two-state solution."

Two gay teens were fined and assaulted by police on 27 July at around 23:30 after cuddling, holding hands and kissing in a public park in &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ABucharest"&gt;Bucharest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. According to their report, the two were subject to humiliation and physical assault by the officers and park guardians, who had approached them on the pretext of checking their &lt;a href="w%3Aidentity%20document"&gt;identification cards&lt;/a&gt;. After beating up the two, one of the officers allegedly said that, "I should tie you up with chains and fuck you until you are cured of your sickness". The two teens were each fined 500 &lt;a href="w%3Alei"&gt;lei&lt;/a&gt; (approximately &lt;a href="w%3A%E2%82%AC"&gt;€&lt;/a&gt;140 or &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;179) for "&lt;a href="w%3Adisturbing%20the%20peace"&gt;disturbing the public peace&lt;/a&gt;", the other alternative being a criminal record for the same offence. They consider this charge to be ungrounded and an act of discrimination against sexual orientation, considering that a heterosexual couple were not prosecuted for engaging in similar acts a few metres away. One of the teens stated that:

Additionally, the police officers threatened the teens that they would beat them again, with "no witnesses", when they were off duty.

Homosexuality, including public manifestations of it, was decriminalised in Romania in 2001, when &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AArticle%20200"&gt;Article 200 of the Penal Code&lt;/a&gt; was fully repealed. Since 2000, the country has an anti-discrimination law which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. However, despite this, social attitudes remain conservative and discrimination remains widespread and rarely reported and investigated, with the 2006 Bucharest &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AGayFest"&gt;GayFest&lt;/a&gt;, held in early June, provoking a violent reaction from many passers-by, even if it took place successfully due to heavy police protection. Gay rights organisations have also complained that when the anti-discrimination law is applied, fines are too low (the average fine for an employer discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation is about 300 lei, or less than €100 or $128).

<h1>ICRC: 28 bodies, 19 children, pulled from rubble after Israeli airstrike, Qana</h1>

In the deadliest single incident in the ongoing &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Hezbollah%20conflict"&gt;Israel-Hezbollah conflict&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i air strike apparently demolished a three-story building in the village of &lt;a href="w%3AQana"&gt;Qana&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, and according to the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Red%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;, killed at least 28 displaced civilians, including 19 children, most of whom handicapped or mentally ill, who were sheltering there. The Lebanese police reported at least 56 fatalities, including 37 children. 

One rescue worker said "The victims all seem to be civilians, women and children". Abu Shadi Jradi, a civil defence official, said the bodies of at least 27 children were found in the rubble. A few wounded men had been evacuated to ambulances in the aftermath, as seen on CNN and FoxNews footage.

Villager Mohammed Ismail said "We want this to stop. May God have mercy on the children. They came here to escape the fighting. They are hitting children to bring the fighters to their knees."

Jim Muir, a &lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; correspondent, said "The three storey building where families have been sheltering in the basement was crushed sideways into an enormous crater by the Israeli bomb strike". He added "Elsewhere in Qana and along the road up from Tyre, many buildings had been similarly crushed." 

About nine out of ten residents are estimated to have left Qana, which has been heavily bombarded by Israeli forces in the current conflict. Those without cars, petrol and other means to leave are left behind. According to Jim Muir who had travelled to Qana along the road from Tyre, the route had been pitted with bomb craters.

Later, Israel agreed to a 48-hour halt in military activities while it investigated the bombing of Qana, while claiming there had been no direct attack on the building at the time of collapse.
However, the Israeli military said it would launch counterattacks in Lebanon if Hezbollah fired more rockets at Israel in the 48-hour period.

<h2>Lebanese reactions</h2>
Anger spread across Lebanon and the Arab world, several thousand Shiite Muslim protesters gathered in front of the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; headquarters in &lt;a href="Beirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; and some smashed their way into the building. The protesters chanted "Death to Israel, Death to America".

Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="Fouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt; called it Israel's "heinous crimes against civilians", and called off a scheduled meeting with US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice saying "There is no place on this sad morning for any discussion other than an immediate and unconditional ceasefire as well as an international investigation into the Israeli massacres in Lebanon now."

The Lebanese Defence Minister Elias Murr commented on the Israeli statement on the &lt;a href="Qatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;-based al-Jazeera TV station, "What do you expect Israel to say? Will it say that it killed 40 children and women?"

<h2>Israeli reactions</h2>

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; expressed "deep regret" for the air strike, but said Israel would not declare a cease-fire until it had reached the targets it had set at the beginning of the war. Olmert, responding to harsh international criticism on the strike, said that Hezbollah had used Qana as a base for launching hundreds of rockets at Israel.

A senior air force commander said Israel had dropped a bomb on the building in Qana on the assumption it was sheltering Hezbollah crews and was unaware civilians were there. The commander said "Had we known there were that many civilians inside, especially woman and children, we certainly would not have attacked it".

According to the Israeli military, the building collapsed eight hours after the attack.
Brigadier General &lt;a href="w%3AAmir%20Eshel"&gt;Amir Eshel&lt;/a&gt;, Head of the Air Force Headquarters told journalists at the Defence Ministry in &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; "the attack on the structure in the Qana village took place between midnight and one in the morning. The gap between the timing of the collapse of the building and the time of the strike on it is unclear".

Eshel and the head of the IDF's Operational Branch, Major General &lt;a href="w%3AGadi%20Eisnkot"&gt;Gadi Eisnkot&lt;/a&gt; said the structure was not being attacked when it collapsed, at around 8:00 in the morning. 

The Israeli military believes that Hezbollah explosives in the building were behind the explosion that caused the collapse: "It's possible that inside the house, something or other was being stored that caused an explosion - something that we didn't succeed in blowing up in the attack and that perhaps was left over there," Brigadier General Eshel said. "I say this very cautiously, because I currently don't have the faintest idea what the explanation for this gap could be."

Eshel added that Hezbullah rocket launchers were hidden in civilian buildings in the village. He proceeded to show video footage of rocket launchers being driven into the village following launches.

<h2>Qana villagers refute IDF claims building fell hours after strike</h2>

Witnesses at the scene said that the strikes on the building was carried out around 1:00 A.M. After the first strike, some of the building's residents run out to survey the damage. A few minutes later, IAF planes struck the building once again, causing the walls to collapse on the residents who still remained inside, killing most of them them in the process.
The building was located in the Hariva neighborhood of Qana.

<h2>Arab world reactions</h2>
&lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said "I think Israeli officials and some American ones should be tried for these sorts of crimes".

&lt;a href="Hezbolla"&gt;Hezbolla&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Nasrallah"&gt;Hassan Nasrallah&lt;/a&gt; said "We will now rig up the fire and retalliate with a venegance. We will send rockets and death to the Zionist enemy, who will pay for this crime. We will hit the US and Britain for supporting this massacre".

&lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;n President &lt;a href="w%3ABashar%20al-Assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt; said "The massacre committed by Israel in Qana this morning shows the barbarity of this aggressive entity. It constitutes state terrorism committed in front of the eyes and ears of the world," 

The &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian President &lt;a href="Hosni%20Mubarak"&gt;Hosni Mubarak&lt;/a&gt; said "The Arab Republic of Egypt is highly disturbed and condemns the irresponsible Israeli attack on the Lebanese village of Qana, which led to the loss of innocent victims, most of which were women and children," a statement from the presidency said.

&lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Abdullah"&gt;King Abdullah&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; said: "This criminal aggression is an ugly crime that has been committed by the Israeli forces in the city of Qana that is a gross violation of all international statutes."

<h2>Reactions from around the World</h2>
The &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="Jacques%20Chirac"&gt;Jacques Chirac&lt;/a&gt;, released a statement "The president learnt with concern about the act of violence which cost the lives of numerous innocent victims, notably women and children in Qana." "France condemns this unjustified action, which demonstrates more than ever the need for an immediate ceasefire without which there will only be other such incidents."

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; has said the "tragedy" in Qana shows the situation in the Middle East "simply cannot continue".
Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, &lt;a href="w%3AMargaret%20Beckett"&gt;Margaret Beckett&lt;/a&gt;, called the strikes "absolutely dreadful" and "quite appalling". She said "We have repeatedly urged Israel to act proportionately,"

&lt;a href="Benedict%20XVI"&gt;Pope Benedict&lt;/a&gt; said "In the name of God, I call on all those responsible for this spiral of violence so that weapons are immediately laid down on all sides."

<h2>Potent symbol</h2>

Qana became a potent symbol of Lebanese civilian deaths by Israeli military bombings after an &lt;a href="w%3A1996%20shelling%20of%20Qana"&gt;earlier incident&lt;/a&gt; in April 1996, when Israeli shelling killed more than 100 civilians sheltering at the base of U.N. peacekeepers in the village during Israel's &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Grapes%20of%20Wrath"&gt;"Grapes of Wrath"&lt;/a&gt; campaign.

<h1>Charles Kennedy rejects leadership allegations</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Charles%20Kennedy%20rejects%20leadership%20allegations&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Kennedy"&gt;Charles Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, who stepped down as leader of the British &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt; party this January, is planning a fresh campaign for his old job, according to today’s &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20of%20the%20World"&gt;News of the World&lt;/a&gt;. But Mr Kennedy, who resigned after admitting he had problems with alcohol, has dismissed such reports.

A senior party source claimed Mr Kennedy is holding weekly meetings with key aids about preparing to contest the Liberal Democrats current leader, &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Menzies%20Campbell"&gt;Sir Menzies Campbell&lt;/a&gt;. It is also claimed Mr Kennedy is “deadly serious” about the challenge.

The source added that if Sir Menzies fails to deliver at this September’s Liberal Democrat conference, the bid could be mounted then, but it is more likely to come after the next &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Election"&gt;General Election&lt;/a&gt;, which is expected to take place in 2010.

Mr Kennedy’s key advisors, which apparently includes the head of campaigns Lord Razzell, are said to be planning a tactic to oppose a potentially damaging &lt;a href="w%3Abiography"&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt; of Mr Kennedy which is due to hit the shelves later this summer.

In a response to the allegations, a statement released on behalf of Mr Kennedy by the Liberal Democrats said: “As everyone knows, long-standing friends and political colleagues remain close to me. We meet frequently and it is simply fanciful to read anything else into such a normal ongoing state of affairs.”

Lord Newby, who was Mr Kennedy’s chief of staff during his reign as Liberal Democrat leader, called the story “ridiculous”.

Sir Menzies, who was chosen by party members to head the party in March, has been criticised over his performance as leader, especially during &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time"&gt;Prime Minister’s Questions&lt;/a&gt;. On Friday, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Black"&gt;Peter Black&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20for%20Wales"&gt;Liberal Democrat Welsh Assembly&lt;/a&gt; member, issued a cutting attack on the 65 year-old, telling him to “shape up”. A recent poll also says that support for the Liberal Democrats has slumped to its lowest point since 2002. The &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3AICM%20%28polling%29"&gt;ICM&lt;/a&gt; survey put the Liberal Democrats at 17%, with the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt; on 39% and &lt;a href="w%3ALabour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; on 35%. 

However, Sir Menzies told &lt;a href="w%3ABBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANewsnight"&gt;Newsnight&lt;/a&gt; recently that he “would not be judged by opinion polls after a few months”. He also said: “If I didn’t think I had the energy, the values and the judgement to be the leader of the Liberal Democrats, I wouldn’t have offered myself for the job.”

<h1>James Bond set at Pinewood Studios destroyed by fire</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=James%20Bond%20set%20at%20Pinewood%20Studios%20destroyed%20by%20fire&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Firefighters have confirmed that the large &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Bond"&gt;James Bond&lt;/a&gt; sound stage at &lt;a href="w%3APinewood%20Studios"&gt;Pinewood Studios&lt;/a&gt; has been destroyed by fire. It is thought eight fire engines were called to the scene near &lt;a href="w%3AIver%20Heath"&gt;Iver Heath&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ABuckinghamshire"&gt;Buckinghamshire&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday morning, where filming for &lt;a href="w%3ACasino%20Royale"&gt;Casino Royale&lt;/a&gt;, the latest Bond movie, has been completed. 

Jen McVean witnessed the event, and she said the stage was “completely on fire”. The set had been transformed into a replica of the &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href="w%3AVenice"&gt;Venice&lt;/a&gt;, but Mrs McVean, who owns a firm at the studios, said: “Nothing is salvageable and there are many, many fire engines there.” One spokesman said around 40 to 50 firefighters were at the scene. 

It is reported that fire damage caused the building’s roof to fall in and firefighters were damping the flames down with specialist equipment. “We do not know the extent of the damage to the 007 stage, although it is believed to be significant,” a spokesman for Pinewood Studios said. “Filming was not taking place. A production had completed filming and its film sets were in the process of being removed,” he added.

No one was reported injured in the incident.

Pinewood, which was created in 1935, was the filming ground for &lt;a href="w%3ADr%20No"&gt;Dr No&lt;/a&gt;, the first ever James Bond movie in 1962. It merged with &lt;a href="w%3AShepperton%20Studios"&gt;Shepperton Studios&lt;/a&gt; in 2001, and high-budget movies like Harry Potter and &lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20and%20the%20Chocolate%20Factory%20%28film%29"&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/a&gt; have since been filmed there. 

In 1984, a sound stage caught fire, but it reopened in January 1985 and was named the &lt;a href="w%3AAlbert%20Brocolli"&gt;Albert Brocolli&lt;/a&gt; sound stage in honour of the man who produced many Bond films. In 1997, Pinewood was hit by fire again after flames broke out in the roof of a sound building where &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Avengers"&gt;The Avengers&lt;/a&gt; was being recorded.

&lt;a href="w%3ACassini"&gt;Cassini&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;European&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; space probe, has taken pictures of what appear to be lakes on the surface of &lt;a href="Saturn"&gt;Saturn&lt;/a&gt;'s moon, &lt;a href="Titan%20%28moon%29"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;. If the findings are confirmed, then Titan will be the only other planetary mass, other than Earth, to have liquid lakes on their surfaces. Some of the 'lakes' also contain channels that lead to and from them. The lakes are believed to have been formed by rainfall of liquid &lt;a href="w%3Amethane"&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Aethane"&gt;ethane&lt;/a&gt;.

Some radar images of the lakes and channels leading to and from them, show areas of black, which indicate that there is no image to display and scientists say that it could mean the surface of the 'lakes' are very smooth and flat.

"What we see is darker than anything we've ever seen elsewhere on Titan. It was almost as though someone laid a bull's-eye around the whole north pole of Titan, and Cassini sees these regions of lakes just like those we see on Earth," said &lt;a href="U.S.%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; Cassini interdisciplinary scientist, Larry Soderblom.

So far scientists have found at least 12 lakes which range between 6 and 62 miles wide.

"It was a real potpourri," said &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Arizona"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; Cassini scientist, Jonathan Lunine. 

"We've always believed Titan's methane had to be maintained by liquid lakes or extensive underground 'methanofers,' the methane equivalent of &lt;a href="w%3Aaquifer"&gt;aquifers&lt;/a&gt;. We can't see methanofers but we can now say we've seen lakes ," added Lunine.

After one of its raids killed at least 56 civilians, Israel agreed on Monday to suspend its aerial activities in south Lebanon for 48 hours. The announcement came after extended meetings between Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, and Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister.

Adam Ereli, a US state department spokesman in Jerusalem, said "Israel has agreed to a 48-hour suspension of aerial activity in south Lebanon to investigate today's tragic incident in Qana,"

The aerial ceasefire began after midnight on Sunday but fighting on the ground continues as Israeli forces aim to create a 'security zone' inside Lebanon along the Israeli border. Lebanon has no air force nor air defences.

Gadi Eisenkaut, army operations chief General, said "By Wednesday we are going to establish a two-kilometer (one-mile) wide 'security zone' in which there will be no infrastructure or sign of Hezbollah's presence"

Today New Zealand's new coins have been released. The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20dollar%23Changes%20to%20Coins"&gt;new coins&lt;/a&gt; replace the 10, 20 and 50 cent coins, while the 5-cent coin is being removed from circulation for good.

The new coins retain the same design as before but the 10-cent coin is now &lt;a href="w%3Acopper"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt; coloured. All coins except the 10-cent are now made from plated steel and nickel, making them lighter and cheaper to produce. The 10-cent coin is made from plated &lt;a href="w%3Asteel"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; and copper.

Brian Lang, &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Reserve Bank of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; Currency Manager, said: "The introduction of smaller, lighter coins is one of New Zealand's biggest currency changes since the introduction of decimal currency on 10 July 1967."

The Reserve Bank reports that they have issued 1,037 million coins since the introduction of decimal currency.

However, people can still use their old change between now and 1 November 2006, when the old coins will cease being &lt;a href="w%3Alegal%20tender"&gt;legal tender&lt;/a&gt;.

A survey conducted by &lt;a href="w%3AACNielsen"&gt;ACNielsen&lt;/a&gt;, on behalf of the Reserve Bank, in January 2004 shows that 51% liked the idea of the new coins initially.

The &lt;a href="w%3AANZ%20Bank"&gt;ANZ Bank&lt;/a&gt; are asking for people to donate their old 5-cent coins to Plunket in their '5s for under fives' appeal.

Israeli jets have carried out strikes in southern Lebanon, despite agreeing to halt air attacks for 48 hours. An army spokesman has confirmed the action saying that the plane was intended to support ground troops in the area and was not targeting anything specific.

Meanwhile Israeli Defense Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAmir_Peretz"&gt;Amir Peretz&lt;/a&gt; addressed parliament saying that an immediate cease was not planned and that military action in Lebanon would continue.

He said "It's forbidden to agree to an immediate cease-fire, Israel will expand and strengthen its activities against the Hezbollah."

Two lesbians who married lawfully in &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; have failed in their High Court bid to have their matrimony accepted under law in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. 

Sue Wilkinson and Celia Kitzinger married in Vancouver in 2003, and they now live together in North Yorkshire. But they say the UK’s failure to accept the legality of their vows infringes a fundamental human right; under Article twelve of the Human Rights Act, it is stated that everyone has a right to marry.

But &lt;a href="w%3ASir%20MarkPotter"&gt;Sir Mark Potter&lt;/a&gt;, the President of the High Court Family Division, ruled today that their union should be accepted as a civil partnership instead of marriage. He emphasised that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman designed for creating and bringing children up: “It is apparent that the majority of people, or at least of governments, not only in England but Europe-wide, regard marriage as an age-old institution, valued and valuable, respectable and respected, and as a means not only of encouraging monogamy but also the procreation of children and their development and nurture in a family unit in which both maternal and paternal influences are available in respect of their nurture and upbringing.” 

The judge also said same-sex laws in England are in no way inferior as they are recognised as civil partnerships which give gay and lesbian couples the same rights as married couples on many issues. However, the two women say civil partnerships are not good enough for gay couples.

After the hearing, Ms Wilkinson said she and Ms Kitzinger were deeply disappointed by the judge’s decision. She said they had been stripped of their marriage by a judge who believes the traditional notion of marriage as being between a man and a woman so they can create children. “It perpetuates discrimination and it sends out a message that lesbian and gay marriages are inferior,” she commented. The couple are now seeking financial help so they can mount an appeal. “This judgement will not stand the test of time. We are looking forward to the day when there is full equality of marriage, not just for us but for all same-sex couples,” Ms Wilkinson added.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; passed a resolution today demanding &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; halt all "enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development" before August 31. The resolution was passed under Article 40, Chapter VII of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Charter"&gt;UN Charter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which sets the stage for possible economic sanctions if Iran does not comply with the resolution, but does not authorise military action. Iran's envoy to the UN has rejected the move.

The resolution, number 1696, was drafted by the permanent five members of the council and was passed by a 14-1 vote, with &lt;a href="Qatar"&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, the only Arab member of the council voting against.

The resolution expressed "serious concern" at &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;'s non-compliance with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's demand to halt enrichment and other activities and asked the IAEA director to report on Iran's compliance by the end of August. This is the first legally binding demand on Iran to halt enrichment work, and the first to suggest possible sanctions. The resolution says that "appropriate measures" will be taken if Iran does not comply, but does not explicitly state any threat of sancions. 

Iran's ambassador to the UN, Javad Zarif told the Reuters news agency, "Iran's peaceful nuclear programme poses no threat to international peace and security and therefore dealing with this issue in the Security Council is unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility,"

Valery Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN said the deadline was meant to meet Iran's request to allow it to consider an offer made in June by the permanent five and Germany, offering Iran a "package" of sops in return for giving up enrichment activities.

<h3>&lt;a href="Israel%20suspends%20air%20strikes%20after%20deadly%20strike%20on%20Qana"&gt;Israel suspends air strikes after deadly strike on Qana&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Lebanon

After one of its raids killed at least 56 civilians, Israel agreed on Monday to suspend its aerial activities in south Lebanon for 48 hours. The announcement came after extended meetings between Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, and Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister.

<h3>&lt;a href="Israeli%20jets%20attack%20southern%20Lebanon%20despite%20partial%20halt%20to%20air%20strikes"&gt;Israeli jets attack southern Lebanon despite partial halt to air strikes&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

Yet, despite agreeing to halt air attacks for 48 hours, Israeli jets have carried out strikes in southern Lebanon. An army spokesman has confirmed the action saying it was intended to support ground troops in the area and was not targeting anything specific.
<h3>&lt;a href="Security%20Council%20sets%20deadline%20over%20Iran%20nuclear%20program"&gt;Security Council sets deadline over Iran nuclear program&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

United Nations

The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution today demanding Iran halt all "enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development" before August 31. The resolution was passed under Article 40, Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which sets the stage for possible economic sanctions if Iran does not comply with the resolution, but does not authorise military action. Iran's envoy to the UN has rejected the move. 
<h3>&lt;a href="Lesbians%20lose%20High%20Court%20marriage%20bid"&gt;Lesbians lose High Court marriage bid&lt;/a&gt;</h3>

United Kingdom

Two lesbians who married lawfully in Canada have failed in their High Court bid to have their matrimony accepted under law in the United Kingdom.

&lt;a href="w%3AMel%20Gibson"&gt;Mel Gibson&lt;/a&gt; made &lt;a href="w%3Aanti-semitic"&gt;anti-semitic&lt;/a&gt; remarks after being pulled over for drunk driving, having a blood alcohol level of .12. After being pulled over, Gibson berated the police, calling them 'motherfuckers' and saying he would 'fuck them'. The police report also said "Gibson almost continually [sic] threatened me saying he 'owns Malibu' and will spend all of his money to 'get even' with me." Gibson went on to say "Fucking Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world," and then he asked the deputy: "Are you a Jew?" He also is reported to have referred to a female police officer as "sugar tits".

On Saturday, Gibson released this statement. &lt;a href="http%3A//sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ffile%3D/n/a/2006/07/29/entertainment/e133616D89.DTL"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Tents began sprouting in &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;’s capital Sunday afternoon after leftist presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AAndres%20Manuel%20Lopez%20Obrador"&gt;Andres Manuel López Obrador&lt;/a&gt; called on his supporters to set up camp on the capital until a recount is ordered by the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Electoral%20Tribunal"&gt;Federal Electoral Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. 

The encampments are to be placed along a 4.6-mile stretch of the city. As of now, the number of people in the camps is unknown but the encampments themselves are expected to block most of the streets in the city, an expectation made much more believable by the fact that in Sunday, only hours after Obrador’s message, one of the capital’s major avenues was blocked for miles. This was only the latest action in a series of protests after the controversial elections that took place in July 2, when &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Calder%C3%B3n"&gt;Felipe Calderón&lt;/a&gt; beat López Obrador, the candidate considered most popular, by less than a percentage point. López Obrador stated he will only back down if the recount is made and a winner is re-chosen, subsequently the protests are not expected to stop until the Federal Electoral Tribunal makes a decision upon the disputed election.

Currently there are 676,000 &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%202006%20Census"&gt;Canada 2006 Census&lt;/a&gt; forms unfilled countrywide following the &lt;a href="w%3AMay%2016"&gt;May 16&lt;/a&gt; census, a large number for &lt;a href="w%3AAlberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. Canada operates a mandatory &lt;a href="w%3Acensus"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt;, requiring all citizens to participate or face court action, a $500 &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20dollar"&gt;CAD&lt;/a&gt; fine and/or three months &lt;a href="w%3Aprison"&gt;imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;.

Census workers are coming to citizens' houses and asking them to fill them out. “We’ll keep following up until we get them; it’s just costing taxpayers lots and lots of money for us to keep doing it,” said Lisa Gibbons from &lt;a href="w%3AStatistics%20Canada"&gt;Statistics Canada&lt;/a&gt;.

"The census provides a snapshot of the country as a whole and of individual provinces, and each community and how it compares with where it was five years ago," said Gibbons.

&lt;a href="w%3AMadrid"&gt;MADRID, Spain&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="w%3AFloyd%20Landis"&gt;Floyd Landis&lt;/a&gt; requested the testing of his backup urine sample today.

"We've sent the fax to the UCI this afternoon." "Now we'll have to adjust to their calendar," said Jose Maria Buxeda, one of Landis's two Spanish lawyers, of the Swiss-based &lt;a href="w%3AUnion%20Cycliste%20Internationale"&gt;International Cycling Union&lt;/a&gt;. Landis's lawyers say they fully expect the backup test to confirm the original finding.

&lt;a href="w%3AOscar%20Pereiro"&gt;Oscar Pereiro&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, who finished second overall in the &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;, would be declared the winner if Landis loses the title.

Results will be revealed during the week.

President &lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ACuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; has temporarily handed duties, including command of the military forces, to his brother, &lt;a href="w%3ARa%C3%BAl%20Castro"&gt;Raúl Castro&lt;/a&gt;. Fidel Castro is undergoing intestinal surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding, and is temporarily unable to govern. 75-year-old Raúl Castro has been the Vice-President of Cuba and number two in the Communist Party of Cuba. Fidel Castro is 79 years old and has ruled since the 1959 revolution.

The power change was reported on Cuban television Monday night by Carlos Balenciago, Castro's secretary. According to the letter of Castro's that he read, the reason for the operation was stress and the President of Cuba will need to spend several weeks in bed.

Over 70% of Cuba's population was born after Castro's rise to power, who has served as president ever since. It is unknown how the population will react to such an unexpected change. However, a recently signed White House bill has allocated $30 million US dollars for the transition to a new Cuban regime in the case of just such an event.

The massive surge of hot air that has plagued the West and Midwest during last week has now moved over the &lt;a href="w%3Aeastern%20seaboard"&gt;eastern seaboard&lt;/a&gt; of the United States. Residents are bracing themselves for what could be record breaking temperatures.

Many cities are already struggling due to power outages from mid-July's Heat Wave, particularly some in the &lt;a href="w%3AQueens"&gt;Queens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStaten%20Island"&gt;Staten Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AConsolidated%20Edison"&gt;Consolidated Edison&lt;/a&gt;, the power supplier for the New York City area, has reported that many customers are still without power. They urge customers to lighten the load on power usage to help avoid further service interruption. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; are all expecting highs to reach above 100º&lt;a href="w%3AFahrenheit"&gt;F&lt;/a&gt; (37.8º&lt;a href="w%3ACelsius"&gt;C&lt;/a&gt;). The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Weather%20Service"&gt;National Weather Service&lt;/a&gt; has posted Excessive Heat Warnings for many of the cities in the eastern seaboard that do not normally experience this type of dangerously hot weather. 

On Tuesday August 1, 2006 according to &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Weather%20Channel"&gt;The Weather Channel&lt;/a&gt;, New York City will have a high temperature of 98ºF in &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Park"&gt;Central Park&lt;/a&gt;, however other areas in the New York City area are expected to rise above 100ºF. Philadelphia will reach 100ºF, Washington D.C. will have a high of 101ºF and Baltimore and &lt;a href="w%3ARichmond"&gt;Richmond&lt;/a&gt; may see temperatures rise above the 100 mark. To exacerbate the situation, &lt;a href="w%3Aheat%20index"&gt;heat indices&lt;/a&gt; are expected to reach well over the 110s for much of the east coast due to high &lt;a href="w%3Ahumidity"&gt;humidity&lt;/a&gt; levels. 

An Air Stagnation Advisory has also been issued for much of the urban areas on the eastern seaboard and "&lt;a href="w%3ABosWash"&gt;BosWash&lt;/a&gt;", as rain is expected to be very minimal through Thursday. Many residents say this heat is unheard of as temperatures are expected to be higher than that of Florida and some parts of Texas, where it is typically hotter. The oppressive and dangerously high temperatures will remain this way well into Thursday afternoon, according to meteorologists, when a cool front is expected to move in and provide much needed relief.

Extreme heat alerts have been issued in &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="w%3AToronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;.

Temperatures are expected to go into the mid 30s C (80-90s F) with the humidex expected to reach into the high 40s C (117-120 F).

Smoggy air is expected to move into the Toronto-area on Tuesday from the &lt;a href="w%3AWindsor%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20Ontario"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; corridor, where a smog alert was also in place on Monday.

The heat has been compounded by severe storms over the weekend in &lt;a href="w%3Asouthwestern%20Ontario"&gt;southwestern Ontario&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3APeterborough"&gt;Peterborough&lt;/a&gt; area.

Almost 31,000 residences were without power for a couple of hours in Peterborough County after a storm was in the area, uprooting trees and knocking down hydro poles. It also tore a roof off a house.

The City of Toronto opens public cooling stations at the &lt;a href="w%3AEast%20York%20Civic%20Centre"&gt;East York Civic Centre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEtobicoke%20Civic%20Centre"&gt;Etobicoke Civic Centre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20York%20Civic%20Centre"&gt;North York Civic Centre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMetro%20Hall"&gt;Metro Hall&lt;/a&gt;.

Toronto set a new record for any date when the overnight temperature did not go lower than 27 C (aprox. 84 F) overnight, besting the record of 26.5 set in 1999. The daytime &lt;a href="w%3Ahumidex"&gt;humidex&lt;/a&gt; hit 47 C (aprox. 117 F) by mid-day and was expected to go slightly higher in the afternoon.

A new report released by the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Ministry%20of%20Health"&gt;New Zealand Ministry of Health&lt;/a&gt; titled "Suicide Trends" shows that the &lt;a href="w%3Asuicide"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; rate in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; has decreased 15% since its peak in the late 1990's, but the attempted suicide rate is increasing.

There were 12 deaths per 100,000 people between 1983-'85. 16.7 deaths per 100,000 people between 1996-'98. And 14.2 deaths per 100,000 people between 2001-'03. But there were 73.1 attempted suicides per 100,000 people between 1995-'97 compared to 82.5 in 2002-'04.

&lt;a href="w%3AJim%20Anderton"&gt;Jim Anderton&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Health Minister, said "It provides some comfort to see the long-term trend still appears to be heading in the right direction, with a continued decline or levelling off of self-inflicted deaths but there is no room for complacency."

The suicide report also shows that:
<ul>
BULLET::::- The 25- to 34-year-old age group has the highest suicide rate
BULLET::::- Between 2000-'03 Maori has the highest suicide rate
BULLET::::- Men were less likely than woman to go to hospital for attempted suicide because more men died from suicide.

</ul>
The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Government"&gt;New Zealand Government&lt;/a&gt; has put &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;10.3 million towards direct suicide prevention. New Zealand News agencies are banned by law from reporting suicide deaths.

&lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;n and &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n border guards exchanged fire yesterday across the border, the first such incident in about a year. 

The exchange occurred on July 31, 2006 at sundown, when, according to a claim from Major Kim-Tae-hoon of South Korea, North Korean soldiers fired two shots at a South Korean guard post in the eastern Korean de-militarised zone.

Major Kim Tae-hoon also said that South Koreans returned six rounds of fire.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (the North) and the Republic of Korea (the South) have been at war since 1950, the beginning of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKorean%20War"&gt;Korean War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , which had no peace treaty which was signed by the two parties.

&lt;a href="w%3AScientist"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; have developed a new way to ensure &lt;a href="w%3Aboiled%20eggs"&gt;boiled eggs&lt;/a&gt; are perfectly cooked thanks to a brand new hi-tech logo being printed on shells. 

After cooking starts, people will be able to see if their egg is soft, medium or hard-boiled with the help of a &lt;a href="w%3AThermochromism"&gt;thermochromic&lt;/a&gt; print which appears in black ink on the egg’s shell. 

The eggs will be sold to consumers in the UK within the next few months. A spokeswoman for Lion Quality, the assurance scheme which came up with the idea, said: “We had a lot of inquiries from people which sparked an interest in the industry. We said OK, this is a big issue - people can’t even boil an egg.”

Gilly Beaumont, from B&amp;H Colour Change, the company which created the logos, said: "We are still perfecting the technology, but we are very excited at the prospect of sorting a problem that has wound people up at breakfast time for decades."

The most successful way to cook an egg has baffled some of the greatest chefs in the past. In 1998, &lt;a href="w%3ADelia%20Smith"&gt;Delia Smith&lt;/a&gt; dedicated a whole episode of her How To Cook programme on the best way to boil an egg. And last year, a survey carried out by the magazine 
Waitrose Food Limited showed five top chefs all had different techniques.

The soldiers were airlifted in by helicopter, supported by Israeli warplanes which targeted at least five suspected Hezbollah positions near Baalbek. The helicopters came under heavy Hezbollah fire and had to retreat while the Israeli raid was ongoing.

Israeli aircrafts hit several locations near Baalbek and there was a large amount of helicopter activity east and west of Baalbek, according to the Lebanese army sources. 

Hezbollah said Israeli commandos were pinned down inside the Dar al-Hikma Hospital near Baalbek when Hezbollah fighters surrounded the building. The Israeli soldiers inside were said to be checking the identification papers of patients and staff. The skirmishes between the Israeli commandos and Hezbollah fighters lasted several hours. Five Lebanese men were captured by the commandos and subsequently airlifted from the area.

Israeli forces claimed it had killed up to ten Hezbollah fighters and seized five more in Jemmaliyeh, near the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek. Between 16 to 19 civilians, including 4 to 7 children, were reportedly killed. Hospital sources said that 20 people were wounded in the Israeli raids. Police reported that five Lebanese men were captured and taken into Israel by the commando team.

Dan Halutz, Israeli chief of staff, said: "We have carried out this operation to prove that we can hit everywhere in Lebanon". He added: "during the Baalbek operation special forces captured five members of Hezbollah while more than 10 others were hit." 

A Hezbollah statement said "the Islamic Resistance announces that it has foiled an Israeli landing operation in Baalbek and denies that the enemy had captured any of its members". Hezbollah claimed those abducted were civilians.

Resulting from the Israeli bombings on July 13 and 15, 2006 of the Jiyeh power station, located on the coast 30 kilometers south of &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 35,000 tons of heavy fuel oil have spilled into the Mediterranean Sea. The Lebanese Ministry of Environment expects additional tonnage to flow into the sea as a result of the damage. For comparison, the &lt;a href="w%3AExxon%20Valdez%20oil%20spill"&gt;Exxon Valdez oil spill&lt;/a&gt; released nearly 40,000 tons.

According to Berj Hatjian from the Lebanon Ministry of Environment, "What we have here is equivalent to a tanker sinking, and 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes reaching the shoreline." Furthermore, several storage tanks caught fire due to the blast of the bombardment and continued to burn uncontrollably for 10 days after. Wind and water currents have spread the oil slick across 70-80 kilometers of Lebanon coastline.

On July 19th, 2006, &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%20Police%20Department"&gt;Philadelphia police&lt;/a&gt; took a 21-year old student, Neftaly Cruz into custody for photographing the arrest of an alleged drug dealer in his neighborhood.

Roused by commotion in his neighborhood, Cruz saw the street outside his house lined with &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20car"&gt;police vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and proceeded to photograph the event with his camera phone. Soon after, one of the police officers walked onto his property, grabbed his hand, placed him in &lt;a href="w%3Ahandcuffs"&gt;handcuffs&lt;/a&gt; and drove off with him. Gerrell Martin, a neighborhood woman, witnessed and confirmed these events. She recalls the officer said to Cruz while restraining him, "You should have just went in the house and minded your own business instead of trying to take pictures off your picture phone."

According to Cruz, "They threatened to charge me with &lt;a href="w%3Aconspiracy"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;, impeding an investigation, obstruction of an investigation. They said, 'You were impeding this investigation.' (I asked,) 'By doing what?' (The officer said,) 'By taking a picture of the police officers with a camera phone.'"

After detaining him for over an hour, Philadelphia Police finally released him with a warning that, according to Cruz, "if the supervisor was there I wouldn't be a free man and that he is letting me go because he felt that I was a good person."

A study by researchers at the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Toronto"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt; found that teenagers demonstrate a strong command of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Agrammar"&gt;grammar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in their &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Atext%20messaging"&gt;text messaging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The study found that while informal forms such as acronyms like "&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALOL%20%28Internet%20slang%29"&gt;lol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " (laughing out loud) are used in text messaging, more formal language constructs that are not usually used in spoken language were also used in messaging. For instance, the word "said" was used in messaging instead of "was like", a common informal spoken phrase. 

The study found that instant messaging language does mirror patterns in speech, but also uses constructs from a wide range of diction. 

Prof. Sali Tagliamonte, a professor of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Alinguistics"&gt;linguistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at the University of Toronto, said parents and teachers shouldn't be concerned that this new medium is corrupting young people's grammar. "I don't think parents have to worry, because they're really showing that they are creative and that they have a mastery of the language. They are not using ruinous language," he said. "What these kids are doing is showing us that they have a really good command of the English language, so much so that I was really blown away by how fluidly they operate," he added.

The research was presented today at the annual meeting of the Linguistics Association of Canada and the United States.

&lt;a href="w%3ARotorua"&gt;Rotorua&lt;/a&gt; has banned criminals with five or more dishonesty convictions from entering the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Business%20District"&gt;Central Business District&lt;/a&gt; (CBD). The criminals will be issued with trespass notices banning them from the main streets of Rotorua.

Eleven out of twelve councillors, including the Rotorua mayor, supported the by-law along with support from the police.

Kevin Winters, Mayor of Rotorua, said "The ban also had the support of local businesses, who wanted an end to the thefts, assaults, shoplifting and other street crime on Rotorua streets. Crime was an issue in the area. Five strikes and you're out."

The trespass notice would ban the offenders from the CBD for three months, but would allow them to enter if they had appointments or emergencies.

They would have CCTV cameras operated by volunteers to catch offenders breaking the trespass notice.

However Bill Hodge, constitutional law expert, said "It's the king's highway and you've got a right to go down the king's highway...so I don't think they can treat you as a trespasser for going down the street."

The councillors would review the impact of the legislation in three years time.

Rotorua already has legislation similar to this one acting at the Kuirau Park, &lt;a href="w%3AImage%3ARotorua-GardensAndBuilding.jpg"&gt;Government Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and the Lakefront.

The father of a &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Asoldier"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt; who was killed in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; yesterday has paid tribute to his son. 

29 year-old Corporal Matthew Cornish, who was married with two young children, sustained injuries after a mortar attack on a base in &lt;a href="w%3ABasra"&gt;Basra&lt;/a&gt;. He was rushed to hospital, but he later died. He was the first soldier to be killed in an attack on a UK military compound in Iraq.

"I’m proud of him as a soldier and as a son. He did the &lt;a href="w%3AArmy"&gt;Army&lt;/a&gt; proud," 60 year-old Robin Cornish said of his son, the one hundred and fifteenth British soldier to be killed in Iraq since operations began in 2003.

Cpl Cornish, who served for the 1st Battalion The Light Infantry, joined the Army at the age of eighteen in &lt;a href="w%3ALeeds"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;. His deployments included &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASierra%20Leone"&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/a&gt; and Iraq in 2003 and 2004. He had been touring the country for a third time for three months when he was killed. His father said he would have risen through the ranks: "He would have got on. He was determined to go up the ladder and he would have got there."

Cpl Cornish grew up near &lt;a href="w%3AOtley"&gt;Otley&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Yorkshire"&gt;West Yorkshire&lt;/a&gt;. He was killed on &lt;a href="w%3AYorkshire%20Day"&gt;Yorkshire Day&lt;/a&gt;.

Yesterday, Cpl Cornish's Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Johnny Bowron, said: "Matthew was a great soldier, a fine friend and a marvellous husband and father. He will be remembered for his heart and his great character. A Yorkshire man through and through and an enthusiastic follower of Leeds Rhinos Rugby League, he was constantly teased for his inexplicable loyalty to &lt;a href="w%3ATottenham%20Hotspur%20Football%20Club"&gt;Tottenham Hotspur Football Club&lt;/a&gt;."

Cpl Cornish leaves behind his wife Abbey, his three-year old son Ethan and his one-year old daughter Libby. Lt Col Bowron said Cpl Cornish's true passion was for his family. "They were what lay closest to his heart - the rest was irrelevant."

Elsewhere, in southern &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, three UK troops died after a vehicle patrol was attacked by militants. So far in 2006, nine British troops have died there.

&lt;a href="w%3ADes%20Browne"&gt;Des Browne&lt;/a&gt;, the Defence Secretary, commented on the loss of life in both Iraq and Afghanistan yesterday. "Our troops are doing a tough job magnificently well. Their courage and commitment demands nothing but admiration."

The &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; Health Ministry has stated that at least seven people, including three children from Northern &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; Province in the district of Karo, are being hospitalized with suspected &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Bird Flu&lt;/a&gt; and officials believe that the infected are part of "two clusters" of family members who are sick. The individuals are being treated at Adam Malik Hospital located in Medan. All individuals were admitted on Tuesday. 

The ♡❤Associated Press♡❤ quoted Nyoman Kandun, a Health Ministry official, as saying, "there are two clusters, one with two sisters, the other with three family members, and another two of their neighbours." The three children range in age from 18 months to six-years-old. 

However; experts are waiting on results from tests on the individuals and must be "scientifically proven," said Runizar Ruesin, also a Health Ministry official.

The condition of all victims are stable, however; all victims have a fever, a cough, and flu-like symptoms which officials say resemble the symptoms of Bird Flu.

"Their lungs have not shown signs of pneumonia but we have to keep monitoring them because in one or two days things could change," said hospital director, Luhur Suroso.

According to anti-bird flu task force member, Bayu Krisnamurthi, if the situation is or becomes "feasible as far as the procedure is concerned" then poultry local to the area will be "culled" beginning "today."

In May, seven members of the same family from the same district died when becoming infected with Bird Flu, possibly through human-to-human transmission. So far, officials have not stated if this is the case or not in the new clusters.

Around twelve people were killed in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; today while they were playing &lt;a href="Football%20%28soccer%29"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; on a makeshift pitch in a predominantly &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a%20Islam"&gt;Shi'a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; area in west &lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. According to police, two bombs, which had been planted in the middle of the pitch, were detonated. It is thought most of the victims were children. 

Earlier today, Iraq’s President &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJalal%20Talabani"&gt;Jalal Talabani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; revealed Iraqi troops would take over safekeeping of the entire country from American troops by the end of 2006. He said the takeover would occur gradually but would be complete by the start of 2007.

Yesterday, more than fifty people were killed across the country.

With an absence of fanfare, the foodstuffs renamed three years ago to "" and "Freedom toast" have reverted to their previous names of "French fries" and "French toast" respectively, for food service of the and .

In March 2003, of Ohio and of North Carolina instituted changing food references of "French" to "Freedom" as a propaganda response to the refusal of France to participate in the U.S.-initiated .

Calling great public attention to the name change on March 11 of that 2003, Ney said, "This action today is a small but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure of many on Capitol Hill with the actions of our so-called ally, France." At the time Ney chaired the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20House%20Administration"&gt;House Committee on House Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which controls those cafeterias.

Currently, Rep. of Michigan chairs the House Administration Committee, and his spokesman has responded to the return of French fries and French toast with: "Officially the committee has no comment on the matter. I really don't see how this is a story."

&lt;a href="w%3ATaranaki"&gt;Taranaki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; policeman, Constable Jonathan Erwood, has been charged with drunk driving after responding to a double fatality emergency call on July 9, his day off. He had been giving the driver first aid and then after 20 minutes at the scene another police officer turned up and breathalysed him.

He was then taken to the police station and undertook an elected blood test, which he failed. The limit is 80-milligrams per 100-millilitres and Erwood had 106-milligrams of alcohol per 100-millilitres.

The crash was between Taranaki and &lt;a href="w%3AWaikato"&gt;Waikato&lt;/a&gt;, which is on &lt;a href="w%3AState%20highways%23New%20Zealand"&gt;State Highway 3&lt;/a&gt;.
He appeared in court today and entered no plea to the charges laid against him.

Supporters of Erwood said he had no choice but to go to the scene of the crash.

Greg O'Conner, Police Association President, said that he does not condone drink driving, but these are exceptional circumstances, adding "The association will be actively advocating that the officer should keep his job."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; has announced that it is moving forward in approving &lt;a href="w%3Aover%20the%20counter%20drug"&gt;over-the-counter&lt;/a&gt; (OTC) sale of the &lt;a href="w%3Aemergency%20contraception"&gt;emergency contraceptive&lt;/a&gt; pill, "Plan B" to women above 18 years of age. The delayed approval of this drug has been raised in the Senate confirmation hearings for President Bush's nominee for the head of the FDA, &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20C.%20von%20Eschenbach"&gt;Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach&lt;/a&gt;.

Emergency contraceptives, also known as "morning-after pills" are used to prevent an unintended pregnancy, after unprotected intercourse has occurred. They usually contain high doses of the same drugs that are used in regular contraceptive pills. 

While they are considered as contraceptives by the medical establishment and by law, and classified as such by the FDA, some abortion opponents object to ECs as they believe that they constitute &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;. Some groups object to emergency contraception believing that it encourages sexual exploitation of young girls and some religious conservatives object to it as they believe that it promotes promiscuous behavior. Proponents of its use contend that it is merely a form of contraception, and point out that other forms, such as condoms or birth-control pills are widely used and that its use serves an important purpose, in cases where other contraceptives have failed (eg. a condom is torn) or to prevent conception in a rape victim. Approval for OTC sale would make the drug more easily available, which is considered important as the drug must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse to be effective. 

The FDA's approval process for the Plan B pills, which contain the drug Levonorgestrel and are manufactured by Duramed, a subsidiary of Barr Laboratories has been mired in controversy since at least 2000, when the American Medical Association announced support for OTC availability. Last year, the FDA rejected the manufacturer's request to approve the pill for OTC sale, citing concerns over "potential behavioral implications for younger adolescents". The decision was criticised by advocates of EC as being based on political considerations rather than scientific reasons. The Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog also faulted the decision process. The FDA has also revised the minimum age of customers from 16 to 17 to now, 18.

Currently, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is holding hearings on the confirmation of the FDA Commissioner nominee, Dr. von Eschenbach. Senators &lt;a href="w%3APatty%20Murray"&gt;Patty Murray&lt;/a&gt;(D) and &lt;a href="w%3AHillary%20Rodham%20Clinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;(D) have held up the approval pending progress on the pill's approval process. Plan B was endorsed by a F.D.A. committee three years ago but had been denied approval for OTC sale by higher officials in the FDA. During the nomination of the last FDA Commissioner, Dr. Lester M. Crawford, Senators raised the issue and went ahead with the nomination after getting assurances that the drug's approval would be given in a timely manner. The deadlines set then were not met.

Senator Clinton was reported as saying: "Like so much of this government in the past five and a half years, it has been turned into a political football, and you're on the field. This is not just about Plan B. Once we start politicizing the F.D.A. there is no stopping. It is essential that we draw a line, and we are drawing a line right here."

In the confirmation hearings, Dr. Von Eschenbach said he would not take political orders on scientific matters. "No one told me what I could or should do," he said. 

The FDA statement said that its latest decision was to approve OTC sale was "the result of a thoughtful and comprehensive scientific and public policy process undertaken by the Agency to resolve the novel and significant issues presented by the Sponsor's amended application."

Sale of &lt;a href="w%3Aoral%20contraceptives"&gt;oral contraceptives&lt;/a&gt; otherwise continues to require prescription by a state-licensed doctor, according to FDA regulation.

The ♡❤Buffalo News♡❤ is reporting that leaders of unions representing city employees in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;, met on Wednesday to discuss a possible 'citywide strike.' If the unions decided on a strike, firefighters, police officers, teachers and many other city employees would not show up for work.

The ♡❤News♡❤ is reporting that employees are upset about the wage-freeze which was put into effect when the Control Board took control of the city's finances 27 months ago. Some employees even call the wage freeze "working class genocide."

"Genocide of the working class is also illegal," president of the Police Benevolent Association, Robert P. Meegan Jr., said to reporters when told that a strike would be illegal, after the meeting.

"We don't expect to see any job actions with the bargaining units directly under the city administration. The fact that their legal counsel wouldn't let [unions] comment any further speaks for itself," said mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown in reference to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20state"&gt;New York state&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ATaylor%20Law"&gt;Taylor Law&lt;/a&gt; which makes striking illegal.

Members of the &lt;a href="w%3ABoard%20of%20Control"&gt;Control Board&lt;/a&gt; have refused to comment to the press about the option to strike.

A lawsuit has been filed by the &lt;a href="w%3APolice%20Benevolent%20Association"&gt;Police Benevolent Association&lt;/a&gt;'s union which would allow workers to strike if a judge grants permission to do so.

The &lt;a href="w%3AChicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; city council passed an ordinance on Wednesday a week ago that requires retailers such as &lt;a href="w%3ATarget"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Depot"&gt;Home Depot&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href="w%3ABig-box%20store"&gt;big box-store&lt;/a&gt; operations to pay a higher wage than the state minimum and offer benefits to their employees within Chicago city limits. The mayor of Chicago, &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Daley"&gt;Richard M. Daley&lt;/a&gt;, opposes the ordinance, though he has yet to state whether or not he intends to exercise his veto power. Because of the ordinance, Target has already put on hold the building of one store in Chicago's south side and other new developments are in jeopardy. 

The ordinance applies to stores of at least 90,000 square feet operated by companies with more than $1 billion in annual sales. Starting in July of 2007, employees of these stores have a minimum wage $9.25 per hour and $1.50 per hour in benefits. By 2010, this will rise to $10 and $3, respectively. After 2010, the increases will be tied to the cost of living.

The current state mandated minimum hourly wage rate is $6.50 for an Illinois employee.

Preliminary tests performed on samples taken from six villagers in the Kabanjahe District of &lt;a href="w%3ASumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; have tested negative for the deadly &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; virus.

"Investigations by the ministry of health lab and Namru, too, on August 2 and 3 on all specimens collected from the suspected cases in Kabanjahe district came up negative," said Indonesia's health minister, Siti Fadilah Supari.

Final test results are expected in at least seven days from the Center for Disease Control (&lt;a href="w%3ACDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;) in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta%2C%20Georgia"&gt;Atlanta, Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. "The World Health Organization (&lt;a href="w%3AWHO"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;) requires human samples to be sent to one of WHO's six collaborative centres. So, we only need to send them to CDC Atlanta as it has worked with the U.S. NAMRU-2 lab here," added Supari.

Supari also stated that all individuals are suffering from the "common flu."

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Two of the most senior &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral"&gt;General&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; conceded that the recent upsurge in sectarian violence in &lt;a href="w%3AIraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; may mean a rapid descent into &lt;a href="w%3ACivil%20War"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACongress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;, Thursday.

General &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Abizaid"&gt;John Abizaid&lt;/a&gt;, the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, warned the Senate Armed Services Committee that "Iraq could move toward civil war" if the violence is not contained and stopped soon adding "Sectarian violence is probably as bad as I have seen it." 

General &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Pace"&gt;Peter Pace&lt;/a&gt;, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated "We do have the possibility of that devolving into civil war." He added that this does not need to happen, and is controlled more by the Iraqis than the U.S. Military.

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; and Defense Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; have refused to call the current situation in Iraq a civil war, even with Rumsfeld admitting in a press conference on Wednesday that violence in Iraq is on the increase, overall. 

The statements by the two top U.S. generals echoed a warning to the British government by William Patey, its ambassador to Baghdad, who predicted in a confidential memo that Iraq would break up along ethnic lines and that "the prospect of a low intensity civil war and a de facto division of Iraq is probably more likely at this stage than a successful and substantial transition to a stable democracy."

Flooding due to heavy rains has devastated &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; (DPRK), leaving over 100 dead and thousands homeless. The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;' official figures give the death toll at 154, with 127 more missing. North Korean officials have said that hundreds have been killed.

However, The &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n aid organisation &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friends"&gt;Good Friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; estimates that around 10,000 are dead or missing, with 1.5 million people homeless. While these figures have not been confirmed, the group's information has been found accurate in the past. 

In response, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross%20of%20South%20Korea"&gt;Red Cross of South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has offered aid which was turned down by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APyongyang"&gt;Pyongyang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , whose North Korean &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARed%20Cross%20of%20North%20Korea"&gt;counterpart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; responded with "thanks for Seoul's offer" but said "it will handle the recovery efforts from recent floods by itself." North Korea has also refused other international offers of help, including from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Programme"&gt;World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The Red Cross has reported that over 7,000 homes were completely destroyed, with almost 13,000 families left homeless. Flooding has also affected almost a quarter of a million acres of farmland, further exacerbating food shortages. North Korea earlier refused a South Korean food aid package conditioned on a return to talks over North Korea's nuclear programme. Later, following DPRK's missile tests, South Korea had announced a suspension of the aid programme. 

Private groups in South Korea have announced plans to send aid shipments, which are expected to be accepted by DPRK.

&lt;a href="w%3AHizbollah"&gt;Hizbollah&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href="w%3ASayyed%20Hassan%20Nasrallah"&gt;Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah&lt;/a&gt; said in a taped 45 minute televised speech the group would target &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt; if Israel attacked central &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;. Nasrallah confirmed for the first time that Hizbollah has longer-range missiles capable of hitting Tel Aviv 130 km (80 miles) from the border. "If you bomb our capital Beirut, we will bomb the capital of your usurping entity… We will bomb Tel Aviv."

Nasrallah also offered his first gesture toward ceasefire. “Any time you decide to stop your campaign against our cities, villages, civilians and infrastructure, we will not fire rockets on any Israeli settlement or city,” “The only choice before you is to stop your aggression and turn to negotiations to end this folly.”

Nasrallah said he held &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;war in Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and claimed the U.S. was blocking the path to a cease-fire. "Lebanon will never be pro-American or pro-Israeli. Lebanon will not be part of the `new Middle East' that Bush and Condoleezza Rice want," he said.

The statement was broadcast on Hezbollah's &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Manar"&gt;Al-Manar&lt;/a&gt; TV and on all other Lebanese and Arab satellite channels and parts of the speech was sent on Israeli television channels.

A highly-positioned &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;IDF&lt;/a&gt; officer said Israel will retaliate harshly against an attack on Tel Aviv and will destroy the entire infrastructure in Lebanon according to Channel One's Mabat news program.

David Baker, an official in the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Israel"&gt;Prime Minister's Office&lt;/a&gt; said today "The Israeli government, along with the Israeli people are fully determined to break this Hezbollah threat and to restore quiet to Israel's north. We will seek and pursue Hezbollah without relenting and we will put an end to these murderous attacks,"

Though the official position of the Israeli government do not support a cease fire between Israel and Hizbollah the leader of the &lt;a href="w%3ADegel%20HaTorah"&gt;Degel HaTorah&lt;/a&gt; political party as well as the ultra-Orthodox Lithuanian community in Israel expressed his support of a cease fire. &lt;a href="w%3AYosef%20Shalom%20Eliashiv"&gt;Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv&lt;/a&gt; said recently "the decision makers must take into account the position of the world nations. They shouldn't ignore or take lightly the ideas raised by other nations. If the United States raises solutions that could bring about the end of the war and save Jewish lives, they should be heeded. No offer or idea should be dismissed offhand. We mustn't anger the nations of the world."

US Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; and Secretary of Defense &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; have approved a plan to provide training and equipment to the Lebanese military. 

The goal would be to allow Lebanon to take control of its own territory once fighting between Israel and &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; had eased.

Rice was quoted as saying, "We need to end the hostilities in a way that points forward a direction for a sustainable peace."

The Hezbollah raid into Israel, which resulted in the capture of two Israeli soldiers and the deaths of seven others and sparked the current conflict, was to ransom the captured for the exchange of Israeli-held Lebanese prisoners.

&lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Cameron"&gt;James Cameron&lt;/a&gt;, director of the $1.8 billion grossing film, &lt;a href="w%3ATitanic%20%281997%20film%29"&gt;Titanic&lt;/a&gt;, has signed up special effects studio, &lt;a href="w%3AWeta%20Digital"&gt;Weta Digital&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; for his next sci-fi film, &lt;a href="w%3AAvatar%20%28film%29"&gt;Avatar&lt;/a&gt;.

Weta Digital, owned by &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Jackson"&gt;Peter Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Taylor%20%28movies%29"&gt;Richard Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJamie%20Selkirk"&gt;Jamie Selkirk&lt;/a&gt;, will provide the visual effects, of which the movie will be mostly of, excluding some action shots in the USA, for the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20dollar"&gt;NZ&lt;/a&gt;$322 million film. The visual effects will also include performance capture animation where the actors movements are translated onto an animated character. Weta Digital is famous for this with characters &lt;a href="w%3AGollum"&gt;Gollum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20film%20trilogy"&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/a&gt; and King Kong in &lt;a href="w%3AKing%20Kong"&gt;King Kong&lt;/a&gt; modelled after actor &lt;a href="w%3AAndy%20Serkis"&gt;Andy Serkis&lt;/a&gt;.

The reason that Cameron chose Weta Digital over other special effects studios is "Weta have proven themselves a leader in visionary effects. Along with their world-class capability comes a genuine passion to blaze new trails." Cameron said.

Cameron also added that "We may end up with stars in Avatar but it's not a requirement."

The Avatar film is a movie about a war veteran that is fighting aliens on other planets. The movie will be launched in 2008.

An alleged member of the Kashmiri militant group &lt;a href="w%3ALashkar-e-Toiba"&gt;Lashkar-e-Toiba&lt;/a&gt; has been arrested by Indian police in connection with the &lt;a href="w%3A11%20July%202006%20Mumbai%20train%20bombings"&gt;July 11 train bombings&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; which killed 200 commuters on the city's commuter rail network. 

The arrest followed a raid on a hideout in the Sanai Potha area of Surankote in the &lt;a href="w%3APoonch"&gt;Poonch&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href="w%3AJammu%20and%20Kashmir"&gt;Jammu and Kashmir&lt;/a&gt;(J&amp;K) state. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; police aided by the Counter-Intelligence Wing of the J&amp;K State Police apprehended the militant, identified as Abdul Hameed. Hamed has been taken to the Joint Interrogation Centre (JIC) in Poonch for interrogation by the Mumbai and Kashmir police forces. 

Hameed was traced through an identity card provided to him by a private security agency in Mumbai he worked for, which was recovered from one of the blast sites at Matunga. 

Officials say Hameed had been been deployed in Mumbai by the Lashkar-e-Toiba to establish a network in the city. Hameed had been close to Abu Usama, the "Divisional Commander" of the LeT in Poonch and is believed to have received direct instructions from the organisation's top leaders across the border in Pakistan to carry out the bombings.

After seeking a remand from the local court in Poonch, authorities will fly Hameed to Mumbai for further interrogation. Hameed has already revealed some vital information about the bombings and more arrests are likely to take place in the Baramulla and Poonch districts of the state, police say. 

Pakistan and the LeT have have denied any role in the attacks, but Indian officials have said that LeT remains a prime suspect and that links between the blasts and the Kashmiri insurgency were emerging.

A coroner revealed last week that Ryan Katcher, a &lt;a href="w%3AIllinois"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; student who had been missing for five years and was found dead a few days ago, had died of drowning. Peggy Johnson, Vermilion County Coroner, added that there was no evidence of criminal action surrounding his death. “There are no injuries whatsoever anywhere on Ryan’s head,” she said.

The body of the 19 year-old was discovered in his pickup truck at the bottom of a lake in Illinois. According to Vermilion County Sheriff Pat Hartshorn, the University of Illinois student’s truck was lifted out of fifty feet of water by emergency workers who were testing new rescue equipment in the lake. Bob Huff, from the Danville/Vermilion County Emergency Management Agency, added: “For the past five and a half years we’ve repeatedly continued to search ponds … It’s the technology that found it this time.” Mr Huff didn’t say how the truck got into the water, but he did say the vehicle could have veered off the road.

Ryan’s mother, who has had to deal with five agonising years of not knowing the whereabouts of her son, said after his discovery: “The sad thing is now the search is over. The good thing is Ryan’s home. We’ve strived to search for Ryan for five and a half years. There was always hope that Ryan could walk through the door at some time.”

Sheriff Pat Hartshorn says he now considers the Katcher case closed. “The five and a half years it’s taken to discover Ryan has led to so many conspiracy theories and mystery novel writers and people who have bothered the family and sometime tormented them,” he said. “But the truth of the matter is it’s a tragic accident that took Ryan’s life.”

Clear Lake in Kickapoo State Park in Oakwood had been the student’s watery grave for over five years. He vanished on 5 November 2000 after one of his friends drove him home from a party at around two o'clock in the morning.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADomesday%20Book"&gt;Domesday Book&lt;/a&gt;, penned in the eleventh century, can now be explored online after more than twenty years of work.

The book was commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086 to tally the amount of land and resources owned throughout England. The findings were used to calculate taxes, and the wealth of the king.

From today, anyone with an Internet connection is now able to explore the book for free. A web browser can be used to find out what life was like in the past in any English village, town or city. In addition, a person can download a copy of any page from the book for the fee of &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sign"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;3.50.

Commenting on the online edition, Adrian Ailes, a Domesday expert from The National Archives, said it was “a fantastic achievement”. “It is important that people of all ages should be able to read and use this national treasure,” he added.

The book was voted the “nation’s finest treasure” in 2005. But studies have found that thirteen percent of people believe the Domesday Book to be a chapter in the Bible, and nearly two percent think the iconic document is a novel penned by &lt;a href="w%3ADan%20Brown"&gt;Dan Brown&lt;/a&gt;.

The original text is currently on display at &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20National%20Archives%20%28UK%29"&gt;The National Archives&lt;/a&gt; in west &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

A "highly pathogenic strain" of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; virus has been detected in a dead Australian black swan, floating in a pond located at the Dresden Zoo in &lt;a href="Dresden"&gt;Dresden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Conflicting reports say that the swan was found on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. The Friedrich Loeffler Institute which specializes in animal diseases confirmed the test results.

"We can confirm that this is the highly pathogenic strain," said a spokesperson for the institute.

Officials have blocked off an area of Dresden approximately 1.9 miles (3km) from the site where the swan was found and have posted observation areas at approximately 6.2 miles (10km) outside the area as a precaution.

For the moment, all birds in the zoo have been confined to their cages and viewing of birds by the public is no longer permitted. The zoo still remains open for business and cleaning efforts have been intensified. Officials have also restricted cats and dogs from roaming areas nearby. There are at least 112 different species of birds, totaling 720, located at the zoo.

In April, H5N1 was first discovered in Germany in a domestic fowl and in wild birds. The last case of H5N1 to turn up in Germany was on May 12, 2006.

A 16 year old girl has crashed her car into a hollow tree stirring up the fury of a swarm of &lt;a href="w%3Abee"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s ten miles (16km) south of &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Wayne%2C%20Indiana"&gt;Fort Wayne, Indiana&lt;/a&gt;. Ten people including the girl received treatment at a hospital. 

Jacqueline Cossairt's &lt;a href="w%3ASports%20Utility%20Vehicle"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; crashed into the tree after she lost control on a gravel road.

Despite hot summer temperatures, firefighters wore full safety gear including face mask and oxygen tanks as they tried to rescue her from the wreck. The bees were doused with foam and water.

"Those bees were mad," said Volunteer Fire Chief Kent Gilbert, who was stung at least 50 times while trying to pull her from the wreckage. "I've never seen bees, especially honeybees, attack like that."

"I'm not too swelled up," Gilbert said. "As long as I'm standing upright, I feel OK, but if I bend down I get a headache. The back of my head is real tender where they stung me."

Jacqueline was taken to Lutheran Hospital with broken legs and multiple bee stings.

A neighbour, a paramedic and seven firefighters were also hospitalized due to heat and bee stings.

Stan Grove, a &lt;a href="w%3Abiology"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt; professor at &lt;a href="w%3AGoshen%20College"&gt;Goshen College&lt;/a&gt;, said that bees were most active during summer as they try to keep their hives cool by flapping their wings.

"They don't like to be jostled," said Grove.

<h1>Swedish nuclear reactors shut down over safety concerns</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Swedish%20nuclear%20reactors%20shut%20down%20over%20safety%20concerns&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Three of &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;'s ten nuclear reactors have been shut down due to safety concerns following an incident last week at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AForsmark%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant"&gt;Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , in which the reactor cooling systems failed. The reactor has since been shut down there. After the incident, the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate, SKI asked all the nuclear power plants to demonstrate that the same failure could not happen in them. On Wednesday, two more reactors at Oskarshamn were shut down after the operator said their safety could not be guaranteed.

Last week's incident at the Forsmark plant was triggered by a short circuit that cut power to the reactor cooling system. Two of the four backup generators also failed to start, but the remaining two worked and were sufficient to meet the plant's needs. Greenpeace reports that the fault in the backup power systems were traced to new equipment installed in 1993. 
The spokesman of the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate Anders Bredfell denied that there was any danger of a meltdown, adding that there was also a backup gas turbine to power the cooling system in an emergency.

However, Lars-Olov Höglund, who was responsible for the nuclear plant Forsmark for many years, said the incident was the most dangerous one since &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChernobyl%20disaster"&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThree%20Mile%20Island%20accident"&gt;Three Mile island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and that a meltdown was avoided only by pure luck. His views have however been questioned as he is involved in litigation with the Swedish nuclear industry and is known as an outspoken nuclear critic. Researchers at the Royal Institute of Technology as well as the personnel at the power plant were critical of Höglunds' view.

Speaking to BBC News, SKI spokesman Anders Bredfell said that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (IAEA) was informed of the incident as required and that the incident classes as a '2' in the 0-7 scale used by the IAEA to assess the severity of the incident. 

Another reactor in Forsmark and a fifth at Ringhals nuclear power plant have been offline due to planned maintenance work. With five of its ten reactors down, Sweden's power generation capacity is down by almost a fifth. 

The environmental group &lt;a href="Greenpeace"&gt;Greenpeace&lt;/a&gt; called on the government to shut down all reactors and probe whether the fault was a generic one. The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Party%20%28Sweden%29"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has called for an independent investigation of the incident. Sweden is scheduled to retire all its nuclear power plants in the next few decades, as decided by a referendum in 1980.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The leader of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Lords_Resistance_Army"&gt;Lord’s Resistance Army&lt;/a&gt;, the rebel group in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, has agreed to a unilateral ceasefire to end 18 years of fighting.

Lieutenant General Otti spoke on behalf of the LRA leader &lt;a href="w%3A%20Joseph_Kony"&gt;Joseph Kony&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, declaring an end to hostilities, ahead of peace talks due to begin next week. 

Speaking to the BBC, Otti said: "I, Lt Gen Vincent Otti, second in command of the LRA, by the order of Gen Joseph Kony, chairman of the LRA High Command, do hereby declare a unilateral cessation of hostilities.”

The Ugandan government has said it will wait to see if violence does actually stop before accepting the ceasefire.

It is a significant step in relations between the government and the rebels who have been fighting a twenty year campaign. However, it is unlikely Kony or Otti will attend the talks with the Ugandan government in &lt;a href="w%3A%20Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, as they are both wanted for war crimes.

During its campaign the LRA has been accused of multiple atrocities, including the deaths of thousands of people in the north of the country and the kidnap of up to 20,000 children for use as soldiers.

The group, with a cult-like status, was formed by Joseph Kony in 1987 against the forces of the current leader &lt;a href="w%3A%20Yoweri_Museveni"&gt;Yoweri Museveni&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken power the previous year.

<h1>Apollo Moon landings tapes reported missing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Apollo%20Moon%20landings%20tapes%20reported%20missing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AMagnetic%20tape"&gt;magnetic tapes&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AApollo%2011"&gt;first moon landing&lt;/a&gt; that was beamed to the world via three tracking stations and those of other 5 &lt;a href="Apollo%20program"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; missions have gone missing. There will be a search for these tapes in the hope that they may be found before they deteriorate.

The missing tapes contain original recordings of five Apollo Moon Landings. Due to the format incompatibility between the Apollo recordings and the commercial TV, the public transmissions were projected onto a screen from which they were filmed using conventional TV cameras which substantially degraded the quality of the picture. These were digitized and can be seen in the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-video.html"&gt;Apollo Lunar Surface Journal&lt;/a&gt; website, where all the graphic documentation of the Apollo Moon landings is maintained.

The tapes were originally stored at &lt;a href="w%3AGoddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center"&gt;Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/a&gt;, but, without any explanation, were taken to the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Administration"&gt;US National Archives&lt;/a&gt; in 1970. A few years after, in 1984, about 700 hundred boxes of tapes were returned to Goddard along with documents stating that the tapes were withdrawn.

"We have the documents to say they were withdrawn, but no one knows exactly where they went," said John Sarkissian, a &lt;a href="w%3ACSIRO"&gt;CSIRO&lt;/a&gt; scientist.

Mr. Sarkissian who has been working at the &lt;a href="w%3AParkes%20Observatory"&gt;Parkes Observatory&lt;/a&gt; for more than decade, initiated a study about the participation of Australia in the Apollo Mission. He requested the tapes from &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; and they told him the tapes were missing.

"We are working on the assumption they still exist," Mr Sarkissian said, "Your guess is a good as mine as to where they are."

"People may have thought 'we have tapes of the moon walk, we don't need these',"

"We want the public to see the way the moon walk was meant to be seen,"

Mr Sarkissian proposes that if the tapes are found that they be &lt;a href="w%3ADigitizing"&gt;digitised&lt;/a&gt; and stored.

The Goddard centre, home to the only known piece of equipment that decodes the &lt;a href="w%3Aanalog%20signal"&gt;analogue tapes&lt;/a&gt;, is set to be closed in October raising fears that, even if they are found, it might not be possible to decode and copy them.

Only a few people saw the original high-quality broadcast. One of these people is David Cooke, a Parkes control room engineer in 1969.

"I can still see the screen," Mr Cook, 74, said. "I was amazed, the quality was fairly good."

Wikimania 2006 is the second annual Wikimedia conference. Hosted by the &lt;a href="w%3ABerkman%20Center%20for%20Internet%20and%20Society"&gt;Berkman Center for Internet and Society&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20School"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt; campus in &lt;a href="w%3ACambridge%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;, it began August 4 and will run until August 6. 

Wikimania began with a &lt;a href="w%3Akeynote%20presentation"&gt;keynote presentation&lt;/a&gt; from Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation. Wales played a short portion of a clip from a recent episode of U.S. television program ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Colbert%20Report"&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ discussing Wikipedia. In the clip, Colbert says that "any website that has a longer entry on truthiness than Lutheranism has got its priorities straight." His keynote continued by re-emphasising Wikimedia's mission, as stated by Wales in a ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ interview: "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing".

Wales stated that Wikipedia is "not as good as Britannica &amp;mdash; yet". Additionally, he also stated that in the coming year, Wikipedia will be making "a turn towards quality". "We have always had this goal, but we all know we're not there yet - in the coming years one of the themes is going to be a turn towards quality." said Wales.

He then introduced Brad Patrick, the &lt;a href="w%3Ageneral%20counsel"&gt;general counsel&lt;/a&gt; and recently-appointed interim CEO of Wikimedia. Patrick said he found Wikimedia after reading Wales' list ♡❤Ten Things That Will Be Free♡❤ on &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Lessig"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt;'s blog. After discovering the Wikimedia Foundation, Patrick emailed Wales about meeting for lunch. He had lunch with Wales a few months later and was hired as general counsel shortly after.

Wales went on to describe Wikia, the company he co-founded with &lt;a href="w%3AAngela%20Beesley"&gt;Angela Beesley&lt;/a&gt;. He announced that Wikia has received venture capital, allowing them to hire full-time engineers to work on the MediaWiki software. He emphasized that Wikia, has "a total commitment to free knowledge and respect for communities."

Later, Wales announced that the &lt;a href="w%3AOne%20Laptop%20Per%20Child"&gt;One Laptop Per Child&lt;/a&gt; project will be including Wikipedia as the first element in the content repository. He also announced that the board has approved Wikiversity as "a center for the creation and use of free learning materials and activities". Wikiversity will "create and host a range of free-content multilingual learning materials for all age groups in all languages". It will be launched soon with a three language, six month, beta trial period.

Wales described a project called Wikiwyg: a &lt;a href="w%3AWYSIWYG"&gt;WYSIWYG&lt;/a&gt; editor for the wiki. Wikiwyg is an attempt to make the wiki easier to edit. "An intelligence test by making it hard to edit, just does not work," noted Wales. While the release date is uncertain both Wikia and Socialtext are devoting full-time engineers to the project. 

Wales emphasized the need to focus on quality. He also briefly discussed the commitment in the German Wikipedia to rolling out a stable version. He stated that if we do not have it rolled out by next year's keynote "we are making a big mistake".

Wales finished his keynote by giving an update on his ♡❤Ten Things That Will Be Free♡❤ and proposing "that the foundation seek funding to hire community coordinator and recruiters for important languages where we currently do poorly".
Other notable speakers included &lt;a href="w%3AWard%20Cunningham"&gt;Ward Cunningham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALawrence%20Lessig"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AEben%20Moglen"&gt;Eben Moglen&lt;/a&gt; and many members of the Wikimedia communities.

The day wrapped up with a poster reception and a party celebrating Wikia's 250,000 articles and Wikia's founders Angela Beesley and Jimmy Wales birthdays. 

Archived copies of many of the presentations are available on the &lt;a href="http%3A//wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Archives%23Friday_-_August_4.2C_2006"&gt;Wikimania&lt;/a&gt; wiki.

A late try by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australian Wallabies&lt;/a&gt; substitute, &lt;a href="w%3AMat%20Rogers"&gt;Mat Rogers&lt;/a&gt; caused the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;South African Springboks&lt;/a&gt; heartbreak in tonight's match at &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ATelstra%20Stadium"&gt;Telstra Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Australia won the match 20&amp;ndash;18, their second in this year's &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt;.

Australia led the Springboks 10 points to nil at half-time, which stretched Australia's hold over the Springboks to zero three halves of football, as the Wallabies had previously beaten South Africa 49 to nil in Brisbane. It was &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Gerrard"&gt;Mark Gerrard&lt;/a&gt; who scored Australia's first half try, along with a conversion and penalty goal to &lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20Mortock"&gt;Stirling Mortlock&lt;/a&gt;.

The Springboks hit back in the second half, with tries to &lt;a href="w%3AJaque%20Fourie"&gt;Jaque Fourie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APercy%20Montgomery"&gt;Percy Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;. The Springboks now led Australia, looking to wrap up their first win of this year's series. However, replacement &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Waugh"&gt;Phil Waugh&lt;/a&gt;, playing his 50th match, came on and made a break down field, off-loading to replacement back Rogers, who scored in the left corner to tie the scores up. Mortlock kicked the conversion, which hit the post, but bounced through to win the match.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;'s strong support for Israel in its current crisis with Lebanon is unpopular with many Canadians. A recent Strategic Counsel poll for &lt;a href="w%3ABell%20Globemedia"&gt;BellGlobeMedia&lt;/a&gt; found that 45% of Canadians disagree with the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; government's support for Israel, a number that climbs to 61 per cent in Quebec. Harper leads a &lt;a href="w%3Aminority%20government"&gt;minority government&lt;/a&gt; and needs to win more seats in Quebec in order to secure a majority in the next election, widely expected to be held next year. 

Nevertheless, Harper told reporters at a caucus retreat yesterday that he believes his position is in tune with Canadians and will be maintaining it.

"I think the position we have, properly understood, is exactly the position of Canadians," Harper told reporters.

&lt;a href="w%3AIDF"&gt;Israel's military&lt;/a&gt; has placed the &lt;a href="w%3ASpeaker%20%28politics%29"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20Legislative%20Council"&gt;Palestinian Legislature&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href="w%3Ahouse%20arrest"&gt;house arrest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AAziz%20Dweik"&gt;Aziz Dweik&lt;/a&gt;, a leading member of &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; has been confined to his residence since the army surrounded his &lt;a href="w%3ARamallah"&gt;Ramallah&lt;/a&gt; home. An Israeli army spokesperson told the &lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; news agency that "Since Hamas is a terrorist organisation, [Dweik] is a target for arrest." 

&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AIsmail%20Haniya"&gt;Ismail Haniya&lt;/a&gt; has responded to the action by accusing Israel of "piracy" and has urged "all Arab and international parliamentarians to condemn and denounce this crime and to secure the release of Aziz Dweik and all jailed ministers and lawmakers." 

Mr Dweik's detention brings the number of Hamas government officials and MPs being detained since the end of June to 30 or 64 persons, according to varying sources. The detentions began after Palestinian militants captured an Israeli soldier, &lt;a href="w%3AGilad%20Shalit"&gt;Gilad Shalit&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Gaza%20conflict"&gt;2006 Israel-Gaza conflict&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=American%20cyclist%20Floyd%20Landis%20tested%20positive%20for%20excessive%20levels%20of%20testosterone%20in%20second%20test&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The second urine sample provided by the winner of this year's &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt;, American cyclist Floyd Landis, has tested positive for excessive levels of &lt;a href="w%3Atestosterone"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. This confirms the results of the earlier test done after his victory in the Tour de France on 20 July. 

The International Cycling Union said: "The UCI communicates that the analysis of the sample B of Floyd Landis's urine has confirmed the result of an adverse analytical finding notified by the anti-doping laboratory of Paris on July 26, following the analysis of the sample A.". Landis now faces the prospect of being stripped of his title, along with the possibility of a two year ban.

He also stands to lose $575,700 in prize money. This would be the first time a winner has been disqualified for doping in the Tour's history. 

The American has refuted the charges saying his body naturally produces high levels of testosterone. 

In its comment about Landis sample analyses, the &lt;a href="w%3AUSA%20Cycling"&gt;USA Cycling&lt;/a&gt; announced that it will "refer this case to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Anti-Doping%20Agency"&gt;United States Anti-Doping Agency&lt;/a&gt; (USADA) as the organization solely responsible for the adjudication of anti-doping cases involving American athletes in the &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic%20movement"&gt;Olympic movement&lt;/a&gt;"

The Phonak team fired Landis on Saturday for "violating the teams internal Code of Ethics", a statement released by the team said.

&lt;a href="w%3AOscar%20Pereiro%20Sio"&gt;Oscar Pereiro Sio&lt;/a&gt; who finished second, 57 seconds adrift, now claims himself the true Tour de France champion after hearing about Landis' result. &lt;a href="http%3A//news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/cycling/5249116.stm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Since 1984 testosterone use is forbidden, but difficult to test for because the body produces it naturally. A test involves measuring the testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) ratio. An average caucasian has a 1:1 ratio but it is tolerated up to 4:1 (ratio was 6:1 or even 10:1 in the past). A new test using a &lt;a href="w%3Aspectrometer"&gt;spectrometer&lt;/a&gt; and carbon 13 ratio (CIR) exists. This new test gives a more accurate result for the presence of synthetic testosterone. This test was used on Floyd's samples in order to confirm synthetic testosterone in his blood.

American scientists have successfully used a &lt;a href="w%3Avaccine"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to slow down weight gain in an &lt;a href="w%3Aanimal%20model"&gt;animal model&lt;/a&gt;, as reported in the scientific journal ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AProceedings%20of%20the%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (PNAS). The vaccinated rodents showed less increase in body weight even though they ate as much as their non-vaccinated counterparts. If supported by further studies, vaccination could become a promising new tool in the battle against the &lt;a href="w%3Aobesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, although application in humans is probably not for the near future.

The research team led by Dr. Kim Janda of the &lt;a href="w%3AScripps%20Research%20Institute"&gt;Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ALa%20Jolla%2C%20California"&gt;La Jolla, California&lt;/a&gt;, vaccinated male rats using three different &lt;a href="w%3Ahapten"&gt;haptens&lt;/a&gt; (small &lt;a href="w%3Amolecule"&gt;molecules&lt;/a&gt; which can elicit an &lt;a href="w%3AImmune%20system"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; response when attached to a large carrier such as a &lt;a href="w%3Aprotein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;). Vaccination teaches the immune system to recognise and destroy a target.

In this experiment, the target was &lt;a href="w%3AGhrelin"&gt;ghrelin&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Ahormone"&gt;hormone&lt;/a&gt; produced by the &lt;a href="w%3Astomach"&gt;stomach&lt;/a&gt; in both humans and rodents. Ghrelin stimulates &lt;a href="w%3Aappetite"&gt;appetite&lt;/a&gt; and promotes the build-up of &lt;a href="w%3AAdipose%20tissue"&gt;fat tissue&lt;/a&gt;. It was also previously shown that mice with the ghrelin &lt;a href="w%3Agene"&gt;gene&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKnockout%20mouse"&gt;knocked out&lt;/a&gt; (makes the mice unable to produce ghrelin), expend more energy and break down their fat stores more easily. In this study, vaccinated rats retained the same appetite, but the other effects were altered resulting in a lesser weight gain. The fact that the appetite remained unchanged came as a surprise to the investigators, but the idea of being able to eat the same and put on less weight is intriguing.

The rats in this study were on a low-energy, low-fat diet quite unlike the typical diet of people with obesity, where energy-rich snacks predominate. It remains uncertain whether these findings could be extended to that setting. The group is already planning further studies to ascertain the therapeutic potential of the new vaccine. The question also remains whether it will prove effective in already obese subjects, and the group plans further investigations into this matter.

Vaccines are generally used to combat &lt;a href="w%3Ainfectious%20disease"&gt;infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt;, but recently their field of application has been expanded to unconventional areas, &lt;a href="w%3ADrug%20addiction"&gt;drug addiction&lt;/a&gt; for example. One of the possible advantages of this approach to the field of &lt;a href="w%3ABariatrics"&gt;obesity medicine&lt;/a&gt;, is that vaccination could promote long term effects. This could supersede the need for chronic intake of drugs sometimes associated with severe adverse effects (such as the banned &lt;a href="w%3AFen-phen"&gt;Fen-phen&lt;/a&gt;).

A man who fell ill after participating in a &lt;a href="w%3AClinical%20trial"&gt;drug trial&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwick%20Park%20Hospital"&gt;Northwick Park Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in north-west &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year has revealed he has the early signs of an “aggressive” form of &lt;a href="w%3Acancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. 

David Oakley was one of six men who volunteered to take part in a trial of a drug intended to cure conditions like &lt;a href="w%3Arheumatoid%20arthritis"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aleukemia"&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt; in March. But after taking the drug, the thirty-five year-old suffered &lt;a href="w%3AMultiple%20organ%20dysfunction%20syndrome"&gt;multiple organ failure&lt;/a&gt; and prominent &lt;a href="w%3AInflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. 

Mr Oakley, who lives in west London, told today’s &lt;a href="w%3ADaily%20Mail"&gt;Mail on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that doctors have informed him he has “definite early signs” of &lt;a href="w%3ALymphoma"&gt;lymph cancer&lt;/a&gt;. He also fears he could develop other debilitating illnesses like &lt;a href="w%3Arheumatoid%20arthritis"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Amultiple%20sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Achronic%20fatigue%20syndrome"&gt;chronic fatigue syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALupus%20erythematosus"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt;. He will now undergo tests to see what treatments will be required. “It’s very frightening,” he told the newspaper. “I’m trying not to be too down about the thought of having &lt;a href="w%3AChemotherapy"&gt;chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt; or that I might die.” 

Mr Oakley was paid &lt;a href="w%3APound%20sterling"&gt;£&lt;/a&gt;2,000 for his involvement in the trial, and that money subsidised his marriage to wife Katrina in June. He now fears their hope of having children has been jeopardised as a result of his ill health. “Katrina and I had planned to start trying for children six months after getting married, but we can’t do that now. Everything is on hold.” 

There is nothing to suggest that Mr Oakley's cancer was triggered by the experiment. He is now seeking compensation from &lt;a href="w%3AParexel"&gt;Parexel&lt;/a&gt;, the company which organised the drug trial. “Really, I’m just trying to do my bit and pointing out their mistake. If someone doesn’t point it out it could happen again and there’s no way I would like to see someone else go through what we’re going through right now.” Earlier this year, six men had to be admitted to an &lt;a href="w%3AIntensive%20care%20medicine"&gt;intensive care unit&lt;/a&gt; at the same hospital, in another Parexel drug trial which caused much upset.

<h1>Iran bans Shirin Ebadi-led human rights group</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Iran%20bans%20Shirin%20Ebadi-led%20human%20rights%20group&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The government of &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; has banned the human rights group &lt;a href="w%3ADefenders%20of%20Human%20Rights%20Center"&gt;Defenders of Human Rights Center&lt;/a&gt; led by Nobel Peace laureate &lt;a href="w%3AShirin%20Ebadi"&gt;Shirin Ebadi&lt;/a&gt;. 

On Saturday, the Iranian newspaper &lt;a href="w%3AShargh"&gt;Shargh&lt;/a&gt; reported an Interior Ministry statement announcing the ban, "As the group calling itself 'Defenders of Human Rights Center' has not obtained a permit from the interior ministry, its activities are illegal and the violators of this decision will be prosecuted,".

Ebadi told reporters that such a permit was not required, "Non-governmental organizations that observe the law and do not disrupt public safety do not need a permit. So the... Center does not need authorization".

She said that the group had applied for the permit but the Interior Ministry denied the request without any explanation. 

Saying that the "move is not in Iran's national interest", Ebadi said that the group will protest against the decision and explore legal options to "obtain our rights".

The group was started by six prominent lawyers and has campaigned on human and minority rights issues for the past four years. It has criticized Iran's judiciary for violations of human rights.

&lt;a href="w%3AAbdolfattah%20Soltani"&gt;Abdolfattah Soltani&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the group was sentenced last month to five years in jail on charges of disclosing confidential information and opposing the regime. He had represented the imprisoned journalist &lt;a href="w%3AAkbar%20Ganji"&gt;Akbar Ganji&lt;/a&gt; as well as the family of the Iranian-Canadian photographer &lt;a href="w%3AZahra%20Kazemi"&gt;Zahra Kazemi&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed in custody in 2003. 

The group demanded an independent probe into the death of dissident student activist &lt;a href="w%3AAkbar%20Mohammadi"&gt;Akbar Mohammadi&lt;/a&gt;, who died in prison on Sunday following a hunger strike.

The ban comes on the 100th anniversary of Iran's "constitutional revolution" of August 5, 1906, when the monarch of what was then &lt;a href="w%3APersia"&gt;Persia&lt;/a&gt; decreed the creation of a constitution and an elected parliament - the &lt;a href="w%3AMajlis"&gt;Majlis&lt;/a&gt;. 

"The ban has a bad meaning for the country" on such a day, said Mohammad Dadkhah, a founder of the rights group.

Ebadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, for "her efforts for democracy and human rights...especially on the struggle for the rights of women and children,". She was the first Iranian and first Muslim woman to receive the honour.

<h1>Edinburgh Fringe festival begins</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Edinburgh%20Fringe%20festival%20begins&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The 60th &lt;a href="w%3AEdinburgh%20Festival%20Fringe"&gt;Edinburgh Festival Fringe&lt;/a&gt;, the "world's largest arts festival" opened on Sunday, August 6. It features more than 1,800 shows put on by 17,000 performers in 260 venues. 

The Fringe now dominates the group of annual arts festivals that draw 750,000 visitors to Edinburgh every year, last year 1.3 million tickets were sold for Fringe shows. Anyone can register, pay a fee, find a venue and put on a show at the Fringe, famous for its quirky choice of venues - this year, they include a double-decker bus, a swimming pool, tree and a toilet; and "Hamlet" is being performed in a bouncy castle.

An estimated 160,000 people watched the Fringe Festival Cavalcade, a jamboree of more than 3000 marchers, which marks the launch of the Fringe.

Fringe director Gudgin urged audiences to be selective, saying that it would take five years, 11 months and 16 days to see all the shows back-to-back. The Festival is scheduled to end in August 28. 

A recent Edinburgh City Council study concluded the Fringe brought more than £75m to the local economy each year. The festival's job openings included rickshaw drivers, show announcers to shouts details of the impending show and tell the audience when it is time to take their seats, and collectors to pick up flyers that people throw away. 

<h2>Good opening</h2>
Several shows sold out in a strong opening weekend, including those by comedians &lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Brand"&gt;Russell Brand&lt;/a&gt;, the "people's poet" &lt;a href="w%3APam%20Ayres"&gt;Pam Ayres&lt;/a&gt; in his maiden Fringe venture and ♡❤One Man Star Wars♡❤ at the Underbelly. Comedians Jason Byrne, &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Amstell"&gt;Simon Amstell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Bhoy"&gt;Danny Bhoy&lt;/a&gt; along with shows such as ♡❤Best of the Fest♡❤ and ♡❤Ella Meets Marilyn♡❤ starring Sally Lindsay and Rain Pryor are expected to join the list.

The Assembly venue, with theatres on &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Street%2C%20Edinburgh"&gt;George Street&lt;/a&gt; and the 800 Assembly Hall on the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Mile"&gt;Royal Mile&lt;/a&gt;, said it had sold 97,000 tickets by last Friday - more than the entire number it sold in 1999.

<h2>Religious satire prominent</h2>
Australian comic &lt;a href="w%3AWil%20Anderson"&gt;Wil Anderson&lt;/a&gt; lays into the &lt;a href="w%3ACatholic%20Church"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;, including a &lt;a href="w%3Asend%20up"&gt;send up&lt;/a&gt; of the late &lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤Breaking the Pope♡❤ is about the infamous &lt;a href="w%3AMagdalene%20laundries"&gt;Magdalene laundries&lt;/a&gt;, religious-run workhouses for women in Ireland that existed until the mid-90s. "Mary and The Stripper" contrasts the tales of &lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Magdalene"&gt;Mary Magdalene&lt;/a&gt; and a 21st-century stripper hooked on heroin.

Danish-Egyptian comedian Omar Marzouk performs a standup routine on the &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;Prophet Mohammed cartoon&lt;/a&gt; controversy.

♡❤We Don't Know Shi'ite♡❤, uses &lt;a href="w%3AVox%20populi"&gt;vox pops&lt;/a&gt; in the streets of Britain to highlight ignorance about &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;. The play's director Joshua Blackstone said, "Britain could work so much better as a multi-ethnic society if people were more open-minded. We could put to rest the stereotypes if there is more understanding,"

Rev Donald Reid, a spokesman for the Festival of Spirituality and Peace, a religious gathering that runs alongside the Fringe, welcomed the focus on religion, calling it a reflection of an upsurge in the thirst for faith and spirituality. 

"Artists are testing the boundaries of how far they can go ... But religion should be able to be commented on and its absurdities pointed out.", he said.

In ♡❤Bible Babel Live!♡❤ the &lt;a href="w%3ABible"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt; is read, in English, Greek and Chinese, from start to finish in 80 hours over 10 days .

Speaking of the religious motif, the festival director Paul Gudgin said, "Clearly it's a very personal subject that artists and writers currently feel a particular need to explore,". 

"It's either about what is happening with radical Islam or reflects interest and concern over the influence Evangelical Christians seem to be having in the United States," he told Reuters. Pointing to a "Da Vinci Syndrome", he said, "All of a sudden, these topics are of huge interest. What has surprised me is the breadth of shows on offer.".

The religious theme received further impetus from the &lt;a href="w%3ARacial%20and%20Religious%20Hatred%20Act"&gt;Racial and Religious Hatred Act&lt;/a&gt; introduced in the UK, which sought to give all faiths equal protection, was condemned by comedians such as Rowan Atkinson who feared it would turn satire into a criminal offence.

<h3>Religion and politics mix</h3>
♡❤Jesus: The Guantanamo Years♡❤ is a one-man show by Abie Philbin Bowman, is playing to sell-out houses. In the show, Bowman plays Jesus, a bearded Middle Eastern man arrested by U.S. immigration officials and sent to the &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay%20detainment%20camp"&gt;Guantanamo detention center&lt;/a&gt; in Cuba after confessing he was ready to die as a martyr.

Bowman says comedy can be an effective weapon if used responsibly. "Being Irish and having grown up in the 1980s I have a sense of my own culture having been hijacked by terrorists and people assuming all Irish were terrorists," he said.

♡❤Petrol Jesus Nightmare♡❤, from the Traverse Theatre Company features two Israeli soldiers holed up under fire, an apocalyptic thriller about the violent consequences of faith has been seen as "prescient" of the ongoing Middle-east violence. 

♡❤The Black Jew Dialogues♡❤ and ♡❤According to Jesus♡❤ were other shows on offer. ♡❤The Situation Comedy♡❤ is a play from Israel about a suicide bombing written and performed by Robbie Gringras. According to Gringras, it was inspired by true events, including suicide bombings in Israel.

The Scotsman newspaper's theater critic Joyce McMillan called the Fringe "the most amazing barometer of world politics," The Fringe tackled terrorism last year, following the &lt;a href="w%3AJuly%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;July 2005 London bombings&lt;/a&gt;.

In ♡❤Breasts and Burgers♡❤, a surrealist spectacle adapted from a play by 20th-century avant-gardist Guillaume Apolliniare - the US flag is ripped apart onstage each night. Cecile Shea, the US consul in Scotland, has said the play could cause hurt to ordinary Americans. 

Director Richard Franklin defended it as a comment on freedom of speech. "The most serious thing to come out of the war on terror is the excuse to create legislation against this freedom (of speech)" he told the Herald newspaper, "It is a symbolic thing and is intended as such."

An American tourist John McCabe visiting Edinburgh was unconvinced, saying "It seems the Stars and Stripes is an acceptable target in this liberal environment," and "I doubt the desecration of the Koran on stage would be tolerated. Free speech is one thing, but where's the proportionality? I certainly would not go and see this play."

<h2>Controversy over Churchill's cigar</h2>
Actor Mel Smith, who plays &lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Churchill"&gt;Winston Churchill&lt;/a&gt; in ♡❤Allegiance♡❤ had to go without lighting the trademark cigar, as smoking in an enclosed public space is now a crime in Scotland. Officials threatened to close down the theater, the Assembly Rooms, if he lit up.

"I think it's absurd. In the context of an international festival like this, it's crazy. It's integral to the part of Churchill and it doesn't affect other people - it's just absurd.", William Burdett-Coutts, who runs the Assembly Rooms, said.

<h2>Funding woes</h2>
Organisers of the Show have called for more funding, both from public sources as well as from private businesses, to help the show. 

Anthony Alderson, the director of &lt;a href="w%3APleasance"&gt;The Pleasance&lt;/a&gt;, told ♡❤The Scotsman♡❤ newspaper that without further private sector funding the Fringe could start to shrink and lose its standing as the world's best festival. He feared that the current rate of expansion is unsustainable without further support from businesses. The Fringe 
director Paul Gudgin said last year that the Festival would need to make a string of cutbacks if it was to combat major losses.

The Fringe Society currently receives only £45,000 a year from the city council and £25,000 from the Scottish Arts Council. 

Gudgin also called for an urgent Scottish Executive response to the ♡❤Thundering Hooves♡❤ report into the future of Edinburgh's festivals, published this May. It pointed out that the festivals contribute £184 million a year to the Scottish economy and stressed the need for continued investment, long-term planning, and international promotion to beat off competition from other cities. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ACity%20of%20Edinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh City Council&lt;/a&gt; responded within a month with the announcement of a £1m fund for the various festivals. Some have argued that this money was already in the pipeline.

<h3>Fees go up</h3>
The Edinburgh City Council has announced increases in theatre licence fees, which venues must pay before holding a show. For venues with 200 seats or less, fees go up from £127 in 2005 to £440 this year, £620 next year and £800 in 2008. For venues seating more than a thousand, fees went up from £295 last year to £1,320 this year.

The Fringe Society, which represents the festivals managers and performers said it was "deeply concerned about the council's decision to make these sharp increases in theatre licence prices", adding that "particularly the smaller venues who will suffer,". 

The Council said new laws meant the costs of its licensing scheme had to be recovered from venues. Councillor Jack O'Donnell, convener of the licensing regulatory committee, said the scheme had been operating at a deficit of £177,000.

A rainy weekend turned out to be a great show for the spectators of the 13th round of the &lt;a href="w%3AFIA"&gt;FIA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFormula-1"&gt;Formula-1&lt;/a&gt; championship. The &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix"&gt;Hungarian Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; held on &lt;a href="w%3AHungaroring"&gt;Hungaroring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABudapest"&gt;Budapest&lt;/a&gt; provided an entertaining race with a few upsets.

An absolutely unlucky race for the &lt;a href="w%3ARenault"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFerrari"&gt;Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; teams, only &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Massa"&gt;Felipe Massa&lt;/a&gt; finished at the tail of the peleton. &lt;a href="w%3AGiancarlo%20Fisichella"&gt;Giancarlo Fisichella&lt;/a&gt; lost control of his car and ended the race very soon after the start. His teammate &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; was in the lead for most of the race, but ended it right after his pit-stop, probably because a badly tucked right front wheel. &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Schumacher"&gt;Michael Schumacher&lt;/a&gt; ended his race not long after Alonso, because of the suspension damage in the numerous battles during the race.

Thus, the victory suddenly came to the hands of &lt;a href="w%3AJenson%20Button"&gt;Jenson Button&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AHonda"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; driver. 

Tough luck for &lt;a href="w%3AKimi%20Raikkonen"&gt;Kimi Raikkonen&lt;/a&gt;, who collided with &lt;a href="w%3AVitantonio%20Liuzzi"&gt;Vitantonio Liuzzi&lt;/a&gt; and was replaced by his teammate &lt;a href="w%3APedro%20De%20La%20Rosa"&gt;Pedro De La Rosa&lt;/a&gt; in second place.

And a very good race for &lt;a href="w%3ANick%20Heifeld"&gt;Nick Heifeld&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3ABMW"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="w%3ASauber"&gt;Sauber&lt;/a&gt; team's driver finished third.

The race probably disproved the popular statement that "the problem of Formula-1 races is no overtaking", saying that it's not completely true

&lt;a href="w%3ASyria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; has rejected a proposed &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; resolution, backed by both the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, for a cease fire in the &lt;a href="2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict&lt;/a&gt;. 

Syria's foreign minister has said that the resolution is a "a recipe for the continuation of the war," and "adopted Israel's point of view only."

Syria has also warned that their armed forces are under orders to respond immediately if &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; attacks. Syria's foreign minister said that "If Israel attacks Syria by any means, on the ground, by air, our leadership ordered the armed forces to reply immediately," and that "Syria is ready for the possibility of a regional war if the Israeli aggression continues."

The &lt;a href="Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; news agency has retracted a photograph of &lt;a href="Beirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, after finding out that it was altered. Reuters released a statement saying: "Photo editing software was improperly used on this image. A corrected version will immediately follow this advisory. We are sorry for any inconvience." The photograph had shown two plumes of black smoke rising out of buildings in Beirut. 

Meanwhile a Reuters employee was suspended after using Reuters internet access to issue a threat saying, "I look forward to the day when you pigs get your throats cut." The e-mail was sent to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Johnson%20%28blogger%29"&gt;Charles Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who maintains the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALittle%20Green%20Footballs"&gt;Little Green Footballs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; blog. Johnson said: "This particular death threat is a bit different from the run of the mill hate mail we get around here, because an IP lookup on the sender reveals that he/she/it was using an account at none other than Reuters News. I think it's more than fair to say that Reuters has a big problem." 

Reuters spokesman Ed Williams said: "I can confirm that an employee has been suspended pending further investigation. The individual was not an employee of Reuters' news division."

The Ministry of Defence has confirmed that a British soldier has been killed in southern Afghanistan during a joint operation with Canadian-led &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; troops. "It is with regret that we can confirm that a member of the UK Armed Forces has been killed in action this afternoon during ongoing operations against insurgent positions in Helmand Province, Southern Afghanistan," said an MOD statement. 

According to a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force, a NATO peacekeeping organisation, troops came under fire after a successful operation.

The soldier’s details have not been released as next of kin have not yet been told. 

In the past two months, ten British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan.

The Sunday Telegraph today quoted commandos as saying British troops in Afghanistan are on "the brink of exhaustion".

Fifteen Israelis were killed and more than 115 injured in an attack that saw more than 180 missiles hit towns in northern Israel Sunday. At least seven rockets hit &lt;a href="w%3AHaifa"&gt;Haifa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;'s third largest city, killing three and injuring more than 100. Other missiles have hit the &lt;a href="w%3AMa%27alot"&gt;Ma'alot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACarmiel"&gt;Carmiel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKiryat%20Shomna"&gt;Kiryat Shmona&lt;/a&gt;. 

Twelve reserve soldiers died when a &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; missile hit &lt;a href="w%3AKfar%20Giladi"&gt;Kfar Giladi&lt;/a&gt; in Israel. "The scene is very difficult, it can be described as a battlefield," Shimon Abutbul, a rescue worker at the scene said. "There was a lot of blood." 

In Lebanon, 17 people were killed as Israeli warplanes and artillery struck southern Lebanon. Three Chinese UN peacekeepers were injured when a rocket landed near their post.

Israeli jets also struck the southern suburbs of Beirut.

Israel has announced the detention of a Hezbollah combatant suspected of being involved in the kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers that prompted the Israeli incursion into Lebanon last month. 

The mounting casualties occur as the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; continues discussions on a draft resolution to halt the fighting. France and the United States have agreed to the wording of a decree which is expected to come to a vote on Monday or Tuesday. 

The draft calls for the "full cessation of hostilities based upon, in particular, the immediate cessation by &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; of all attacks and the immediate cessation by Israel of all offensive military operations". 

The pending resolution has been welcomed by Israel but condemned by the Syrian foreign minister, Wallid Muallem, who called it a "recipe for the continuation of the war". A senior Lebanese official has said his country would reject the resolution because it does not ask that Israeli forces withdraw from Lebanese soil.

&lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, the British Prime Minister, intends to remain in power for "at least another year" despite calls for his resignation from within his own &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28Britain%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;. 

♡❤The Sunday Telegraph♡❤ reports that it has learned from senior sources that Blair feels "rejuvenated" after a trip to the United States and believes he can continue to play a major role as prime minister.

According to the report, Blair, 53, is planning to stare down his critics, including some members of his Cabinet, to push through reforms in health and education. 

&lt;a href="Gordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt; and the man long touted as Blair's successor, has been quietly urging a transfer of power to occur shortly after May 2007, the tenth anniversary of Blair's premiership. 

If Blair tries to hang on to power much after next May he may face a full scale revolt by backbench Labour MPs who circulated a letter earlier this year calling for the prime minister to announce a timetable for his departure. Under the party constitution, 70 Labour MPs need to sign a letter calling for a leadership change in order to set a formal challenge into motion. 

Blair has been the most successful leader in the Labour Party's history having won three successive elections. However, he led his party to a narrow victory in the 2005 election leading to widespread speculation that he would resign during this term in favour of Brown. His popularity has sagged due to his government's involvement in the Iraq war as well as the &lt;a href="w%3ACash%20for%20Peerages"&gt;Cash for Peerages&lt;/a&gt; corruption scandal and several ministerial resignations.

&lt;a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; is planning to execute a Canadian national next week according to his wife who is seeking help from the Canadian government to free the man. 

Huseyin Celil, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUighur"&gt;Uighur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Muslim who immigrated to Canada as a refugee, had been a dissident in China in the 1990s urging greater religious freedom. He was arrested last decade for trying to start a political party and fled China after breaking out of prison. He was sentenced to death in absentia by a Chinese court for his role in the anti-government movement. China also claims Celil was involved in a political assassination, a charge he and his family deny. Celil settled in Canada as a refugee and eventually gained citizenship. He was visiting his wife's family in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKyrgystan"&gt;Kyrgystan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in March when he was arrested at the request of the Chinese. He was extradited to China in June.

His wife, Kamila Talendibaeva of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABurlington%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Burlington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was told by Calil's sister, who lives in China, that Calil was being held in a prison in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang and may be executed as early as August 10.

"I can't get any information. I can't get any news and I'm just crying all the time thinking of him," Talendibaeva told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

A Canadian official says that Ottawa has been in contact with China and received assurances that Celil will not be executed.

"In the past 48 hours or so, Chinese government officials at a senior level assured our embassy officials in Beijing that they would not seek the death penalty against Mr. Celil," Conservative Member of Parliament Jason Kenney told CBC News.

<h1>Castro recovering following surgery: Cuban officials</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Castro%20recovering%20following%20surgery%3A%20Cuban%20officials&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro's&lt;/a&gt; condition is "satisfactory" following surgery last Monday for intestinal bleeding according to Cuban vice-premier &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACarlos%20Lage"&gt;Carlos Lage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and Cuba's health minister José Ramón Balaguer who adds that it will not be long before the Cuban leader returns to work. On Saturday, Cuban parliamentary speaker &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARicardo%20Alcaron"&gt;Ricardo Alcaron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; told CNN's Spanish service that Castro "remains in stable condition" and is "resting in order to recover as quickly as possible". 

Lage, who is in &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; for the opening of that country's constitutional convention, said that Castro sends the Bolivian people "fraternal greetings" according to Cuban press agency ♡❤Prensa Latina♡❤. Lage denied reports that Castro has stomach cancer and said that the ailing leader had "been made well by the operation and is recuperating favourably."

Venezualan president &lt;a href="Hugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; sent his good wishes during his weekly broadcast saying "Fidel Castro, a hug for you, friend and comrade and I know you are getting better." 

"We have reliable information of your quick and notable recuperation" said Chavez on Castro's condition. In a telephone conversation with Bolivian leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEva%20Morales"&gt;Eva Morales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; later in the broadcast, Chavez said of the Cuban leader "this morning I learned that he's very well, that he is already getting out of bed, he's talking more than he should — because he talks a lot, you know. He has sent us greetings,"

Castro, who turns 80 later this month, temporarily transferred power to his 75 year-old brother, &lt;a href="Raul%20Castro"&gt;Raul Castro&lt;/a&gt;, prior to his surgery, leading to widespread speculation in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; that he is dying or dead. 

No pictures of Castro have been released since his surgery was announced last Monday fuelling speculation around the world about his condition. Acting Cuban leader Raul Castro has also not been seen in public in the past week.

The island's government has increased security due to fears of a US attack during Castro's illness. US Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; told NBC News "The notion that somehow the United States is going to invade Cuba, because there are troubles in Cuba, is simply far-fetched"

Until temporarily relinquishing power to his brother last week, Fidel Castro had led the country since the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACuban%20Revolution"&gt;1959 Cuban Revolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Mexico's electoral tribunal has ordered a partial recount of ballots cast in &lt;a href="w%3AMexican%20general%20election%2C%202006"&gt;last month's election&lt;/a&gt;, rejecting demands by left-wing candidate &lt;a href="w%3AAndres%20Manuel%20Lopez%20Obrador"&gt;Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador&lt;/a&gt; for a full recount. 

Right-wing candidate &lt;a href="w%3AFelipe%20Calderon"&gt;Felipe Calderon&lt;/a&gt; had roughly 243,000 votes more than Lopez Obrador in the July 2nd vote according to the present official results, a margin of 0.58%. Lopez Obrador accuses Calderon's supporters of electoral irregularities. Under Mexican law a president-elect must be declared by September 6th. 

Ballots cast at 9% of the country's polling stations will be recounted. 

Speaking at a rally in Mexico City following the ruling, Lopez Obrador told his supporters that "peaceful civic resistance" will continue. "We maintain our demand," he said. "We disagree with the tribunal's decision. They must reverse it." 

His supporters, chanting "vote-by-vote" and "if there is no solution, there will be revolution" blocked the entrance to the tribunal. 

In a speech on July 30, Lopez Obrador stated his point of view on &lt;a href="w%3Ademocracy"&gt;democracy&lt;/a&gt;, "Let's bear in mind that democracy is not just the best system of government that humanity has found : it is also the most effective method of guaranteeing coexistence in condtions of harmony. Democracy generates checks and balances, it promotes dignity and avoids that one person or a few people, whether from the higher or lower echelons of the social scale, behave as absolute owners of public power."

Regarding his request for a full recount, he stated, "The most decisive proof that we won the presidential election lies in the attitude of rejection that the candidate of the Right has adopted when faced with the demand for a recount of all the votes. If he argues that he won he has no reason not to clear up any doubt and clean up the election. Who owes nothing, fears nothing..."

The partial recount is scheduled to begin on Wednesday August 9 and is expected to last five days.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Oil prices rose dramatically on Monday after a major Alaskan oil field shut down operations, halving the total output of oil from Alaska. Coming on top of the ongoing violence in the Middle East, the price of Light, sweet crude for September delivery rose by $1.23 to US$75.99 a barrel in early afternoon Asian trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange.

London &lt;a href="w%3Abrent%20crude"&gt;brent crude&lt;/a&gt; peaked at $77.73/barrael.

The shutdown of the &lt;a href="w%3APrudhoe%20Bay"&gt;Prudhoe Bay&lt;/a&gt; oil field "caught traders by surprise", says Victor Shum, an energy analyst in Singapore. "The Middle East violence is a threat to the oil supply, but Alaska is a real disruption".

The oil field began shutdown procedures on Sunday due to severe corrosion and a minor leakage from an oil transit line. The total shutdown process is expected to take a few more days. BP Exploration Alaska, Inc, the company running the field, has said that oil production will be reduced by 400,000 barrels per day, or nearly 8% of the total U.S. oil production.

BP officials do not know how long the field will stay offline.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADechatu%20River"&gt;river Dechatu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; flooded on Saturday night after exceptionally heavy rains. Over 200 homes were destroyed and many died instantly as their houses were swept away as they slept. Of the confirmed dead so far, nearly 40 were children. 

94 people injured in the immediate aftermath were treated in hospital before returning to the remains of their homes.

Regional police inspector Beniam Fikru said that some of the dead were already being buried, but identifying bodies was difficult. “Relatives are reporting that 300 people are missing,” he said, “but the search goes on.” 

Dire Dawa, 500km east of the capital &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;, is the country’s second largest city. While the death toll is expected to rise, over 15,000 people had been displaced from the city’s 250,000-strong population. On Friday, over 1,000 people were rescued from villages as rains swept through the south of the country. 

Flooding is a regular occurrence in the June-August rainy season and Dire Dawa has been struck before. 45 people were killed in the city in flash floods last summer, some reportedly by crocodiles in the floodwaters.

The &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFouad%20Siniora"&gt;Fouad Siniora&lt;/a&gt;, told a meeting of Arab foreign ministers in &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt; that an &lt;a href="w%3AIsraeli"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; air strike killed more than 40 people in the village of Houla in southern Lebanon. However, he later revised the figure down to one.

"An hour ago, there was a horrific massacre in the village of Houla in which more than 40 martyrs were victims of deliberate bombing", Siniora told the meeting. "If these horrific actions are not state terrorism then what is state terrorism?" he asked rhetorically.

65 survivors have been pulled out from the rubble, half of them children. It was feared that the air strike had led to a reprise of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Qana%20airstrike"&gt;bombing of Qana&lt;/a&gt; last month.

"They thought that the whole building smashed on the heads of about 40 people and it turned out, thank God because we are not happy if someone is killed, they have been saved", Siniora told reporters later on Monday.

There have been several strikes on Lebanese cities, towns and villages today as Israeli warplanes have hit targets in Beirut, Tyre, Qassmieh, Ghaziyeh, Ghassaniyeh, Nabatiyeh, Naqoura and Ras al-Biyada. Meanwhile, skirmishes on the ground between Hezbollah and Israeli troops are continuing in the border village of Bint Jbail.

The name of the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; soldier killed in southern &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; during a joint operation with &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt;-led &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; troops has been revealed by the Ministry of Defence to be Private Andrew Barrie Cutts, from the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Logistic%20Corp"&gt;Royal Logistics Corps&lt;/a&gt;. Private Cults was killed in the Musah Qualeh area of northern &lt;a href="w%3AHelmand"&gt;Helmand&lt;/a&gt;.

Pte Cutts, who was killed yesterday during a planned operation against insurgents, was part of the 13 Air Assault Support Regiment. Since May, ten British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan. 

Defence Secretary, Des Browne, said yesterday, “I was saddened to hear of the death today of a British soldier who was supporting the NATO mission in Afghanistan. This is a huge loss for his friends and family - my thoughts are with them. UK forces are making a vital contribution to bringing security to the people of Afghanistan. Today's tragic incident underlines the challenges they face in carrying out this important task.” 

Yesterday, commandos told the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ASunday%20Telegraph"&gt;Sunday Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ British troops in Afghanistan are on “the brink of exhaustion”. But &lt;a href="w%3AChief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff"&gt;Chief of the General Staff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Jackson"&gt;General Sir Mike Jackson&lt;/a&gt;, who retires at the end of this month, yesterday defended Britain’s military strategy in Afghanistan.

Residents of &lt;a href="w%3AKelso%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Kelso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; - a suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt; in the state's Central West - may have been confused by a newsletter sent by the local &lt;a href="w%3ALocal%20government%20in%20Australia"&gt;council&lt;/a&gt; giving an incorrect date for the council's &lt;a href="w%3ABy-election"&gt;by-election&lt;/a&gt;.

A by-election was called by the New South Wales State Electoral Office to fill vacancies left by the resignation of councillors Janice McGilcrist and Kath Knowles.

Bathurst Regional Council dispatched a newsletter in Kelso on Friday which gave the date of the by-election as August 8. The information in this newsletter was incorrect - the correct date for the by-election was August 5. Wikinews has been told by some Kelso residents that they thought the date for the by-election must have been changed.

Prior to the newsletter being sent out, residents received only a single flyer informing them of the by-election. Many received the newsletter and were confused, believing that the original flyer must have been incorrect as the newsletter was sent so close to the planned polling day.

As voting is compulsory for council elections, those who did not vote on Saturday may now be liable for a &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; $55.00 fine.

The same newsletter also lists the date for the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Australian%20Census"&gt;2006 Australian Census&lt;/a&gt; being held on August 8 as August 9.

Over 2,000 &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organization"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; troops stood at attention at &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt; Airfield Monday morning to mourn the death of the fifth Canadian soldier in a week to die in &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. Master Cpl. Raymond Arndt, a 32 year-old reservist from Peers, Alberta, was killed in a traffic accident August 5th when the G-Wagon he was travelling collided head-on with a civilian truck 35 kilometres southeast of Kandahar. The vehicle was part of a convoy delivering medical supplies. Three other soldiers were injured in the crash which occurred as the military was preparing to transport home the bodies of four other Canadian soldiers who were killed August 3rd during heavy combat with &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; insurgents. Sgt. Vaughn Ingram, Cpl. Bryce James Keller, Cpl. Christopher Jonathan Reid and Pte. Kevin Dallaire, all members of the &lt;a href="w%3APrincess%20Patricia%27s%20Canadian%20Light%20Infantry"&gt;Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry&lt;/a&gt;, were killed by a rocket-propelled grenade near the village of Pashmul, west of Kandahar. Their bodies were returned to Canadian Forces Base &lt;a href="w%3ACFB%20Trenton"&gt;CFB Trenton&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday where a memorial service was held. Master Cpl. Arndt's remains will arrive at the eastern Ontario military base on Tuesday.

In all, 24 Canadian soldiers and one diplomat have been killed since the beginning of &lt;a href="w%3ACanada%27s%20role%20in%20the%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan"&gt;Canada's military presence in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; in March 2002. Sixteen soldiers have died in the past six months. Canada has approximately 2,000 soldiers stationed around Kandahar in the south of Afghanistan where Taliban resistance is strongest.

<h1>Canadians are contacting PM Stephen Harper about the war in Afghanistan</h1>

Canadians contact &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; about the war in Afghanistan, newly released records of telephone calls, letters, and emails to the Prime Minister reveal.

"Callers would like him to resign and run in a byelection," says a report, citing 73 such calls.

In February, most were congratulatory messages for the new prime minister, and other matters.

In April, 1,805 pieces of correspondence and another 422 telephone calls dealt with Afghanistan-related issues.

In May, the &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20the%20Prime%20Minister%20%28Canada%29"&gt;PMO&lt;/a&gt; (Prime Minister's Office) received 1,453 letters, and emails about Canada's Afghan deployment, more of them calling on the government to pull out and get the troops home. Another 114 telephone callers said the same. A lot of them criticized the government's decision to not lower the flag at the &lt;a href="w%3APeace%20Tower"&gt;Peace Tower&lt;/a&gt; on Parliament Hill to honour fallen soldiers. Almost 200 callers said that the media should not be banned from reporting the return of the bodies of soldiers.

&lt;a href="w%3ACalgary%20Northeast"&gt;Calgary Northeast&lt;/a&gt; conservative &lt;a href="w%3A39th%20Canadian%20Parliament"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AArt%20Hanger"&gt;Art Hanger&lt;/a&gt; said, most correspondence from his constituents is supportive of the government's deployment of troops in the war-torn country. "I would have to say there's a fair amount of support for the party's position out here," said Hanger.

Three dozen bureaucrats are employed full time to wade through some 2 million items each year and categorize them by subject.

&lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; warned the &lt;a href="U.N."&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; today that the &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; drafted &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; resolution will not end the on-going conflict in Lebanon. The conflict between &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; has left thousands homeless and threatens more. The resolution calls for a long-term buffer zone between Southern Lebanon and Northern Israel. Also the draft demands full cessation of all hostilities but makes no mention of any Israeli withdrawal, which is one of the points of Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFuad%20Siniora"&gt;Fuad Siniora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 's &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASiniora%20Plan"&gt;seven point proposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for ending the crisis.

Mitri who is Lebanon's ministry of culture also demands a clear statement that Israel must withdraw.

Yesterday U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; was quoted as saying, "We're trying to deal with a problem that has been festering and brewing in Lebanon now for years and years and years, and so it's not going to be solved by one resolution in the Security Council." Rice also emphasized that the resolution is a first step for a better future in the on-going conflict.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;United States Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; announced that a magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck near the South Pacific island nation of &lt;a href="w%3AVanuatu"&gt;Vanuatu&lt;/a&gt;.

The earthquake occurred at 22:18:55 UTC on August 7, only 75 km (50 miles) east-southeast of Luganville, or 215 km (135 miles) north-northwest of the nation's capital, &lt;a href="w%3APort-Vila"&gt;Port-Vila&lt;/a&gt;. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Tsunami%20Warning%20Center"&gt;Pacific Tsunami Warning Center&lt;/a&gt; issued a bulletin, saying the earthquake was of magnitude 7.0, but did not expect a widespread tsunami.

<h1>Study says dogs can smell lung and breast cancer</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Study%20says%20dogs%20can%20smell%20lung%20and%20breast%20cancer&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3ADogs"&gt;Dogs&lt;/a&gt; can be trained to detect early and late stages of &lt;a href="w%3Alung%20cancer"&gt;lung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Abreast%20cancer"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; accurately according to a study published by &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; scientists in the little-known &lt;a href="w%3AScientific%20journal"&gt;scientific journal&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AIntegrative%20Cancer%20Therapies%20%28journal%29"&gt;Integrative Cancer Therapies&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

The study took place over the last five years at the Pine Street Foundation, a &lt;a href="w%3ANon-profit%20organization"&gt;non-profit organization&lt;/a&gt; which conducts &lt;a href="w%3AEvidence-based%20medicine"&gt;evidence-based research&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AAlternative%20medicine"&gt;integrative medicine&lt;/a&gt; (combining &lt;a href="w%3AAlternative%20medicine"&gt;complementary and alternative medicine&lt;/a&gt; and mainstream &lt;a href="w%3AMedicine"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;). Michael McCulloch and colleagues used three &lt;a href="w%3ALabrador%20Retriever"&gt;Labrador Retrievers&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href="w%3APortuguese%20Water%20Dog"&gt;Portuguese Water Dogs&lt;/a&gt;, both common pets, that received basic behavioral &lt;a href="w%3Adog%20training"&gt;dog training&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers trained the dogs to lie down next to a sample from a cancer patient and to ignore other samples.

The samples used were breath samples from 55 patients with lung cancer and 31 with breast cancer — the two types of cancer with the highest mortality rates in the United States.

After the training phase, the dogs' accuracy &lt;a href="w%3Adiagnosis"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; was tested in a &lt;a href="w%3ADouble-blind"&gt;double-blind experiment&lt;/a&gt;. Among lung cancer patients, the &lt;a href="w%3ASensitivity%20%28tests%29"&gt;sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aspecificity"&gt;specificity&lt;/a&gt; were 99% accurate and for breast cancer sensitivity was 88% and specificity 98%. Because these figures seem almost too good to be true, cancer experts are the same time baffled and skeptical. The authors of the study themselves also say replication of the study is needed.

Importantly, this was independent of the &lt;a href="w%3ACancer%20staging"&gt;cancer stage&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the dogs were able to pick up the scent of cancer in its early stages. This is important because in many cases, the success of any treatment depends on early diagnosis. However, the researchers don't believe this will lead to the use of dogs in the clinic soon, rather they want to find out which chemicals are actually sensed by the canines, because they could be used in laboratory assays. "It's not like someone would start chemotherapy based on a dog test," Dr. Gansler of the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Cancer%20Society"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; said, "They'd still get a biopsy.".

The researchers were inspired by anecdotal reports about dogs detecting cancer. In 1989, a &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; women consulted with her &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20practitioner"&gt;family physician&lt;/a&gt; because her &lt;a href="w%3ADalmatian"&gt;Dalmatian&lt;/a&gt; kept licking a &lt;a href="w%3AMole%20%28skin%20marking%29"&gt;mole&lt;/a&gt; on her leg. At &lt;a href="w%3ABiopsy"&gt;biopsy&lt;/a&gt; it showed to be &lt;a href="w%3AMalignant"&gt;malignant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMelanoma"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt;. When diagnosed too late this form of cancer has a poor survival rate, but in this case early &lt;a href="w%3ASurgery"&gt;surgery&lt;/a&gt; was made possible, and the women survived. Prior studies showed that breath samples from patients with lung cancer or breast cancer contain distinct biochemical markers. This provides a basis for the hypothesis that some cancer types produce volatile chemicals that dogs could smell. A study published in the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Medical%20Journal"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt; already proved that dogs could use their exquisite sense of smell to detect &lt;a href="w%3Abladder%20cancer"&gt;bladder cancer&lt;/a&gt; in urine samples, but they were only correct in 41% of cases, and another study provided preliminary evidence that dogs could detect melanomas.

This doesn't mean you can show your breasts to your dog and it will tell you if you have cancer, other physicians caution, and scientists do not advise people to train their dogs to sniff for cancer. Unresolved issues from the study include the fact that subjects were required to breathe deeper than normal, so it's not sure whether dogs can smell cancer in normal breath. Also, whether this is a permanent skill that would be retained by dogs was not tested. 

Finally, there are concerns that could arise over &lt;a href="w%3ALiability%23In_law"&gt;liability&lt;/a&gt; issues: who would be responsible when the dog makes a mistake?

Current detection methods for both lung and breast cancer are not flawless. For lung cancer, &lt;a href="w%3AChest%20X-ray"&gt;chest X-ray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Asputum"&gt;sputum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Acytology"&gt;cytology&lt;/a&gt; (detecting cancer &lt;a href="w%3ACell%20%28biology%29"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; in coughed up fluid) fail to detect many early cases, and &lt;a href="w%3AComputed_tomography"&gt;CT scan&lt;/a&gt; produces many &lt;a href="w%3AType_I_and_type_II_errors%23False_positive_rate"&gt;false-positive results&lt;/a&gt; unless combined with expensive &lt;a href="w%3APositron%20emission%20tomography"&gt;PET scans&lt;/a&gt;. Although it might be comparing apples and oranges, a $2.5 million CT scanner has an accuracy of 85 to 90%. &lt;a href="w%3AMammography"&gt;Mammography&lt;/a&gt; also produces false-positive results, and it may be difficult in women with dense &lt;a href="w%3ABreast"&gt;breast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABiological%20tissue"&gt;tissue&lt;/a&gt;. As such, another type of "pet"-scan, using dogs as a &lt;a href="w%3ABioassay"&gt;biological assay&lt;/a&gt;, might prove feasible for screening if supported by further research. Current tests are also expensive so the use of dogs for preliminary cancer testing could prove to be an affordable alternative for countries in the developing world.

Police in South-Western &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; raided two homes in &lt;a href="w%3AGreenfield%20Park"&gt;Greenfield Park&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, seizing 1 million &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20dollar"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; worth of &lt;a href="w%3ACannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt;. Both houses were located on Smithfield Road.

The two houses were raided at 11:30 AM &lt;a href="w%3ATimezones%20in%20Australia"&gt;AEST&lt;/a&gt; on Monday where police found what they called "ellaborate [sic] hydroponic set-ups". Police seized 360 cannabis plants in addition to a large quantity of processed cannabis.

At the time of the raids, there was nobody at home. No charges have been laid over the discovery, but police say they are continuing investigations.

According to police, the Wetherill Park Target Action Group are cracking down on the cultivation of hydroponic cannabis.

In June, a monkey reportedly crawled through some pipes and into a subway car jumping around and making faces at passengers who were evacuated to another car while staff chased the creature. 

Delhi is known to suffer from trouble brought on by monkeys. The animals are reported to invade homes, schools and government offices in the city. Scores of animals have moved in as the city expands into surrounding forests. In an effort to control the problem, the Delhi administration captured about 500 monkeys and took them to the outskirts of the city last year.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics"&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics&lt;/a&gt; will hold its 15th &lt;a href="w%3ACensus"&gt;census&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; tonight. For the first time, the bureau will have a website set up to allow people to complete their census online.

The last census was held in 2001. Under federal law censuses are held every five years.

All people who are in Australia or her territories on census night are required to be included in the census. The census includes visitors to the country in addition to permanent residents. The only exceptions are foreign diplomats and their families.

Australia's head statistician, Dennis Trewin said that young people need to ensure they are being included in the count. "Young people may not realise that the mere fact of being counted in the Census can make a difference to their lives," Mr Trewin said.

"By making sure that you are counted on Census night, planners will know how many young people there are and where they are - and be able to plan services accordingly. This includes services such as public transport, education, sporting facilities and bike paths."

The ABS has is also assuring participants that their information is protected. In a statement on their website the ABS stated "The security of your personal information is protected by law. Census information is used to produce statistics, not in ways that can identify any individual. No other organisation, public or private, will have access to any personal information provided in the Census."

Jones, who was a commentator for Ten Sports said "The terrorist has got another wicket.", in reference to Amla (a practising Muslim who sports a long beard) when the latter dismissed Sri Lankan batsman &lt;a href="w%3AKumar%20Sangakarra"&gt;Kumar Sangakkara&lt;/a&gt; during yesterday's match at &lt;a href="w%3AColombo"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Majola"&gt;Gerald Majola&lt;/a&gt;, the chief executive of Cricket South Africa, said that Supersport as well as Cricket South Africa had received several angry calls in response to Jones' comment. Shortly after Majola's statement, the Australian was spotted at Colombo airport where he clarified that he was "gone". Dean Jones also admitted that his comment was "silly" and "insensitive" and that "it was never meant to be heard on air". He apologised to those offended by his comment and said that he had not intended to be disrespectful.

President &lt;a href="w%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; was sworn into his second term of office in the Colombian capital of Bogota, Monday, pledging to improve the economy and make peace with rebels.

Security was tight in order to prevent a repetition of the attack on his first inauguration in 2002 when FARC rebels fired mortars at the presidential palace killing 20. 

Police reported deactivating a car bomb outside of the capital on Monday. 

In his inaugural speech, Uribe pledged "Fear will not stop us negotiating. I confess my concern is something else - the risk of failing to get peace and slipping back in security." 

The event was attended by 11 heads of state, mostly from South America. 

Uribe, 54, a free-market conservative from the land-owning class, is seen as one of the few remaing allies of US President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; on a continent that has seen a swing to the left with the election in recent years of leftists in Brazil and Argentina, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Chile. He was re-elected with 62% of the vote in May. He changed the constitution to allow himself to serve two consecutive terms. 
His first term saw a drop in the number of murders and kidnappings, offensives against the Marxist FARC rebels and an amnesty for right wing paramilitary fighters but there is a widespread feeling that Uribe has failed to militarily defeat the rebels and there is a public mood favouring negotiation. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in the four decades-long conflict between rebels, the army, and right wing paramilitaries. 

Uribe will also face increasing demands for improved security and more social investment. Half of the country's population lives below the poverty line making less than three dollars a day despite an economic boom and 13 million Colombians have no pension.

"We are against a fiscally tight macro-economic policy that leaves economic growth to the luck of supply and demand. The state must be devoted in equal parts to growth and equality," he said in his speech.

Hillside suburbs in &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have been suffering from torrential rain since Monday night. The &lt;a href="w%3AHeathcote%20river"&gt;Heathcote river&lt;/a&gt; burst its banks and caused surface flooding in areas.

Around 60-&lt;a href="w%3Amillimetres"&gt;millimetres&lt;/a&gt; of rain has fallen. The Heathcote river in Beckenham has inundated areas in Eastern Terrace, making some roads impassable. Terry Sefton, &lt;a href="w%3ATerritorial%20authorities%20of%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Christchurch City Council&lt;/a&gt; spokesman, said "Eastern Terrace between Birdwood and Sandwich Roads is impassable and some parts of Palentine and Riverlaw terraces are covered in water."

One household near the river has already been evacuated with another twelve also expected to evacuate out of 30 surrounding houses.

Rain has eased slightly and the Christchurch City Council expects people will be able to return to their homes tonight, along with 400 sandbags laid to protect homes.

The Christchurch City Council have set up a welfare centre at &lt;a href="w%3ACashmere%20High%20School"&gt;Cashmere High School&lt;/a&gt;, with meals supplied by the &lt;a href="w%3ASalvation%20Army"&gt;Salvation Army&lt;/a&gt;. Civil Defence is also at the school.

Slips in the &lt;a href="w%3APort%20Hills"&gt;Port Hills&lt;/a&gt; area have also happened, leaving some roads closed and others limited access.

There has been more fighting between &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; as attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;crisis in Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; continue. 

The &lt;a href="w%3AArab%20League"&gt;Arab League&lt;/a&gt; is proposing an amendment calling for Israel's immediate and complete withdrawal from Lebanon, a condition that is not in the current draft. 

There are also objections to the resolution's call for Hezbollah to end all attacks whilst only requiring Israel to end "offensive" actions. Critics assert this wording gives Israel room to continue defensive operations. Lebanese parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri, who is also a member of Hezbollah, said the draft is one sided. "If Israel has not won the war but still gets all this, what would have happened had they won?" Syrian Foreign Minister Wali Muallem called the American-French proposal "a recipe for the continuation of the war". 

Israeli analysts say their government is pleased with the draft. "We got what we wanted" said the ♡❤Yedioth Ahronoth♡❤ newspaper.

The draft resolution is not expected to come to the &lt;a href="w%3AUN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt; for a vote until Wednesday or Thursday. 

The Lebanese government has pledged to dismantle Hezbollah's "state within a state" and to send 15,000 troops to be part of a peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon if Israel withdraws. The UN resolution proposed by Washington and Paris would allow Israel to remain in Lebanon for the time being. The Beirut government's pledge was unanimously approved by Lebanon's coalition cabinet which, significantly, includes two Hezbollah representatives

Israeli Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AEhud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; called the Lebanese proposal an "interesting step", but said Israel would only pull out of Lebanon once it decides Hezbollah is no longer a threat.

Meanwhile, Israeli air and artillery strikes continue in their effort to secure key strategic points from which Hezbollah has launched rockets into Israel, and to choke off supply lines over which Hezbollah arms have been travelling. Over 90 missiles hit northern Israel by midday. 

The intensity of the fighting has forced the UN to delay for a day an aid convoy into south Lebanon. 

Nearly 1,000 Lebanese and 100 Israelis have been killed during the month long conflict. Casualties on the Lebanese side have been mostly civilian, while 35 Israeli civilians were killed.

<h1>Lieberman loses to Lamont in Connecticut primary</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Lieberman%20loses%20to%20Lamont%20in%20Connecticut%20primary&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Three-term US Senator &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Lieberman"&gt;Joe Lieberman&lt;/a&gt; has conceded defeat to challenger &lt;a href="w%3ANed%20Lamont"&gt;Ned Lamont&lt;/a&gt; in Tuesday's &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aprimary%20election"&gt;primary election&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20state"&gt;U.S. state&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AConnecticut"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;. With 98% of precincts reporting, the Associated Press reports that Lieberman has 48% of the vote compared to 52% for Lamont. The winner of the primary faces the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20Republican%20Party"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; candidate in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20congressional%20elections%2C%202006"&gt;November 7 general election&lt;/a&gt; but Lieberman confirmed tonight his intention to petition to run as an &lt;a href="w%3Aindependent%20%28politician%29"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt; against both the Democratic and Republican nominees. The polls closed at 8 p.m. local time (&lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;-5). 

The final result is highly anticipated due to the feud between Lieberman and Lamont. The major issue in the primary has been Lieberman's support for the &lt;a href="w%3AWar%20in%20Iraq"&gt;US war in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. Lieberman, who was Democrat Al Gore's running mate in the 2000 US presidential election, opposed criticizing &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;US President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; during wartime and was famously kissed on the cheek by Bush following his 2005 &lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20the%20Union"&gt;State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; address. Lamont has challenged President Bush's handling of the &lt;a href="w%3APost-invasion%20Iraq%2C%202003%E2%80%932006"&gt;Iraq conflict&lt;/a&gt;.

The campaign leading up to the election became increasingly acrimonious, with numerous "&lt;a href="w%3Aattack%20ad"&gt;attack ad&lt;/a&gt;s" used by both sides.

Because of the nature of the candidates and the marginality of the seat, the race has been seen by some as a "referendum" on the Democratic party or a "proxy vote" on the entire &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq"&gt;2003 invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent war.

&lt;a href="w%3AColorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMissouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeorgia"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; also held primaries Tuesday.

In testimony given before a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; military hearing, criminal investigator Benjamin Bierce narrated his account of how an incident involving five soldiers involved the serial rape of a 14-year-old Iraqi girl prior to shooting her. The hearing will determine whether four current U.S. soldiers have to face a court martial hearing; an additional former soldier allegedly involved in the incident, Steven D. Green, was recently discharged from the military and has pleaded not guilty to rape and murder charges in federal court in Kentucky. 

According to Bierce, a U.S. Special Agent investigating the incident, the brutal attack which saw Abeer Qassim al-Janabi slain and her parents and younger sister murdered was premeditated. Citing a sworn statement from Army Specialist James Barker, the five accused were said to have plotted the rape whilst drinking whisky and playing cards.

According to Agent Bierce, Spc. Barker said that Pte. Spielman grabbed the girl while Pte. Green seized her father and they then took them into the house and Sgt. Cortez and Spc. Barker followed them inside.

Pte. Green supposedly led the father, mother and younger sister into the bedroom and closed the door, while the teenage girl remained in the living room with the other Americans, Spc. Barker's statement said.

Sgt. Cortez then allegedly pushed the girl to the floor, pulled up her dress and tore off her underwear while she was struggling, Bierce said, again citing Spc. Barker's statement. Sgt. Cortez appeared to then rape Abeer and afterward, Spc. Barker tried to rape the girl, the statement said.

Then Pte. Green came out of the bedroom with an AK-47 rifle and announced: "They're all dead. I just killed them," according to Spc. Barker's statement.

Then Sgt. Cortez held Abeer down while Pte. Green raped the girl; according to Spc. Barker's statement. Pte. Green then picked up the AK-47 and shot Abeer once, waited, and then shot her a few more times, the U.S. official, Agent Bierce, said, quoting from Spc. Barker's statement.

Spc. Barker said that he then poured kerosene lamp fuel on the girl's body but Barker did not say who set it on fire.

Gary Griesmyer, another Special Agent, quoted Sgt. Cortez as telling him that the teenage girl was crying and talking in Arabic and that Spc. Barker told her to "shut up."

Private Justin Watt testified that Pte. Howard told him before the incident that Pte. Green, Sgt. Cortez and Spc. Barker were planning to rape a girl, and Pte. Howard was going to be the lookout. 

Watt testified that he heard Mr. Green say, "I want to kill and hurt a lot of Iraqis." Green has been discharged from the military and has pleaded not guilty in a federal court in Kentucky where he will stand trial; he will not be facing a court martial regardless of what occurrs in the Baghdad hearing.

"If you have the power to make something right, you should do it. Investigation is not my job. But if something went down -- something terrible like that -- then it's my obligation to come forward," Watt said.

Watt also said life for some of the soldiers in the B Company, 1st Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, was horrible while they were manning a military post in nearby Yusufiyah. Some lived in a "dilapidated, abandoned water treatment facility" he said.

Pfc. Watt, who is identified as the whistle-blowing soldier who disclosed the attack during a counseling session, also said; "I feared for my safety at the TCP (traffic control point). It's like this, I find out that guys in my squad, guys I trusted with my life, are allegedly responsible for one of the most brutal rapes/murders I've ever seen. And everyone has a weapon and grenades."

Pfc. Justin Cross testified that deadly attacks by insurgents sapped morale and raised combat stress in the U.S. Army unit that included the soldiers accused of raping and murdering Abeer. He said that the "mentally draining" living conditions of the combat unit was a factor.

"It drives you nuts. You feel like every step you might get blown up. You just hit a point where you're like, 'If I die today, I die.' You're just walking a death walk." Pfc. Cross told the hearing.

An &lt;a href="w%3Aarticle%2032%20hearing"&gt;article 32 hearing&lt;/a&gt;, like this, seeks to determine if a soldiers should face court martial. Its similar to that of a &lt;a href="w%3Apreliminary%20hearing"&gt;preliminary hearing&lt;/a&gt; or a grand jury proceeding in civilian law.

A fire on Tuesday night at &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20hospitals%20in%20New%20Zealand%23Southland%20Region"&gt;Southland Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AInvercargill"&gt;Invercargill&lt;/a&gt; has destroyed a two-storey building which was used for laundry and cleaning by the cleaning company Alsco. 

Junior doctors and interns were evacuated from the nearby hospital campus. A dangerous goods store nearby nearby was saved from the fire. The building was not close enough to the new main hospital building to cause any damage to it. 

Morris Robertson, Fire Chief, said: "We managed to save a dangerous goods store near the fire but the laundry is a total loss."

Fire crews arrived at the scene at 9.30 p.m. (&lt;a href="w%3ANZST"&gt;NZST&lt;/a&gt;) and Morris Robertson said that the building was well ablaze when they arrived. The first was so severe that they had to call in other firefighters to help, including volunteers. In total there was eight fire engines and 35 firefighters.

The fire was under control by 11.30 p.m. but the fire crews stayed overnight, just in case.

The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.

Three people have been arrested over allegations that they intercepted calls made by staff in &lt;a href="w%3AClarence%20House"&gt;Clarence House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APrince%20Charles"&gt;Prince Charles&lt;/a&gt;’ household. Clive Goodman, royal editor for the tabloid newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ANews%20of%20the%20World"&gt;News of the World&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, is one of three men who were last night detained by police following a probe by &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; lasting several weeks. It is alleged they listened to numerous voice mail messages made by members of &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20royal%20family"&gt;Britain’s royal household&lt;/a&gt;.

All of the three men were questioned by police at Charing Cross police station in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, and police have confirmed this morning that a fifty year-old man has been released on bail. But a spokeswoman for the News International newspaper has said that Mr Goodman remains in custody with another unidentified man.

Scotland Yard had reportedly been told by staff at Clarence House that something suspicious was occurring. The Royal Protection Squad was therefore told to investigate the claims, and due to potential security implications, the anti-terrorist branch is also involved in the enquiry. 

"Police launched an investigation after concerns were reported to the Met’s Royalty Protection Department by members of the Royal Household at Clarence House," said a statement issued by Scotland Yard last night. "It is focused on alleged repeated security breaches within telephone networks over a significant period of time and the potential impact this may have around a number of individuals."

It has also emerged today that the investigation will look at whether a number of celebrities and Members of Parliament have had their phones tapped. "Police continue to work with the telephone companies concerned and continue to have their full support in attempting to identify any other person whose telephone may have been intercepted," Scotland Yard’s statement added. 

This is not the first time that such phone hacking allegations surrounding the Royal Family have made the headlines. In 1993, a romantic call made late at night between Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwell was made public, and in 1992, a tape featuring a conversation between Princess Diana and a close friend called James Gilbey was published.

The government of &lt;a href="w%3AKerala"&gt;Kerala&lt;/a&gt;, a state in southern &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, has banned the production and sale of both &lt;a href="w%3ACoca-Cola"&gt;Coca-Cola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APepsi"&gt;Pepsi&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href="w%3ACentre%20for%20Science%20and%20Environment"&gt;Centre for Science and Environment&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ANon-governmental%20organization"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;, found high levels of &lt;a href="w%3Apesticide%20residue"&gt;pesticide residue&lt;/a&gt; in the popular &lt;a href="w%3Asoft%20drink"&gt;soft drink&lt;/a&gt;s. 

Kerala is the first state to impose a complete ban on the production and sale of the drinks, but five other states have said they will introduce partial bans in hospitals, schools and colleges. 

Chief minister &lt;a href="w%3AV.%20S.%20Achuthanandan"&gt;V. S. Achuthanandan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%29"&gt;CPI(M)&lt;/a&gt;, said the two companies had been asked to wind up their operations, meaning the closure of a Pepsi and a Coca-Cola plant in the state.

The Indian Soft Drinks Manufacturers Association issued a statement saying: "Our products manufactured in India are absolutely safe and meet every safety standard set by food health and regulatory bodies in India and all over the world."

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

Two brothers have been found guilty of killing a ten year-old schoolboy. &lt;a href="w%3ADamilola%20Taylor"&gt;Damilola Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, who was born in Nigeria and had only been in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of months, was stabbed in the leg and died in the stairwell of a &lt;a href="w%3Ahousing%20estate"&gt;housing estate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3APeckham"&gt;Peckham&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3Asouth%20London"&gt;south London&lt;/a&gt; in 2000.

Eighteen year-old Danny Preddie and nineteen year-old Rickie Preddie, who live in Peckham, were convicted of manslaughter in a retrial at the &lt;a href="w%3AOld%20Bailey"&gt;Old Bailey&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon.

On hearing the verdict, Rickie Preddie started shouting and swearing. "You are corrupt. You are nothing," he told the judge, who then ordered prison officers surrounding the teenager to take him out of the court.

Outside the court, Damilola's father Richard Taylor said: "We, the family, feel nobody can ever return our son to us. But it is a great comfort that justice has finally been done for Damilola. We pray that his gentle soul can now rest in peace."

The head of homicide and serious crime at the Metropolitan Police's Specialist Crime Directorate, Commander Dave Johnston, said: "Today justice has finally been reached for Damilola. His violent death in 2000 sent shockwaves throughout London and beyond. For his family it was a very personal tragedy played out in a very public arena and I would like to acknowledge the courage and dignity with which Gloria and Richard Taylor have supported us throughout the police investigations."

The two brothers had been cleared earlier this year of murder and assault at an earlier trial.

They will be sentenced in two weeks time.

According to reports citing &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;U.S. forces&lt;/a&gt; in eastern &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, an insurgent attack on the base at Kamdesh in &lt;a href="w%3ANurestan%20Province"&gt;Nuristan Province&lt;/a&gt; was successfully repelled, leaving dead approximately half of the 30 insurgents who attacked the base. 

Early Wednesday morning, the Kamdesh Provincial Reconstruction Team base was attacked from three directions by an estimated 30 insurgents with &lt;a href="w%3ARocket%20propelled%20grenade"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href="w%3Asmall%20arms"&gt;small arms&lt;/a&gt;. The base, which houses hundreds of soldiers, returned fire with &lt;a href="w%3Amortar%20%28weapon%29"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt;s and small arms. The base called for air support and jets dropped four &lt;a href="w%3AMark%2082%20bomb"&gt;500-pound bombs&lt;/a&gt;, effectively ending the battle.

Lt. Joel Rees said "This is the first large, coordinated attack on our base since we arrived three weeks ago". He continued "When light broke, we found large crater holes from the RPG attack throughout the base and several tents had bullet holes." Maj. Tom Sutton described the two-hour battle as the most ferocious he had seen in the area.

According to the U.S. military, two of their soldiers and one Afghan policeman sustained minor injuries. They were treated at the scene and returned to duty.

The attackers are suspected to be &lt;a href="w%3AHezbi%20Islami"&gt;Hezbi Islami&lt;/a&gt;, a militant group/political party that is said to have allied with &lt;a href="w%3AMullah%20Omar"&gt;Mullah Omar&lt;/a&gt; and the remnant &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;.

Nuristan is one of the most remote regions of Afghanistan, located on the southern slopes of the &lt;a href="w%3AHindu%20Kush"&gt;Hindu Kush&lt;/a&gt; mountains in the northeastern part of the country. Nuristan's security situation is so poor that no &lt;a href="w%3ANon-governmental%20organization"&gt;NGO&lt;/a&gt;s operate there. The base is part of the reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The ♡❤♡London Underground♡❤♡ service was disrupted today due to a man being caught under a train near Marble Arch Station in the city of Westminster, Central London. 
According to British Transport Police officials,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"on Wednesday 9 August 2006 at 16:30 the Central line was suspended between Liverpool Street and White City due to a person under a westbound train at Marble Arch. The person was confirmed deceased at 17:20. At 19:45 service resumed from Liverpool Street and White City. There was severe delays on the Central line until the close of traffic.&lt;i&gt;[sic]&lt;/i&gt;"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The incident affected the Underground's Central Line between Liverpool Street Station and White City Station. According to Underground staff, the Central Line service on this route was suspended at 17:20 local time. On stations that connect to the Central Line, passengers were informed that "service for the Central Line is suspended until further notice" and that their "...tickets will be valid for all local traffic." In addition to announcements over loudspeaker, passengers were advised of the interruption with notices on white boards inside of most stations in Central London. While Marble Arch Station was closed off, additional buses were made available by the city to carry Underground passengers from Central Line connection points like Bond Street Station to their intended destinations. 

The scene outside of Marble Arch station brought back memories of last year's train bombings: Underground staff, as well as police officers blocked the entrance to the station, and advised passengers to use alternate means of transportation; meanwhile, vehicles from the London Underground Emergency Response Unit, as well as police cars were standing by outside the station. 
British Trasport Police did not release further details about the accident.

By 20:00 local time, London Underground staff confirmed that service on the Central Line had been fully restored. "Yes, they're all open" said an Underground associate when asked whether Marble Arch Station had resumed service. By 23:00 local time, however, the Central Line service still reported "severe delays" on some stations. On Thursday, August 10th, the Central Line was operating normally again, but the service interruption was overshadowed by the breaking news regarding a plot to detonate explosives on airplanes flying from the UK to the United States.

Train accidents on the Tube are not uncommon: the London Underground reports 53 injuries last year and continues to advise passengers to "mind the gap between the train and the platform" when trains arrive, and to "stand clear of the closing doors," in order to help ensure a safe journey. In addition, passengers are also advised to carry a bottle of water with them on hot days to avoid heat-related injuries and to remember to "take all their belongings with them when [they] leave the train, in order to avoid station closures and security alerts."

The closure of Marble Arch Station was not the only service interruption on Wednesday; according to its &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tfl.gov.uk"&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt;, London Underground reports that Baker Street Station was also closed down due to a gas leak. The station reopened Thursday afternoon, but some delays were reported.

The Ministry of Defence has confirmed tonight that a British soldier has been killed in Afghanistan. Twenty-five year-old Private Leigh Reeves, from the Royal Logistic Corps in Kabul, died in a traffic accident in Camp Souter.

His commanding officer praised Private Reeves, saying he was a "high calibre soldier" and "one of those larger than life characters" that every unit needed. 

He is the fifth UK soldier to die this month in Afghanistan, and in total, eighteen British troops have died there since operations began. 

Last Sunday, Private Andrew Barrie Cutts, from the Royal Logistics Corps, was killed by insurgents in the northern area of Helmand Province.

A &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; government official convicted of working for the &lt;a href="w%3ARepublic%20of%20China"&gt;Taiwanese&lt;/a&gt; government has been executed, and thousands of civil workers viewed the taped trial for "educational purposes" on Monday. The prisoner's name was Tong Daning and was in his mid-50's and held a rank just under "Assistant-Minister" before he was found guilty of espionage. According to the anonymous sources, Daning had been selling state sources for over 15 years, making a profit of about US$250,000. 

Daning is the highest ranking person executed in China since 1999, when a Major General and Senior Colonel were executed for selling state secrets. China and Taiwan have been spying on each other ever since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was officially created, but that has not stopped over 1 million Taiwanese citizens from working and investing over 100 billion USD in China. There have been many cases of espionage within the last few years, with all but two resulting in a death sentence.

&lt;a href="w%3AVenezuela"&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/a&gt; President, &lt;a href="w%3AHugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt;, compared &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel's&lt;/a&gt; activities in Lebanon and the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank%20and%20Gaza"&gt;West Bank and Gaza&lt;/a&gt; to what Hitler did to the Jews. "They are doing what &lt;a href="w%3AAdolf%20Hitler"&gt;Hitler&lt;/a&gt; did against the Jews," Chavez said to the Arabic news network &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Jazeera"&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; and on his radio program.

Chavez condemned the Israeli attacks and accused the Jewish state of committing a "new Holocaust" with the help of the United States, which Chavez called a "terrorist" country.

"Israel has gone mad and is inflicting on the people of &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; the same thing they have criticized, and with reason: the Holocaust. But this is a new Holocaust." Chávez said. Over 1,000 Lebanese civilians are reported to have been killed in the Israeli offensive.

The Jewish &lt;a href="w%3AAnti-Defamation%20League"&gt;Anti-Defamation League&lt;/a&gt; responded: "Clearly, President Chavez needs a reality check when it comes to the Middle East conflict."

Other accusations of Israel claim that Israel is involved in systemic racism via an "Israeli apartheid".

Armoured columns of the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israeli Defense Forces&lt;/a&gt; are meeting resistance as they move deeper into &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to capture the &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; stronghold of Khiam as 40,000 Israeli troops mass on the Lebanese border following an Israeli cabinet decision to widen the war. Israel took control of the strategic southern Lebanese hub of Marjayoun on Thursday as part of its northern push.

Israel ratcheted up its fight against Hezbollah, beginning operations aimed at the heart of Beirut, taking control of a largely &lt;a href="w%3AChrist"&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; southern Lebanese town, named &lt;a href="w%3AMarjeyoun"&gt;Marjeyoun&lt;/a&gt;. The Israeli military also dropped leaflets in Beirut, warning of expanded operations inside the capital and urging people in southern &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a%20Islam"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods to evacuate. Those neighborhoods have been bastions of support for Hezbollah. "To the people who live in Hay El Soulom, Borj El Barajneh, &lt;a href="w%3AChyah"&gt;Shiyah&lt;/a&gt; ... For your safety," one flier warned. "You must evacuate these areas immediately and evacuate any area from where Hezbollah and its members or their assistants are launching their terrorist operations. "Be aware!"

Other Israeli troops also advanced on the town of &lt;a href="w%3AKhiam"&gt;Khiam&lt;/a&gt;. Israeli jets also struck a lighthouse used as a cell phone communications tower in central Beirut. Witnesses said they saw a man being loaded into an ambulance at the scene. There was no immediate information on his condition. The area, located in an upscale neighborhood where slain former Lebanese Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARafik%20Hariri"&gt;Rafik Hariri&lt;/a&gt; lived, is outside the Hezbollah-dominated southern suburbs that Israeli forces have targeted up to now.

Israeli troops had warned residents to remain in their homes as forces moved toward the nearby town of Blatt, Lebanese military intelligence and police said. The secured area overlooks the Litani River, where Hezbollah fighters have reportedly launched rockets into Israel, sources said.

On Wednesday, the Israeli government approved a plan to widen the war in Lebanon in an attempt to destroy Hezbollah installations and neutralize its ability to launch rockets. The cabinet has authorized the Israeli army to advance as far north as the Litani River, 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of the Lebanese-Israeli border. However, Israel says yesterday's push is not part of that campaign.

"It's a small operation that looks large from where we're looking right now, but this is not opening up any new front," IDF spokeswoman Miri Eisen said. "It's taking care of one that has been consistently hitting Kiryat Shmona."

Hezbollah officials reacted angrily to the Israeli cabinet's decision. Hezbollah leader &lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Nasrallah"&gt;Hassan Nasrallah&lt;/a&gt; appeared on Al-Manar television, and threatened to make southern Lebanon "a graveyard" for the Israelis.

"I say to the Zionists, you could come anywhere, invade, land airborne forces, enter this village or that, but I repeat, all this will cost you a high price," he said.

The Israeli army says 15 of its soldiers were killed in combat on Wednesday, and that 40 Hezbollah fighters died the same day. Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into Israel, while no casualties from the Israeli side were reported. 

The IDF says it currerntly has approximately 10,000 troops on the ground in southern Lebanon, a number that will swell to 50,000 in coming days. 

As the fighting continues, U.S. sources said they no longer expect that a joint U.S.-French UN draft resolution calling for a ceasefire in Lebanon would reach a Security Council vote by a hoped for Thursday deadline. Disagreement over whether the resolution should call for an immediate Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon is an obstacle. 

The resolution was to be co-sponsored by the United States and France, but the two countries are now at odds over how to reword the proposal in light of Arab objections to the original draft. The French have accepted a Lebanese offer to send 15,000 troops into the south to monitor the ceasefire if Israel withdraws immediately, while the U.S. wants Israel to be able to remain in southern Lebanon for a few weeks until a new multi-national force arrives. 

More than 1000 Lebanese, mostly civilians, have died in the month-long conflict according to Lebanon's government. 100 Israelis, mostly soldiers, have also been killed.

<h1>New Zealand Maori angry over US tattoo kit</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori"&gt;Māori&lt;/a&gt; leaders have said that they will try to get a Maori &lt;a href="w%3Atattoo%23Temporary%20tattoos"&gt;temporary tattoo&lt;/a&gt; kit from the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; store Halloween Town withdrawn from sale, as they find it insulting to the Māori culture. 

The Halloween Town, a store that specializes in Halloween costumes and accessories, is selling the tattoo kit for NZ$16. The store's website features a photograph of a full facial &lt;a href="w%3AT%C4%81%20moko"&gt;Tā moko&lt;/a&gt; (Māori tattoo) instead of their usual caricatures. 

Aroha Mead, &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20University%20of%20Wellington"&gt;Victoria University of Wellington&lt;/a&gt; Māori business lecturer said that the Tā moko is not frightening, "And he doesn't look scary to me – he looks quite handsome,", but added "There didn't appear to be much that Māori could do. No-one likes to see their culture being denigrated but we are aware that the moko is in the public domain."

Rotorua acedmic Ngahihi o te ra Bidois, who has a full facial moko, has asked the Halloween Town store to remove the tattoo kits. "It is insulting ... what they are doing is not portraying Māori correctly," Bidois said.

A full-face moko is traditionally restricted to male Māori and is used to represent &lt;a href="w%3AMana%23Mana%20in%20Oceanic%20culture"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; (prestige).

<h1>Police in Britain uncover suspected terrorist plot</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Police%20in%20Britain%20uncover%20suspected%20terrorist%20plot&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Police%20Service"&gt;Metropolitan Police's&lt;/a&gt; anti-terrorist branch and security service in &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; have claimed that a terrorist plot to detonate bombs on nine planes travelling mid-air from the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; has been thwarted. 

<h2>Details of plot emerge</h2>
The bombs were to be smuggled onboard in passengers' hand luggage. The planned attacks might have been the biggest terrorist attacks since &lt;a href="w%3ASeptember%2011%2C%202001%20attacks"&gt;9/11&lt;/a&gt;, government officials have said. Information gathered after recent arrests in &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; convinced British investigators they had to act urgently to stop the plot. The original information about the plan came from the Muslim community in Britain, according to a British intelligence official. The tip resulted from a person who had been concerned about the activities of an acquaintance after the &lt;a href="w%3A7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings"&gt;July 7, 2005 terror attacks in London&lt;/a&gt;, the official said.

The counter-terrorism operation took several months to complete. &lt;a href="w%3AScotland%20Yard"&gt;Scotland Yard&lt;/a&gt; said twenty-three people are in custody, and were arrested in north and east London, &lt;a href="w%3ABirmingham"&gt;Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHigh%20Wycombe"&gt;High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire&lt;/a&gt;. An undercover British agent infiltrated the group, giving the authorities intelligence on the alleged plan, several U.S. government officials said. The men had not bought plane tickets, the officials said, but they were in the process of perusing the Internet to find flights to various cities that had similar departure times. Pakistani officials have said two Britons were arrested last week, and that five Pakistanis have been detained on suspicion of "facilitating" the plot. As many as 50 people were involved in the plot, an internal &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Homeland%20Security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; document said.

Speaking on the day after the arrests, UK Home Secretary John Reid said although officials believed the main suspects were in custody, the UK threat level remained "critical", the highest level. He said UK citizens faced a "common threat" and appealed for tolerance and resilience. He also added that Britain was grateful for Pakistan's cooperation in breaking up the suspected plot. 

After the arrests, Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, said: "We are confident that we have disrupted a plan by terrorists to cause untold death and destruction and to commit, quite frankly, mass murder. We believe that the terrorists' aim was to smuggle explosives on to aeroplanes in hand luggage and to detonate these in flight. We also believe that the intended targets were flights from the United Kingdom to the United States of America. I can confirm that a significant number of people are currently in custody and the operation is ongoing." U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, said it was unclear if all suspects were now in custody. U.S. and British officials said some suspects could still be on the loose and that investigations were continuing.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently holidaying in the Caribbean, paid tribute to the security services and the police. "I thank them for the great job they are doing in protecting our country. There has been an enormous amount of co-operation with the U.S. authorities which has been of great value and underlines the threat we face and our determination to counter it," he said in a statement.

The White House has said the plot had been a direct threat to the U.S., and security officials there say aspects of the plan were suggestive of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;. Terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said two factors pointed to the influence of al-Qaeda. He said the organization is "obsessed" with commercial aviation, and he added that the timing of the plot was "very interesting." "It's not clear when this was going to be implemented ... but we are coming up on the fifth anniversary of 9/11. They do want to make a big statement," he said. 

U.S. intelligence officials said the plotters hoped to stage a dry run by August 10, and the actual attack would have followed days later, the officials told the &lt;a href="Associated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that terrorists planned to detonate explosives on three U.S. airliners. A U.S. administration official said the plot targeted &lt;a href="w%3AContinental%20Airlines"&gt;Continental Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines"&gt;United&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Airways"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Airlines"&gt;American Airlines&lt;/a&gt; flights to &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.

A senior U.S. intelligence official suggests that those arrested are British citizens, and some have links with Pakistan. Among those arrested were a Muslim charity worker and a Heathrow Airport employee with an all-area access pass, according to Britain's &lt;a href="w%3AChannel%204"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt;. The suspected terrorists had been under surveillance in Britain since last December, the channel reported. According to ABC News, five more suspects who are still at large in Britain are being "urgently sought". At a press conference at the afternoon on August 10, Home Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reid"&gt;John Reid&lt;/a&gt; said the police believe the "main players" are accounted for. Two of the suspects left "martyrdom tapes," according to Pakistani sources familiar with the details of the British investigation. 

A senior U.S. congressional source said it is believed the plotters planned to mix a British sports drink with a gel-like substance to make an explosive that they would possibly trigger with an MP3 player or cell phone. The sports drink could be combined with a peroxide-based paste to form a potent "explosive cocktail," if properly done, said a U.S. counterterrorism official. "There are strong reasons to believe the materials in a beverage like that could have been part of the formula," the official said. "What makes it frightening is the sophistication to turn relatively common materials into a dangerous bomb," said a U.S. intelligence official. 

Two of the suspects held in connection with the alleged plot to down commercial jetliners with explosives may have had contact with a Pakistani suspected of being an al Qaeda operative, government officials in Britain and the United States said. The officials allege that &lt;a href="w%3AMatiur%20Rehman"&gt;Matiur Rehman&lt;/a&gt;, described as an explosives expert in Pakistan who is now at large, met two of the British suspects in Pakistan. But officials, who say the plot displays signs of al Qaeda participation but are still investigating that angle, do not know whether Rehman was involved in the plot. After the two people returned to Britain, they received a wire transfer of money from Pakistan, the officials said.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Chertoff"&gt;Michael Chertoff&lt;/a&gt;, the US Secretary of Homeland Security, said the plan was reminiscent of the &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Bojinka"&gt;1995 plot&lt;/a&gt; by 9/11 coordinator &lt;a href="w%3AKhalid%20Shaikh%20Mohammed"&gt;Khalid Shaikh Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;, who envisioned detonating bombs on 11 airlines possibly traveling over the &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. He also said that the plotters were "getting close to the execution phase". 

The U.S. is also sending out more &lt;a href="w%3Aair%20marshals"&gt;air marshals&lt;/a&gt; on flights between the UK and the U.S. President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; said the arrests are a "stark reminder" that the U.S. is "at war with Islamic fascists." He thanked British Prime Minister Tony Blair for "busting this plot." U.S. government officials say there were two phone calls made from London to the United States recently by suspects. Those calls were tracked down and investigated, but there is no evidence of any involvement of people in America in the alleged plot.

The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi on August 11 warned American citizens of possible terrorist attacks across &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; in the week from August 14 to August 20.

<h2>Flights disrupted</h2>
&lt;a href="w%3AMI5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt;, the British internal security service, has raised the threat level to critical, meaning "an attack is expected imminently and indicates an extremely high level of threat to the UK".

As a result, increased security at all British airports have been implemented, leading to delays in departing flights.
Significant disruptions include: 

<ul>
BULLET::::- At &lt;a href="w%3AHeathrow%20Airport"&gt;Heathrow Airport&lt;/a&gt;, incoming short-haul flights have resumed. However, long-haul services are still delayed and numerous outbound flights have been cancelled.
BULLET::::- At &lt;a href="w%3AGatwick%20Airport"&gt;Gatwick Airport&lt;/a&gt;, all &lt;a href="w%3AEasyJet"&gt;EasyJet&lt;/a&gt; flights have been cancelled
BULLET::::- All flights from &lt;a href="w%3ABrussels%20Airport"&gt;Brussels Airport&lt;/a&gt; to the UK have been cancelled.

</ul>
Air passengers across Europe faced a second day of delays on August 11, though the situation had eased from the previous day when London's Heathrow Airport was closed to many incoming flights.

<h2>Security restrictions</h2>
The alleged plot to smuggle liquid explosives onto planes has led to drastic new security measures at airports around the world.

All airlines departing from UK airports have told their passengers that they are not permitted to carry any hand baggage on board any aircraft departing from any airport in the UK.

Only the following items are permitted in the cabin, and must be carried in transparent bags:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Wallets and purses, plus their contents.
BULLET::::- Travel documents, including passports and travel tickets.
BULLET::::- Prescription medicines, but not in liquid form, unless they can be verified as authentic.
BULLET::::- Essential medical items, such as a diabetic kit.
BULLET::::- Glasses and sunglasses, but not in their cases.
BULLET::::- Contact lens holders, but with no bottles of solution.
BULLET::::- Baby food and milk, but contents must be tasted by accompanying passenger.
BULLET::::- Sanitary items for babies.
BULLET::::- Female sanitary items, unboxed.
BULLET::::- Handkerchiefs and tissues, unboxed.
BULLET::::- Keys, but with no electric key fobs.

</ul>
No fluids at all are allowed onboard. "We hope that these measures, which are being kept under review by the government, will need to be in place for a limited period only," said a statement issued by the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20for%20Transport"&gt;Department for Transport&lt;/a&gt;.

Weblog journalists have criticized whether the physical handling of potential explosive liquids reflects the threat authorities claim. In response to CNN reporting, "Because the plot involved taking liquid explosives aboard planes in carry-ons, passengers at all U.S. and British airports, and those boarding U.S.-bound flights at other international airports, are banned from taking any liquids onto planes." XOPL observes, "And then they have the photo of the &lt;a href="w%3ATransit%20Security%20Administration"&gt;TSA&lt;/a&gt; guy dumping a tub of confiscated possibly explosive liquids into a garbage can in a crowd of people. ... Nevermind that the plot specifically mentions mixing chemicals and/or nitroglycerin... which explodes if handled too roughly." Responding to "A.J. Leoni, pours the last of her drink into the receptacle while in line for the security checkpoint at the Asheville Regional Airport," in the Asheville Citizen-Times, Gabriel Meister writes, "♡❤Pour it into a receptacle?♡❤ Don't you think that some of these potentially explosive liquids might be more dangerous when, I don't know, mixed in a big vat in the middle of an airport?"
The United States Department of Homeland Security said in an email: "The U.S. threat level is raised to Severe, or Red, for all commercial flights flying from the United Kingdom to the U.S. The U.S. threat level is raised to High, or Orange for all commercial aviation operating in the U.S., including international flights. Flights from the U.S. to the U.K. are also Orange. PROHIBITED ITEMS CHANGE: All liquids and gels are now prohibited at the screening checkpoints. For more information please visit www.tsa.gov." Continental, &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20Air%20Lines"&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANorthwest%20Airlines"&gt;Northwest&lt;/a&gt; and United Airlines advised passengers to arrive three hours before takeoff for domestic and international flights, according to the airlines' Web sites. American Airlines advised passengers to allow for "extra time." Passengers in the U.S. faced a second security check starting August 11.

The nation's overall terror threat level has not been altered. August 10 2006 was the first time the Department of Homeland Security has raised the threat level for a specific group of flights. British Airways canceled all short haul flights in or out of Heathrow Airport for August 10, 2006, and delays were stacking flights up at airports across Europe.

Massachusetts Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; ordered the National Guard to &lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALogan%20International%20Airport"&gt;Logan Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and California Gov. &lt;a href="w%3AArnold%20Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt; ordered the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20National%20Guard"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt; to airports in his state.

The United States on August 11 renewed its warning to U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Pakistan amid rising concerns over terror activity that would be directed against U.S. interests.

<h2>Bank accounts frozen</h2>
The &lt;a href="w%3ABank%20of%20England"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt; has notified financial institutions to freeze accounts of 19 people under terrorist financing laws, according to a statement on the Bank's web site. The individuals were identified as Ali Abdula Ahmed, Ali Cossor, ALI Shazad Khuram, Hussain Nabeel, Hussain Tanvir, Hussain Umair, Islam Umar, Kayani Waseem, Khan Assan Abdullah, Khan Waheed Arafat, Khatib Osman Adam, Patel Abdul Muneem, Rauf Tayib, Saddique Muhammed Usman, Sarwar Assad, Savant Ibrahim, Tariq Amin, Asmin, Uddin Shamin Mohammed, and Zaman Waheed.

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; is introducing warnings in its search results, notifying users about websites which are known to distribute "&lt;a href="w%3Abadware"&gt;badware&lt;/a&gt;", malicious software such as &lt;a href="w%3Aspyware"&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt;, deceptive &lt;a href="w%3Aadware"&gt;adware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AComputer%20virus"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATrojan%20horse%20%28computing%29"&gt;trojans&lt;/a&gt; that disrupt the smooth running of computers. Google search users will be warned before they enter suspect websites: "The site you are about to visit may harm your computer!"

"To begin we'll only be identifying a small number of sites, but we'll be expanding our coverage over time," the company said. "Finding new and better ways to protect our users is a perpetual project, and we'll continue to work hard in this area." 

Google, along with &lt;a href="w%3ALenovo%20Group"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Microsystems"&gt;Sun Microsystems&lt;/a&gt;, has sponsored StopBadware project, in which researchers from &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oxford"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt; universities are creating a clearinghouse for information on spyware and other malicious software and the ways they are disseminated. 

&lt;a href="w%3AJonathan%20Zittrain"&gt;Jonathan Zittrain&lt;/a&gt;, a Harvard and Oxford professor involved with StopBadware, said the project may one day release lists of suspect sites still under investigation, but would most likely do so for everyone and not just sponsors like Google.

Milton Fabian Sanchez was killed on Wednesday evening in his house in Yumbo municipality in &lt;a href="w%3AValle%20del%20Cauca%20Department"&gt;Valle del Cauca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AColombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, when gunmen entered the home and shot him dead.

Sanchez, 30, worked for a local radio and television station. Police could not immediately provide a motive for his killing.

Jose Leon, chief of the local police said that the investigation is following three leads: "incidents relating to his journalism, the second those relating to his family, and finally what he was doing at the time of the murder,".

Some press organizations have ranked Colombia among the most dangerous for journalists to work in.

&lt;a href="w%3AMerseyside%20Police"&gt;Merseyside Police&lt;/a&gt; concluded after a brief inspection that the controversial blog ♡❤Liverpool Evil Cabal♡❤ does not break criminal law. However the council officers continue to search for the editor.

The blog has been blocked on computers controlled by Liverpool Direct Ltd, a company jointly owned by &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20City%20Council"&gt;Liverpool City Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Telecom"&gt;British Telecom&lt;/a&gt;.

Previous fights between Liverpool city councillors and executive staff have resulted in controversy before, most notably in the resignation of leader &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Storey%20%28politician%29"&gt;Mike Storey&lt;/a&gt; and CEO Henshaw.

The &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; government's proposed amendments to immigration laws to allow offshore processing may face a difficult passage through the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Senate"&gt;Australian Senate&lt;/a&gt; with four &lt;a href="w%3ACoalition%20%28Australia%29"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt; senators refusing to state whether or not they will support the amendments. The ♡❤Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill♡❤ passed in the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, despite three coalition MPs crossing the floor to vote against the government.

On Thursday, Petro Georgiou (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Kooyong"&gt;Kooyong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt;), Russell Broadbent (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20McMillan"&gt;McMillan&lt;/a&gt;, Liberal) and Judi Moylan (&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Pearce"&gt;Pearce&lt;/a&gt;, Liberal) crossed the floor to vote with the opposition against the government's proposed reforms. Two other coalition MPs abstained from the vote. The legislation still passed, due to the coalition's commanding majority in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia's&lt;/a&gt; lower house.

In the Senate, where the government has a one seat majority, it may be difficult for the legislation to pass with coalition senators Judith Troeth (&lt;a href="w%3AVictoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, Liberal), Marise Payne (&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;, Liberal), Russell Trood (&lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, Liberal) and Barnaby Joyce (Queensland, &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;National&lt;/a&gt;) refusing to indicate which way they will be voting when the legislation comes before the senate on Monday or Tuesday.

The government now needs all of these senators to vote for this bill because Steve Fielding from the Family First Party has now officially announced that he will vote aganist this bill because he disagrees with sending asylum seekers to Nauru instead of being processed in Australia

Australia's major opposition party, the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; has urged coalition senators to follow the lead of their lower house counterparts and defeat the bill. "I do hope that in the Senate others on the Coalition, who share that view, will ensure its defeat," said &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the opposition.

A &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;U.N.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; proposal calls for &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; to move out of the south and into positions north of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALitani%20River"&gt;Litani River&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , but it makes no mention of disarmament.

According to U.N. observers, a vicious battle broke out between Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters in Khiyam, which Israel says is a Hezbollah stronghold.

The U.N.'s top humanitarian official, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJan%20Egeland"&gt;Jan Egeland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , criticised both Israel and Hezbollah for hindering access to southern Lebanon, calling the situation a "disgrace".
U.N. Secretary-General &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; pushed the Security Council to come up with a plan by week's end, August 12 to August 13, for ending the conflict. In a statement issued early afternoon, Annan's office said he is working "very intensely" on reaching a resolution acceptable to both Israel and Lebanon, and he repeated his call to end the fighting and "save civilians on both sides from the nightmare they have endured for the past four weeks." "The secretary-general believes that it ought to be possible for the Security Council to adopt a resolution by the end of the week," his office said. 

Meanwhile, the United Nations warned of a major food crisis in Lebanon, saying that the displacement of nearly a million people has coincided with the country's main cereal harvest. Of the 915,000 people the U.N. estimates to be internally displaced in Lebanon, 45 percent are children, it said. Fighting has disrupted the delivery of food, fuel and medical supplies and devastated much of the country's infrastructure, and the U.N. said 100,000 people in southern Lebanon won't be receiving vital relief. 

The emergency coordinator for the U.N. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Program"&gt;World Food Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Zlatan Milisic, said no aid has been able to reach areas south of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASidon"&gt;Sidon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . A relief convoy planned for Nabatiya was denied IDF approval, said Milisic. The main points of a resolution to end fighting between Israel and Hezbollah have been agreed to by the U.S. and France, diplomatic sources said. U.N. observers described again a vicious battle in Khiyam, which Israel said is a Hezbollah stronghold, during the Israelian advance to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMarjayoun"&gt;Marjayoun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Super &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATyphoon%20Saomai"&gt;Typhoon Saomai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; made landfall in the eastern province &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AZhejiang"&gt;Zhejiang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; around 5:30 p.m. Thursday afternoon. By Friday evening Saomai had left a path of destruction in Zhejiang and neighboring province &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFujian"&gt;Fujian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Over 100 people have been reported dead with even more missing. An estimated 3.5 million people were affected by the storm, some 1.6 million of whom were evacuated.

Reports from the civil affairs bureau tell of large-scale material destruction. In Zhejiang, 18,000 houses were destroyed and in Fujian, 32,000. Hundreds of thousands of buildings have been damaged. Phone and power lines were knocked down and outages were wide-spread.

With wind speeds of 216 km/h (135 mph) at the time of landfall it is the strongest typhoon to hit China since August 1, 1956, when a storm with wind speeds of 244 km/h killed 4,900 people.

Emergency plans have been implemented and supplies are being sent in from other provinces. The central government has allocated 166 million yuan to assist the affected region.

WHP Holdings Corp., the parent company of &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20Hen%20Pantry"&gt;White Hen Pantry&lt;/a&gt;, has been acquired by Tokyo based &lt;a href="w%3ASeven%20%26amp%3B%20I%20Holdings%20Co."&gt;Seven &amp; I Holdings Co.&lt;/a&gt; for $35 million from New York investment firm, Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co. White Hen has previously declared bankruptcy. Seven &amp; I is the owner and operator of the &lt;a href="w%3A7-Eleven"&gt;7-Eleven&lt;/a&gt; convenience store chain. This is the largest buyout for the 7-Eleven brand in two decades and signals a continuance of the expansion Seven &amp; I has pursued in recent years. 

"This acquisition is a strategic fit for 7-Eleven and enhances market presence in the Chicagoland area," said 7-Eleven Inc. President and Chief Executive Joseph DePinto. The addition of White Hen stores will allow the company to increase their presence in greater Boston (55 stores) and metropolitan Chicago (206 stores) bringing their North American store count to over 7,100.

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Embassy in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi%2C%20India"&gt;New Delhi, India&lt;/a&gt; has warned citizens in a statement on its website that "foreign terrorists, possibly members of &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;" may be planning a "series of bombings" that would take place "in or around New Delhi and &lt;a href="w%3AMumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;" in India before or during India's celebration of Independence Day on August 15, 2006. The statement also says that the likely "time frame" for the attacks may be around "August 11-16," 2006.

"The Embassy has learned that foreign terrorists, possibly including members of Al-Qaida, allegedly intend to carry out a series of bombing attacks in or around New Delhi and Mumbai (Bombay) in the days leading up to India’s Independence Day on August 15, 2006," said the statement.

The statement warns that "likely targets include major airports, key central Indian government offices, and major gathering places such as hotels and markets." 

The statement also warns all Americans in the region to "keep a low profile" and to be "attentive" of their surroundings.

The embassy in New Delhi will be closed on August 15 in recognition of the Indian Independence Day along with the Consulates in Mumbai, &lt;a href="w%3AChennai%2C%20India"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACalcutta%2C%20India"&gt;Calcutta&lt;/a&gt;. The embassy in New Delhi and the Consulate in Chennai will be closed on August 16 in recognition of &lt;a href="w%3AJanmashtami"&gt;Janmashtami&lt;/a&gt; (Krishna Jayanthi), also an Indian holiday; however, the embassy in Mumbai and Calcutta will remain open.

The Indian Home Ministry has told New Delhi Police to step up security at all "vital installations" and also asked them to maintain "the highest state of alert." 

"All vital installations like bus and railway stations, airports, metro services and government buildings are under the scanner," said Ministry officials.

The Home Ministry also said that the warning should be treated only as an "advisory."

"It is a very innocuous advisory. And that's about it. I have read the advisory. We have no comments," said home secretary VK Duggal.

Indian minister of state for external affairs, Anand Sharma said that the ministry is "aware that there is a threat, as India has been a target for militants."

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; has unanimously approved &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201701"&gt;Resolution 1701&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; calling for a "full cessation of hostilities" in the &lt;a href="2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;Israeli-Lebanon war&lt;/a&gt; and for international and Lebanese troops to replace Israeli troops in south Lebanon.

The UN decree comes on the heels of an Israeli government decision to expand its offensive in Lebanon. Sources say that Israeli prime minister &lt;a href="Ehud%20Olmert"&gt;Ehud Olmert&lt;/a&gt; will bring the UN resolution to cabinet for discussion on Sunday. Daniel Ayalon, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said that his government was likely to agree to the resolution.

"I do not want to preempt the Cabinet decision, but the language as I see it now &amp;mdash; and I'm being careful &amp;mdash; if the language of the resolution doesn't change, I view this resolution very positively and, of course, the crux is implementation," Ayalon said. "If this resolution will be enforced, then we solve the problem of Lebanon," said the Israeli envoy.

&lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; officials have not responded to the UN action. The Lebanese cabinet meets Saturday to discuss the resolution.

Lebanese leaders have cautiously welcomed the resolution which had been delayed for almost a week due to negotiations over its wording. U.N. Ambassador Nouhad Mahmoud of Lebanon said; "The Lebanese are not comfortable with the Israeli distinctions of what is defensive and what is offensive." 

The resolution calls for &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; to end its attacks on Israel and for Israel to end "offensive military operations" in Lebanon. It also raises the strength of the UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Interim%20Force"&gt;United Nations Interim Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Unifil), from 2,000 to a maximum of 15,000, and gives it an expanded mandate to enforce the ceasefire. A portion of the UN language expanding that force's Chapter 6 mandate reads: ♡❤"Acting in support of a request from the government of Lebanon to deploy an international force to assist it to exercise its authority throughout the territory, authorizes Unifil to take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces and as it deems within its capabilities, to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind... "♡❤

The U.S. Secretary of State, &lt;a href="Condoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt;, responding on Friday during an interview with ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWolf%20Blitzer"&gt;Wolf Blitzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to the difference between a UN Chapter 7 mandate, and the current mandate for Unifil in Lebanon said: &lt;blockquote&gt;So this force has a big mandate, it has a robust mandate, it has a mandate that will allow it to defend itself and to defend that mandate. But it's never been the expectation that this force is going to disarm Hezbollah. That will have to be done by the Lebanese...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Chapter 7 is very often used when a government is not prepared to accept a force. Lebanon is prepared to accept this force, but this is an absolutely robust mandate. This, by the way, is what helped the Israeli government. They were concerned earlier about the mandate. After we talked about this enhanced mandate in the revised resolution, I think the government of Israel saw that it met their needs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Israel is to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon as UN and Lebanese troops are deployed. The resolution outlines plans for the disarmament of Hezbollah and for a settlement of the Israeli-Lebanese border.
The UN also called for the unconditional release by Hezbollah of two Israeli soldiers it captured on July 12th, precipitating the conflict.

123 Israelis, including 40 civilians, and 861 Lebanese, mostly civilians, have been killed in the 31-day old war.

<h1>British Muslims warn Prime Minister Tony Blair over foreign policy</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=British%20Muslims%20warn%20Prime%20Minister%20Tony%20Blair%20over%20foreign%20policy&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Some of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;'s most influential British Muslims have written a letter to Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; saying that there must be urgent changes to UK foreign policy. 

In the memo, they say current government policy musters fanaticism and puts ordinary people at risk in both the United Kingdom and abroad. They also urge the Prime Minister to extend his efforts in tackling terrorism and extremism. 

The letter has been signed by three Muslim Members of Parliament, three Muslim peers and thirty-eight Muslim groups including the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Council%20of%20Britain"&gt;Muslim Council of Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Association%20of%20Britain"&gt;Muslim Association of Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the British Muslim Forum and the Muslim Solidarity Committee. 

&lt;a href="w%3ASadiq%20Khan"&gt;Sadiq Khan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Members of Parliament to sign the letter, condemns the Government’s stance on the Middle East. "This government has had some major foreign policy successes that have helped make the world a better place. But current policy on the Middle East is seen by almost everyone I speak to as unfair and unjust." 

"Whether we like it or not such a sense of injustice plays into the hands of extremists. As moderates we will do all we can to fight extremism. We hope the government will join us in this, not just by changing the rules on hand luggage, but by showing itself as an advocate for justice in the world."

In a response to the letter, a &lt;a href="w%3A10%20Downing%20Street"&gt;10 Downing Street&lt;/a&gt; spokesman said: "We should always remember that the terrorism affecting the West today has blighted Muslim countries for several decades. It certainly pre-dated our decision to support democracy in Afghanistan and Iraq and of course the September 11 attacks. Our foreign policy is focused on supporting the people of those countries in their desire to live in a democracy just as we enjoy in the UK."

Downing Street also said that Tony Blair "stands ready" to meet with Muslim representatives when he returns to the UK from his holiday in the Caribbean. 

The letter comes after police foiled an alleged attempt by terrorists to blow up several planes travelling mid-air from the United Kingdom to the United States of America.

The Dutch government has confirmed its first &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; bird flu case in the country. The case was found in 2 dead young owls in a zoo in Rotterdam. A lab in Lelystad confirmed that the bird flu was first discovered after a routine test by the Wild Life Health Centre and found traces of H5N1. Further tests will be carried out due to be released in a few days.

Netherlands has never had a reported case of H5N1 before.

As bird flu can only spread by close contact, the zoo will remain open, but restrictions will be in place to protect visitors, staff and other animals.

The source of the bird flu is unknown. Staff have been given prophylactic medication.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; federal government has announced that it will be introducing an electronic system for &lt;a href="w%3AMedicare%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; rebates within the next twelve months. Under the new system, patients will be able to receive their Medicare rebates electronically without having to visit a Medicare office.

During an interview in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; today, Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, along with his human services minister Joe Hockey and health minister Tony Abbott, announced that patients who pay for the services of a doctor using their credit cards will be able to receive their rebates electronically within 24 hours. Under the current system patients must visit a Medicare office to receive their rebates.

John Howard said the 80,000 people per day who queue at Medicare offices will no longer need to spend their lunch break in line at Medicare.

According to the government, doctors who bulk-bill their patients through Medicare will benefit through faster payments and reduced paperwork. "If it’s a bulk bill transaction; all they do is hand over their Medicare card," said Mr Hockey.

"The Medicare card is swiped in the EFTPOS device, all is done."

"Doctors will be rebated within 24 hours."

"Currently doctors are rebated up to 14 days for bulk bill claims."

The government claims that electronic rebates will be less expensive to process&amp;mdash;costing only a few cents, compared to an estimated &lt;a href="w%3AAUD"&gt;AUD&lt;/a&gt; $3.50 for an over-the-counter transaction. Despite this, patients who still wish to visit a Medicare office to receive their rebates will still be able to do so.

The minister for human services was quick to assure Australians that Medicare offices would remain open saying that over the past twelve months they have taken on an "expanded role" with the Family Assistance Office's services being provided in Medicare offices.

<h1>South Africa sets deadline in land transfer scheme</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=South%20Africa%20sets%20deadline%20in%20land%20transfer%20scheme&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n government has set a six-month deadline for some white farmers to agree on sale prices for their farms. The government will be requiring them to sell the farms as part of its land redistribution programme. 

Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister Lulu Xingwana said that if no agreement in reached in 6 months, the government could &lt;a href="w%3Aexpropriation"&gt;expropriate&lt;/a&gt; farmlands. Stating that negotiations have been too slow, in some cases taking many years, Xingwana said that some farm owners were seeking "unrealistic prices". Land owners claim they are not offered market value for their property. 

The government has identified about 350 farms for which, if no deal is reached, the government will force a mandatory sale at current market prices identified by the government. 

Officials said that expropriation is only a measure of last-resort and that farmers can appeal the decision in court. 

The land reform programme aims to hand back land or give financial compensation to black South Africans who were forcibly removed from their ancestral homes and lands under &lt;a href="w%3Aapartheid"&gt;apartheid rule&lt;/a&gt;. The programme was a key promise made by the &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20National%20Congress"&gt;African National Congress&lt;/a&gt; (ANC) as it came to power in 1994 and remains an emotive and politically charged issue.

Currently, about 4% of South Africa's farm land is owned by blacks, who number 42 million out of the nation's 47 million population. President &lt;a href="w%3AThabo%20Mbeki"&gt;Thabo Mbeki&lt;/a&gt;'s government has set a target of transferring 30% of land to blacks by 2014. About 89% of the nearly 80,000 claims have been settled so far, and the government has spent some R2.5bn ($368m) purchasing farms from white owners. The National Land Claims Commission is entrusted with carrying out the transfers.

The reform programme had so far followed a "willing-buyer willing-seller" principle. The process had to contend with land owners challenging the validity of some claims, negotiating sale prices with current owners, and settling competing claims over the same piece of land&amp;mdash;sometimes by tracing family trees of claimants when other documents supporting the claim did not exist. 

Xingwana called on established farmers to form partnerships with new landowners and to transfer skills to new farmers, to ensure productive use of transferred lands. One criticism of the programme is that some of the transferred farms have fallen in production due to the inexperience and lack of capital among the new owners. 

The government has rejected comparisons of the programme with that initiated in &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; under President &lt;a href="Robert%20Mugabe"&gt;Robert Mugabe&lt;/a&gt;.

Twenty-four thousand delegates from over 132 countries are expected to attend the &lt;a href="w%3AXVI%20International%20AIDS%20Conference%2C%202006"&gt;16th International AIDS Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto this week 

Delegates include scientists, politicians, health care workers, government and non-governmental officials, people with AIDS and celebrities. In attendance will be &lt;a href="Bill%20Gates"&gt;Bill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMelinda%20Gates"&gt;Melinda Gates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Gere"&gt;Richard Gere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AOlympia%20Dukakis"&gt;Olympia Dukakis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASandra%20Oh"&gt;Sandra Oh&lt;/a&gt;.

The theme of the conference is "Time to Deliver" and is meant to focus attention on the need to meet past promises to increase funding for treatment, care and prevention. The conference began on August 13th and is scheduled to end on August 18th.

There is growing frustration with the failure of developed countries to provide drugs to combat the AIDS crisis in the developing world, particularly Africa. 

"What the Western world has to do is deliver on its promises, which it never does. It always betrays the people of Africa," &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Lewis"&gt;Stephen Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, the UN secretary general's special envoy for HIV-AIDS in Africa, told CBC News.

In the week leading up to the conference, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates announced a donation of US$500 million spread over five years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Gates and former US President &lt;a href="w%3ABill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; will be sharing the podium during this week's conference. 

International AIDS conferences have usually been attended by world leaders, particularly the leader of the host country. Canadian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; has been criticized for snubbing the conference by sending his health minister, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Clement"&gt;Tony Clement&lt;/a&gt;, to attend in his place. The prime minister, who is touring Canada's far north this week, officially declined his invitation to attend three weeks ago.

"It's a dreadful mistake in political judgment, and it's not excusable," said Lewis, who was Canada's Ambassador to the United Nations in the 1980s. "It's a lost opportunity to tell the world how Canada feels about this pandemic.

"The Arctic sovereignty issue will still be there on August 18 (when the AIDS conference ends)," said Lewis. "Forty million people worldwide carry this virus, and most will die preventable deaths. What greater scourge is there than that?"

This is the second major international event Canada has hosted which Harper has snubbed. Last month, he did not appear in Montreal for the 2006 World Outgames, a celebration of elite gay, lesbian, and transgendered athletes. 

The AIDS conference is expected to be the largest in history and will be ten times the size of the first which was held in Atlanta in 1985. It has become a biennial event and is convened by the International AIDS Society (IAS), an independent association of HIV professionals, with more than 7,000 members from 153 countries.

<h1>Fresh pictures of Castro and Chavez shown in Cuban media</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Fresh%20pictures%20of%20Castro%20and%20Chavez%20shown%20in%20Cuban%20media&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
An additional round of new photos of a recuperating &lt;a href="Fidel%20Castro"&gt;Fidel Castro&lt;/a&gt; have been published in the &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;n media. There has been international speculation on the state of the Cuban leader's health since he temporarily relinquished power two weeks ago prior to undergoing intestinal surgery. Castro had not been seen in those two weeks, and there were rumours that he was dead or nearing death.

The official Communist Party daily ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGranma%20%28newspaper%29"&gt;Granma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ today published pictures of Castro meeting &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;n president &lt;a href="Hugo%20Chavez"&gt;Hugo Chavez&lt;/a&gt; on the Cuban leader's 80th birthday, yesterday. The paper referred to the meeting as "three hours of emotional exchange" quoting Chavez as saying "This is the best visit I've ever had in my life." Earlier, acting Cuban leader &lt;a href="Raul%20Castro"&gt;Raul Castro&lt;/a&gt; made his first public appearance since taking power when he welcomed Chavez to Cuba at the airport. The brothers also appear together in one of the new photos. 

The earlier round of pictures released Sunday by the ♡❤Juventud Rebelde♡❤ (Rebel Youth) newspaper show Castro speaking on the phone and holding Saturday's edition of the Communist Party newspaper ♡❤Granma♡❤.

Castro also released a statement yesterday saying that his health had improved but that his recovery would take more time.

"To say that objective stability has improved considerably is not to invent a lie. To affirm that the period of recovery will last a short time and that there is no longer any risk would be absolutely incorrect."
"I ask you all to be optimistic and at the same time to be ready to face any adverse news," said Castro, who also thanked the Cuban people for their love and support during his health crisis. The statement was the first from the Cuban leader since undergoing surgery.

♡❤Granma♡❤ reported Saturday that Castro is now "up" and "working". The official newspaper reported that according to an unnamed friend of Castro "the leader of the revolution, after receiving some physiotherapy, took his first steps in the room, then, sitting on a coach, talked vividly".

Though most official celebrations of Castro's birthday have been postponed (possibly until December), three thousand well-wishers have gathered for a five-hour birthday concert on Havana's Malecon seafront boulevard.

<h1>Forest fires continue to rage in Spain</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Forest%20fires%20continue%20to%20rage%20in%20Spain&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Several forest fires which have ruined well over ten thousand hectares of land are continuing to burn in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGalicia%2C%20Spain"&gt;Galicia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; today.

Four people have perished so far in the blazes which the government says were started intentionally by arsonists over a week ago. Police have arrested twenty-four people on suspicion of starting the fires. Among those being detained is a ninety-four year-old man.

"Those arrested are people who knew exactly what they were doing, knew they were committing crimes and went up into the hills to start fires, sometimes more than one," said the president of Galicia’s regional government, Emilio Perez Tourino.

Four hundred troops are currently in the northwestern county guarding densely-populated areas, airports and power stations. Spain’s President of Government, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Luis%20Rodriguez%20Zapatero"&gt;Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said earlier this week that an additional 1,200 army personnel would be sent to the area to assist the fire service.

Yesterday, flames continued to threaten Galicia, but the number of fires said to be out of control reportedly dropped thanks to the vigorous efforts of firefighters, soldiers and volunteers. 
Alfredo Canal, a Galician rural agency chief, told ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ yesterday: "We have a situation that is noticeably better than in recent days."

Over fifty firefighters are damping down after a tanker exploded at an industrial unit in &lt;a href="w%3ASalford"&gt;Salford&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Manchester"&gt;Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, thick smoke could be seen drifting across Manchester city centre. 

According to Greater Manchester Ambulance Service, no one has been hurt as a result of the explosion. 

A fire service spokesman said a Heavy Goods Vehicle and a nearby building were engulfed in flames. 

Greater Manchester Police are telling people to stay away from the Pendleton area. A spokesman said: "Officers are currently at the scene along with several fire engines including an aerial appliance. The fire has caused a large plume of smoke to form but at this stage it has not been established whether it is hazardous. It appears the fire has caused a number of small explosions within the building. As a precaution people are asked to stay away from the immediate area and those living in the immediate vicinity are being advised to stay indoors and keep all windows and doors shut as a precaution. There are no reports of any injuries."

Twenty-six year-old Lance Corporal Sean Tansey, from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHousehold%20Cavalry%20Regiment"&gt;Household Cavalry Regiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , was killed whilst mending a damaged &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFV107%20Scimitar"&gt;Scimitar tank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; near Sangin in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHelmand%20Province"&gt;Helmand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; province. An inquiry into his death will now be conducted. 

"Always smart, always hard working, he was a very experienced reconnaissance soldier, who was not only respected professionally but was also a charming individual, hugely popular among his peers," said Lt Col Edward Smyth-Osbourne, Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry regiment. "With his death the Household Cavalry has suffered the loss of another exceptionally talented member of
the regiment." 

He is the nineteenth British soldier to die in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUK%20Threat%20Levels"&gt;British terror alert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been downgraded from "Critical" to "Severe" &lt;a href="MI5"&gt;MI5&lt;/a&gt; is reporting. The "Severe"-level became active at midnight BST. The terror alert was raised to "Critical" after an alleged terror plot was foiled which involved blowing up at least a dozen planes from the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; in flight. The plot could have resulted in around 5000 deaths.

A power outage hit large parts of &lt;a href="w%3ATokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AChiba"&gt;Chiba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The electrical blackout occurred due to an industrial accident, in which a crane damaged some power lines accidentally at 7:40 AM local time (2240 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), the Kyodo News agency reported, quoting Tokyo Power Electric Co. Power was reported to have been restored to most areas within a few hours.

At least two elevators stopped with an unknown number of people trapped inside, said a fire official in Tokyo. Some train services were halted. The number of passengers was lower than normal due to a holiday. About 800,000 residences were affected by the blackout, according to the power company. Most services have since then been restored.

Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea delayed opening by an hour as many rides did not function due to the power problems.

<h1>Wellington, New Zealand university student missing</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wellington%2C%20New%20Zealand%20university%20student%20missing&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt; are concerned over the disappearance of a 19-year-old student. Daniel Antonious Hansman has not been seen since 11.30 p.m. last Thursday. He was last seen outside Coyote Bar on Courtney Place after he and his friend were refused entry because they were intoxicated. After several other unsuccessful attempts to get into other bars, his friend left for the toilet, but when he returned, Hansman was missing.

Hansman is from &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Plymouth"&gt;New Plymouth&lt;/a&gt; and is a student at &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20University%20of%20Wellington"&gt;Victoria University of Wellington&lt;/a&gt;. He has not attended his lectures, contacted his friends or family or gone to his flat since his disappearance.

Shane Cotter, &lt;a href="w%3AWellington"&gt;Wellington&lt;/a&gt; Detective Senior Sergeant, said: "It's out of character for Daniel to disappear without any explanation. Mr Hansman had been out with two female friends and a male friend in the Courtenay Place area on Thursday night. The women were allowed into a bar."

Hansman was probably carrying his cellphone with him, but it is not being answered. He may also have his driver's licence, but police are not sure if he had any other property or ID.

Hansman is a 177-&lt;a href="w%3Acentimetre"&gt;centimetre&lt;/a&gt; European of medium build. He has blue eyes, brown-black medium length hair, a &lt;a href="w%3Agoatee"&gt;goatee&lt;/a&gt; and is unshaven. He was last seen wearing dark jeans, a dark blue-black shirt with white and grey stripes and black dress shoes.

<h1>Economist reports Saudi oil production can continue unabated</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Economist%20reports%20Saudi%20oil%20production%20can%20continue%20unabated&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In its August 10 edition, ♡❤The Economist♡❤ magazine asserts that &lt;a href="w%3ASaudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; can continue producing oil at its current production levels for 70 years, without having to look for another drop. Further, the magazine claims that the nation could find ♡❤"plenty more if they look"♡❤, calling for privatisation of national oil companies to help increase oil production.

The language is provocative - the world has plenty of oil, and only requires sufficient investment and exploration to find it. This is a line that ♡❤The Economist♡❤ has held for some time, certainly since before its now infamous March 1999 issue proclaiming that we were "drowning in oil" and featuring a prediction of US$5 per barrel. That issue was followed by an embarrassing retraction in December of that year, as oil started its steady climb. It now sits above US$70 per barrel.

However, petroleum geologists and energy investment specialists maintain a different view of oil reserves. They say that there is a limit to what is in the ground, and further to that, a limit to how much of it we can retrieve even with advancing technology. Just how much is down there can't be said with any certainty, for a variety of reasons. A big one is the suspicious reserves figures given by producers in the &lt;a href="w%3AMiddle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, including Saudi Arabia. Since &lt;a href="w%3AOPEC"&gt;OPEC&lt;/a&gt; starting using a quota system based on reserves, the estimated reserves for member nations has magically risen, and even continued rising in the face of increased extraction from those reserves.

Amongst those who deal with the physical realities of oil fields, forecasts of a peak in production vary between 30 years, as the USA's &lt;a href="w%3AEnergy%20Information%20Administration"&gt;Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt; suggest, and now, as suggested by the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociation%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Peak%20Oil%20and%20Gas"&gt;Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas&lt;/a&gt; and other more pessimistic forecasters. A peak in production would then be followed by decline. Certainly, in the petroleum world, there is no serious suggestion of sustaining the current level of oil production for 70 years.

The controversial blog ♡❤Liverpool Evil Cabal♡❤ which had made serious allegations concerning &lt;a href="w%3ALiverpool%20City%20Council"&gt;Liverpool City Council&lt;/a&gt; and other organisations, is reportedly offline as off August 13th 2006

The site currently displays:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
♡❤This blog is temporarily unavailable but the fight goes on.♡❤
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to BBC News, Merseyside police have apparently been called in and are working with the &lt;a href="w%3ACrown%20Prosecution%20Service"&gt;Crown Prosecution Service&lt;/a&gt;. As yet there has been no confirmation that the blog was acting in or had intended to act in a criminal manner. An earlier article in the ♡❤Liverpool Echo♡❤, had however suggested that some employees of Liverpool City Council felt postings on the blog may be defamatory, a civil rather than criminal matter.

Liverpool City Council, has so far declined to comment on the sites disappearance, although the site had been previously blocked from the council's IT systems.

At 5:00 a.m. &lt;a href="w%3AGreenwich%20Mean%20Time"&gt;GMT&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; sponsored ceasefire between the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;IDF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; took effect. Outside of isolated small arms fire, both sides seem to be abiding by it. Although fighting took place until just minutes before the ceasefire, no air strikes or rocket attacks have been reported since.

Israel has said that it will maintain ground forces in southern &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; until they are relieved by the peace-keeping force. Israel also said it will maintain the blockade so that Hezbollah cannot rearm. Hezbollah on the other hand insisted on its right to fight Israeli soldiers on Lebanese soil.

The international peace-keeping force may take 10 days to assemble, says the UN. It is expected to be headed up by &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; troops, complemented primarily by troops from &lt;a href="w%3AItaly"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, which has volunteered up to 3,000 soldiers. &lt;a href="w%3APortugal"&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AFinland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASpain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; will also consider deployments. &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMalaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; have been mentioned by the UN as sources of non-&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; forces.

Within an hour of the ceasefire cars started heading south in Lebanon. Within hours thousands of Lebanese sought to return to their homes crowding roads, even as bulldozers were still trying to fill bomb craters. The Lebanese army was working hard to coordinate traffic and make-shift road repair.

"I'm so excited to see my home. I'd heard news it was completely destroyed, but even if there's one room intact, I will stay there with my children," said Sanaa Ayyad, who had with her a baby and two young boys.

The conflict has been going on for 39 days and has cost over 1,200 people their lives. In Lebanon, around 1,100 people have been killed, mostly civilians. 154 Israelis, including 114 soldiers, have been killed in the conflict.

A small fire broke out in the &lt;a href="w%3AiMPACT%21%20Zone"&gt;iMPACT! Zone&lt;/a&gt; during the first &lt;a href="w%3APPV"&gt;PPV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Aprofessional%20wrestling"&gt;professional wrestling&lt;/a&gt; match (and third overall, including preshow) of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ATNA%20Hard%20Justice%202006"&gt;TNA Hard Justice 2006&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on August 13, causing the evacuation of Stage 21 (the official name for the "iMPACT! Zone") at &lt;a href="w%3AUniversal%20Orlando%20Resort"&gt;Universal Orlando Resort&lt;/a&gt; for about 30 minutes. Although a Universal worker was taken to the hospital for treatment for &lt;a href="w%3Asmoke%20inhalation"&gt;smoke inhalation&lt;/a&gt;, no fans or wrestlers were hurt.

The source of the fire was a burlap sandbag in the rafters. Conflicting reports stated that either &lt;a href="w%3Apyrotechnics"&gt;pyrotechnics&lt;/a&gt; or a stage light caused the fire. It was put out with fire extinguishers from the rafters, and fans in general did not know what was going on until they saw and heard the fire extinguishers go off above them. Fans were heard at first chanting "The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire!" like the 1985 song by &lt;a href="w%3ARock%20Master%20Scott"&gt;Rock Master Scott&lt;/a&gt;.

As the fire occurred, &lt;a href="w%3AJohnny%20Devine"&gt;Johnny Devine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AEric%20Young%20%28wrestler%29"&gt;Eric Young&lt;/a&gt; were wrestling. The match continued, and Eric Young won the match. After the match, the iMPACT! Zone was evacuated. Due to the delay caused by the evacuation, a match to determine the number one contenders to the &lt;a href="w%3ANWA%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship"&gt;NWA World Tag Team Championship&lt;/a&gt; was cancelled.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOrlando%20Fire%20Department"&gt;Orlando Fire Department&lt;/a&gt; was called to the scene, and assessed that the building was safe to re-enter. As a safety precuation, &lt;a href="w%3ATotal%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling"&gt;TNA&lt;/a&gt; decided to not use any more pyros for the rest of the show.

Scientists have discovered the possible presence of the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20flu"&gt;Bird Flu&lt;/a&gt; virus in wild mute swans in &lt;a href="Michigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; on the coast of &lt;a href="w%3ALake%20Erie"&gt;Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt; near the Mouillee state game area in &lt;a href="w%3AMonroe%20County"&gt;Monroe County&lt;/a&gt;. The swans were sampled on August 8, 2006 and the initial testing was done at Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health and at the National Veterinary Services laboratories in &lt;a href="w%3AAmes%2C%20Iowa"&gt;Ames, Iowa&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House%20Press%20Secretary"&gt;Press Secretary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Snow"&gt;Tony Snow&lt;/a&gt; says that "They (the scientists) believe it is a strain of low pathogenicity, similar to strains that have been seen before in North America."

Snow also added that "this [case] is not what we're accustomed to hearing about from &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;."

"Test results thus far indicate this is low pathogenicity avian influenza, which poses no threat to human health. Routine surveillance has indicated the presence of H5 and N1 avian influenza subtypes in samples from two wild mute swans in Michigan," said a statement on the United States Department of Agriculture's (&lt;a href="w%3AUSDA"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;) website.

The statement also went on to say that the swans "did not show signs of sickness" and that the swans were infected with "two separate" strains of Avian Flu.

"It is possible that these birds were not infected with an H5N1 strain, but instead with two separate avian influenza viruses, one containing H5 and the other containing N1," said the statement.

"This is not the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that has spread through much of other parts of the world. We do not believe this virus represents a risk to human health," said USDA's Animal and Plant Health inspector, Ron DeHaven.

Health officials are remaining "remaining vigilant and prepared," said Department of Health and Human Services science advisor, Dr. William Raub.

Further tests will be done to confirm that there is in fact a virus there and what type and are expected sometime today.

"The confirmatory testing underway at NVSL will clarify whether one or more strains of the virus are present, the specific subtype, as well as pathogenicity," said that statement but also said that it could take "up to two weeks and will be made public when completed." The statement also said that the "testing suggests" the strain is of low pathogenicity, but that these tests do "not confirm" the findings.

The virus turned up two times in the U.S. The first case was in &lt;a href="w%3A1971"&gt;1971&lt;/a&gt; and the second in &lt;a href="w%3A1986"&gt;1986&lt;/a&gt;. In both cases, the virus turned up in wild ducks.

Hours after the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberation%20Tigers%20of%20Tamil%20Eelam"&gt;Tamil Tigers&lt;/a&gt; threatened to bomb civilians in &lt;a href="w%3AColombo"&gt;Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful bomb went off. The device is thought to be a &lt;a href="w%3Aland%20mine"&gt;fragmentation mine&lt;/a&gt;. Seven people were killed and seventeen injured in the explosion, and it came hours after Sri Lanka's military carried out an air-raid that killed dozens.

The blast occurred within a mile of the official home of President &lt;a href="w%3AMahinda%20Rajapakse"&gt;Mahinda Rajapakse&lt;/a&gt;. A convoy with the &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; ambassador was travelling on the road as explosion occurred, but he was unhurt.

"Definitely it's an LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] attack to the Pakistan ambassador's car but they missed and the backup vehicle got caught," a Sri lankan military spokesman said. The Pakistani ambassador may be a target of the Tigers as Pakistan has backed the &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Sri%20Lanka"&gt;government of Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; diplomatically.

In the past few days, there have been fierce hostilities between government forces and Tamil Tigers in the north and the east of the country.

The Tamil Tigers are a military and political group that has waged a violent secessionist campaign against Sri Lanka’s government since the 1970s. Their aim is to secure self-government for the traditional Tamil regions in the north and east of Sri Lanka.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The preliminary hearing for a lawsuit filed against the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; as well as the City of Buffalo has been postponed indefinitely and will take place "as needed" pending the resubmission of the proposal by Savarino Construction also of Buffalo. A request was made to New York State Supreme court Judge Justice Rose Sconiers, the judge to preside over the case, to discuss a "timetable" for resubmission, but the court "decided not to," said attorney Arthur Giacalone who represents the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

The hotel would require the demolition of at least five properties, 1109-1121 Elmwood and would cause the closure of several businesses. Already, two businesses, Skunk Tail Glass and Six Nations Native American Gift Shop have relocated, outside the Elmwood Strip. Don apparel, H.O.D. Tattoo and Mondo Video still remain on Elmwood; however, Mondo Video is planning on moving to a new location. The hotel will be 72 rooms and will cost at least 7 million dollars to build. Wyndham Hotels is expected to be the owner/operator of the hotel. The properites are currently owned by Hans Mobius. Two other properties, 605 and 607 Forest might also be part of the proposal. 605 Forest is owned by Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo. 607 Forest is owned by Mobius.

"There's no new [court] date. The next appearance will be as needed," said Giacalone.

The proposal was withdrawn by Savarino on July 13, 2006 to undergo "a do-over" and according to the ♡❤Buffalo News♡❤, "shed the lawsuits" against the proposal; however, so far the proposal has "not yet" been resubmitted, but could be in about a "week."

"With Council being out of session we have a bit of time [before resubmitting]. [We will] Probably resubmit] in a week or so," said Sam Savarino, CEO of Savarino Construction.

"We welcome some discourse on this project and while we realize that, in all likelihood, we will not make everybody happy, we hope we can develop a consensus that what we provide on that corner will be something that is an enhancement to the neighborhood and the community. Better to have that decided (again?) in a public forum and through the approval process than through a debate over points of law in a courtroom," added Savarino.

Despite the withdraw of the proposal, Giacalone states that the lawsuit his clients filed is still in effect due to the re-zoning of the properties, which he says are still in place and that he is "frustrated" that his client's "day in court" has been delayed continuously by Savarino and the city.

Savarino believes that the re-zoning of the properties are "not in effect" because the proposal was withdrawn. He also stated that he is "unsure" on a decision to request the rezoning again because the "city suggested" the rezoning "last time."

"We have pulled the request [proposal] so I would suppose it [the rezoning] is not in effect. We are as of yet unsure of whether or not to request rezoning of all the parcels. We are communicating with the City on this. You may recall that the City suggested this to us last time. We want to make sure we are doing the correct thing – and the proper thing. I am not sure whether I have a clear indication of that at this juncture," said Savarino.

Savarino was asked if the proposal was going to be resubmitted or not, but did not answer the question.

Giacalone states that there may be several resons as to why "a new application has not been filed. Is Savarino having a hard time coming to an agreement with Mobius? Has Wyndham Hotels backed out? Is Savarino negotiating with Pano to buy the [605] Forest Avenue property?"

Buffalo's Common Council is scheduled to meet on September 9, 2006 after Summer recess.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Erroneous%20newspaper%20report%20garners%20publicity%20for%20Moon%20landing%20tapes&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On August 5, Wikinews published an article, &lt;a href="Apollo%20Moon%20landings%20tapes%20reported%20missing"&gt;Apollo Moon landings tapes reported missing&lt;/a&gt;, based on a report in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald"&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/a&gt;. As highlighted in the prominent correction notice at the top of that article, several issues were present with the article.

Citing a letter to the Herald, a member of the team involved in the search for the missing tapes, Bill Wood, described their article as "great disservice to a group of &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n and &lt;a href="US"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Apollo%20program"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; tracking station veterans involved in a new search for better Apollo 11 EVA images.".

Mr. Wood pointed out that one of the tracking stations that these tapes had been recorded at was hosting a detailed description of the process Earth-side. Written by John Sarkissian of the &lt;a href="w%3ACSIRO%20Parkes%20Observatory"&gt;CSIRO Parkes Observatory&lt;/a&gt; it gave a fascinating glimpse into what was done to show the world &lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Armstong"&gt;Neil Armstong&lt;/a&gt; stepping onto the Moon's surface.

What Bill Wood, John Sarkissian, and their other former Apollo 11 colleagues are trying to track down are the recording of what was broadcast from the Moon, referred to as Slow-Scan TV (SSTV). This raw data was recorded onto 1" wide magnetic tapes at the same time as it was converted for terrestrial TV broadcast. As far as the paper trail goes, there are about 700 boxes that might contain these coveted tapes. They are mixed in with recordings from the entire Apollo era, meaning there is a lot of footage that, with modern techiques, could offer far clearer pictures of man's first visits to another celestial body. While John Sarkissian's report points out that everyone thinks we have footage of the first moonwalk, modern techiques would, if the tapes are found before they deteriorate, allow these raw data tapes to be turned into far higher quality pictures than before seen by the public.

Of course, proving that any publicity is good publicity, Mr. Wood didn't restrict himself to contacting Wikinews. Getting the right story out is important for these folks, and Leonard David, a Senior space writer with &lt;a href="w%3AMSNBC"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt; helped give some impetus to the search with an article; help because the search is focussing not on the tapes, but on the people who might know where they, or the paperwork leading to them, might be. Time isn't working in favour of the volunteers searching for the SSTV tapes, part of the Goddard center is scheduled to close in October. Not the entire center as previously reported, but the Data Evaluation Laboratory. This is the one place where all the equipment and expertise exists to process these tapes, if they are found before they deteriorate.

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam accused the &lt;a href="w%3AMilitary%20of%20Sri%20Lanka"&gt;air force of Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; of deliberately bombing an &lt;a href="w%3Aorphanage"&gt;orphanage&lt;/a&gt;, killing 50-60 children and injuring 150 more. The Tigers said that the victims were between the ages of 15 and 18 and were attending a first aid seminar. The air strike in took place in the rebel-controlled northern district of &lt;a href="w%3AMullaitivu"&gt;Mullaitivu&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Province%2C%20Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Northern Province&lt;/a&gt; of Sri Lanka.

The military denied the charges that they bombed an orphanage. They say that they can prove that it was training camp for the Tamil Tigers. The air raid was in support of government ground troops that are fighting rebels who are advancing on the &lt;a href="w%3AJaffna"&gt;Jaffna&lt;/a&gt; peninsula.

"It is a lie to say that schoolchildren were targeted," government spokesperson Chandrapala Liyanage told the AFP news agency. "The air force had bombed a LTTE training centre. We don't know if they had moved child soldiers there." 

Since the early 1980s, there has been an ongoing ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka between the Sri Lankan government and members of the Tamil ethnic group in the northeast of the island. A ceasefire was declared in 2002, but violence has continued despite this.

Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt; did not attend the &lt;a href="w%3AXVI%20International%20AIDS%20Conference%2C%202006"&gt;16th International AIDS Conference in Toronto&lt;/a&gt;. This is now drawing criticism from event organizers.

Harper said earlier when he was in the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20federal%20election%2C%202006"&gt;Canadian federal election, 2006&lt;/a&gt;, that he was not going to attend the AIDS conference. It is not known why he didn't want to attend.

"We are dismayed that the prime minister of Canada, Mr. Stephen Harper, is not here this evening," &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Wainberg"&gt;Dr. Mark Wainberg&lt;/a&gt; said at the &lt;a href="w%3ARogers%20Centre"&gt;Rogers Centre&lt;/a&gt; on yesterday. "Mr. Harper, the role of prime minister includes the responsibility to show leadership on the world stage. Your absence sends a message that you do not regard &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt; as a critical priority and clearly all of us here tonight disagree with you,” Wainberg said. 

Wainberg was one of the first to speak and criticized the prime minister for missing the event.

Harper instead chose to tour the Arctic aboard a naval ship. He received many boos from the audience at the mention of his name, including a remark by &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Gere"&gt;Richard Gere&lt;/a&gt; (an American actor and a speaker at the event). A group near the stage stood up and chanted "Where is Harper?"

Canada's health minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Clement"&gt;Tony Clement&lt;/a&gt; defended the prime minister's absence, saying it doesn't mean a lack of commitment in the fight against AIDS.

Tony Clement said the federal government has adequate representation at the international conference and it is committed to helping people around the world through an access-to-medicine program.

&lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;'s condition has worsened according to officials at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center where the former &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; prime minister is being treated.

A new brain scan shows a deterioration in function according to hospital spokesperson Anat Dolev. His urine output has fallen and a chest scan indicates a new infection.

Ms. Dolev would not say whether Sharon's life was in danger.

Sharon, 78, has been in a &lt;a href="w%3Acoma"&gt;coma&lt;/a&gt; since his &lt;a href="w%3Astroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; on Jan. 4 and his doctors have said his chances of recovery are very slim.

&lt;a href="w%3ANigeria"&gt;Nigerian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACameroon"&gt;Cameroonian&lt;/a&gt; officials held a joint ceremony to mark the formal handover of the &lt;a href="w%3ABakassi%20peninsula"&gt;Bakassi peninsula&lt;/a&gt; from Nigeria to Cameroon. Nigeria agreed to cede the resource-rich area after a long drawn dispute with Cameroon. The ceremony comes after Nigeria completed the withdrawal of its troop stationed in the northern part of the peninsula. Many Bakassi residents are reported to be opposed to living under Cameroon's authority. 

<h2>Long-drawn dispute</h2>
The resource-rich Bakassi peninsula was claimed by both Nigeria and Cameroon, leading to military clashes between the two back in 1981. 
In 1994, Cameroon approached the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;International Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt;(ICJ) to rule on the claims, and the ICJ ruled in 2002 that the area belonged to Cameroon as per a 1913 treaty signed between then colonial powers &lt;a href="w%3ABritain"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Nigeria finally agreed to the handover in the UN brokered Greentree Agreement signed in New York on June 12th, which gave Nigeria 60 days to withdraw its military forces from the area. The agreement signed by Nigerian President &lt;a href="w%3AOlusegun%20Obasanjo"&gt;Olusegun Obasanjo&lt;/a&gt; and Cameroon's President &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Biya"&gt;Paul Biya&lt;/a&gt;, was the outcome of the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission, set up by Secretary-General &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; to address the issue.

<h2>Handover ceremony</h2>
The ceremony was held in the capital of northern Bakassi, the fishing town of Archibong, and was witnessed by &lt;a href="w%3AAfrican%20Union"&gt;African Union&lt;/a&gt;, British, French, German UN and US officials, as well as the Nigeria's chief of defence staff, General Martin-Luther Agwai, and the heads of the army, navy, airforce and the police. The Nigerian flag was lowered Cameroon flag was then raised. The Nigerian Justice Minister Bayo Ojo and his Cameroonian counterpart, Maurice Kamto signed the documents Monday transferring authority at exactly 12:30 pm (1130GMT).

Speaking at the event, Mr. Ojo said "We yield ground in order to give way to peace.", adding, "We have reason to celebrate the peaceful resolution of the Bakassi peninsula dispute". He tried to reassure Nigerians living in the peninsula, saying the transfer "does not not mean an end in itself. You still have the opportunity of living here if you choose to do so".

Mr. Kamto told the gathering ""We have the conviction that things will not be different in Bakassi, whose inhabitants have always co-existed in peace as they do in other locations and regions of Cameroon." 

Kieran Prendergast, representative of the UN secretary general at the event called the handover "a good example of taking initiative in conflict prevention and solution".

<h2>Local opposition</h2>
The population of Bakassi, mainly Nigerian are reported to be deeply unhappy over the transfer. After Nigeria began its troop withdrawal last week, a group called the Bakassi Self Determination Movement declared Bakassi's independence from both Nigeria and Cameroon. The group hoisted blue and white flags and declared the creation of the "Democratic Republic of Bakassi". 

Speaking to the IRIN news agency on Monday, the leader of the group, Tony Ene insisted on the "natural right" of Bakassi residents to "determine our future,", adding that "If Nigeria does not want us, we choose to go it alone and not with Cameroon.".

Some residents have said that they will fight Cameroonian authority and called for help from militants in the Niger delta region. Complaints by Bakassi Nigerians of harassment by Cameroonian police years ago had led to the deployment of Nigerian troops in the region. Many residents have said that they wish to evacuate the area rather than live under Cameroon.

<h2>Cameroon welcomes transfer</h2>
The Cameroon state broadcaster, Cameroon Radio and Television said "Today is a beautiful day for Cameroon... (and) Nigeria," adding that the handover "demonstrated the good faith of Cameroonian and Nigerian authorities to do everything to ensure that their two peoples can continue to live in peace and harmony in Bakassi,". 

Reuters also reports Cameroonians in &lt;a href="w%3AYaounde"&gt;Yaounde&lt;/a&gt; as welcoming the transfer.

<h2>Violation of terms by Cameroon alleged</h2>
The Nigerian Newspaper, ♡❤The Daily Champion♡❤ reports that several villages in the peninsula were "taken over" by Cameroonian security agents prior to today's formal handover, violating the terms of the handover agreement. The Lagos-based daily reported Brigadier General Felix Chukwuma, a spokesman for the Nigerian Army saying that higher authorities in Nigeria have been notified of this "violation of the UN-brokered agreement on the demilitarisation of the peninsula". "I am very positive that Nigeria would take this up at the appropriate level," he said.

<h2>Transition arrangement</h2>
Nigeria has given Bakassi residents the option of either staying on in Bakassi under Cameroonian authority or getting resettled elsewhere in Nigeria. Under the handover agreement, Nigeria retains civilian authority over the southern section of the peninsula, known as West Atabong and Akwabana for two more years, during which the resettlement can proceed. Cameroon is to take full administrative control after a five year transitional period, during which neither country is expected to allow military presence in the region.

The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for West Africa, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah has said that about a dozen UN civilian observers will monitor the situation following the troop withdrawal to "reassure" the locals of their safety under Cameroonian authority. 

The UN Office for West Africa has said in a statement that the next meeting of the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission will discuss how to delineate the maritime boundary between the two countries.

<h2>Resource-rich region</h2>
The 700 sq km Bakassi peninsula lies in the gulf of Guinea, which is estimated to contain up to 10% of the world's oil and gas reserves as well as being a rich fishing ground. The peninsula is estimated to be home to between 150,000 and 300,000 people.

The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam accused the air force of Sri Lanka of deliberately bombing an orphanage, killing 50-60 children and injuring 150 more.

<h1>Virginia incumbent, Senator George Allen, accused of racism by Democratic hopeful</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Virginia%20incumbent%2C%20Senator%20George%20Allen%2C%20accused%20of%20racism%20by%20Democratic%20hopeful&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

On Monday, August 14th, 2006, tensions boiled over between the two party candidates in Virginia's 2006 US Senate election.

Democratic challenger &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20H.%20Webb"&gt;James Webb&lt;/a&gt; accused Republican incumbent &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Felix%20Allen"&gt;George Allen&lt;/a&gt; of making derogatory comments to a Webb volunteer, an Indian American who was videotaping the Allen campaign. On Friday, August 11th, 20-yr-old S.R. Sidarth, currently attending the University of Virginia, was documenting a campaign stop in Breaks, Virginia. In the midst of a campaign speech, Allen paused and singled out the college student.

"This fellow here over here with the yellow shirt, Macaca, or whatever his name is. He's with my opponent. He's following us around everywhere. And it's just great. We're going to places all over Virginia, and he's having it on film and its great to have you here and you show it to your opponent because he's never been there and probably will never come," Allen said.

He continued, "Lets give a welcome to Macaca, here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia."

There is some uncertainty as to whether the comments were intended to be racist or not.

The term '&lt;a href="w%3AMacaque"&gt;macaca&lt;/a&gt;,' if spelled as such, refers to a type of monkey, which could be termed very offensive, but Allen's campaign maintains that the word was used in reference to Sidarth's apparent mohawk.

Additionally, the Webb campaign was offended that Allen would presume that the color of their volunteer's skin implied he was an immigrant, as Sidarth was born and raised in &lt;a href="w%3AFairfax%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Fairfax County&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, Allen insists that the comment was not meant to imply immigrant status, and was simply an address to the Webb campaign at large.

Political analysts fear that this mistake may jeopardize the senate race, as well as an Allen presidential bid.

<h1>Two Fox News journalists kidnapped in Gaza</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Two%20Fox%20News%20journalists%20kidnapped%20in%20Gaza&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="Palestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; gunmen have reportedly kidnapped two foreign journalists working for &lt;a href="w%3AFox%20News"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, a news company owned by parent-company &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corp"&gt;News Corp&lt;/a&gt;.

A Palestinian witness who worked with the journalists, said that &lt;a href="USA"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Centanni"&gt;Steve Centanni&lt;/a&gt;, and Olaf Wiig, a cameraman from &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; were taken against their will.

&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20Trade"&gt;New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade&lt;/a&gt; spokeswoman Helen Tunnah said that the ministry had not received any information on the kidnapping. 

Fox News said that they did not know who captured the journalists but said that "We can confirm that two of our people were taken against their will in &lt;a href="w%3AGaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;," and that "negotiations were under way to secure their release."

The incident began when two vehicles blocked the transmission truck, labelled 'TV', and their bodyguard was forced to the ground at gunpoint by a masked man. 

The gunman then drove away with the journalists.

Palestinian police stopped and searched cars. &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AIslam"&gt;Islamic&lt;/a&gt; militant group that heads Gaza's government, did not claim responsibility, and condemned the kidnapping. There are no claims for responsibility at this time.

Fox News Vice President &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Moody"&gt;John Moody&lt;/a&gt; said in an internal message to Fox News personnel that "The rumors are true: two of our employees have been abducted in Gaza. We will report this fact via our Israel correspondents. Do NOT do any other segments on it. Do not book guests on this topic. Do not comment officially and of course, not on the air, about it. DO pray for their release. I will keep you posted."

South Korean foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3ABan%20Ki%20Moon"&gt;Ban Ki Moon&lt;/a&gt; and UN undersecretary &lt;a href="w%3AShashi%20Tharoor"&gt;Shashi Tharoor&lt;/a&gt; of India are the early leaders in the race to succeed &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASecretary%20General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations"&gt;Secretary-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; who retires at the end of this year. 

In late July the 15 members of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;Security Council&lt;/a&gt; conducted a secret straw poll on who should succeed Annan. Monday's edition of the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Guardian"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ newspaper reports the leaked results which have Ban leading with 12 "encourages", 1 "discourage" and 2 "no opinions" ahead of Tharoor's 10 "encourages", 2 "discourages" and 3 "no opinions". The other two official candidates thus far are Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ASurakiart%20Sathirathai"&gt;Surakiart Sathirathai&lt;/a&gt; and former U.N. disarmament chief &lt;a href="w%3AJayantha%20Dhanapala"&gt;Jayantha Dhanapala&lt;/a&gt; from Sri Lanka. Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AGoh%20Chok%20Tong"&gt;Goh Chok Tong&lt;/a&gt; of Singapore is also a possible contender, according to ♡❤the Guardian♡❤ but has not officially declared his interest. 

Prime Minister &lt;a href="Helen%20Clark"&gt;Helen Clark&lt;/a&gt; of New Zealand dismissed a report, Monday, that she was lobbying for the position calling it "a piece of fiction". The ♡❤New Zealand Herald♡❤ reported in its weekend edition that Clark had sought support for her possible candidacy from British Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; during a recent visit to London.

Coincidentally, Ban was in Auckland Monday seeking New Zealand's support for his bid. New Zealand Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3AWinston%20Peters"&gt;Winston Peters&lt;/a&gt; met with Ban but made no public comment on his country's position on the contest. 

Traditionally, the position of Secretary-General rotates among the continents suggesting that Annan's successor will likely be an Asian, the first since &lt;a href="w%3AU%20Thant"&gt;U Thant&lt;/a&gt; filled the post from 1961 to 1971.

&lt;a href="w%3APepsiCo"&gt;PepsiCo Inc.&lt;/a&gt; is in line to get its first female chief executive before the end of the year. Steven S. Reinemund, chairman and CEO of the U.S. soft drink and snack food giant, announced his retirement via press release effective in May, 2007. Reinemund, 58, said he was leaving to spend more time with his family.

The same PepsiCo release confirmed that &lt;a href="w%3AIndra%20Nooyi"&gt;Indra Nooyi&lt;/a&gt;, currently president and CFO, will take over for Reinemund. Nooyi's current position will be split in two. The first is scheduled to be filled by Richard Goodman, 57, currently CFO of PepsiCo International, who will become CFO. Hugh Johnston, 44, currently senior vice president of transformation, was promoted to the newly created post of executive vice president of operations, procurement and information technology.

Nooyi, 50, is a &lt;a href="w%3AYale%20University"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;-educated daughter of a middle class Indian family, according to her official biography. She is scheduled to succeed Reinemund, in October, the company said. Reinemund reportedly will stay with PepsiCo until May, 2007. Together, Nooyi and Reinemund have guided PepsiCo through several large take-overs and has seen the company overtake &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Coca-Cola%20Company"&gt;The Coca-Cola Company&lt;/a&gt; both in terms of sales and market value. 

Coca-Cola is still the No. 1 soft drink maker based on U.S. and global market share. A significant portion of PepsiCo's sales revenue comes from non-drink brands in its &lt;a href="w%3AFrito-Lay"&gt;Frito-Lay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AQuaker%20Oats%20Company"&gt;Quaker Oats&lt;/a&gt; product lines.

Some on Wall Street were surprised by Reinemund's retirement announcement, according to news reports. Monday, the stock (ticker:PEP) closed up $0.62 at $63.95 per share on the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Stock%20Exchange"&gt;NYSE&lt;/a&gt;.

Last week, &lt;a href="w%3ACyprus"&gt;Cypriot authorities&lt;/a&gt; released British soldier Allan Ford from a prison in Cyprus despite protests from &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Danish authorities&lt;/a&gt;. Allan Ford was one of three &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; soldiers serving life sentences for the brutal murder of 23-year-old Dane Louise Jensen, a tourist guide. Still serving, are fellow soldiers Justin Fowler and Geoff Pernell. Jensen's family and Danish authorities appealed Cyprus to reconsider the decision but it was in vain.

In 1994, after a &lt;a href="w%3Abinge%20drinking"&gt;drinking binge&lt;/a&gt;, the three soldiers came upon Louise Jensen and her boyfriend, who were on motorcycle. With their jeep, the soldiers struck the pair and abducted Jensen. They then sexually abused her and killed her with strikes to the head from a spade.

Allan Ford, Justin Fowler and Geoff Pernell were subsequently convicted to life in prison and discharged from the military. In 1998, the sentence was reduced to 25 years after an appeal case. Now, after serving 12 years the Cypriotic authorities have decided to release them with time off for good behavior and remission. To avoid a public outrage similar to that of 1994, the three will be released separately. Allan Ford was released last week and quietly spirited away to the United Kingdom. Justin Fowler and Geoff Pernell are scheduled to be released later this month.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACanberra%2C%20Australia"&gt;Canberra, Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister of Australia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, has announced new measures to alleviate the impact of rising global oil prices on Australians. They include grants of up to $2,000 to switch to &lt;a href="w%3ALiquified%20petroleum%20gas"&gt;LPG&lt;/a&gt;, and $17.2 million over three years to improve &lt;a href="w%3ACommon%20ethanol%20fuel%20mixtures"&gt;E10 blend ethanol fuel&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure.

Speaking in &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20House%2C%20Canberra"&gt;Parliament House&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister outlined the cause of higher &lt;a href="w%3APetrol"&gt;petrol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADiesel"&gt;diesel&lt;/a&gt; prices as a consequence of increasing global demand for oil occurring at a time when additional supply is tight. He singled out the re-emergence of &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; as a major factor in the increase in demand, and underinvestment as the main reason that supply cannot be increased rapidly.

The Prime Minister once again said he would not lower fuel &lt;a href="w%3AExcise"&gt;excises&lt;/a&gt;, saying that any benefit that might bring would be quickly devoured by further rises in global oil prices, and would leave a large hole in the Federal budget.

He announced that the $1,000 grant to purchases of new vehicles equipped to run on LPG would be brought forward from 2011 to be effective immediately. In addition, he announced that conversions of private vehicles to LPG would be eligible for a $2,000 grant, also effective immediately. 

LPG is much cheaper than petrol in Australia, partly due to concessional tax treatment. The Prime Minister said that a six cylinder vehicle that travels 15,000 &lt;a href="w%3AKilometre"&gt;kilometres&lt;/a&gt; in a year would save $27 per week at current prices if converted from petrol to LPG. With the $2,000 grant, the conversion would pay for itself in four months.

The cost of the eight-year program to convert vehicles from petrol to LPG, including lost excise revenue, is estimated to be $1.3 billion.

On the &lt;a href="w%3AEthanol"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt; front, the Prime Minister announced a further $17.2 million dollars over three years to help petrol retailers install or convert pumps for &lt;a href="w%3ACommon%20ethanol%20fuel%20mixtures"&gt;E10 blends&lt;/a&gt;. Eligible petrol stations will receive up to $10,000 towards the cost of conversion or installation, once complete, and an additional $10,000 when sales targets are met.

The Prime Minister also made mention of remote communities that rely on diesel for their electricity supply. He said that the existing Renewable Remote Power Generation Programme has helped remote communities reduce their reliance on diesel, through the use of renewable energy services like &lt;a href="w%3AWind%20turbine"&gt;wind turbines&lt;/a&gt;. He announced that the Government will extend this programme with an additional $123.5 million over four years, and will now include energy efficiency projects.

The Prime Minister also committed an additional $135.4 million over the next five years for exploration services, searching for new oil, &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20gas"&gt;natural gas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGeothermal%20power"&gt;geothermal&lt;/a&gt; reserves.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APremier%20of%20Ontario"&gt;premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Rae"&gt;Bob Rae&lt;/a&gt; received a boost today in his bid to win the leadership of the federal &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Liberal Party of Canada&lt;/a&gt; when rival candidate &lt;a href="w%3AMaurizio%20Bevilacqua"&gt;Maurizio Bevilacqua&lt;/a&gt; announced he was dropping out of the race in order to back Rae.

"I'm convinced that Bob Rae is the best person to lead the Liberal Party to victory. He has the experience and the intelligence and the vision to lead Canada into the 21st century," Mr. Belivacqua said at a news conference, Monday.

Bevilacqua is a six-term Liberal MP representing the riding of &lt;a href="w%3AVaughan%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Vaughan, Ontario&lt;/a&gt; and was seen as a centrist on economic issues.

His departure leaves 10 candidates who will vie for the position at the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Party%20of%20Canada%20leadership%20convention%2C%202006"&gt;Liberal leadership convention&lt;/a&gt; being held this December in Montreal.

Bevilacqua, 46, had had trouble raising money in the campaign and was thought to be trailing the other candidates. He fell behind the front-runners in the race in terms of raising money and wooing support from senior Liberals. He now becomes national co-chair of Rae's campaign as well as his economic advisor. 

Rae is considered a front-runner in the race to succeed &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Martin"&gt;Paul Martin&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Ignatieff"&gt;Michael Ignatieff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGerard%20Kennedy"&gt;Gerard Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AStephane%20Dion"&gt;Stephane Dion&lt;/a&gt;. Rae, a former leader of the provincial &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20New%20Democratic%20Party"&gt;New Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt; joined the Liberals in April after months of speculation about his possible candidacy. The winner of the December convention becomes &lt;a href="w%3ALeader%20of%20the%20Official%20Opposition%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Leader of the Official Opposition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AStephen%20Harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20of%20Canada"&gt;Conservative&lt;/a&gt; government.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria, Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Crime statistics released on Monday by Victoria Police show that Victoria is seeing an increase in fuel theft, much like &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%2C%20Australia"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; has recently experienced.

In the past year, petrol drive-off offences have increased by 41.6%, from 5,038 in 2004-05 to 7,135 in 2005-06. There has also been a large increase in number plate thefts, 31.9% in the past year. These thefts allow concealment of vehicle registration numbers during the commission of drive-off offenses.

Police Chief Commissioner, Christine Nixon, has said that new initiatives are being introduced to control the growing problem. "In particular we have recently introduced the 'safe plates' initiative which encourages the use of one-way screws on number plates", she said. 

The slotted head of the screw allows an installer to turn the screw tighter for fastening the license plate in place, but the screw cannot be backed out with a screwdriver because the slot is shorn off in the direction needed to loosen the screw.

"Jeremy", an airplane pilot in &lt;a href="w%3ANelson%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, has put his uniform on sale for &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;1.00 at New Zealand auction site &lt;a href="w%3ATradeMe"&gt;TradeMe&lt;/a&gt;. The pilot had lost his job when &lt;a href="w%3AOrigin%20Pacific%20Airways"&gt;Origin Pacific Airways&lt;/a&gt; fired 230 staff because of financial difficulties and is now trying to "make ends meet this week," the pilot said. The auction has already reached 31 bids and reached $101 as of 7.30 a.m. August 15.

'Jeremy', the pilot, said on the auction page, that he is offering "a rare piece of Kiwi aviation history,".

"This is an authentic Origin Pacific Jetstream pilot's uniform lovingly drycleaned for one last time before its unfortunate retirement. It's travelled many stormy nights and many sunrises and has seen almost 50,000 Kiwis safely to their destinations from Invercargill to the Far North. It has 778,000km on it, yet it looks as crisp today as it did when it was born," the pilot described on TradeMe.

One bidder had offered $40 if he sold the uniform immediately but that offer was turned down in order to see the auction go until Sunday. 

David Collier, Origin Pacific passenger services general manager, said "The uniform was Origin Pacific's property and the pilot should not be selling it, but I think it's probably one of those things you'd have to grin at and move on."

Jay, Waitakere, asked on the auction page if the uniform came with a plane. The pilot replied "No, but if you want to start an airline I know where you can find a great bunch of people."

The auction is closing on August 20, Sunday.

Recent heavy hailstorms occurring at approximately 4 o'clock in the afternoon today left parts of Sydney with the appearance of being snowed in, with thick blankets of hail covering streets and sidewalks with layers of hail.

The hail was observed in the Central Business District of Sydney, where cars were observed -- possibly sheltering from the worst of the downfall -- under awnings on Paramatta Road, and areas in the Inner West.

The Bureau of Meteorology's Sydney Harbour weather station recorded a drop in temperature with the storm: at 4pm the temperature was 17 degrees Celsius, while the temperature reached a low at 11 degrees half an hour later.

Solar Systems Pty Ltd, &lt;a href="w%3AHawthorn%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Hawthorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, have announced an agreement with &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20Australia"&gt;Boeing Australia Ltd&lt;/a&gt; for supply of &lt;a href="w%3ABoeing%20Satellite%20Systems"&gt;Spectrolab&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASolar%20cell"&gt;solar cells&lt;/a&gt;. The agreement will result in the supply of 500,000 cells, capable of generating 11&lt;a href="w%3AMegawatt"&gt;MW&lt;/a&gt; of electricity.

Spectrolab produces multi-junction solar cells, originally designed for powering satellites. The solar cells are three times more efficient than the cells used in typical domestic solar panels, and are capable of converting light energy to electrical energy with up to 34% efficiency according to &lt;a href="w%3ANREL"&gt;NREL's&lt;/a&gt; National Centre for Photovoltaics. Solar Systems utilise Spectrolab's multi-junction solar cells to increase the output of their dish systems.

Solar Systems have already trialed the cells in one of their CS500 concentrating solar dishes installed at a solar power station in &lt;a href="w%3AHermannsburg%2C%20Northern%20Territory"&gt;Hermannsburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Australia"&gt;Central Australia&lt;/a&gt;, established to reduce the consumption of diesel in the remote community. Simply replacing the existing cells with the Spectrolab multi-junction solar cells increased output from 24&lt;a href="w%3AKilowatt"&gt;kW&lt;/a&gt; to 34kW.

Solar Systems is planning to use the technology in a solar power station it will build in northern Victoria, with a capacity of 154MW.

A &lt;a href="w%3AJapan"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; tanker has spilled an estimated 4,500 tonnes (1.4 million gallons) of &lt;a href="w%3Acrude%20oil"&gt;crude oil&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern &lt;a href="Indian%20Ocean"&gt;Indian Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, after colliding with a cargo ship, which it was trying to assist, the tanker's owners report. 

A statement released by &lt;a href="w%3AMitsui%20O.S.K.%20Lines"&gt;Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, the owners of the tanker, Bright Artemis said that the tanker was attempting to rescue the crew of the distressed &lt;a href="w%3ASingapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;-registered cargo ship, Amar, when the two vessels came in contact about 470 km (290 miles) west of the &lt;a href="w%3AGreat%20Nicobar"&gt;Great Nicobar Island&lt;/a&gt; in the Indian Ocean at 1:00 p.m., (3:00 p.m. JST) on Monday. The collision opened a gash 1 meter in height and 5 meters in length on the single-hulled tanker's starboard side, spilling its crude oil cargo. The statement said that the spill has been contained, the crew of the Amar are safe on board another rescue vessel and no other injuries have been reported. 

The tanker reported the location of the incident as 5'46"N, 89'04"E and the cargo ship Amar was on fire when the incident happened, said the statement. It added that oil has been transferred from the damaged tanks to other tanks, the tanker is proceeding east at a reduced speed and that the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore and the Indian Coast Guard have been informed of the incident.

The Bright Armetis was manned by a crew of 23 including Croatians, Filipinos and a Canadian and was carrying close to 250,000 tonnes of crude oil from the Persian gulf to Japan, according to the company. 

Indian Coast Guard officials told Reuters news agency that the spill lies outside India's exclusive economic zone and that they are watching the situation closely.

Bloomberg reports that shares of Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. fell as much as 4.3% upon news of the event. Mitsui is Japan's second-largest shipping company.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; brokered cease-fire between &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; is largely holding as Israel has begun to withdraw its forces from &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201701"&gt;UNSC Resolution 1701&lt;/a&gt;, which calls for a "full cessation of hostilities" in the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;Israeli-Lebanon war&lt;/a&gt;, was passed by the UN Security Council last Friday and was approved by Lebanon and Israel over the weekend. 

Lebanon's defence minister, &lt;a href="w%3AElias%20Murr"&gt;Elias Murr&lt;/a&gt;, says that the 15,000 troops Lebanon has committed to the peacekeeping operation will be on the north side of the Litani River by the end of the week. As part of the truce agreement, they must cross the river and exercise control over what has been Hezbollah controlled territory in southern Lebanon.

The head of the Israeli army says the &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;IDF&lt;/a&gt; could complete its withdrawal from Lebanon in 7 to 10 days. 

The new international peace-keeping force may number as many as 15,000, significantly larger than the existing force of 2,000, known as &lt;a href="w%3AUNIFIL"&gt;UNIFIL&lt;/a&gt;, which is expected to take up border positions in the mean time. The UN hopes for an advance force of up to 3,500 within the next 10 to 14 days. &lt;a href="w%3AFrance"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, who is expected to lead the international force, is seeking a clearer mandate from the UN on the rules of engagement.

Over 1,200 people have lost their lives in the conflict. 1,110, mostly civilians, have died in Lebanon and 157 Israelis, mostly military, were killed. Israel says it killed 530 Hezbollahh fighters while Hezbollah puts the toll at about 80.

Former &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; prime minster &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, 78, has developed double &lt;a href="w%3Apneumonia"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and is being treated with "massive" amounts of antibiotics according to hospital officials.

"We are talking about pneumonia that is being treated with massive antibiotics. There is no change in the functioning of the brain tissue and no significant fall in vital signs," said officials at Tel Hashomer hospital in the Sheba Medical Center located in &lt;a href="w%3ATel%20Aviv"&gt;Tel Aviv&lt;/a&gt;, in a statement today.

Yesterday doctors stated that Sharon's urine ouput had "decreased significantly" and that a scan of his brain "showed a deterioration in his brain function," said Anat Dolev, a Sheba Medical Center spokesman.

Yesterday the hospital reported that the condition of Sharon was getting worse.

Sharon has been in a coma since suffering a major stroke on January 4. Since being admitted to the hospital, he has undergone several rounds of surgery on his brain in an attempt to stop bleeding. Currently a respirator assists him in breathing.

&lt;a href="w%3ADell"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;, the world's largest manufactuer of home computers, is recalling 4.1 million lithium batteries used in laptop computers because of the risk of their bursting into flame. There have been at least six incidents since December of laptops catching fire because of overheated batteries.

The &lt;a href="w%3AConsumer%20Product%20Safety%20Commission"&gt;Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt; in the United States says it is the largest recall of electronic products in its history. Scott Wolfson, spokesperson for the CPSC, says the affected laptops should only be run off of a power cord and not the battery. Dell says that the computers are safe to use if the batteries are removed entirely. 

At risk are those Dell Latitude, Inspiron, XPS and Precision laptops shipped between April 2004 and July 2006.

"In rare cases, a short-circuit could cause the battery to overheat, causing a risk of smoke and or fire," said Dell spokesman Ira Williams. 

"It happens in rare cases but we opted to take this broad action immediately." 

Customers with concerns can call a special toll free number, 1-866-342-0011 or go to http://www.dellbatteryprogram.com to determine if their batteries are subject to the recall.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Experiment%20on%20frozen%20sperm%20raises%20hopes%20of%20%26quot%3Brestoring%26quot%3B%20extinct%20mammals&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

According to &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese and &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; scientists, healthy offspring have resulted from the injection of &lt;a href="w%3Asperm"&gt;sperm&lt;/a&gt; into female mice from male mice that have been in a deep freeze for 15 years. The mice, as a whole, were kept frozen in temperatures of -20 degrees celsius. 

Scientists at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research Bioresource Center which is located in &lt;a href="w%3ATsukuba%2C%20Japan"&gt;Tsukuba, Japan&lt;/a&gt;, say that cryogenic techniques were not used and that the mice were kept in a freezer.

Scientists also say that the sperm was not alive when it was thawed out. At least one out of every five females that were injected with the sperm, gave birth to healthy offspring which are also fertile.

"Obviously, those frozen [sperm] were all dead in the conventional sense. Motionless sperm had no chance whatsoever of fertilising in vivo or in vitro. Nevertheless, some of these, if not all, were ... genomically intact, because they were able to produce apparently normal offspring," said the researchers.

The idea behind the experiment is that scientists say that the results now make it possible to bring back prehistoric animals or extinct animals such as the woolly mammoth, but because any fully intact body found would have been frozen for over 10,000 years and would likely be too damaged organisms and &lt;a href="w%3Abacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;s. Endangered species such as elephants could also be reproduced, but scientists also say that the chances of an experiment like that of being successful are still "slim."

"Restoration of extinct species could be possible if male individuals are found in permafrost. If sperm of extinct mammalian species, for example the &lt;a href="w%3Awoolly%20mammoth"&gt;woolly mammoth&lt;/a&gt;, can be retrieved from animal bodies that were kept frozen for millions of years in permanent frost, live animals might be restored by injecting them into oocytes [eggs] from females of closely related species," said Dr. Narumi Ogonuki, head of the team who made the discovery.

A recent study published in the latest issue of the scientific medical journal, &lt;a href="w%3AArchives%20of%20Internal%20Medicine"&gt;Archives of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt; reports on the potential use of a new drug &lt;a href="w%3Avarenicline"&gt;varenicline&lt;/a&gt; to help smokers &lt;a href="w%3Asmoking%20cessation"&gt;quit the habit&lt;/a&gt;. Varenicline received &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20and%20Drug%20Administration"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AApproved%20drug"&gt;approval&lt;/a&gt; for sale earlier this year.

&lt;a href="w%3ATobacco"&gt;Tobacco&lt;/a&gt; use remains the leading preventable cause of &lt;a href="w%3Adisease"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Adeath"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; as well as other Western countries. The addictive habit causes approximately 440,000 deaths in the U.S. each year and costs approximately $157 billion per annum in health-related economic losses. In 2000, 70 percent of those who smoked wanted to &lt;a href="w%3Asmoking%20cessation"&gt;quit smoking&lt;/a&gt;. Each year over half of all daily smokers try to quit. But long term success rates are generally not over 40 percent.

In a multicenter, randomized, &lt;a href="w%3ADouble-blind"&gt;double-blind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AClinical_study%23Phase_II"&gt;phase II clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, 638 men and women aged 18-65 who smoked an average of 10 cigarettes per day during the previous year, without a period of abstinence of more than 3 months, where put on &lt;a href="w%3APlacebo"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Abupropion"&gt;bupropion&lt;/a&gt; (another drug used as a smoking cessation aid, brand name Zyban), or different treatment schedules of varenicline for 7 weeks. Subjects were tested for continuous quitting by measuring exhaled &lt;a href="w%3Acarbon%20monoxide"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt;. After one year, the success rates were 14.4%, 6.3% and 4.9% for varenicline, bupropion and placebo, respectively.

Former &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President of the United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGerald%20Ford"&gt;Gerald Ford&lt;/a&gt;, 93, has been admitted to the &lt;a href="w%3AMayo%20Clinic"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota, tonight, for "testing and evaluation" according to a statement from his office.

"No further releases or updates are anticipated prior to early next week," the statement also said. When contacted, Ford's spokesman did not say what treatment he was getting at the clinic, and referred all other questions to the clinic.

John Murphy, the Mayo Clinic's spokesman, said only "I can verify that the statement is correct and I have no other additional information."

Ford's activity has diminished since he suffered two small strokes five years ago. The 38th president spent 12 days in hospital this past January suffering from pneumonia.

On Tuesday, at the &lt;a href="w%3AXVI%20International%20AIDS%20Conference%2C%202006"&gt;XVI International AIDS Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto, Canada, both former President &lt;a href="Bill%20Clinton"&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; founder/chairman &lt;a href="Bill%20Gates"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; defended President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush%20administration"&gt;Adminstation&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3APresident%27s%20Emergency%20Plan%20For%20AIDS%20Relief"&gt;PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt; program.

Clinton said that the United States is spending more to fight HIV than any other government. He did criticize the program, saying that 33% of PEPFAR funds are dedicated to abstinence-only programs. Clinton said he does not believe that abstinence-only programs work. Also, he spoke out against a US law that requires organizations that apply for PEPFAR funds to pledge to oppose prostitution.

"I wish they would just amend the law and say 'we disapprove of prostitution but here's the money - go save lives'," said Clinton.

"The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has done a great deal of good, and President Bush and his team deserve a lot of credit for it," Gates said.

PEPFAR, which Bush unveiled in 2003, is to spend $15 billion over five years in 15 target countries. It provides medicine to HIV patients, distributes condoms and funds programs run by many aid groups. It is the largest international health initiative in history initiated by one nation to address a single disease.

Six soldiers were injured, Tuesday, during a mortar attack on a &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; outpost in Afghanistan. None of the injuries sustained are life threatening, according to officials. 

One soldier was treated on base while five others were flown to a military hospital in &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;. Two of the soldiers are being kept for observation, the others were treated and released. 

The attack occurred at Forward Operating Base Wilson which is about 30 kilometres west of Kandahar in Zhari District Centre, an area that has been the target of recent &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; attacks. 
Canadian Press reports that according to its sources Taliban fighters from across southern &lt;a href="w%3AAfghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; have gathered in the area within the past 24 hours, preparing for battle with &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; and Afghan government forces.

Three &lt;a href="w%3AMexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; fishermen from the Mexican State of &lt;a href="w%3ANayarit"&gt;Nayarit&lt;/a&gt; have been found by a &lt;a href="w%3ATaiwan"&gt;Taiwanese&lt;/a&gt; tuna trawler near the &lt;a href="w%3AMarshall%20Islands"&gt;Marshall Islands&lt;/a&gt; after spending 9 months and 9 days at sea on a small open top fishing boat eating what ever fish and birds they could catch and drinking only rain water.

Experiencing problems with their two small outboard engines soon after departure from home port of &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Blas%2C%20Nayarit"&gt;San Blas&lt;/a&gt; on the Mexican &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Ocean"&gt;Pacific&lt;/a&gt; coast on October 9 last year, they drifted more than 5,000 miles (8000 km) west trying to call the attention of passing ships before being picked up by the Taiwanese trawler where they are currently being held.

In an interview with Mexican television station &lt;a href="w%3ATelevisa"&gt;Televisa&lt;/a&gt; one of the men commented:
♡❤"We ate raw sea gulls, ducks and fish. We ate everything raw [...] any fish that came near the boat we grabbed it and gulped it down"♡❤ one time going more than 15 days without food, but constant rain had kept them from thirsting. To keep up their spirit the three fishermen took turns reading the &lt;a href="w%3ABible"&gt;Bible&lt;/a&gt;.

The three men, Salvador Ordonez, Jesus Vidana and Lucio Rendon, had been presumed dead when their families were notified of their miraculous rescue.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt; 'Boobs on Bikes' parade for next weeks annual sex industry convention, Erotica Expo which features naked woman on motorcycles has been approved by Auckland City Council's events and promotion staff despite disapproval by Auckland Mayor, &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Hubbard"&gt;Dick Hubbard&lt;/a&gt; and 13 other Auckland City Council councillors.

The mayor and the other councillors have signed a petition to withdraw the permit. Hubbard said "I think such a parade down Queen Street is totally inappropriate because it's shamelessly promoting a pornography trade fair. It's particularly degrading to women."

However, the organiser of the expo, Steve Crow, says Mr Hubbard's opposition is morally based.

All other previous parades had been held informally. Steve Crow, organiser of the parade and expo said "He only asked the council and the police if they wished to be involved as a matter of courtesy, and the parade will go ahead regardless. It's legal under New Zealand law. They can basically go to hell; we're going to do it." Crow said the only reason they asked for permission this year is to have police involvement for spectators' safety.

A spokeswoman for the Mayor said "The proposed route for the tour would pass a kindergarten and school. It's the councillors that have got upset about it due to huge public reaction by people saying they didn't want it," the council has received numerous complaints to the parade.

Bob McCoskrie, Family First national director said "[We are] offering support for the topless porn girls by making bras and sweatshirts available. Typical of Auckland weather, there’s a high likelihood it’ll either be cold and/or wet. We’re genuinely concerned for their welfare and health."

The Councillors are meeting today, August 16, to try and withdraw the permit that gives the parade green lights throughout Queen Street. Their decision is due sometime late today.

<h1>UK seeks pardon for executed World War I soldiers</h1>

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Defence Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADes%20Browne"&gt;Des Browne&lt;/a&gt; has announced a plan to seek approval from Parliament to grant a group pardon to more than 300 British soldiers executed during the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20World%20War"&gt;First World War&lt;/a&gt; for offences such as cowardice and desertion. 

The proposed pardon will include the case of Pte. Harry Farr, whose family had appealed to the Defence Secretary to grant a full, posthumous pardon. The Ministry of Defence informed the family lawyers of the decision hours before making a public announcement. 

Farr's family members said in a statement that they were "overwhelmed".

The government proposes to pardon all those executed in World War I under the Army Act 1881 and the Indian Army Act 1911, for what are considered "battlefield offences", such as cowardice or desertion, which may have been influenced by the stress of the battle. The proposal involves several Commonwealth and former colonial countries whose troops also fought alongside British troops. Mr. Browne said that he intends to introduce a suitable amendment to the current Armed Forces Bill to request Parliament's approval.

Announcing the plan, Mr. Browne said, "I am conscious of how the families of these men feel today. They have had to endure a stigma for decades. [...] I believe it is appropriate to seek a statutory pardon."

<h2>Campaign to clear soldiers' names</h2>

Pte Farr's family have fought for 14 years to obtain a pardon, saying Farr's refusal to fight was a direct result of the mental stress caused by his experience in the trenches. They had argued that Pte. Farr was suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Ashell%20shock"&gt;shell shock&lt;/a&gt;, he should have not been sent back to the trenches and that the court martial was unfair because it did not take shell shock into consideration. 

In June 2004, Defence Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AGeoff%20Hoon"&gt;Geoff Hoon&lt;/a&gt; refused to grant a pardon to Pte Farr, but the family sought a judicial review. After a High Court ruled against a pardon, the family appealed to the Defence Secretary for a review of the case. In May 2005, a judge opined that there was "room for argument" that they had been wrongly refused a conditional posthumous pardon. A further hearing scheduled for October 2005 was delayed while Defence Secretary &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Reid"&gt;John Reid&lt;/a&gt; reconsidered the case. 

The Ministry of Defence said in June that Mr. Reid, who had earlier sympathised with the cause, was prepared to look at Pte Farr's case in the wider context of the whole posthumous pardon issue. 

Relatives of many soldiers convicted of desertion or cowardice have been calling for pardons since 1990 when the &lt;a href="w%3APublic%20Record%20Office"&gt;Public Record Office&lt;/a&gt; declassified case documents. Campaigners claimed that most of the soldiers were suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Apost-traumatic%20stress%20disorder"&gt;post-traumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt; brought on by their experience of &lt;a href="w%3Atrench%20warfare"&gt;trench warfare&lt;/a&gt; and that they were unrepresented or defended by those with no legal training at trial, where relevant medical history, including mental health, was ignored.

In 1993, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Major"&gt;John Major&lt;/a&gt; rejected an appeal for a pardon, while John Reid, Armed Forces Minister in July 1998, refused a request for all executed soldiers to be pardoned. The government had always said it would consider each case on its own merits.

Announcing the decision today, Mr. Browne said that he believed it was better to "acknowledge that injustices were clearly done in some cases, even if we cannot say which - and to acknowledge that all these men were victims of war.", adding that "I do not want to second guess the decisions made by commanders in the field, who were doing their best to apply the rules and standards of the time."

He said that 90 years after the events, the evidence doesn't exist to assess cases individually. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Mr. Browne said "We can't be in a situation morally where we cannot redress injustices because we don't have paperwork in relation to an individual case. But we can in other cases where we have some paperwork."

<h2>Private Harry Farr</h2>

Pte. Harry Farr was from &lt;a href="w%3AKensington"&gt;Kensington&lt;/a&gt; in London and enrolled in the &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Yorkshire%20Regiment"&gt;West Yorkshire Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, serving in France for two years. He saw fighting at Neuve-Chappelle, where his battalion was shelled repeatedly. In May 1915, he collapsed with &lt;a href="w%3Ashell%20shock"&gt;shell shock&lt;/a&gt; and was evacuated to &lt;a href="w%3ABoulogne"&gt;Boulogne&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to see action in the &lt;a href="w%3ABattle%20of%20Somme"&gt;Battle of Somme&lt;/a&gt;. In September 1916, he refused to '&lt;a href="w%3Aover%20the%20top"&gt;go over the top&lt;/a&gt;'. 

He appeared before a &lt;a href="w%3Acourt%20martial"&gt;court martial&lt;/a&gt;, where he represented himself. Medical evidence presented at the court martial and found later showed that he was treated many times for being "sick with nerves" and "shell shock". He was found guilty of "misbehaving before the enemy in such a manner as to show cowardice", the decision was reached in 20 minutes.

On October 16, 1916 Pvt. Harris was shot dead by a firing squad, on the orders of his own officers. He was 25 years old.

Declassified army documents described him as a diligent soldier.
An Army chaplain who witnessed his execution wrote to his widow, Gertie Batstone "A finer soldier never lived" and that Pvt. Farr had refused to wear a blindfold during the execution, the ♡❤Independent♡❤ newspaper reported. ♡❤The Times♡❤ reports that nurses at the hospital where he was treated for severe shell shock said that he was unable to hold a pen in his trembling hand. 

After his execution, his military pension was stopped and Ms Batstone was forced out of their house, according to the ♡❤Independent♡❤. Pvt Farr's grave is unmarked and its whereabouts are not known.

<h2>Family "owerwhelmed"</h2>

After being informed of the Secretary's decision, Farr's granddaughter Janet Booth told the BBC "We don't know if it's a full or a conditional pardon yet. We are over the moon,".

Pte Farr's daughter Gertrude Harris was seven days old when her father went to fight in France. Now aged ninety-three, she said on learning of the decision, "I'm overwhelmed. I prayed that it would happen in my lifetime but I never realised really that it would. It's come really as a shock today.", adding that the whole family were celebrating. 

"I am so relieved that this ordeal is now over and I can be content knowing that my father's memory is intact. I have always argued that my father's refusal to rejoin the front line, described in the court martial as resulting from cowardice, was in fact the result of shell shock, and I believe that many other soldiers suffered from this, not just my father." Mrs. Harris said, and hoped that "others [...] who had brave relatives who were shot by their own side will now get the pardons they equally deserve."

Three people in the &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Toronto%20Area"&gt;Greater Toronto Area&lt;/a&gt; (GTA) and one person in &lt;a href="w%3AQuebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; won last week's &lt;a href="w%3ALotto%206/49"&gt;Lotto 649&lt;/a&gt;. They will share the second-largest lottery jackpot in Canadian history as the lucky winners of Saturday's $43.2-million Lotto 649 draw. They will each take home $10.8 million.

"Two of the tickets were purchased in the GTA, and one in &lt;a href="w%3Asouthwestern%20Ontario"&gt;southwestern Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, despite the free ticket giveaway by the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; lottery corporation to promote the contest", the &lt;a href="w%3AOntario%20Lottery%20and%20Gaming%20Corporation"&gt;Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation&lt;/a&gt; said.

The six regular winning numbers for the Saturday, August 12, 2006 Lotto
649 draw were: 3 - 10 - 21 - 23 - 33 - 44 (Bonus number 43).

Eight &lt;a href="w%3ADollarama"&gt;Dollarama&lt;/a&gt; employees in downtown Toronto also held one of the winning tickets, worth more than $10.8 million. They will take home about $1.35 million each. They range in ages from 22 to 53.

The biggest Lotto win was $54 million in a Lotto 649 draw in October 2005. It was won by 17 oil company workers in &lt;a href="w%3ACamrose%2C%20Alberta"&gt;Camrose, Alberta&lt;/a&gt;. Each took home a cheque for $3 million.

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Astronomical%20Union"&gt;International Astronomical Union&lt;/a&gt; (IAU) has offered up a new &lt;a href="w%3ADefinition%20of%20planet"&gt;definition of the word "planet"&lt;/a&gt; that could potentially increase &lt;a href="w%3ASolar%20system"&gt;our solar system&lt;/a&gt;'s nine &lt;a href="w%3Aplanet"&gt;planets&lt;/a&gt; to at least twelve. According to the proposed definition, "A planet is a &lt;a href="w%3AAstronomical%20object"&gt;celestial body&lt;/a&gt; that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-&lt;a href="w%3Agravity"&gt;gravity&lt;/a&gt; to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a &lt;a href="w%3AHydrostatic%20equilibrium"&gt;hydrostatic equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; (nearly round) shape, and (b) is in &lt;a href="w%3APlanetary%20orbit"&gt;orbit&lt;/a&gt; around a &lt;a href="w%3Astar"&gt;star&lt;/a&gt;, and is neither a star nor a &lt;a href="w%3Asatellite"&gt;satellite&lt;/a&gt; of a planet." Roughly speaking, the former includes objects over 5 x 10 kilograms (1/12,000th of Earth's mass) and 800 kilometers in diameter, but all borderline cases would require confirmation by observation of their shape.

According to this new definition, &lt;a href="w%3A1%20Ceres"&gt;Ceres&lt;/a&gt; (an &lt;a href="w%3Aasteroid"&gt;asteroid&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3Aasteroid%20belt"&gt;asteroid belt&lt;/a&gt;, between &lt;a href="w%3AMars"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJupiter"&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20UB313"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt; (an astronomical object beyond &lt;a href="w%3APluto"&gt;Pluto&lt;/a&gt; which has previously been called the &lt;a href="w%3ATenth%20planet"&gt;tenth planet&lt;/a&gt;), and Pluto's &lt;a href="w%3ANatural%20satellite"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ACharon%20%28moon%29"&gt;Charon&lt;/a&gt; may be dubbed planets. A dozen other candidates, like &lt;a href="w%3A90377%20Sedna"&gt;Sedna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A90482%20Orcus"&gt;Orcus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A50000%20Quaoar"&gt;Quaoar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2003%20EL61"&gt;2003 EL&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤etc♡❤., along with the asteroids &lt;a href="w%3A4%20Vesta"&gt;Vesta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3A2%20Pallas"&gt;Pallas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A10%20Hygiea"&gt;Hygiea&lt;/a&gt; are awaiting evaluation by the IAU.

The draft resolution also introduces the term "&lt;a href="w%3APluton%20%28astronomy%29"&gt;pluton&lt;/a&gt;", which refers to a growing subcategory of planets that have orbits around the sun that take at least 200 years to complete - effectively this will mean planets that orbit beyond &lt;a href="w%3ANeptune"&gt;Neptune&lt;/a&gt;. Plutons differ from &lt;a href="w%3Aclassical%20planet"&gt;classical planets&lt;/a&gt;: their orbit is highly tilted, &lt;a href="w%3AOrbital%20eccentricity"&gt;eccentric&lt;/a&gt; and not circular, which suggests they have a different origin, the main reason why &lt;a href="w%3AAstronomer"&gt;astronomers&lt;/a&gt; are interested in them.

The word "planet" comes from the &lt;a href="w%3AAncient%20Greek"&gt;ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt; word for "wanderer", because it was known in ancient times that certain lights in the sky moved in relation to other stars. However, since then no formal definition of the word planet was agreed upon. With the advent of powerful telescopes on the ground and in space, knowledge about heavenly bodies became more complex, stressing the need for unambiguous definitions. The issue came to a head in 2005 with the discovery of the &lt;a href="w%3Atrans-Neptunian%20object"&gt;trans-Neptunian object&lt;/a&gt; 2003 (unofficially termed Xena by its discoverer, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20E.%20Brown"&gt;Michael E. Brown&lt;/a&gt;). 2003 is a body larger than the smallest accepted planet, Pluto.

The suggested definition is not universally popular: some astronomers would like to draw the line at Neptune, and wouldn't classify icy dwarfs like Pluto as a planet, but as a trans-Neptunian object (similar to the plutons in the draft resolution) part of the &lt;a href="w%3AKuiper%20belt"&gt;Kuiper belt&lt;/a&gt;. Robin Catchpole, from the &lt;a href="w%3AInstitute%20of%20Astronomy%2C%20Cambridge"&gt;Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, said in an interview: "The public are very clear about what they understand by "planets". Those are the big, dominant bodies in the Solar System that we're all familiar with, the eight - or nine if you include Pluto. I think including more is going to add confusion to the public, but not really be particularly useful for astronomers."
Pluto is now being considered to be moved off the list of classical planets, but as the prototype of the new plutons category. The ninth planet (as it is termed, but maybe not for long), discovered in 1930, is a curiosity among planets for more than one reason: because Charon is so big in comparison, both are considered twin planets by some.

The current proposal is the result of two years work of the Planet Definition Committee of the IAU, which is responsible for the naming of astronomical objects. The 26th IAU General Assembly in &lt;a href="w%3APrague"&gt;Prague&lt;/a&gt; plans to vote on the proposal on Thursday, August 24 of 2006. When asked if he was confident the proposal would get the necessary two thirds of the votes, Professor &lt;a href="w%3AOwen%20Gingerich"&gt;Owen Gingerich&lt;/a&gt;, Chair of the IAU Planet Definition Committee, replied: "I'm sure it will be controversial to those with a stake in some other solution, but I hope we will get an overwhelming endorsement."

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt; Flight 923 from &lt;a href="w%3ALondon"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20D.C."&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/a&gt; made an emergency landing at &lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ALogan%20International%20Airport"&gt;Logan International Airport&lt;/a&gt; following the pilot declaring an in-flight emergency.

The flight had 182 passengers and 12 crew members on board.

A spokesman for Logan International Airport, Phil Orlandella, said the flight was guided to Boston by two fighter jets. 

A 59-year-old woman from &lt;a href="w%3AVermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt;, evidently suffering from &lt;a href="w%3Aclaustrophobia"&gt;claustrophobia&lt;/a&gt;, created an on-board disturbance and had to be restrained by passengers.

The spokesman for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Airlines"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/a&gt; said that the pilot for the flight declared an in-flight emergency.

&lt;a href="w%3AMassport"&gt;Massport&lt;/a&gt; spokesman says that the passengers were removed from the plane and their carry-on items were inspected.

A huge fire at a plastics recycling plant fire forced hundreds of residents in &lt;a href="w%3AAmherstburg%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Amherstburg&lt;/a&gt;, a Southwestern &lt;a href="w%3AOntario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt; town, to flee their homes.

It started early yesterday afternoon. Smoke was 20 metres high over the area and grew to roughly the size of two football fields.

Residents were evacuated from 360 nearby houses, but by 6:00 P.M. &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;ET&lt;/a&gt; (UTC-5) were told it was safe to return after officials determined the smoke was not considered to be a health risk.

Dave Fields, the fire chief from nearby &lt;a href="w%3AWindsor%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, said "80 firefighters were called in from other districts to battle the flames". 

"If people are going to store materials like this, you can't be available to store them in these types of quantities. It's a disaster waiting to happen," said Chief Fields. Chief Fields blamed storage practices at Enviro-Tech for much of the problem, saying the amount of high-density plastic stored at the plant made fighting the fire nearly impossible.

Also, a toxic cloud of chemicals forced 1,500 employees and residents to flee after a fire engulfed the laboratory of a coatings plant north of &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3ABoisbriand%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Boisbriand, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;. Thick black smoke swirled over the town located at the intersection of Highways 15 and 640.

More than 100 firefighters were called about 12:00 P.M. &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Eastern%20Time%20Zone"&gt;ET&lt;/a&gt; to get rid of the blaze on the third floor at Polyval Coatings Inc.

Fire Chief Christian Grand'Maison said early last night that "the fire wasn't yet under control but there were no longer concerns that it could flare up again". The evacuation order was lifted about 7:00 P.M.

People who live east of &lt;a href="w%3ABoisbriand"&gt;Boisbriand&lt;/a&gt; and nearby &lt;a href="w%3ARosem%C3%A8re%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Rosemere&lt;/a&gt; have been asked to keep their windows closed until it's clear, while Environment Quebec is at the smoke scene and is testing the air quality.

Three people have minor injuries. One employee was burned on the arm. A firefighter and a resident were treated for smoke inhalation.

New observations of the distribution of mass show clear evidence of the separation of &lt;a href="w%3Adark%20matter"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt; and normal matter, according to &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; scientists.

"This is the most energetic cosmic event, besides the Big Bang, which we know about," said Maxim Markevitch of the &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard-Smithsonian%20Center%20for%20Astrophysics"&gt;Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics&lt;/a&gt; and member of the NASA team that studied images collected with the &lt;a href="w%3AChandra%20X-ray%20observatory"&gt;Chandra X-ray observatory&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AHubble%20Space%20Telescope"&gt;Hubble Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, the European Southern Observatory's &lt;a href="w%3AVery%20Large%20Telescope"&gt;Very Large Telescope&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMagellan%20%28Telescopes%29"&gt;Magellan optical telescopes&lt;/a&gt;.

The observation supports the theory that the bulk of the universe is made up of invisible dark matter, which was detected by observing the gravitational force it exerted on visible matter.

"A universe that's dominated by dark stuff seems preposterous, so we wanted to test whether there were any basic flaws in our thinking," said team leader Doug Clowe of the &lt;a href="University%20of%20Arizona"&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="Tucson"&gt;Tucson&lt;/a&gt;. "These results are direct proof that dark matter exists." 

Because the force of gravity can bend light, the team was able to detect the presence of dark matter through gravitational lensing. Light emitted by objects that lie on the far side of the galaxy was distorted by a gravitational force in excess of the distortion expected by the visible matter present in the galactic collision. To make their discovery, the scientists trained their telescopes on a cluster of galaxies officially designated 1E0657-56, informally known as the bullet cluster because of its shape. 

The bullet shape is the result of the violent collision of a small galaxy cluster with another, larger cluster as normal matter in the galaxies interacts during the collision. Dark matter, however, does not experience any of the forces that affect normal matter, other than gravity, and ended up separating from the normal matter during the event.

These results will be published in an upcoming issue of &lt;a href="w%3AAstrophysical%20Journal"&gt;Astrophysical Journal&lt;/a&gt; Letters.

An arrest has been made in the almost 10-year-old murder of &lt;a href="w%3AJonBen%C3%A9t%20Ramsey"&gt;JonBenét Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;, according to a law enforcement official. The suspect is 41-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Mark%20Karr"&gt;John Mark Karr&lt;/a&gt;, a former second grade teacher. Karr was detained in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok, Thailand&lt;/a&gt; at the request of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20government"&gt;U.S. government&lt;/a&gt;. The suspect faces charges in &lt;a href="w%3AColorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. 

Local authorities in &lt;a href="w%3ABoulder%2C%20Colorado"&gt;Boulder, Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, where the suspect will face a murder charge, declined to comment.

&lt;a href="w%3AKUSA-TV"&gt;9News&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ADenver"&gt;Denver&lt;/a&gt; television station, claimed that the suspect had confessed to elements of the crime that were not public.

&lt;a href="w%3ACBS%20News"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that according to their sources the suspect is John Mark Karr, a 41-year-old American man and second-grade schoolteacher, who will be brought back to the United States this weekend.

JonBenét's father, John Ramsey, told 9News that he has been notified of the arrest. Asked if he knew Karr, Ramsey replied, "To the best of my knowledge, no," the station's Web site reported.

According to &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;, John Ramsey released the following statement to the media:

On December 26, 1996, 6-year-old JonBenét Ramsey, a child beauty pageant queen, was found murdered in the basement of her parents' home in Boulder, Colorado, United States, eight hours after being reported missing. The case drew national attention when no suspect was charged and suspicions turned to possible family involvement.

<h1>Google launches free city wide Wi-Fi in Mountain View, California</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Google%20launches%20free%20city%20wide%20Wi-Fi%20in%20Mountain%20View%2C%20California&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday inaugurated a free city-wide &lt;a href="w%3AWi-Fi"&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; system in its home town of &lt;a href="w%3AMountain%20View%2C%20California"&gt;Mountain View, California&lt;/a&gt;. Google insisted that it had no plans to offer a similar service nationwide. Most residents of Mountain View, can connect to the Internet via a Mesh Wi-Fi network for free. Google said that its network "eventually will cover the entire city" and serve as "testing ground for future innovations." The network is currently setup in downtown Mountain View, and much of the suburbs are yet to be hooked up.

The wireless network (Wi-Fi) covers 90% of Mountain View. It offers maximum &lt;a href="w%3AData%20transfer%20rate"&gt;data transfer rate&lt;/a&gt; of up to 1 &lt;a href="w%3AMegabit%20per%20second"&gt;Megabit per second&lt;/a&gt;, which is slightly slower than &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Subscriber%20Line"&gt;DSL&lt;/a&gt;.

The system costs about &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$1 million to build and uses 380 &lt;a href="w%3ATransceiver"&gt;transceivers&lt;/a&gt; mounted on street-lights throughout the 31 &lt;a href="w%3ASquare%20kilometre"&gt;km²&lt;/a&gt; city. Reviews of the network say that it works smoothly in open areas, but that connections can be patchy in enclosed spaces.

Chris Sacca, Google's head of special initiatives, said that "the main purpose of his company's backing local wi-fi access is to clear the way for broadband entrepreneurs and overcome legal roadblocks by established telephone and cable TV providers".

Mountain View, which has about 72,000 residents, is the largest U.S. city with totally free Internet access available throughout the entire community.

Private Meredith Simms, 18-years-old, died yesterday when the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Army"&gt;New Zealand Army&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMercedes-Benz%20Unimog"&gt;Mercedes-Benz Unimog&lt;/a&gt; truck he was travelling in left the road and fell 100-&lt;a href="w%3Ametres"&gt;metres&lt;/a&gt; down a steep bank 2.30 p.m. yesterday (&lt;a href="w%3ANZST"&gt;NZST&lt;/a&gt;), coming to rest on railway tracks. The soldier driving the truck was critically injured and was flown by the Westpac Rescue Helicopter to &lt;a href="w%3AList%20of%20hospitals%20in%20New%20Zealand%23Wellington%20Region"&gt;Wellington Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where he is being treated for spinal cord injuries.

The Unimog was travelling in a convoy 14-&lt;a href="w%3Akilometres"&gt;kilometres&lt;/a&gt; southeast of &lt;a href="w%3ABlenheim%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Blenheim&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Highway%201%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;State Highway 1&lt;/a&gt;, Weld Pass.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20police"&gt;New Zealand police&lt;/a&gt; have launched an inquiry into the fatal accident. The Unimog has been removed from the scene of the crash and will now be examined. The police say that they will guard the scene and finish examining it today.

The accident occurred when the Unimog was returning back to the Burnham Military Camp, &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt;, where all soldiers were from. It followed a ten day exercise which involved 15 vehicles in &lt;a href="w%3AMarlborough"&gt;Marlborough&lt;/a&gt;. The other soldiers went to the &lt;a href="w%3ARNZAF%20Base%20Woodbourne"&gt;RNZAF Base Woodbourne&lt;/a&gt; base to receive counselling from a military chaplain, military psychologist and police victim support, they are returning to Burnham today.

The family of the deceased said their son "died doing what he loved," and have requested privacy.

Simms' death has been referred to a coroner.

Since 1994 there have been eight fatal accidents involving Unimogs.

&lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; government forces repulsed an overnight offensive by the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberation%20Tigers%20of%20Tamil%20Eelam"&gt;Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)&lt;/a&gt; in the northern Jaffna peninsula in some of the fiercest fighting since the 2002 truce.

The LTTE attempted an amphibious attack arriving in a flotilla of gunboats. Government troops drove them off, supported by artillery and aerial bombing.

According to a military spokesperson, Major Rajapakse, the army killed at least 98 Tamil Tigers and wounded twice as many. The army suffered 6 killed and 60 wounded.

"The situation has calmed down now after heavy fighting till early this morning," Rajapakse said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEthnic%20conflict%20in%20Sri%20Lanka"&gt;ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; is an ongoing conflict between the &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Government of Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka%20Tamils%20%28native%29"&gt;ethnic Sri Lankan Tamils&lt;/a&gt; on the island-nation of Sri Lanka. Since the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20July"&gt;1983 "Black July" pogrom&lt;/a&gt;, there has been on-and-off civil war, mostly between the government and the LTTE who want to create an independent state of called &lt;a href="w%3ATamil%20Eelam"&gt;Tamil Eelam&lt;/a&gt; in the north and east of the island. It is estimated that the war has left 65,000 people dead since 1983 and caused great harm to the population and economy of the country. A cease-fire was declared in 2002, but hostilities renewed in late 2005 following military operations against Tiger-controlled territory in the east.

David Witt, &lt;a href="w%3Afather-in-law"&gt;father-in-law&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AFloyd%20Landis"&gt;Floyd Landis&lt;/a&gt;, the winner of the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tour%20De%20France"&gt;2006 Tour De France&lt;/a&gt;, has died. Witt was found dead in his car in a parking garage on August 16. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego%20Police"&gt;San Diego Police&lt;/a&gt; said. He was 57.

Witt who was married to Rose, the mother of Amber, Floyd Landis' wife, introduced Amber to Landis. Witt was an amateur cyclist who became friends with Landis after having the same coach. At one time, they were even roommates.

Witt and his wife co-own the "Hawthorn's" restaurant in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Diego"&gt;San Diego&lt;/a&gt; and it is adorned with Landis memorabilia, including his jerseys and magazine covers. The two had also attended the &lt;a href="w%3ATour%20de%20France"&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; where they witnessed Floyd's victory.

Floyd Landis did win the 2006 Tour de France, but the &lt;a href="w%3A2006_Tour_de_France%23Results"&gt;result&lt;/a&gt; is contested after he tested positive in a doping test. He is widely expected to be stripped of the title.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
A fire that started in the attic on Baynes Street between Bird and Forest Avenues in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt; left 2 families, totaling 6 people, homeless including three children.

A resident living on the second floor of the two family house called &lt;a href="w%3A911"&gt;911&lt;/a&gt; at around 8:00 p.m. on August 16, 2006 and reported the smell of smoke. When firefighters arrived they "saw flames shooting out of the third floor window," a firefighter told Wikinews.

Firefighters said that there was "severe damage from the fire to the third floor," but the second and first floor apartments suffered smoke and water damage.

Witnesses say that smoke from the blaze could be seen as far as a half mile away.

There were no injuries to any residents or firefighters and the cause of the blaze is still under investigation. Residents of the house would not comment.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Mark%20Karr"&gt;John Mark Karr&lt;/a&gt;, 41, a former elementary school teacher, has confessed to killing 6-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AJonBen%C3%A9t%20Ramsey"&gt;JonBenét Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; in 1996. Karr, an &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;, was arrested in an apartment located in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok%2C%20Thailand"&gt;Bangkok, Thailand&lt;/a&gt;. Karr called the killing an "accident", thereby implying that it was not murder, which requires intent.

"I was with JonBenét when she died. I loved JonBenét. She died accidentally. I am so very sorry for what happened to JonBenét. It's very important for me that everyone knows that I love her very much, that her death was unintentional, that it was an accident," Karr told reporters in a press conference yesterday. When Karr was asked by a reporter if he was innocent, regarding Ramsey's murder, he simply replied "no."

Karr also said that it would take "several hours" to describe what happened to Ramsey.

"It would take several hours to describe that. It's a very involved series of events that would involve a lot of time. It's very painful for me to talk about it," added Karr.

Despite the confession, ♡❤ABC News♡❤ is reporting that the ex-wife of Karr is supplying an alibi and says that he was in &lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; with her when the murder occurred.

John Ramsey, JonBenét's father, issued a statement shortly after the news of the arrest saying, "I want to have only very limited comment on today's arrest because I feel it is extremely important to not only let the justice system operate to its conclusion in an orderly manner, but also to avoid feeding the type of media speculation that my wife and I were subjected to for so many years."

Karr is expected to be charged with "second-degree murder. . . . He said it was unintentional. He said he was in love with the child. She was a pageant queen," said Lt. Gen. Suwat Tumrongsiskul, chief of the Thai police.

"Karr will be returned to &lt;a href="w%3AColorado"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; within the next week and will face charges of first-degree murder, felony murder, kidnapping and sexual assault," said official for the Department of Homeland Security at the United States Embassy in Bangkok.

Investigators say that Karr was being investigated for months and was arrested on sex charges that were not related to the Ramsey case. United States authorities were watching Karr after he attempted to get a job as a teacher in Thailand. 

Ramsey's lifeless body was found in her home just one day after Christmas in 1996. There had been no signs that anyone had forceably entered the home, but police did find evidence of &lt;a href="w%3ADNA"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;, from a male, under the fingernails of Ramsey; however, investigators had never been able to match the DNA to anyone.

A man with the same name, presumably Karr himself, founded PowerWurks, "a world wide support organization for kids, teens and college students." A March 7, 1996 newsgroup post to alt.missing-kids read "All my plans revolve around kids. I am very concerned about the well being of all young people. I'll do anything I can to help find a missing child. I have 3 children of my own and I don't know what I would do if they were taken from me." The message used an anonymizer to hide his email address.

&lt;a href="w%3AIndonesia"&gt;Indonesian&lt;/a&gt; Health officials are concerned that a 9-year-old girl who died of the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; virus, contracted the illness as a result of human to human transmission and officials say a team of experts are on the way to the area to determine if a cluster exists.

"The tests were positive. She died of bird flu. A team left this morning to check if there is a cluster or not," said Bird Flu Information Center scientist, Nurdin.

Ai Siti Amanah who lived in Garut, located in West Java died on August 15 before health officials were able to determine that she had the deadly virus and only one day after arriving for treatment at the hospital.

It is believed that the girl had contact with a 17-year-old male named Umar Aup from the same town who is infected with the virus , but health officials say he is recovering at a local hospital. He was diagnosed with the illness on August 12. Another boy named Misbah, 20, cousin of Aup died earlier in August and was not tested for the disease but officials say he was exhibiting signs of the illness. 

Supari Indonesia's health minister stated that tests will be done on the two subjects to determine the origin and the "exact type of the virus."

Three months ago, seven family members died when they contracted the virus through human to human transmission.

So far, 46 people have died from the virus in Indonesia.

A United States District federal judge ruled Thursday that the Bush administration's &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorist%20Surveillance%20Program"&gt;wiretapping program&lt;/a&gt; is "unconstitutional" and that it "must be halted immediately." The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt;(ACLU) challenging federal intelligence agencies' eavesdropping of international phone calls without obtaining court warrants.

The defendants, the &lt;a href="National%20Security%20Agency"&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (NSA), the &lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Security%20Service"&gt;Central Security Service&lt;/a&gt; and NSA Director and Chief of the Central Security Service, Lieutenant General &lt;a href="w%3AKeith%20B.%20Alexander"&gt;Keith B. Alexander&lt;/a&gt; asserted that they cannot defend their case without exposing &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Secrets%20privilege"&gt;state secrets&lt;/a&gt;.

Judge &lt;a href="w%3AAnna%20Diggs%20Taylor"&gt;Anna Diggs Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, US District Judge for the Eastern District of &lt;a href="w%3AMichigan"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, wrote in an opinion that the defense argument was "without merit". 
"Defendants have supported these arguments without revealing or relying on any classified information," Taylor wrote in an opinion accompanying the ruling. 

Judge Taylor also ruled that the tapping violates "the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution, privacy and free speech."

The Bush Administration has been firmly committed to the wiretapping, known as the &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorist%20Surveillance%20Program"&gt;Terrorist Surveillance Program&lt;/a&gt; (TSP), and said the practice has a valid basis in law, despite public criticism. Defenders of the program contended that the President has the authority under the and the Constitution to authorize the continued use of the TSP.

Judge Taylor wrote in her 43-page opinion that, "We must first note that the Office of the Chief Executive has itself been created, with its powers, by the Constitution. There are no hereditary Kings in America and no powers not created by the Constitution. So all 'inherent powers' must derive from that Constitution."

The ACLU filed the lawsuit to protect the privacy and unreasonable search of lawful verbal exchanges by journalists, lawyers and scholars among others. The court order ruled that powers granted by TSP violated the U.S. &lt;a href="w%3ASeparation%20of%20powers%20under%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Separation of Powers doctrine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AAdministrative%20Procedure%20Act"&gt;Administrative Procedure Act&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="w%3AFirst%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AFourth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution"&gt;Fourth Amendments.&lt;/a&gt; 

An appeal over the court decision is expected. 

In 2001, President George W. Bush approved a program that allowed the NSA to monitor international calls for possible terrorist activity when one party to the call was outside U.S. territory. The government argued that the program is well within the president's authority. The Justice Department wrote, "In the ongoing conflict with al Qaeda and its allies, the president has the primary duty under the Constitution to protect the American people".

In a full-page ad in the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Times"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, 85 top actors, directors and other &lt;a href="w%3AHollywood"&gt;Hollywood&lt;/a&gt; notables accused &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; of being &lt;a href="w%3ATerrorism"&gt;terrorist organisations&lt;/a&gt; and blamed them for the deaths of all the civilians in &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;; including the civilians that were killed by Israel's bombing of Lebanon.

The statement in the ad read as follows:

Among the signatories are famous actors such as: &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Douglas"&gt;Michael Douglas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APatricia%20Heaton"&gt;Patricia Heaton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADennis%20Hopper"&gt;Dennis Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20Hurt"&gt;William Hurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADon%20Johnson"&gt;Don Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANicole%20Kidman"&gt;Nicole Kidman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Mann"&gt;Michael Mann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AKelly%20Preston"&gt;Kelly Preston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASylvester%20Stallone"&gt;Sylvester Stallone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20De%20Vito"&gt;Danny De Vito&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABruce%20Willis"&gt;Bruce Willis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Woods"&gt;James Woods&lt;/a&gt;.

Also included were directors &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Donner"&gt;Dick Donner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Mann%20%28film%20director%29"&gt;Michael Mann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASam%20Raimi"&gt;Sam Raimi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ARidley%20Scott"&gt;Ridley Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Scott"&gt;Tony Scott&lt;/a&gt;. Other influential Hollywood signatories include &lt;a href="w%3ANews%20Corporation"&gt;News Corporation&lt;/a&gt; chairman and chief executive &lt;a href="w%3ARupert%20Murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;, chairman and majority owner of &lt;a href="w%3AParamount%20Pictures"&gt;Paramount Pictures&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ASumner%20Redstone"&gt;Sumner Redstone&lt;/a&gt; and media mogul &lt;a href="w%3AHaim%20Saban"&gt;Haim Saban&lt;/a&gt;.

Although neither Hamas nor Hezbollah have responded directly to the statement, both organisations have previously insisted that they are not terror organisations, but merely legitimate resistance movements. 

&lt;a href="w%3AMahmoud%20al-Zahar"&gt;Mahmoud al-Zahar&lt;/a&gt;, who is foreign minister of the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian National Authority&lt;/a&gt; as well as a co-founder of Hamas and member of Hamas' leadership in the &lt;a href="w%3AGaza%20Strip"&gt;Gaza Strip&lt;/a&gt;, has previously insisted his organisation has the "right to resist" Israeli attacks. He continued:

Israeli &lt;a href="w%3AVice%20Premier%20of%20Israel%23Vice%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;Vice Premier&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Shimon%20Peres"&gt;Shimon Peres&lt;/a&gt; had earlier persuaded Nicole Kidman to visit Israel and, during a conference held by Rupert Murdoch, said "Maybe you can be tourism ambassador to the Galilee."

The discovery of a suspect bottle of fluid in a passengers carry-on luggage has prompted the evacuation of Tri-State Airport, located near Huntington, West Virginia. 

The bottle was identified by a security screener as a woman passenger attempted to board a flight to Charlotte, North Carolina. Since the discovery of an alleged plot to destroy US flights departing from British airports last week using liquid explosives, authorities in the US and UK have banned transportation of liquids in carry-on luggage.

A machine used by security officers to test for the presence of explosives was trigged by two of four bottles carried by the woman. This positive result was subsequently confirmed by a sniffer dog. The bottles reportedly contained drinking water and a face wash with a drop of bleach.

Both bomb sniffing dogs and explosive detecting equipment detect chlorine among other chemicals. Chlorine is the major ingredient in bleach and a common disinfectant.

Airport officials report that the woman, Rima Qayyum, is an American from Jackson West Virginia. She is of Pakistani origin and was travelling on a one way ticket to Charlotte, North Carolina. She is four months pregnant.

Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman Amy von Walter issued the following statements to press. "The bomb squad is on site and the woman is being interviewed by the FBI," "It looks like there were four items containing liquids ... two of those containers tested positive."

The bottles were later found to be harmless and the woman was released.

Irish firm Steorn has placed an advertisement in ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Economist"&gt;The Economist&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ magazine asking for 12 scientists to test their "&lt;a href="w%3APerpetual%20motion"&gt;free energy&lt;/a&gt;" invention. 

The &lt;a href="w%3ADublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; based firm, founded in 2000, says it has developed technology that takes a small amount of &lt;a href="w%3AMechanical%20energy"&gt;mechanical energy&lt;/a&gt; and returns a bigger amount, using &lt;a href="w%3AMagnetic%20field"&gt;magnetic fields&lt;/a&gt;. The company's Chief Executive, Sean McCarthy, said that they discovered the technology whilst working on generators for &lt;a href="w%3AWind%20turbine"&gt;wind turbines&lt;/a&gt; used to power &lt;a href="w%3ACCTV"&gt;CCTV&lt;/a&gt; cameras.

The company has asked for 12 physicists to help them rigorously test their invention to prove, one way or the other, whether it works as they say it does. McCarthy claims that the vast majority of the scientists they've directly invited to test their device have refused, which is why they've resorted to the advertisement.

"Free energy" is a perennial claim of con artists and inventors, one that science has constantly battled with. The idea that a small amount of energy can return a bigger amount without drawing it from somewhere breaks the basic laws of physics, specifically the &lt;a href="w%3ALaws%20of%20thermodynamics"&gt;laws of thermodynamics&lt;/a&gt;. One common claim of the free energy 'inventor' is that the scientific community, the government, etc. needs to publicly verify the machine works before the inventor will sell it. The logic of this is flawed, as the device would be an instant cash cow. The inventor would be able to power his home, car, and be able to sell the energy produced to others at the market price. Devices that are claimed to exhibit this behaviour are known as &lt;a href="w%3APerpetual%20motion"&gt;perpetual motion&lt;/a&gt; machines. The average person's knowledge of science (or lack thereof) is a popular weak point to exploit for con men.

Two New Zealand men, Richard Stuart Hayes and Troy Jonathon Elliot, have been convicted of running an illegal mobile text based competition after 27 winners did not receive the car prizes. The pair were found guilty yesterday in a decision reached by Judge Nicola Mathers in Auckland District Court, following a February hearing.

The two convicts, whose names were suppressed until yesterday, are the directors of the company which ran the 'TxtDrive' competition in March 2004, the Watch and Win Company. The company had hoped to gain a profit of &lt;a href="w%3ANZ%24"&gt;NZ$&lt;/a&gt;2.5 million, but due to lack of interest and entrants they could not afford to honour the daily prizes as they had only raised $414,595.

"I am satisfied that the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Department%20of%20Internal%20Affairs"&gt;Department of Internal Affairs&lt;/a&gt;(DIA) has proved to me beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hayes and Mr Elliot organised an illegal lottery. I consider they deliberately entered into the scheme and were careless as to the legality of this novel scheme." Judge Mathers said.

During the 27-day competition, cellphone users had to send a $0.99 text message during television adverts on &lt;a href="w%3ATV%202%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;TV 2&lt;/a&gt; for the opportunity to win a &lt;a href="w%3APeugeot"&gt;Peugeot&lt;/a&gt; car a day or free products from &lt;a href="w%3APizza%20Hut"&gt;Pizza Hut&lt;/a&gt;.

Settlements have been reached with the winners; only one received a car.

Hayes and Elliot argued that it was not a lottery but a sales promotion, which means it didn't need to be licensed by the DIA.

Mark Woolford, DIA lawyer, said "Internal Affairs had to prove that the Hayes and Elliot organised the competition, that it was a lottery under the definition of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977, and that it was not authorised as a lottery by Internal Affairs."

A sales promotion is defined as "Any competition promoted by a manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler or retailer for the purpose of promoting the sale of goods or services." Judge Mathers said she was satisfied the TxtDrive competition was an illegal lottery.

The two men are to appear back in court on 6 October, they face either a fine of $4,000 or three months in prison under the maximum penalties.

Nearing the one year anniversary of the publication of twelve controversial &lt;a href="w%3Aeditorial%20cartoons"&gt;editorial cartoons&lt;/a&gt; depicting &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Muhammad&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; newspaper, a leading authority of &lt;a href="w%3ASunni%20Islam"&gt;Sunni Islam&lt;/a&gt; has demanded that the newspaper be shut down.

In an interview with the Danish newspaper &lt;a href="w%3ABerlingske%20Tidende"&gt;Berlingske Tidende&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad%20Sayyid%20Tantawy"&gt;Sheikh Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi&lt;/a&gt;, Grand Iman of the &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Azhar%20University"&gt;Al-Azhar University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt; and formerly &lt;a href="w%3AGrand%20Mufti"&gt;Grand Mufti&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AEgypt"&gt;Republic&lt;/a&gt;, demanded the closure of &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands%20Posten"&gt;Jyllands Posten&lt;/a&gt;, the paper responsible for publishing the cartoons. He went on to call for chief editor &lt;a href="w%3ACarsten%20Juste"&gt;Carsten Juste&lt;/a&gt; to be jailed for three years, and for the editor of the paper's cartoon section, &lt;a href="w%3AFlemming%20Rose"&gt;Flemming Rose&lt;/a&gt;, be depicted as a pig.

"It is thought provoking," Rose said, "that he (Tantawi) believes it would be a punishment for me to be depicted as a pig. It confirms that the imam has a shocking lack of knowledge about our civilisation, and it confirms the need for dialogue." Rose added that it shows how blasphemy law in the Arab world is used to suppress those with views different from those in power.

Tantawi called the drawings "one of the most serious crimes ever committed."

&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;Senator John McCain&lt;/a&gt; will next observe the effects of &lt;a href="w%3AGlobal%20warming"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3AGreenland"&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3ADenmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; government has invited a number of influential American politicians to visit for them to witness with their own eyes the consequences of &lt;a href="w%3Aclimate%20change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; on the Arctic ice.

Last year 25 Environmental Ministers from all over the world were treated to a similar tour. Last week American scientists from &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin"&gt;University of Texas at Austin&lt;/a&gt; released a study that showed that the ice is melting three times faster now than in the late nineties.

Among several senators participating in the trip is former presidential candidate &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20McCain"&gt;John McCain&lt;/a&gt;. From the Danish side, Foreign Minister &lt;a href="w%3APer%20Stig%20M%C3%B8ller"&gt;Per Stig Møller&lt;/a&gt; and Minister for the Environment &lt;a href="w%3AConnie%20Hedegaard"&gt;Connie Hedegaard&lt;/a&gt; will be on the tour.

"We have to realize, that the current president hasn't in mind to do anything, but John McCain can be key to that process in the U.S." Connie Hedegaard said to &lt;a href="w%3ADanmarks%20Radio"&gt;DR&lt;/a&gt;'s radio news.

The province of &lt;a href="w%3ANova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to set aside 300 acres in Cape Breton for the country's first orbital launch facility, the &lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Star"&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt; reported Wednesday. According to the Star, the &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Space%20Agency"&gt;Canadian Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; has been aware of a proposed orbital launch facility for &lt;a href="w%3ACape%20Breton%20County%2C%20Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Cape Breton, Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; for several months and is "pleased."

"Seeing industry taking a strong role and a leadership role in this area is not something we're against," said Hugues Gilbert, the agency's director-general of policy planning and relations. "Au contraire, this is something we're very pleased to see."

The proposal came from a Canada and U.S. firm called &lt;a href="http%3A//PlanetSpace.org"&gt;PlanetSpace.org&lt;/a&gt;. They are working on a shuttle called the &lt;a href="w%3ASilver%20Dart%20%28space%20craft%29"&gt;Silver Dart&lt;/a&gt;. It plans to construct a spacecraft capable of shuttling astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station, then gliding back to Earth. &lt;a href="w%3APlanetSpace"&gt;PlanetSpace&lt;/a&gt; picked Cape Breton as a launch site because of its location in relation to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;.

Nova Scotia Business Inc., a government development agency, recommended the move after reviewing the company’s business plan. The province will allow PlanetSpace to use 120 hectares of Crown land for the project.

"PlanetSpace is a company that is very involved in the commercialization of space," government spokesman Mark James said Wednesday.

PlanetSpace says &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; is so intrigued with its proposed "Silver Dart" vehicle and launch location it's willing to provide unfunded technical support. PlanetSpace and a related company, &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Arrow"&gt;Canadian Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, have built and tested a powerful liquid fuel rocket engine near &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%2C%20Ontario"&gt;London, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.

"PlanetSpace also says it's in discussions with NASA to sign a Space Act Agreement, which would give us the technology to complete the vehicle", said Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, chairman of PlanetSpace. 

The spacecraft is expected to launch vertical atop a stack of about 10 Canadian Arrow rocket engines and land horizontally on an aircraft runway, they added.

A woman detained after an evacuation at a U.S. airport in Huntington, West Virginia, has been cleared of all charges after further tests revealed that the liquid contained in water bottles in her carry-on luggage was not explosive. This result came despite earlier tests which seemed to indicate explosives were present.

The evacuation affected 100 people. The woman, who is of Pakistani descent, has been cleared by U.S. authorities to travel as early as Friday.

&lt;a href="w%3AWeb.com"&gt;Web.com&lt;/a&gt;, a web-hosting and online services company, has released its second quarter financial results and associated statements - and it's clear that the company has experienced both the ups and downs of executing on its goals.

On the upside, the company achieved an industry-first achievement of securing a non-exclusive license agreement with Hostopia.com Inc. last month. The agreement granted Hostopia rights to two of Web.com's patents over five years on a non-transferable basis. The specific licensed patents were U.S. Patent numbers 5,680,152 and 6,789,103 and broadly cover methods for website building and web hosting control panels. Importantly for revenues, the license agreement states that Hostopia will pay Web.com a royalty equal to 10% of their gross U.S. retail revenues for five years. 

On the downside, the company failed to deliver on the expected and announced acquisition of Houston-based WebSource Media - a business offering "easy and affordable built-to-order websites". The announced acquisiton was to have added about $9 million in annual revenue to Web.com. 

However, according to published reports from Web.com, the company filed to rescind its acquisition of WebSource media just about one month after the announcement. This action was taken after the Federal Trade Commission filed a sealed action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against WebSource Media, L.L.C. and its members - alleging unfair and deceptive acts and business practices prior to the acquisition. 

In a press release issued by Web.com, President and CEO Jeff Stibel discussed the effects of the rescinded acquisition on the second quarter resutls, "Web.com continued to drive subscriber growth across its core website and web services plans by refining our sales and marketing efforts and working closely with strategic distribution partners. While we had unfortunate news about an acquisition we made during the quarter, the company has moved on and is working on further solidifying its position as a leader in the industry."

On the financial side of the report, Web.com reported that total revenues for the quarter were $12.1 million, down from $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2006. The second quarter marked the last quarter of recognizing Verizon revenues (a deal that was initially cancelled in December 2004 and terminated in the second quarter of 2006).

On the organic customer acquisition side of the equation, the company reported that net subscribers totaled approximately 148,000 for the quarter, down from approximately 149,000 in the first quarter of 2006. The reduction in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter includes the loss of approximately 3,200 Verizon subscribers. Excluding the loss of Verizon subscribers, the company added approximately 1,600 subscribers in the quarter.

A younger brother of &lt;a href="w%3AChechnya"&gt;Chechen&lt;/a&gt; warlord &lt;a href="w%3ADoku%20Umarov"&gt;Doku Umarov&lt;/a&gt; is the latest of around 120 rebels whom have surrendered in the &lt;a href="w%3ARussia"&gt;Russian&lt;/a&gt; republic Chechnya alone since an amnesty was declared following last month’s killing of rebel leader &lt;a href="w%3AShamil%20Basayev"&gt;Shamil Basayev&lt;/a&gt;.

In an attempt to capitalize on Basayev’s death and other recent successful developments in Russia’s long struggle against Chechen separatists, Russian authorities instigated an amnesty that reached out to all insurgents of the Russian &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Caucasus"&gt;North Caucasus&lt;/a&gt; area who would lay down their weapons in exchange for peace. Previous amnesties showed only lacklustre success but it is hoped the current situation and declining popularity of the separatist groups within Chechnya will lend this latest attempt more success. The amnesty initially valid until August 1 was later extended until September 30.

Doku Umarov however rejected the amnesty as ♡❤"a hopeless attempt by the Kremlin regime to shroud the real situation [...] in lies"♡❤. After the death of Shamil Basayev, Doku Umarov is considered the most influential separatist. A previous report that it was Doku Umarov himself, who had surrendered has been denied.

The Regina soldier died August 9, 2006 after he was wounded by another Canadian soldier's accidental discharge with a weapon near &lt;a href="w%3AKandahar"&gt;Kandahar, Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;.

"He knew there were bad guys out there, but he knew he had a duty to go and protect the public," said Rev. Allan Higgs at the service for the 33-year-old master corporal in the 2nd Battalion of &lt;a href="w%3APrincess%20Patricia%27s%20Canadian%20Light%20Infantry"&gt;Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry&lt;/a&gt;.

Walsh had been in Afghanistan just six days before he was killed, a day after celebrating his 33rd birthday.

In the wake of last month's floods, &lt;a href="North%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to accept aid from &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;n donors as well as international organisations. This signifies an apparent change of heart the North Korean leadership, which as recently as last month had insisted they would handle everything itself.

Local North Korean sources put the number of deaths from the floods at 547 and a few hundred missing, however &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGood%20Friends"&gt;Good Friends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a South Korean private aid agency, estimates the numbers may be more than hundred times that and top 57,700 deaths. Good Friends, citing "many sources" inside North Korea, also estimates more than 2.5 million homeless and hundred of thousands of acres of farmland had been inundated.

Initially the aid from &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20World%20Food%20Program"&gt;World Food Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will cover 150 tonnes of food to feed 13,000 people for a month in North Korea's worst hit northern Songchon county. South Korea has pledged an additional $72 million.

In related news North Korean infant mortality reached 21 for every 1000, one of the highest in the world, mostly due to malnutrition and poor medical conditions.

<h1>Wikimedia servers unreachable for 3 hours due to network outage</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Wikimedia%20servers%20unreachable%20for%203%20hours%20due%20to%20network%20outage&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Earlier today, &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the free encyclopedia, and other projects hosted by the &lt;a href="w%3AWikimedia%20Foundation"&gt;Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/a&gt; suffered downtime due to network issues. Thanks to the efforts of Wikimedia staff and volunteers, service was restored relatively quickly. The downtime lasted from about 17:20 UTC to 20:00 UTC, according to Wikimedia's Chief Technology Officer, &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ABrion%20VIBBER"&gt;Brion Vibber&lt;/a&gt;.

According to Vibber, &lt;a href="w%3ACogent%20Communications"&gt;Cogent Communications&lt;/a&gt; readvertised routing to Wikimedia's primary &lt;a href="w%3AIP%20address"&gt;IP address&lt;/a&gt; block, rendering the site unreachable to most visitors. The reason behind Cogent's actions remain unclear at this time. According to a reliable anonymous source, the service outage was due to a dispute between Cogent and the hosting provider used by Wikimedia, and had nothing to do with Wikimedia's services or content in any way. Rumors that the outage was related to a &lt;a href="w%3ADMCA"&gt;DMCA&lt;/a&gt; takedown notice received by Cogent are false, according to the same source. 

Whilst some users were still able to access the site, projects such as Wikipedia were temporarily switched to read-only mode in order to combat vandalism. This block on editing was removed once normal service resumed.

"This was an unfortunate case of collateral damage" said Brad Patrick of WMF. "It was a shock that something like this could happen to us without warning. We will do everything necessary to make sure our users have continuous access to our projects."

In the southern part of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ANetherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3ALimburg%20%28Netherlands%29"&gt;Limburg&lt;/a&gt; there has been an &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Aoutbreak"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Abluetongue"&gt;bluetongue&lt;/a&gt; according to a statement of the Ministry of Agriculture. This disease is dangerous for &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Asheep"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;. Sheep who are infected by the disease would get a blue &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Atongue"&gt;tongue&lt;/a&gt;, high fever and a swollen head. The disease may also cause death for them. For many other animals and for humans the disease isn't dangerous. It is the first time that this disease has been spotted in the Netherlands. Usually this disease can only be found in the countries of the &lt;a href="%3Aw%3AMediterranean"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt;.

To combat the disease, the Dutch authorities have forbidden exports of animals such as sheep, goats and cows. In the surrounding 20 kilometers of the source of the outbreak it is forbidden to transport animals; the animals have to be stabled and &lt;a href="%3Aw%3Ainsecticide"&gt;insecticides&lt;/a&gt; are obliged. Furthermore, an area of protection of 150 kilometers has been arranged which these animals are not allowed to leave.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

&lt;a href="w%3AReuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that according to a source with &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanese&lt;/a&gt; security, Israeli aircraft fired rockets at a &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; stronghold at or near the village of Bodai.

An Israeli army spokesperson reportedly said they were checking into the report.

If confirmed, this would be the first overt action since the cease-fire after &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201701"&gt;United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701&lt;/a&gt; that sought to end the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Israel-Lebanon%20conflict"&gt;2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict&lt;/a&gt;.

Lebanon condemned the operation as a "flagrant violation" of the six-day old truce.

"The operation was aimed at preventing the delivery of weapons to Hezbollah from Iran and Syria," an Israeli army spokesman said, adding that "all goals were achieved".

Sri Lanka government jets bombed the &lt;a href="w%3ALTTE"&gt;LTTE&lt;/a&gt; on front lines in the battle for the &lt;a href="w%3AJaffna"&gt;Jaffna&lt;/a&gt; peninsula as fighting continued in the ethnic strife. The last week of fighting has claimed the lives of hundreds.

Government air strikes continued on targets in the northern rebel-held territory of Kilinochchi and near the eastern port town of Trincomalee.

The peninsula, which has largely been cut off form the outside world, has seen tens of thousands have flee their homes. There are shortages of food and lines for fuel.

During a brief break in the fighting, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; tried to get food and water to some of the worst-off areas.

"We need both sides to stop fighting so we can get proper access to the area," said &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees"&gt;UNHCR&lt;/a&gt; representative Amin Awad. "Food is getting low and we have worries about water and sanitation."

The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Food%20Program"&gt;World Food Program&lt;/a&gt; said it was feeding more than 50,000 people in camps who fled fighting in and around Trincomalee, where there was only sporadic gunfire overnight.

The &lt;a href="w%3AEthnic%20conflict%20in%20Sri%20Lanka"&gt;ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; is an ongoing conflict between the &lt;a href="w%3APolitics%20of%20Sri%20Lanka"&gt;Government of Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3ASri%20Lanka%20Tamils%20%28native%29"&gt;ethnic Sri Lankan Tamils&lt;/a&gt; on the island-nation of Sri Lanka. Since the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20July"&gt;1983 "Black July" pogrom&lt;/a&gt;, there has been on-and-off civil war, mostly between the government and the LTTE who want to create an independent state of called &lt;a href="w%3ATamil%20Eelam"&gt;Tamil Eelam&lt;/a&gt; in the north and east of the island. It is estimated that the war has left 65,000 people dead since 1983 and caused great harm to the population and economy of the country. A cease-fire was declared in 2002, but hostilities renewed in late 2005 following military operations against Tiger-controlled territory in the east.

The New Zealand &lt;a href="w%3AAll%20Blacks"&gt;All Blacks&lt;/a&gt; have defeated &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; to win the &lt;a href="w%3Arugby%20union"&gt;rugby union&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Tri%20Nations%20Series"&gt;2006 Tri Nations&lt;/a&gt;. The end result was a close 34 to 27 win for the home side, which was played at &lt;a href="w%3AAuckland"&gt;Auckland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AEden%20Park"&gt;Eden Park&lt;/a&gt;. It is the fourth series win in five years for the All Blacks. The All Blacks entered the match having already wrapped up the &lt;a href="w%3ABledisloe%20Cup"&gt;Bledisloe Cup&lt;/a&gt; two weeks prior in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;, and sealed their victory in the Tri Nations by winning this match, despite the &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;South African&lt;/a&gt; leg of the series starting next week. The Wallabies had not won at Eden Park in 20 years, whilst the All Blacks had not lost a Test at home in over three years.

The All Blacks performed the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Kapa%20O%20Pango%20controversy"&gt;controversial Kapa O Pango&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AHaka%20of%20the%20All%20Blacks"&gt;haka&lt;/a&gt; before the game in front of the sold out Eden Park. The scoring kicked off in the third minute of play, with &lt;a href="w%3AStirling%20Mortlock"&gt;Stirling Mortlock&lt;/a&gt; booting a penalty goal to give the Wallabies an early lead of thee to nil. The equaliser came in the 6th minute, with &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Carter%20%28rugby%20player%29"&gt;Dan Carter&lt;/a&gt; kicking a penalty goal for the All Blacks. The Australian &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team"&gt;Wallabies&lt;/a&gt; were back in front by the 15 minute mark, Mortlock kicking another penalty goal to take Australia six points to three in front. In the fourth penalty goal in 20 minutes, Carter leveled things once again, six-points all. A intercept by &lt;a href="w%3ALote%20Tuqiri"&gt;Lote Tuqiri&lt;/a&gt; turned into a runaway &lt;a href="w%3Atry"&gt;try&lt;/a&gt; for Australia, scoring the first try of the match. Mortlock converted the try, making the score 13 points to six, 26 minutes in the game. Carter missed a penalty goal in the 32nd minute. Two minutes later the All Blacks barged over with &lt;a href="w%3AJason%20Eaton"&gt;Jason Eaton&lt;/a&gt; scoring the All Blacks' first try of the match. Carter missed the conversion, so Australia held onto a slim 13 to 11 lead. Australia went searching for their second try before half-time, &lt;a href="w%3ARocky%20Elsom"&gt;Rocky Elsom&lt;/a&gt; getting over the line, though it went up to the video referee. The try was awarded, though some believe there was not enough control when the try was scored. Mortlock converted, and the Wallabies were now leading 20 points to 11.

Six minutes into the second half, Carter kicked a successful penalty goal, narrowing the gap to 14 to 20. Carter again narrowed the scoreline in the 53rd minute, kicking another penalty goal. The All Blacks now trailing by just three points, 17 to 20. The All Blacks came close to scoring in the 60th minute, though the ball was knocked-on close to the line. Minutes later &lt;a href="w%3AChris%20Jack"&gt;Chris Jack&lt;/a&gt; put the All Blacks back in front, scoring the first try of the second half. Carter converted and the All Blacks now led the match 24 points to 20. In the 68th minute, &lt;a href="w%3ALuke%20McAlister"&gt;Luke McAlister&lt;/a&gt; scored an intercept try, and with Carter's conversion, the All Blacks moved ahead 31 ponts to 20. However, in the 73rd minute, Tuqiri got his second try, and with Mortlock's conversion, there was a new hope for the Wallabies. The score now 31 points to 27, with under 10 minutes remaining. &lt;a href="w%3APhil%20Waugh"&gt;Phil Waugh&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="w%3Ared%20card"&gt;sent off&lt;/a&gt; in the final minutes of the match. A Carter conversion took the score line out to 34 to 27. Full-time was soon called, and the All Blacks had held onto the win. Despite the All Blacks win, the rugby is far from over, with more games to be played in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Africa"&gt;the Republic&lt;/a&gt;.

On Saturday, in a pre-dawn raid, &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20Defense%20Forces"&gt;Israeli soldiers&lt;/a&gt; seized &lt;a href="w%3ANasser%20al-Shaer"&gt;Nasser al-Shaer&lt;/a&gt; at his home in &lt;a href="w%3ARamallah"&gt;Ramallah&lt;/a&gt; in the occupied &lt;a href="w%3AWest%20Bank"&gt;West Bank&lt;/a&gt;. Al-Shaer is the &lt;a href="w%3APalestine"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; Deputy Prime Minister and a top official of the &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; militant group.

The Israeli military confirmed the detention of al-Shaer. &lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; has been cracking down on the Hamas movement, which does not recognise Israel, for the last seven weeks. Al-Shaer is the highest ranking Hamas member to be detained. 30 members of &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian National Authority&lt;/a&gt; parliament have also been detained during the crack-down.

Nasser al-Shaer, a former university professor, is known as a pragmatist in Hamas. Palestinian officials accused Israel of undermining their efforts to form a broad government coalition.

The West Bank was captured by Israel from &lt;a href="w%3AJordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3A1967%20Six-Day%20War"&gt;1967 Six-Day War&lt;/a&gt; and is considered by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; and most countries to be under Israeli occupation. Some Israelis and various other groups prefer to refer to it as "disputed" rather than "occupied" territory.

A 21 year old man fell into a tank of chocolate and was stuck waist deep in it for two hours on August 18 in &lt;a href="w%3AKenosha"&gt;Kenosha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;.

Darmin Garcia, an employee of a company that supplies chocolate ingredients, said he was pushing the chocolate down into the container because it was stuck but it became loose and he fell in. However police chief Randy Berner said that he was told by Mr. Garcia that he climbed into the tank.

It was in my hair, in my ears, my mouth, everywhere," said Garcia, who has worked at the company for two years. "I felt like I weighed 900 pounds (400 kg). I couldn't move."

"It was pretty thick. It was virtually like quicksand," said Mr. Berner. "It's the first time I've ever heard of anything like this," he added.

He fell into 70 gallons (450 L) of dark chocolate that was being kept at 110°F (43°C). Co-workers, police and firefighters tried to free the man but could not until cocoa butter was used to thin the chocolate. He only suffered minor injuries and was released from hospital.

When asked whether he still had a taste for chocolate he said, "Not so much anymore."

2008 &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20party%20%28United%20States%29"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt; presidential hopefuls are spending a lot of time in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; in the run-up to the 2006 off-year elections. All the interest in the Palmetto State is widely viewed in the light of its place of significance in the GOP's primary calendar. 

&lt;a href="John%20McCain"&gt;Sen. John McCain&lt;/a&gt; (R-AZ) leads in most early polls. And he also leads in the pack in handing out campaign contributions to down-ticket Republican hopefuls. Since the beginning of the year, Sen. McCain's Straight Talk America PAC has contributed $172,750 to South Carolina Republican candidates, according to campaign finance reports. In contrast, Massachusetts Governor &lt;a href="w%3AMitt%20Romney"&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt; has contributed roughly $73,000 during the same period. 

McCain has also picked up some influential support recently. Former State 
Attorney General Charlie Condon, veteran consultant Bob McAlister and 
current Attorney General Henry McMaster have all assumed leadership roles in McCain's Straight Talk America PAC. McCain was in South Carolina this week to raise money for Republican Adjutant General Stan Spears, who is running for reelection. 

Former New York Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ARudy%20Giuliani"&gt;Rudy Giuliani&lt;/a&gt; also visited South Carolina this week. Mayor Giuliani headlined a fundraising dinner for the state Republican Party. While Giuliani focused his speech on the War on Terror, some were more interested in the New Yorker's position on social issues. 

Conservative reporter Byron York, who attended the event, quotes Palmetto 
Family Council President Oran Smith saying, "Gay rights, abortion, guns 
[Giuliani is pro-gun control] ... any one of them would be a disqualifier, but the three of them together are absolutely insurmountable." 

Representatives from McCain, Romney, and Giuliani's camp all say their man 
is still deciding whether or not he will run for president in 2008.

Speaking at a &lt;a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia"&gt;Liberal&lt;/a&gt; party conference in &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; today, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s treasurer &lt;a href="Peter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; said that the US-led &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWar%20on%20Terrorism"&gt;War on Terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could outlast the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACold%20War"&gt;Cold War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and continue for more than 50 years.

Mr Costello said that Australians needed to be sure about their values as they prepare for a long war on terror.

The treasurer said that Australia must be prepared to protect its values and defend itself against the threat of terrorism.

"There are, unfortunately, terrorists who would rather see Australia as some kind of &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islamo&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afascism"&gt;fascist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; state," he said.

"They are prepared to do us ill. These people do not always come from overseas."

"There are people that are born in Australia who, for whatever reason, have been infected with terrorist ideology; who have trained to give themselves the capacity to do us and our society ill."

Mr Costello warned that the war would not end until all terrorists were defeated and the type of society they wished to create was crushed. "The defeat of them and their ideas will signal the end of the war on terrorism," he said.

Mr Costello said that the government would defend Australia against any terrorist threat. "We have had plots in Australia to blow up buildings and I want to reassure the Australian public that the Government will do what is required to defeat terrorists and their ambitions," he said.

&lt;br style="clear:both;"&gt;

The body of Mike Seavers, a &lt;a href="w%3Amountaineer"&gt;mountaineer&lt;/a&gt; who died in a climbing accident in the &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Alps"&gt;French Alps&lt;/a&gt;, has been found after seventeen years.

The 31 year-old, who lived in &lt;a href="Bristol"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;, was scaling &lt;a href="w%3AMont%20Blanc"&gt;Mont Blanc&lt;/a&gt; with a climbing party when they got caught up in a fierce storm. 

He was found alongside a &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; member of the party in a melting &lt;a href="w%3Aglacier"&gt;glacier&lt;/a&gt; which preserved their bodies, according to Nick Cotton from the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Mountaineering%20Council"&gt;British Mountaineering Council&lt;/a&gt;. “They may have gone inside a crevasse to take cover and got covered, possibly by an &lt;a href="w%3Aavalanche"&gt;avalanche&lt;/a&gt; or snowfall. Glaciers are flowing things. They move at an imperceptible speed and anything travels with it encased in ice. When they get to a point where the glacier melts, things appear,” he said.

Police in &lt;a href="w%3AGermany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; have arrested one of two men who they suspect was involved in a failed terrorist attack. 

Authorities say the pair planted two bombs on trains last month, but they failed to detonate. The Propane gas devices was discovered in baggage on trains at &lt;a href="w%3ADortmund"&gt;Dortmund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AKoblenz"&gt;Koblenz&lt;/a&gt; stations on 31 July.

The man was identified as 21 year-old Jussuf Mohammed. He was arrested at the main train station in &lt;a href="w%3AKiel"&gt;Kiel&lt;/a&gt;. 

"The person appears to be one of the two suspects that have been sought since yesterday with the help of video footage that was made public," the public prosecutors' office said.

&lt;a href="w%3AFord"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; has announced sweeping cuts of 21% (168,000 units) in its &lt;a href="w%3AUSA"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACanada"&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; production, resulting in the partial closure of ten of its plants during the fourth quarter. The measure comes on top of existing turnaround plans announced in January, in which 25,000 to 30,000 positions should be cut and 14 plants closed by 2012.

Ford is the world’s third-largest automaker and the U.S.’s second-largest. However it has in recent years been struggling with poor profitability and shrinking market shares. In 2005 it lost $1.6 billion and recently the company reported a second quarter loss of $254 million and a 34% year-year decline in sales for the month of July.

George Pipas, director of sales analysis at Ford, points to rising gas prices having negative impact on the sale of the companies &lt;a href="w%3ASUV"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; lines as well as its sales leader, the &lt;a href="w%3AFord%20F-Series"&gt;F-series pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; as being the direct cause of the latest initiative.

So far the following plants are thought to be affected: 

<ul>

The eruption of volcano &lt;a href="w%3ATungurahua"&gt;Tungurahua&lt;/a&gt; on August 16 destroyed several small villages in the &lt;a href="w%3AEcuador"&gt;Ecuadorian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AAndes"&gt;Andes&lt;/a&gt;. At least 6 people have been killed and about 4000 residents of the affected area have been evacuated.

The 5,023 m high volcano spat lava, stones and ash for several hours on Wednesday night. A 10km high ash cloud spread over an area of 740 by 180 km. Towns like &lt;a href="w%3AAmbato"&gt;Ambato&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3ARiobamba"&gt;Riobamba&lt;/a&gt;, 30 km away from the volcano have been covered with up to 5cm of ash. &lt;a href="w%3APyroclastic%20flows"&gt;Pyroclastic flows&lt;/a&gt; descending on the northwestern slopes of the volcano left a path of destruction behind. 

At least seven small villages and hamlets have been completely destroyed. The ash and rocks blocked the Chambo and the Peula river and the road Ambato - &lt;a href="w%3ABa%C3%B1os"&gt;Baños&lt;/a&gt;, one of the main connections between the &lt;a href="w%3AGeography_of_Ecuador%23La_Sierra_.28the_highlands.29"&gt;Ecuadorian&lt;/a&gt; highlands and the &lt;a href="w%3AGeography_of_Ecuador%23El_Oriente_.28the_East.29"&gt;Amazon region&lt;/a&gt;. The Institute for Geophysics has lost an important part of its equipment installed on the slopes of Tungurahua, limiting their capability to monitor the volcanic activity.
The Hydroelectric power plant &lt;a href="w%3AAgoyan"&gt;Agoyan&lt;/a&gt; near Baños has been shut down since Wednesday night. On Thursday, air traffic in the whole country was limited due to ash layers on several airports. On Thursday the provinces of &lt;a href="w%3AChimborazo%20Province"&gt;Chimborazo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATungurahua%20Province"&gt;Tungurahua&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACotopaxi%20Province"&gt;Cotopaxi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABol%C3%ADvar%20Province%20%28Ecuador%29"&gt;Bolivar&lt;/a&gt; have been declared a disaster area. Losses in agriculture due to the ash cover are estimated at $150 Million.

On Friday, volcanic activity decreased to a calm that remained into Saturday evening, but the Ecuadorian Institute for Geophysics warns that a further eruption may be imminent.

In 1999, after a long period of rest, the volcano started an eruptive process that continues to this day. After the first eruptions in October 1999 that produced a major ash out-fall and led to the temporary evacuation of more than 25,000 inhabitants of Baños and its surroundings, the activity continued on a medium level. In May 2006 it increased dramatically culminating in violent eruptions on July 14 and August 16.

<h1>Australia's &quot;most powerful&quot; windfarm approved</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australia%27s%20%26quot%3Bmost%20powerful%26quot%3B%20windfarm%20approved&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The government of &lt;a href="w%3AVictoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; has announced plans to build what it says will be Australia's "most powerful wind farm." Planning Minister &lt;a href="w%3ARob%20Hulls"&gt;Rob Hulls&lt;/a&gt; has given the go ahead to a new $380 million wind farm at Mount Gellibrand in the state's south-west. 

"I'm pleased to announce that I have approved Australia's most powerful and Victoria's largest wind farm to date," Mr Hulls said. "This project is expected to create anywhere between 110 and 120 jobs during construction and up to 25 full time positions during the life of the wind farm," he said.

The massive wind farm will be located 120&amp;nbsp;km west of &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, close to the regional centre of &lt;a href="w%3AColac"&gt;Colac&lt;/a&gt;. The wind farm comprises 116 turbines of the 2 MW class - with an overall capacity of 232 MW. The wind farm will produce over 700,000 MWh annually of clean energy which is enough to supply approximately 132,000 Victorian households. German company Pro Ventum International is undertaking the project

Minister Hulls said only nine objections had been lodged against the project. Local landowner Tim Gore, who plans to have 32 turbines on his property, said he was not concerned about potential noise from the turbines. Pro Ventum International say they will commence work on an Environmental Management report the next few weeks. 

Wind farm critic Tim Le Roy said there was no environmental benefit from the project at all and the Victorian government would better spend its money on &lt;a href="w%3AGeothermal%20power"&gt;geo-thermal energy&lt;/a&gt;. 

The turbines, each 125 metres tall, will be visible from the &lt;a href="w%3APrinces%20Highway"&gt;Princes Highway&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href="w%3AGeelong"&gt;Geelong&lt;/a&gt; and Colac, sited at the foot of Mount Gellibrand.

In October last year, Colac Otway council's chief executive officer, Tracey Slatter, said the proposal would benefit the shire: "...we're looking at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and with the demand of energy set to increase it is important that we do consider these renewable energy sources," she said.

<h1>Virtual orchestra opens in London</h1>

A virtual orchestra opened in London on August 19th 2006 outside the Royal Festival Hall on London's South Bank. But unlike a normal orchestra, this one features 58 specially designed cube-shaped seats which activate a musicical note. As more people sit down on the seats, more of the score is revealed. 

The music will be added to an online sample library. Jude Kelly, Artistic Director of South Bank Centre, said: "This is exactly the way we are looking at developing our site by fusing the community with the artistic world of ideas and technology in our many versatile spaces." 

Alistair Mackie, chairman of the Philharmonia Orchestra, said: "Central to the Philharmonia Orchestra's vision is exploiting new media to take music out to the widest possible audience, breaking down the barriers which have stood in the way of their access and enjoyment." 

Bethany, aged 10, went to the orchestra launch and she said: "It is a good experience. You get to see what it's like to be in a real orchestra." One of the main aims of the virtual orchestra is to get more people interested in classical music.

Every Saturday, a musician from the Philharmonic Orchestra will be visiting and they will bring their sound recording equipment.

Two men who were reportedly seen acting suspiciously on a flight bound for Manchester had to be taken off the plane, it has emerged today.

According to &lt;a href="w%3AMonarch%20Airlines"&gt;Monarch Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, a number of passengers informed staff of their worries surrounding the pair’s behaviour in Malaga on Wednesday. As the passengers' requested, the two men were then removed from the Airbus A320, which was carrying 150 people. 

They were then questioned by police for several hours and allowed to fly back to the United Kingdom at the end of the week. 

A Monarch Airlines spokesman said: "There were two passengers on the flight who came to the attention of the other people because they were apparently acting suspiciously. The flight attendants were sufficiently concerned to alert the crew who in turn informed the security authorities at Malaga airport." 

According to reports, the men were of Asian appearance, and their alleged suspicious actions have not yet been revealed.

&lt;a href="w%3APatrick%20Mercer"&gt;Patrick Mercer&lt;/a&gt;, a homeland security spokesman for the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, told the ♡❤Mail on Sunday♡❤ today: "For those unfortunate two men to be victimised because of the colour of their skin is just nonsense."

Israel violated resolution 1701 yesterday when troops from the Matkal, a special forces elite unit, launched a commando raid near the &lt;a href="Hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt; stronghold of Baalbek, in the Beka valley, according to Kofi Annan. One Israeli soldier was killed and two injured. Three Hezbollah members were killed according to Lebanese security officials.

Spokesman Mark Regev defended the action, saying "Israel reserves the right to act in order to enforce the spirit of the [UN] resolution,". The resolution called for a cessation of all hostilities, and an arms embargo. The Israeli Prime minister, Ehud Olmert justified the attack, stating that it was intended to prevent the supply of new weapons and ammunition to Hezbollah.

"The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about a violation by the Israeli side of the cessation of hostilities as laid out in Security Council resolution 1701," said a UN spokesperson. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general said violations of the resolution like Israel's "endanger the fragile calm that was reached after much negotiation and undermine the authority of the Government of Lebanon." He called on all parties "to respect strictly the arms embargo, exercise maximum restraint, avoid provocative actions and display responsibility in implementing resolution 1701."

The man being held in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion of murdering six-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AJonBen%C3%A9t%20Ramsey"&gt;JonBenét Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; more than ten years ago has started his extradition flight to the &lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;. 

Forty-one year-old &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Mark%20Karr"&gt;John Mark Karr&lt;/a&gt;, an American school teacher, is flying on Thai Airways Flight 748 from Bangkok to Los Angeles International Airport. According to Thai police, he is being accompanied by American security officials. 

Lt Gen Suwat Thamrongsrisakul, from the &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; immigration police, said: "He is very calm, and not scared. He said was ready to go back home."

In a press conference on Wednesday, Karr confessed to killing the child beauty queen by accident. "I was with JonBenét when she died. I loved JonBenét. She died accidentally. I am so very sorry for what happened to JonBenét. It's very important for me that everyone knows that I love her very much, that her death was unintentional, that it was an accident." 

Despite his confession, Karr's then ex-wife said that he was in &lt;a href="w%3AAlabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt; with her when the murder occurred.

JonBenét was found beaten and strangled in her Colorado home on the day after Christmas in 1996.

400 Australian soldiers have been officially farewelled at parade in &lt;a href="w%3ADarwin"&gt;Darwin, NT&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of their deployment to &lt;a href="w%3A2001%20war%20in%20Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. Wishing the soldiers well, Defence Minister &lt;a href="Brendan%20Nelson"&gt;Brendan Nelson&lt;/a&gt; says there is a high risk associated with the mission. 

"We know that this is a dangerous mission but it's also an extremely important one," he said. "They will go beginning this week and be deployed over the next few weeks." 

The group will work around the southern &lt;a href="w%3AOruzgan%20Province"&gt;Oruzgan Province&lt;/a&gt;. Rising violence in the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; heartland province earlier this month prompted Australian &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Prime Minister John Howard&lt;/a&gt; to further strengthen the capability of the Reconstruction Task Force (RTF). Approximately 150 personnel will be added to the 240-strong force announced in May.

Defence says the RTF will form part of the Netherlands-led &lt;a href="w%3AProvincial%20Reconstruction%20Team"&gt;Provincial Reconstruction Team&lt;/a&gt; in the Oruzgan province under NATO.

More than 1800 people have been killed in fighting in Afghanistan this year, 92 of them foreign soldiers (12 being Canadian). A contingent of 190 Australian special forces, supported by a 110-member helicopter detachment, has suffered a steady flow of casualties since September year, with 11 wounded — a rate of one a month. The Age reports the Howard Government has "kept secret" how soldiers suffered the wounds, or the extent or nature of the wounds. 

Dr Nelson said the soldiers would perform command, construction, communications intelligence, protection and logistics support. "We must stick with our allies and stand up for our values," he said. He told the troops they would be "dealing with people who are fanatically opposed to our way of life and everything we stand for".

Dr Nelson says the Australian contribution will also include skills training for the local population to "ensure the benefits of the deployment continue long after our personnel have returned home."

&lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; man &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Thomas"&gt;Jack Thomas&lt;/a&gt; has been acquitted of terrorism offences in &lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Court%20of%20Victoria"&gt;Court of Appeal&lt;/a&gt;. His convictions for receiving funds from a terror group and using a false passport were quashed on Friday. Mr Thomas was earlier sentenced to five years in jail.

Jack Thomas, 33, known as "Jihad Jack" was convicted under new Australian anti-terror laws. He was found guilty in February of accepting cash and a plane ticket from an &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; agent in Pakistan. But was cleared of 'intentionally providing resources for al-Qaeda'. The former taxi driver was sentenced to five years in prison in March. 

The Court of Appeal ruled Thomas's interview with &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; (AFP) in Pakistan was inadmissible. Thomas appealed his conviction on the grounds that interviews conducted in Pakistan after his arrest in 2003 breached Australian law and should not have been allowed as evidence at his trial. 

He was interviewed without access to a lawyer, having already been interrogated during two months in custody in Pakistan. Mr Thomas' lawyers argued that he was earlier threatened with torture from foreign security agencies.

His lawyer said Mr Thomas, who is married and has three children, accepted the money and plane ticket because he wanted to return home. Mr Thomas said he never had any intention of becoming an al-Qaeda operative. 

Lawyer Rob Stary said Thomas wanted to thank his legal team and staff at a hospital he had spent the past several months in psychiatric care. "He's in a debilitated condition as a result of what's transpired," Mr Stary said. 

Liberty Victoria president Brian Walters, SC, welcomed the decision, saying: "We believe that the Court of Appeal has righted a great injustice."

Prosecutor Nick Robinson is calling for a retrial based on a television interview with the ABC. The defence counsel has labelled the submission "bloody-minded." Rob Stary said the defence team would counter with arguments that prosecutors withheld a statement from a prisoner now held overseas. "The AFP has withheld important information that would have contradicted other evidence," he said.

<h3>More "terrorism" claims</h3>
Thomas' brother, Les, who took part in a protest rally outside &lt;a href="w%3ABarwon%20Prison"&gt;Barwon Prison&lt;/a&gt; this weekend in support of 13 detainees facing charges of "terrorism", said the 13 Melbourne men faced a similar predicament to his brother. 

Les Thomas said the 13 were victims of a government "scare campaign" and "media demonisation" and were being held in solitary confinement in Barwon's high security Acacia Unit, despite not being convicted of any crime. He said the men faced greater "persecution" than he claimed his brother had faced because most were of Middle Eastern background. "These people have not been convicted of any crime, but they're already being punished in extremely punitive circumstances," said Les Thomas.

Ten of the 13 were arrested in pre-dawn police raids in Melbourne and Sydney last November, and another three were arrested in March this year. 

Jack Thomas was the first person to be convicted under the controversial new &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20anti-terrorism%20legislation%2C%202004"&gt;Australian anti-terror legislation&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Australia to detain Burmese boatpeople on Nauru</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australia%20to%20detain%20Burmese%20boatpeople%20on%20Nauru&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Eight Burmese &lt;a href="w%3ABoat%20people"&gt;boat people&lt;/a&gt;, who arrived off &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20Australia"&gt;Western Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s Ashmore Reef last week, say they wish to claim refugee status. The group of 8 men, aged between 24 and 40, are being held in detention on &lt;a href="w%3AChristmas%20Island"&gt;Christmas Island&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20government"&gt;Australian Federal Government&lt;/a&gt;. They will be sent to &lt;a href="w%3ANauru"&gt;Nauru&lt;/a&gt; after identity interviews and medical checks are completed.

According to ♡❤The Age♡❤ newspaper, the men are from a refugee camp on the Thai-Burmese border, and may be from the &lt;a href="w%3AKaren%20people"&gt;Karen&lt;/a&gt; tribe, who are battling Burma's brutal military Government. Karen rebels have been at war with the central Government for 57 years. 

An Immigration department spokesman confirmed that the eight men claimed to be from &lt;a href="w%3ABurma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;. Two of the men have contacted immigration lawyers, seeking assistance with asylum claims. David Manne, from Melbourne-based Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, said the other six were likely to do the same. "There's a very strong likelihood that they are genuine refugees," he said. 

The men were first spotted by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Customs%20Service"&gt;Australian Customs Service&lt;/a&gt; at Ashmore Reef, 610km north of &lt;a href="w%3ABroome"&gt;Broome&lt;/a&gt;, WA on August 13. They were sent by Navy vessel to Christmas Island - 2,400 km northwest of &lt;a href="w%3APerth%2C%20Western%20Australia"&gt;Perth, WA&lt;/a&gt;. The men have been held since Friday as part of the Howard Government's &lt;a href="w%3APacific%20Solution"&gt;Pacific Solution&lt;/a&gt; to keep asylum seekers out of the country. 

In 2005, the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Multicultural%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Department of Immigration&lt;/a&gt; began construction of an &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20immigration%20detention%20facilities"&gt;Immigration Reception and Processing Centre&lt;/a&gt; on Christmas Island, due for completion late in 2006. The facility is estimated to cost $210 million, and will contain 800 beds.

<h3>No Legal Recourse for Burmese</h3>

The news of the boat people's arrival became public last week as &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;Prime Minister John Howard&lt;/a&gt; scrapped controversial new migration laws. The proposed laws would have excised the Australian mainland for immigration purposes. 

&lt;a href="w%3AAshmore%20Reef"&gt;Ashmore Reef&lt;/a&gt;, already excised from &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia%27s%20migration%20zone"&gt;Australia's migration zone&lt;/a&gt;, means the men have no legal entitlement to be brought to Australia for processing. They have no access to the Australian court system to argue their claims or contest the rulings of the Immigration Department.

Mr Manne said he was concerned that the circumstances of the men's confinement could hamper their attempts to communicate with lawyers. He said the Burmese men should be afforded the same rights as the West Papuans or Vietnamese asylum-seekers who recently made it to Australian shores. "It's absolutely crucial these people be given a fair go, so that they can actually speak with us properly about the issues," he said. Mr Manne says he has made several requests of the Department of Immigration in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;.

"They're asylum seekers... they believe that they'd be persecuted if sent to Burma, and we have agreed to act on their behalf." He was unable to say whether the group was dropped off by &lt;a href="w%3APeople%20smugglers"&gt;people smugglers&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="w%3AAmanda%20Vanstone"&gt;Immigration Minister Senator Amanda Vanstone&lt;/a&gt; claims. 

"What we do know is they're seeking refugee status, that is, protection from brutal human rights abuse," he said. The Burmese regime has recently waged an aggressive attack on Karen insurgents - forcing thousands of villagers to hide in the jungle or seek refuge in Thailand. There are 140,000 refugees in seven camps along the Thai-Burma border.

&lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Nettle"&gt;Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle&lt;/a&gt; says the government must allow the Burmese group to be brought to Australia to process the asylum-seeker's claims. "The government needs to ensure that all asylum seekers are offered legal support," she said. "The best way to ensure the Burmese asylum seekers have full access to their lawyer is to bring them to Australia while their asylum claims are assessed."

<h3>Nauru</h3>

Meanwhile the near-bankrupt Nauru Government has urged Australia to "speed up asylum seeker processing" in their country. Nauru says Australia is taking far too long to process asylum seekers. Currently two refugees remain on Nauru - both Iraqi men. The men have been held in detention on the remote tiny island for five years.

According to ♡❤The Age♡❤, the Nauru Government has approved a plan to impose financial penalties on Australia if asylum seekers are forced to languish on the near-bankrupt island. The report says if they have not been processed and either returned or resettled within three months, their visas will have to be renewed each month, with the cost increasing by $500 for each renewal.

Nauru's Foreign Minister David Adeang raised serious concerns about the mental state of the detainees. He says Muhammad Faisal's condition worsened sharply after he was re-interviewed by &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Security%20Intelligence%20Organisation"&gt;ASIO&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Adeang has asked for the Government to evacuate the Mr Faisal immediately, he says he is also concerned about the mental health of the other Iraqi man left on Nauru. The Australian Government claims advice from ASIO that the man may be a "security threat."

Nauru is the world's smallest island nation, covering just 21 km². Since 2001 it has accepted aid from the Australian government. In exchange for this aid, Nauru houses an 'offshore' detention centre for Australia.

The Ministry of Defence has tonight confirmed that a British soldier has been killed whilst fighting with insurgents in southern Afghanistan. 

The unnamed troop was killed in a gun battle with Taleban forces in the volatile Helmand province at around midday local time. 

A spokesman from the Ministry of Defence said: “The soldier died as a result of injuries sustained during the contact. Three other British soldiers received minor injuries.” The MoD also said that they are in the process of informing the soldier’s family about his death.

Defence Secretary Des Browne said: "I was deeply saddened to be informed of the death today of a British soldier and the injuries of three others as they supported the NATO mission in Afghanistan," he said. "I wish to express my sincere condolences to their families and friends. My thoughts are with them at this difficult time."

So far, twenty British armed forces personnel have died in Afghanistan.

Today, it has been reported that around seventy Taleban fighters were killed when they clashed with Afghan security forces and Nato-led troops.

On August 9 in the Polish city of &lt;a href="w%3APozna%C5%84"&gt;Poznań&lt;/a&gt;, Krysztof Wantoch-Rekowski, an anti-hunger, anti-war campaigner from the international &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20Not%20Bombs"&gt;Food Not Bombs&lt;/a&gt; network was detained by police.

He was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment on the charge of "destroying" his identity card, which is a criminally punishable action under Article 276 of the Polish &lt;a href="w%3ACriminal%20Code"&gt;Criminal Code&lt;/a&gt;.

In a press statement made on August 15, supporters said that Wantoch-Rekowski did not destroy his card, he only stuck a "paper illustration" on it to prevent it from falling apart (♡❤"podkleił 'papierową ilustracją' swój rozpadający się ze starości dowód"♡❤). Typical (old-style) Polish identity papers are made of paper and soft carton and must be carried at all times.

Wantoch-Rekowski's supporters claim that his detention is an example of the "absurdity" of an increase in imprisonment rates against "the homeless, the unemployed and those living on the margins of society" which has taken place, according to them, since the &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202005"&gt;parliamentary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APolish%20presidential%20election%2C%202005"&gt;presidential elections in late 2005&lt;/a&gt; were won by the right-wing &lt;a href="w%3ALaw%20and%20Justice"&gt;Prawo i Sprawiedliwość (PiS)&lt;/a&gt; party and one of its leaders, &lt;a href="w%3ALech%20Kaczy%C5%84ski"&gt;Lech Kaczyński&lt;/a&gt;. 

The number held in prison in Poland increased by 5% from about 83,000 to about 87,000 in the first six months of 2006, making it one of the highest imprisonment rates in the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;. The imprisonment level in Poland increased 100% since the &lt;a href="w%3AHistory%20of%20Poland%20%281989%E2%80%93present%29"&gt;post-communist epoch, beginning in 1989&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Demand for biofuel irrigation worsens global water crisis</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Demand%20for%20biofuel%20irrigation%20worsens%20global%20water%20crisis&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

A report by the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational_Water_Management_Institute"&gt;International Water Management Institute (IWMI)&lt;/a&gt; says rising demand for irrigation to produce food and biofuels will aggravate scarcities of water. "One in three people is enduring one form or another of water scarcity," states the report compiled by 700 experts.

IWMI warns there has to be a radical transformation in the management of water resources - citing as examples Australia, south-central China, and last year’s devastating drought in India. Report authors claim that the price of water could double or triple over the next two decades. The report, backed by the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited_Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; and farm research groups, shows that globally, water usage had increased by six times in the past 100 years and would double again by 2050 - driven mainly by irrigation and demands by agriculture.

Record oil prices and concerns about rapid onset &lt;a href="w%3AClimate_change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; are driving more countries to produce &lt;a href="w%3ABiofuel"&gt;biofuels&lt;/a&gt; - from sugarcane, corn or wood - as an alternative to &lt;a href="w%3AFossil_fuel"&gt;fossil fuel&lt;/a&gt;. "If people are growing biofuels and food it will put another new stress," says David Molden, who led the study at the &lt;a href="w%3ASri_Lanka"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;-based IWMI. "The big solution is to find ways to grow more food with less water. Basically, more crop per drop," Molden said. "The number one recommendation... is to look to improve rain-fed systems in &lt;a href="w%3ASub-Saharan_Africa"&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASouth_Asia"&gt;South Asia&lt;/a&gt;."

The report says conquering hunger and coping with an estimated 3 billion more humans by 2050 will result in an 80 percent increase in water use for agriculture. Irrigation absorbs around 74 percent and is likely to surge by 2050.

"We will have to change business as usual in order to deal with growing scarcity," said Frank Rijsberman, director general of the IWMI, of the report released at the 2006 "World Water Week" conference in &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;. Solutions included helping poor countries to grow more food with available fresh water via simple, low-cost measures, a shift from past policies that favoured expensive dams or canals, the report said.

According to Rijsberman, there are two types of shortages: those observed in regions where water is over-exploited, causing a lowering of groundwater levels and rivers to dry up; and those in countries lacking the technical and financial resources to capture water - despite its abundance. 

Billions of people in Asia and Africa already faced water shortages because of poor water management, he said. "We will not run out of bottled water any time soon, but some countries have already run out of water to produce their own food," he said.

The report said that a calorie of food took roughly 1 litre of water to produce, with a kilo of grain needing only 500-4,000 litres compared to a kilo of industrially produced meat taking 10,000 litres.

"Without improvements in water productivity the consequences of this will be even more widespread water scarcity and rapidly increasing water prices." Rijsberman said water scarcity in Africa was caused by a lack of infrastructure to get the water to the people who needed it. "The water is there, the rainfall is there, but the infrastructure isn't there," Rijsberman told reporters. 

Other recommendations for certain regions include the extension and the improvement of agriculture using rainwater, the introduction of cereal varieties that need less water as well as the development of irrigation systems.

But the priority, Rijsberman stresses, is to change mentalities and often outdated government policies. "Government policies and their approach to water are probably the most urgent that need changing in the short term," he said. 

There is, he says, enough land, water and human capacity to produce enough food for a growing population over the next 50 years, but one of the challenges is to provide enough water for agriculture without damaging the environment. "Agriculture is driving water scarcity and water scarcity is driving environmental degradation and destruction," he said.

In Australia last week, Rijsberman said he would "not be surprised to see the price of water double or triple over the next two decades."

<h1>NASA chooses Woomera, South Australia for rocket launch site</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=NASA%20chooses%20Woomera%2C%20South%20Australia%20for%20rocket%20launch%20site&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

NASA has announced that rockets will be launched from &lt;a href="w%3AWoomera%2C%20South%20Australia"&gt;Woomera&lt;/a&gt; in outback &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; to service the &lt;a href="International%20Space%20Station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; (ISS) &amp;mdash; starting in 2008. &lt;a href="NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; has selected two American companies to launch rockets from the Woomera base. Rocket Plane Kistler and Space-X will conduct orbital flight tests and commercial operations. The Woomera site would also be used to launch cargo such as fuel and food to the ISS as often as every two weeks.

Woomera, named for an &lt;a href="w%3AWoomera"&gt;Aboriginal spear-throwing tool&lt;/a&gt;, was originally involved in testing of long-range missiles and rockets for Britain during the Cold War. The site was also recently used by the Australian government to &lt;a href="w%3AWoomera%20Immigration%20Reception%20and%20Processing%20Centre"&gt;incarcerate asylum-seeking refugees&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="SpaceX"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ARocketplane"&gt;Rocketplane-Kistler&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AOklahoma%20City"&gt;Oklahoma City&lt;/a&gt;, will share up to $US500 million in NASA seed money to develop their launch vehicles. NASA has stated it wants commercial firms to take over ISS transportation services after the space shuttle fleet is retired in 2010.

SpaceX, owned by Internet entrepreneur and &lt;a href="PayPal"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; founder Elon Musk, made its launch debut in March with the &lt;a href="w%3AFalcon%201"&gt;Falcon 1 rocket&lt;/a&gt; but the vehicle failed shortly after lift-off. The two companies secured the NASA contract to demonstrate its "commercial orbital transportation services". Kistler has scheduled the first launch of its &lt;a href="w%3AK-1%20Vehicle"&gt;K-1&lt;/a&gt; rocket from Woomera in late 2008.

Kistler said work on a $100 million launch site at Woomera was expected to start in October. The site should be completed by the end of next year. Kistler Woomera chairman Alan Evans said the contract meant "hundreds of jobs" would be created within the aerospace industry in South Australia. "The jobs will be within the high-level end of the spectrum of the space industry, which is great news for the state," he said.

K-1 will have crew transportation capabilities, meaning the Woomera site could see astronauts leave from Australia. The site may also be used to transport satellites into space for telecom companies and defence organisations. The K-1 launch vehicle is designed to be re-used 100 times. It is powered by liquid-propellant engines and lands back on Earth with the help of parachutes and airbags.

"Woomera was chosen because it can be used for polar and equatorial launches and because of its clean land areas," Mr Evans said. "Kistler has already spent US$700 million developing this idea."

Rocketplane Kistler say their K-1 launch system will also provide low cost space access for satellites and research payloads. Their sub-orbital XP Spaceplane is 50% complete, and scheduled for first flight in late 2008. The K-1’s hardware is 75% complete &amp;mdash; and is scheduled for first flight in 2008.

The annual '&lt;a href="w%3AUndie%20500"&gt;Undie 500&lt;/a&gt;' road-trip, in which 400 &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Canterbury"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Otago"&gt;Otago university&lt;/a&gt; students took part, turned into a riot when students started throwing bottles around and lighting fires. The riot started in Dunedin on Castle Street North, which is known for its parties. In the Undie 500 road-trip, students go from &lt;a href="w%3AChristchurch"&gt;Christchurch&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ADunedin"&gt;Dunedin&lt;/a&gt; and along the way stopping at five pubs. It is the biggest &lt;a href="w%3Apub%20crawl"&gt;pub crawl&lt;/a&gt; of its kind in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralasia"&gt;Australasia&lt;/a&gt;.

The police found students watching the &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Zealand%20Fire%20Service"&gt;New Zealand Fire Service&lt;/a&gt; battling the fires they had lit.

Maggie Kleist, an Otago University student, said: "The police were so outnumbered, and people were just getting each other worked up more and more and more and it was yeah, pretty intense."

&lt;a href="w%3Ariot%20police"&gt;Riot police&lt;/a&gt; then turned up to move students away with batons but more bottles were thrown and more fires were lit. "At this stage police moved the crowd with the use of batons," Allan Grindell, Police Senior Sergeant said.

Paul Chong, Students Association president, said: "Couch-burning and bottle-smashing aren't serious enough offences to justify bringing in baton-wielding police."

Allan Grindell said: "Many in the crowd were heavily intoxicated and drinking from bottles and cans."

An unnamed student said: "This is just out of control."

Sergeant Wayne Pitcaithly says 95 arrests were made. The police continued to dispersed crowds for 45 minutes.

"People were throwing bottles, everyone was getting arrested, the riot police came, and they were hitting people with their batons," said Canterbury Student Josh Binns.

The legendary &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;Indian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AShehnai"&gt;shehnai&lt;/a&gt; maestro &lt;a href="w%3ABismillah%20Khan"&gt;Ustad Bismillah Khan Sahib&lt;/a&gt; (March 21, 1916 - August 21, 2006) was the third classical musician to be awarded the &lt;a href="w%3ABharat%20Ratna"&gt;Bharat Ratna&lt;/a&gt; (in 2001), the highest civilian honour in India. According to the Indian Home Ministry officials, the musical maestro would be given a state funeral. Flags would be flown at half mast in all the government buildings as part of the mourning. 

He also had the distinction of heralding in India's Independence, mesmerizing audiences before the start of Pandit Nehru's speech and the unfurling of the tricolour on August 15, 1947. Ustad Bismillah Khan Sahib was one of the few people to be awarded all the top four civilian awards.

A woman and her three children, aged five to 11, have been found dead in their home in Cheadle Hulme in &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Manchester"&gt;Greater Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, prompting a murder investigation by police. 

Officers were summoned to the scene on Turves Road last night after neighbours became concerned about the well being of the house's inhabitants. Greater Manchester Police had to break into the house, and when they got in, they discovered four bodies which had been there for some time. 

In a press conference this afternoon, Greater Manchester Police said that they want to trace Rheman Arshad, a thirty six year-old male who was living with the four victims in the house. Detective Superintendent Martin Bottomley said: "We are keen to trace the fifth occupant of the house, Mr Arshad. We are concerned for his welfare. We are treating it as a murder inquiry, therefore we need to speak to him. There are a number of strands to the inquiry but the most immediate one is to trace the whereabouts of Mr Arshad."

He has been missing for four weeks, and Mr Bottomley have asked him or anybody who has seen him to contact them. "We have alerted every police force in the country. We want to speak to him in relation to the horrendous events in the house. We are liaising with forces abroad." Mr Arshad, a local taxi driver, may be driving a BMW 320 series sports coupe. 

Mr Bottomley said the cause of death is not yet known. He also said that post-mortem examinations are yet to take place. "The bodies may have been lying there for up to four weeks and you can imagine in the hot weather we have been faced with a devastating scene." 

This morning, a spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said: "A murder investigation has been launched after four bodies were discovered in Cheadle Hulme. Police were called to the address and officers attended and forced entry. They discovered four bodies, believed to be a woman and three children. It is believed the bodies may have been there for some time."

Winifred Lomax, a seventy four year-old retired shop worker who lives on Turves Road, said: "They had not been seen for a few weeks and someone looked through their letterbox and there was a nasty smell."

This afternoon, an eyewitness told Wikinews what she saw: "I walked past the scene earlier today, and the terrace house was surrounded with tape. Several officers in white forensic suits were examining the barricaded area and a huge white tent was erected in front of the house's front door."

The woman and her children are thought to be Asian.

&lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Mark%20Carr"&gt;John Mark Carr&lt;/a&gt;, the man who has been accused of killing six-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AJonBen%C3%A9t%20Ramsey"&gt;JonBenét Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; ten years ago, has arrived in the US after being extradited from &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AThailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;.

The forty-one year-old American schoolteacher was escorted by US security officials from Bangkok, but officers from the &lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20Police%20Department"&gt;Los Angeles Police Department&lt;/a&gt; accompanied him after he went through customs. He was then whisked off in a helicopter and taken to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in downtown Los Angeles. 

"Mr. Karr is expected to remain in the custody of local authorities while the Boulder District Attorney's Office seeks his extradition to Colorado," a statement from the &lt;a href="w%3AImmigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement"&gt;Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; said.

In a press conference on Wednesday, Karr confessed to being with JonBenét when she died, adding that her death was an accident. "I was with JonBenét when she died. I loved JonBenét. She died accidentally. I am so very sorry for what happened to JonBenét. It's very important for me that everyone knows that I love her very much, that her death was unintentional, that it was an accident."

Despite his confession, Karr's then ex-wife said that he was in Alabama with her when the murder occurred.

JonBenét was found beaten and strangled in her Colorado home on the day after Christmas in 1996.

Thirty-four people had to be evacuated this lunchtime after a fire started on a &lt;a href="w%3ALorry"&gt;lorry&lt;/a&gt;, which was being transported on a freight train in the &lt;a href="w%3Achannel%20tunnel"&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AEurotunnel"&gt;Eurotunnel&lt;/a&gt;, the operator of the Channel Tunnel, said all services had to be suspended this afternoon due to the small blaze in which nobody was hurt.

John Keefe, a spokesman for Eurotunnel, said: "It was a freight shuttle going through with about 34 people on board, who have all been evacuated safely.

"Eurotunnel is conducting checks of the tunnel and its equipment. Once these investigations are completed, Eurotunnel will commence a progressive restart of commercial services." 

The company also said services through the Tunnel would hopefully 
resume later today. "Unfortunately with this being a very busy time of year, it's going to take a few hours to clear the backlog once we've got started again," said Mr Keefe. 

A &lt;a href="w%3AEurostar"&gt;Eurostar&lt;/a&gt; spokesman said: "We are advising passengers to avoid travelling today if possible. Tickets can be exchanged for another day." 

The Channel Tunnel is a 31 mile long rail tunnel beneath the English Channel which connects Folkestone in Kent to Coquelles near Calais in northern France.

According to published reports and information posted to the Writely.com website and blog, the service has re-opened its Writely account beta program.

The &lt;a href="w%3AWritely"&gt;Writely&lt;/a&gt; beta was launched in August 2005,
and &lt;a href="w%3AGoogle"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; acquired the Writely technology on March 9, 2006. The core Writely service provides a free online collaborative word processor which is widely viewed as an alternative and potential competitor to more traditional locally-run word processing software.

The service has claimed that thousands of people had previously registered for the service exclusively driven by word-of-mouth and the Writely blog. Shortly after being acquired by Google, the company greatly restricted the service and maintained a future customer sign up waiting list.

Writely re-opened its beta service on August 17, 2006. According to the company's blog, the timing of the re-launch was due to a positive product review on CNET combined with persistent email requests asking the service to re-open. Additionally, Writely is planning to make its service available as part of the Google Account sign-in sometime on the near future.

A number of industry sources have speculated on why Google chose to issue a press release on August 17, 2006 touting its involvement in a Star Trek convention and failed to release any information on the Writely beta re-open. While Google has proven reticent to release and publish product information in the past, the lack of any published information for the Writely beta re-open has generated a greater than usual number of web posts and articles addressing the subject.
