<h1>Jyllands-Posten reconsiders printing holocaust denial cartoons</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten"&gt;Jyllands-Postens&lt;/a&gt; (The Jutlands Post)'s editor-in-chief, &lt;a href="w%3ACarsten%20Juste"&gt;Carsten Juste&lt;/a&gt; has scrapped supposed plans to publish holocaust-denial cartoons simultaneously with &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian paper &lt;a href="w%3AHamshahri"&gt;Hamshahri&lt;/a&gt;. The message currently on the front page of their website indicates that the news was "based on an over-interpretation of a statement made by Culture Editor Flemming Rose". Juste emphasizes that the cartoons will under "no circumstances" be published by the paper prior to seeing them.

Jyllands-Posten, Denmark's most widely-circulated newspaper, has come under criticism for its original publishing of the so-called "Mohammad Cartoons". Originally published with the intent of sparking debate about the image of Mohammad, the &lt;a href="w%3ALast%20Prophet"&gt;Last Prophet&lt;/a&gt; of Islam, the images have instead sparked a series of dangerous, sometimes bloody riots throughout the Middle East following their republishing in newspapers throughout Europe and the Arab world. 

Hamshahri's announcement concerning the publishing of cartoons questioning the reality of the &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; came in response to the cartoons, which have been viewed as highly offensive and insulting to many Muslims throughout the Middle East and the world at large. The announcement follows a brief period earlier this year when the government of Iran faced worldwide rebuke when its President, &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;, referred to the Holocaust as a myth fabricated by the West to secure a Jewish homeland in the state of Palestine.

According to the Associated Press, the Post's culture editor, &lt;a href="w%3AFlemming%20Rose"&gt;Flemming Rose&lt;/a&gt; had offered to print the planned holocaust-denying cartoons commissioned by Iranian paper Hamshahri as a response to the riot-provoking cartoons depicting the prophet &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed"&gt;Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;. In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;'s American Morning on Wednesday, Rose said that Jyllands-Posten would contact Hamshahri to print the pictures the same day.

&lt;a href="w%3AAlan%20Shalleck"&gt;Alan Shalleck&lt;/a&gt;, 76, associate in the children’s book series &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ACurious%20George"&gt;Curious George&lt;/a&gt;, was found dead in his driveway 8 February 2006. Covered in black garbage bags, his body had been disregarded by neighbors and passersby who presumably mistook it for a collection of refuse.
Speculation has risen around the case due to the seemingly odd coincidence of Shelleck's death with the Curious George film's Friday release. As of yet, investigators are not releasing any solid information involving the case. 

A Boynton Beach, Florida Border’s Book and Music store employee, Shelleck had been missing from work for two days prior to the discovery of the body by Burt Venturelli, a maintenance worker at the retirement complex Shelleck called home. 

Venterelli told ♡❤Sun-Sentinel♡❤ reporters “I went to drag it this morning and said, ‘This is a body, this isn’t garbage.”’ He also stated that Shelleck's body was naked from the waist up and that there was "blood all over the place."

With an increase in the number of insurgent attacks targeting teachers, many schools in &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;'s southern province of &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt; have closed. The country's interior minister, Kongsak Wanthana, has given assurances that security measures will be strengthened and teachers will be able to return to work.

School closures were initially sparked with the shooting of four teachers at Ban Lue Mu school in Yala late last week. These had been teachers awaiting a military escort home, a fifth teacher was shot on his way home. Approximately 250 primary schools in Yala province were closed as teachers were afraid to go to work. The three southernmost provinces have problems in ensuring adequate educational cover as many teachers in the violence-torn area have sought transfers elsewhere in the country.

Attacks on those viewed as supporting the government have seen a recent increase in the area, with insurgents mounting attacks on motorcycles during the day in addition to remotely detonated bomb attacks. Since the start of February, the death toll exceeds one person per day. Generally identified as having started in early 2004, the insurgency in the predominantly &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; provinces that border &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt; are reported to have resulted in a death toll exceeding 1,000.

<h1>Bird Flu found in Africa</h1>

The H5N1 &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; virus, also known as Bird Flu, has been found in &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; by Italian scientists. Tests done on samples in a laboratory confirm that the strain is the one that can kill people, although no human cases have been reported said the Paris-based United Nations body. This is the first time is has appeared on the continent.

Reports say tests of the virus closely resemble the virus in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;. The virus has been discovered in poultry flocks in a large Nigerian farm. "It is the first report of the disease in Africa," the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health (&lt;a href="w%3AOIE"&gt;OIE&lt;/a&gt;) said on Wednesday.

"It's going to be very difficult to mount an eradication campaign," said Dr. Alex Thiermann, president of the OIE's international animal health code, from &lt;a href="w%3AParis%2C%20France"&gt;Paris, France&lt;/a&gt;. "With what we have today, it is a highly pathogenic H5N1 - the same, or very closely related to the previous ones," said Thiermann. He also added, "a full genetic analysis of sample viruses is expected to be completed by late Thursday."

Maria Zampaglione of the Paris-based OIE said "An outbreak has been detected. A local poultry farm keeping 46,000 birds was affected, of which 42,000 were infected and 40,000 of those, died." The farm is located in Jaji, which is a village in the northern state of Kaduna.

"The farm is located near the Niger Delta, one of the largest over-wintering areas for wild birds in Africa." said Thiermann.

Quarantine measures on the control and movement of poultry have been taken, and the farm has been disinfected said Nigerian authorities.

"However, it is too early to say how serious the outbreak is and how big its spread could be," said Ilaria Capua of the Italian bird flu centre in Padua. "We have to be cautious in evaluating the possible implications of these findings."

In &lt;a href="w%3ARome%2C%20Italy"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;, Samuel Jutzi, a director of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization said, "if the situation in Nigeria gets out of control, it will have a devastating impact on the poultry population in the region. It will seriously damage the livelihoods of millions of people and it will increase the exposure of humans to the virus."

"When you have 46,000 chickens in a house, usually you have some degree of biocontainment...So these (chickens) are not likely to be the ones to first encounter migratory waterfowl," Thiermann said. 

Wildlife circles have been debating on whether or not wild birds are spreading the virus around the globe. Experts believe they are playing a role but most believe poultry movement, poultry products and poultry manure is the main cause of the spreading of the virus.

"But probably not in this case," said Thiermann. "While it's too early to blame the wildlife, it's very likely to be in an area that's remote enough that it's not likely to be associated with international trade."

OIE spokeswoman Zampiglione also said, "Experts had been fearing an African outbreak for months. The conditions there are more likely to lead to contagion from birds to man."

&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Deutsch"&gt;George Deutsch&lt;/a&gt;, a controversial &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; appointee at &lt;a href="w%3ANASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, resigned his post as press officer the same day that &lt;a href="w%3ATexas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University"&gt;Texas A&amp;M University&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that he never graduated from the school. The resume of the 24-year old had claimed he received a "Bachelor of Arts in journalism, Class of 2003."

Mr. Deutsch gained notoriety when it was revealed he had instructed NASA web site designers to insert the word "theory" at every mention of the Big Bang, on the grounds that it was a religious matter. "This is more than a science issue, it is a religious issue. And I would hate to think that young people would only be getting one-half of this debate from NASA." said Mr Deutsch in an e-mail.

Mr. Deutsch also told public affairs workers to limit reporters' access to &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Hansen"&gt;James Hansen&lt;/a&gt;, a top climate scientist and longtime director of NASA's &lt;a href="w%3AGoddard%20Institute%20for%20Space%20Studies"&gt;Goddard Institute for Space Studies&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Hansen's lectures and papers were also to have been censored by public affairs workers. Dr. Hansen stated he would ignore the restrictions, which came through the less official channels of phone calls.

&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20D.%20Griffin"&gt;Dr. Michael Griffin&lt;/a&gt;, NASA chief, appeared to back Dr. Hansen's claims of internal censorship, when he sent a strongly worded email message to all NASA employees stating "It is not the job of public-affairs officers to alter, filter or adjust engineering or scientific material produced by NASA's technical staff." Several other NASA employees reported similar tampering after the incident. NASA personnel told the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ that "Mr. Deutsch played a small but significant role in an intensifying effort at the agency to exert political control over the flow of information to the public."

&lt;a href="w%3AClimate%20science"&gt;Climate science&lt;/a&gt; has long been linked with the space program because many of the underlying mathematical modeling techniques were originally developed to help understand the atmospheres of other planets, such as Venus.

Mr. Deutsch was given his job in NASA's public affairs office in Washington after working on President Bush's re-election campaign and inaugural committee.

Reports say that an office building for members of the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="United%20States%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was evacuated after tests detected the presence of a "possible &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anerve%20agent"&gt;nerve agent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ". The hazardous materials division has since determined that it was a false alarm. It is possible that a cleaning solvent could have tripped the sensor.

"At approximately 1830 (2330 GMT) this evening (Wednesday) we received an alarm at the Capitol Police for a nerve agent in the attic of the Russell Building," Capitol Police Sergeant Kimberly Schneider said. "This is on the Senate side of the Capitol. At this time we have received negative results on this testing. At this time, nobody has indicated that there are any symptoms present... a runny nose or something of that nature. That would indicate a presence of a nerve agent and nobody has reported that thus far."

Eight senators and over 200 senate staff members were evacuated into an underground garage next to the building until 2130 (230 GMT). The people were then briefed on the situation and screened; however, no one showed symptoms of exposure to a biological agent.

The &lt;a href="w%3AHome%20Office"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt; department of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; government have released statistics claiming an 11 percent drop in violent crime over the 2005 Christmas period, with a 21 percent drop in 'serious violent crime'. 

This drop in violent crime coincided with a six week police campaign, aimed at reducing the level of alcohol related disorders. Home Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Clarke"&gt;Charles Clarke&lt;/a&gt; said "[these] figures are a credit to all those committed to tackling alcohol related disorder. Delivering results, reducing violent crime and underage sales in local communities takes us another step closer to removing such unacceptable behaviour from our streets."

The police campaign followed the introduction of new UK licensing laws which allow pubs and bars to potentially open for longer than the previous 11PM curfew, with '24 hour' opening a possibility. Critics, including the opposition Conservative party, had predicted that this would lead to a rise in drunken behaviour. Culture Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ATessa%20Jowell"&gt;Tessa Jowell&lt;/a&gt;, a strong proponent of the new laws, said of the statistics "thanks to the new licensing laws, the police and local authorities have joined forces to use tougher powers to deal with the problem at the source."

The Conservative Party are accusing the government of spinning the statistics, suggesting that the drop in violent crime was due to the police campaign. Shadow Home Secretary &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Davis"&gt;David Davis&lt;/a&gt; said "what this shows is that if you put more bobbies on the street you will cut crime. However these figures are a result of a six-week crack down on violence which cost £2.5m - what happens when this money runs out?"

In the past year, Mona Sahlin, the &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt; Minister for Sustainable Development, announced plans to break the nation's dependency on oil by 2020, without building new nuclear plants. She stated that, “There shall always be better alternatives to oil, which means no house should need oil for heating, and no driver should need to turn solely to petrol.”

As part of the program, Sweden has recently organized the roles of various agencies in the expansion of its wind power program. 

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is concerned the oil supply is peaking and that future high oil prices could cause global economic recession. Sweden currently gets the majority of its electricity from nuclear and hydroelectric power, and 26% of all its energy comes from renewables (6% is the EU average). Sweden's long term aims for energy independence are partially rooted in the 1970s oil shocks.

In related news, Exxon Mobil Senior Vice President Stuart McGill claimed on Tuesday that energy independence for the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; "is simply not feasible in any time period relevant to our discussion today." He stated "No combination of conservation measures, alternative energy sources and technological advances could realistically and economically provide a way to completely replace those imports in the short or medium term." McGill proposed "energy interdependence" as the solution best suited to importing nations.

Two &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n women, 23 and 27, have tested positive for the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of &lt;a href="w%3Aavian%20influenza"&gt;avian influenza&lt;/a&gt;. They are in "serious condition but seem to be improving," said Hariadi Wibisono, a senior health ministry official. They are being treated in the designated bird flu hospital, Sulianti Suroso in eastern &lt;a href="w%3AJakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that both women had contact with infected poultry. This brings Indonesia's number of confirmed cases of the virus to 25.

A 26 year old female farmer in &lt;a href="w%3AFujian%2C%20China"&gt;Fujian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; whose surname is ♡❤Lin♡❤, also has the deadly H5N1 virus. She was admitted to the hospital in January, but it was only confirmed on Wednesday that she had the virus. Some of the people that have come in close contact with the woman are under observation by local health officials. Her current condition is reported as stable. This is China's eleventh confirmed case of the virus. 

Julie Hall of the Beijing-based World Health Organization said that the latest patient was "highly likely to have had contact with sick animals," but the &lt;a href="w%3AWHO"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt; is still waiting for information on how she could have gotten the disease.

Some experts believe migrating birds from China's Qinghai Lake nature reserve are spreading the virus; however, there others who believe it's shipments of poultry and poultry products along with poultry manure.

As avian influenza confirmed in &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, "We shouldn't assume that is just in Nigeria" said David Nabarro, the United Nations' coordinator for bird flu and pandemic influenza. "The outbreak in Nigeria means [we] have another central point for the virus to become embedded into the poultry population."

About 20 countries have reported outbreaks of the virus in birds which has sickened people who come in contact with the infected birds. If the rate of human infection continues to increase, so does the chance the virus will change into a form easily transmitted by humans.

The Amtsgericht &lt;a href="w%3ABerlin-Charlottenburg"&gt;Berlin-Charlottenburg&lt;/a&gt; has repealed an injunction that it had issued in January against Wikimedia Deutschland, the &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation.

The court found that identifying the deceased Boris Floricic as the hacker &lt;a href="w%3ATron%20%28hacker%29"&gt;Tron&lt;/a&gt; in an article of the German Wikipedia does not constitute a breach of the personal rights of Floricic or his parents, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. It said that those rights only protect deceased persons from libelous or disfiguring characterisations of their biography; this is not the case in the Wikipedia article. The court also found that the personal rights of the parents were not infringed upon as well, as the article does not enable anyone to identify them.

The lawyer of the parents, Friedrich Kurz, called the decision "arbitrary", "tangibly illegal" and a "misjudgment" as his clients have a unique surname which would make it possible to connect Tron to them. He announced that he would appeal the decision, even to the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights"&gt;European Court of Human Rights&lt;/a&gt; if necessary.

The chairman of Wikimedia Deutschland, &lt;a href="w%3Ade%3ABenutzer%3AKurt%20Jansson"&gt;Kurt Jansson&lt;/a&gt;, said they are happy that the court "confirmed our interpretation of the law completely" and hoped that the attorney of the plaintiffs would refrain from taking further legal actions due to the "decidedness" of the ruling.

The court in Berlin had issued an injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland on January 17th, banning them from redirecting &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wikipedia.de"&gt;www.wikipedia.de&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http%3A//de.wikipedia.org"&gt;de.wikipedia.org&lt;/a&gt;.

The bill will be debated in the House of Representatives on February 14, 2006.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Neil%20Entwistle%2C%20suspect%20in%20murder%20of%20wife%20and%20child%2C%20arrested%20in%20England&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3ANeil%20Entwistle"&gt;Neil Entwistle&lt;/a&gt; was named as a "person of interest" by authorities for the murder of his wife Rachel and nine-month-old baby daughter Lillian in their &lt;a href="w%3AHopkinton%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Hopkinton, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; home. Both were shot to death and found under a pile of blankets in the bedroom. The family had just moved into the home and had only been living there for ten days. Entwistle has not been in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; since the murders.

However; it has been confirmed that Entwistle was arrested in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; on two counts of murder, and one count of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition on Thursday. Until today he has not been a suspect.

"Entwistle was arrested by British authorities and faces murder charges," said Emily LaGrassa, spokeswoman for the Middlesex District Attorney's office. "He is in police custody in England at this time." Entwistle was arrested at around noon (7 a.m. ET). 

A statement was released by the family of Rachel Entwistle saying, "The family is deeply saddened at the arrest of Neil Entwistle for the murders of Rachel and Lillian. We are heartbroken at the loss - to understand how this happened." 

District Attorney Martha Coakley, of &lt;a href="w%3AMiddlesex%20County%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Middlesex County, MA&lt;/a&gt;, said that Entwisle could have been planning a murder-suicide, but abandoned the suicide part of the plot after carrying out the murders. 

"On Thursday night, (January 19) Rachel was alive and had spoken with family members," said Coakley. She also says that authorities believe, "at some time on Friday morning, Neil Entwistle, with a firearm that we believe he had secured some time before that from his father-in-law Joseph Materazzo, shot Rachel Entwistle in the head and then proceeded to shoot baby Lillian, who was lying on the bed next to her mother. We believe possibly that this was intended to be a murder suicide, but we cannot confirm that. The murder was effected, the suicide was not. Forensic evidence linked the gun to Mr. Entwistle and his wife, but she had never used it (the gun). What we believe happened next was that Neil Entwistle returned the gun to his father-in-law's home, that he then made preparations to leave the country."

She also stated that Entwistle was observed leaving Boston's &lt;a href="w%3ALogan%20international%20Airport"&gt;Logan International Airport&lt;/a&gt; on a flight to England. He had purchased the ticket on the phone.

"He was then in Worksop with his parents. Authorities went to the UK to pursue that investigation. They returned, the investigation pursued. We explored motive, with witnesses, with information from searches, internet capabilities," Coakley added. "Based upon that information and forensic information late Tuesday afternoon that linked the 22 handgun owned by Joseph Materazzo both to Neil Entwistle and to Rachel, we believed we had probable cause to seek an arrest warrant for Neil Entwistle's arrest."

&lt;a href="w%3AFramingham%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Framingham&lt;/a&gt; District Court issued the warrant for his arrest last night. 

Entwistle has been at his parents home in England since last month and reportedly refused to cooperate with Massachusetts investigators when they arrived in England to question him about the deaths.

So far, Entwistle has not spoken in public nor did he attend the funerals of his wife and child.

<h3>Entwistle does not consent to extradition</h3>

When appearing before the Bow Street Magistrates' Court Entwistle said that he will not voluntarily consent extradition to the U.S. "at this stage."

District judge Timothy Workman said during the hearing, "I am remanding you in custody at this stage. I am not granting you bail because at this moment I don't have sufficient information to make that decision." 

When Entwistle was asked if he understood the charges that had been filed against him, he said, "I do."

Court was adjourned until Friday.

&lt;a href="Germany"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; police are embarrassed after a 27-year-old man, whom they had just booked for burglary, walked out of the police station and stole an unmarked police vehicle. "It's not just unusual, it's embarrassing," said a spokesman for police in the town of Eschwege.

It is thought that the man stole the key from an officer at the station. When he was booked and released, he was observed by officers getting into the unmarked police car. The officers gave chase resulting in the man's re-arrest. Three vehicles (including the stolen police car) were damaged during the pursuit. The stolen vehicle was recovered upon arrest of its unlawful driver.

A massive demonstration march on Thursday of over half a million Shiite Muslims in &lt;a href="w%3ABeirut"&gt;Beirut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; heard &lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20Nasrallah"&gt;Sheik Hassan Nasrallah&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of &lt;a href="w%3AHezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;, tell the U.S. President George W. Bush and his Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, to "shut up" after they reportedly accused Iran and Syria of fueling protest demonstrations over the &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;Muhammad cartoons&lt;/a&gt;. 

"Defending the prophet should continue all over the world. Let Condoleezza Rice and Bush and all the tyrants shut up. We are an Islamic nation that cannot tolerate, be silent or be lax when they insult our prophet and sanctities. We will uphold the messenger of God not only by our voices but also by our blood," Nasrallah told the crowd, estimated to be 700,000 (police said the figure was likely to be even higher).

The Hezbollah leader also told the crowd that protests must continue until laws are passed in Europe banning insults to Muhammad. 

NATO defence ministers are in Brussels meeting to discuss the controversy's security implications. The upheavals of protest in Afghanistan are blamed for the deaths of 10 people in that country this week. Muslim protests have spread across the Middle East, Asia and Africa. 

Speaking Wednesday at a joint news conference in Washington with the new Israeli Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni, the U.S. Secretary Rice said, "Iran and Syria have gone out of their way to inflame sentiments and to use this to their own purposes and the world ought to call them on it."

Her comments were preceded earlier that day President Bush who also called for an end to the violence: "I call upon the governments around the world to stop the violence. To be respectful. To protect property. To protect the lives of innocent diplomats who are serving their countries overseas."

&lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash;

On a rainy Saturday, February 4, 2006, several thousand protesters gathered in a corner of the Ellipse in Washington, D.C. to protest the current administration’s stance on the &lt;a href="War%20in%20Iraq"&gt;War in Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and to demand that &lt;a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; be &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMovement%20to%20impeach%20George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;impeached&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or resign as Commander-in-Chief.

Saturday’s demonstration that lasted through five hours of rain ended with a march around the &lt;a href="US%20White%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; was organized by a group called World Can’t Wait – Drive out the Bush Regime. The group organized a smaller rally near the Capital during the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AState%20of%20the%20Union"&gt;State of the Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .
Demonstrators came from as far away as Hawaii; New York sent 12 buses. However the crowd was significantly less than the 30,000 protesters that organizers had anticipated. The actual numbers were more like 2,000 to 3,000 and varied with the strength of the rain. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Park%20Police"&gt;Park Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; refused to comment on the size of the crowd. 

A series of speakers included a 96 year old great grandmother, and a &lt;a href="Georgetown%20University"&gt;Georgetown&lt;/a&gt; law student that led a protest against a speech given by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Attorney%20General"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="Alberto%20Gonzales"&gt;Gonzales&lt;/a&gt;. The speeches were followed by the dropping of a 30 foot wire effigy of President Bush from the stage. The crowd, which had already been in a frenzy, chanted in unison: "Bush step down! Bush step down!" After it fell, protesters kicked and cursed at the fallen mass of chicken wire and construction paper.

Some protesters got more visual and burned a mock US flag that contained corporate logos instead of stars as at least one protester yelled that the flag burners were "&lt;a href="FBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; Plants."

The rally ended with a march around the White House through closed streets escorted by the Capital Police and the Uniformed Division of the United States Secret Service. A group of ten to fifteen counter-protesters waited in front of the White House and although cursing was traded, the obvious police presence kept the scene peaceful.

In an odd move, &lt;a href="ESPN"&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;'s parent company, &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Walt%20Disney%20Company"&gt;The Walt Disney Company&lt;/a&gt;, traded the contract of NFL play-by-play analyst &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Michaels"&gt;Al Michaels&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20Universal"&gt;NBC Universal&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for various sports considerations and &lt;a href="w%3AOswald%20the%20Lucky%20Rabbit"&gt;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3Aanimated%20cartoon"&gt;cartoon&lt;/a&gt; character &lt;a href="w%3AWalt%20Disney"&gt;Walt Disney&lt;/a&gt; created 79 years ago but lost to &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20B.%20Mintz"&gt;Charles B. Mintz&lt;/a&gt; when he created his own studio. Oswald is generally understood to be the precursor to &lt;a href="w%3AMickey%20Mouse"&gt;Mickey Mouse&lt;/a&gt;.

Oswald the Lucky Rabbit was created in 1927 by Walt Disney for Charles B. Mintz, and distributed by Universal Studios. Disney directed 26 Oswald cartoons before a budget dispute with Mintz forced Disney to leave and create his own studio. Mintz, however, owned the rights to Oswald, and kept the character. Oswald soon was bought by Universal, who would continue to create Oswald cartoons on a regular basis until 1938. Most of the succeeding Oswald cartoons were directed by &lt;a href="w%3AWalter%20Lantz"&gt;Walter Lantz&lt;/a&gt;, who would later become famous for Universal's most well-known cartoon character, &lt;a href="w%3AWoody%20Woodpecker"&gt;Woody Woodpecker&lt;/a&gt;.
Michaels, 61, will again join &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Madden"&gt;John Madden&lt;/a&gt; in the analyst booth for NBC's &lt;a href="w%3ANBC%20Sunday%20Night%20Football"&gt;Sunday Night Football&lt;/a&gt; coverage beginning in the 2006 season. This follows the announcement the previous day that &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20Theismann"&gt;Joe Theismann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMike%20Tirico"&gt;Mike Tirico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Kornheiser"&gt;Tony Kornheiser&lt;/a&gt; would be in the broadcast booth for &lt;a href="w%3AMonday%20Night%20Football"&gt;ESPN Monday Night Football&lt;/a&gt;. It was previously believed that Theismann and Michaels would announce Monday Night Football for ESPN.

In consideration for releasing Micheals from his ABC contract, Disney received the rights to the early Disney-directed Oswalds, while ESPN received the following rights from NBC Sports:

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Australian%20Governments"&gt;Council of Australian Governments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (COAG) will meet in &lt;a href="Canberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; today for its first meeting of 2006. Members of COAG are the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APremiers%20of%20the%20Australian%20states"&gt;State Premiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory"&gt;Australian Capital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Northern%20Territory%2C%20Australia"&gt;Northern Territory&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AChief%20Minister"&gt;Chief Ministers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and the President of the Australian Local Government Association. COAG is chaired by the Prime Minister.

On the agenda is a wide range of issues such as health, economic reform, regulation, and education.

The state leaders (all of whom are members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), met last night to develop a strategy for dealing with &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, Australia's Prime Minister.

<h2>Health</h2>
COAG is expected to agree on a AU$1 Billion health package. The centrepiece of the package will be reforms to mental health care. Other elements of the package include the introduction of the national health call centre network, accelerating the implementation of a national electronic health records system, and reducing the number of disabled young people living in nursing homes

Mr Howard said yesterday "I want all of the heads of government of this country to understand it's a serious issue and the Australian public will expect no less than a coordinated genuine commitment by all of us to try and solve the problem."

Mr Howard told federal parliament yesterday part of the problem can be attributed to the closing of mental health institutions. "There is abundant evidence that that process went too far, and whilst I do not advocate and I do not believe Australia would benefit from turning back the clock to the institutions of old, nor can we as a decent society tolerate having people with mental illnesses out in the community unsupported and untreated." said Mr Howard.

The Mental Health Council of Australia's Chief Executive, John Mendozza said there needs to be a massive injection of funds into mental health care and it needs to happen quickly.

"Any Australian who has attempted to access mental health services through the public system will have found that unless they are extremely unwell, and that is a danger to themselves or the community, they probably won't gain admission to those public mental health services, and that simply is not good enough." said Mr Mendozza.

The Prime Minister has also accused &lt;a href="cannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; of playing a role in Australia's mental health problems. "I think we are paying a dreadfully heavy price for the abuse of what was so called recreation and socially acceptable drugs despite the clear evidence, unaccepted until a few years ago, that these things were doing massive damage within our community," Mr Howard told parliament yesterday.

"I will ask them (the state premiers) to agree with me that part of the solution to the mental health problem is a tougher line on marijuana, and I imagine they will agree with me," said Mr Howard.

Mr Howard signaled that he supported the move in &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; to increase penalties for cannabis, especially hydroponic cannabis which the NSW government claims is stronger. "I welcome the change in direction of many of the states," he said.

The Mental Health Council of Australia has warned the government of over-estimating the role of cannabis in mental health. John Mendozza told &lt;a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt; "I don't think we should overstate the role of cannabis in the nation's mental health crisis. It is a factor, but it is not the reason that we now face a mental health crisis."

"The real reason is that governments collectively have under-funded the investment in community services for well over a decade and hence we have a large unmet need in the community." said Mr Mendozza.

The national health call centre network was announced by the federal government in January as a means of reducing the number of people going to hospital emergency departments for treatment. Under the plan call centres would be set up with trained nurses who could advise people on the best cause of action to take for a wide variety of health problems.

Under the health package the introduction of an electronic health records system known as HealthConnect will be fast tracked. Governments promise that HealthConnect will improve the quality and safety of health services by providing timely and accurate medical history on a patient. Participation in HealthConnect will be voluntary and patients may withdraw at any time.

<h2>Education</h2>
COAG will also discuss setting up a national inquiry into early childhood education. The inquiry is expected to explore the possibility of free access to pre-school education. COAG documents warn "By the time Australian children enter formal education, they have very different levels of preparedness for life and learning,"

"Australia's investment in early childhood development before school entry remains low by international standards." says the documents.

COAG is also to explore how to implement a system to ensure trade qualifications gained in one state can be used in another. Under the current system, the majority of trade qualifications gained through state technical colleges are not recognised in other states. Only the small percentage of courses which award certificates under the Australian Qualifications Framework are recognised nationally.

The federal government has also indicated that it wants $11 million spent over four years ease skills shortages in trades such as plumbing and electrical. Federal opposition education spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin said "Eleven million over four years will have little or no impact on the raging skills crisis which is hurting Australian businesses and families,"

"It will provide just 900 training (places). The Australian Industry Group has predicted that by 2010 we will need 100,000 extra skilled tradespeople if we are to address the skills crisis."

<h2>Economic Reform and Regulation</h2>
The topic of economic reform is expected to arouse debate at the meeting today as the federal, state and territory governments argue about how to fund it.

&lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;n Premier &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Bracks"&gt;Steve Bracks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been one of the key figures behind the plan which has been worked on by state and federal officials over the past past six months.

From 1995 until 2004, the federal government made payments to state and territory governments for reaching milestones in deregulating their economies. If a state failed to meet a required reform as determined by the National Competition Council payments were withheld until the milestone was met. John Howard abolished the scheme stating that the states and territories already received enough revenue through the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGoods%20and%20Services%20Tax"&gt;GST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The states are said to be arguing that the federal government should be sharing the revenue achieved through their reforms.

It is expected the plan will fail to reach agreement and will have to be considered by a working party.

Federal treasurer &lt;a href="Peter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt; has said that economic reform should be bought about by abolishing eight state and territory port and export authorities and create a single national regulatory authority.

The treasurer also indicated he would like to see utility regulation become a federal responsibility.

"Australia would be better served if it could get a uniform system of regulation in relation to ports and port access, in relation to access regimes generally, and in relation to utilities," Mr Costello said.

Archaeologists have discovered a tomb, referred to as &lt;a href="w%3AKV63"&gt;KV63&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AValley%20of%20the%20Kings"&gt;Valley of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;. It is the first such discovery since &lt;a href="w%3AHoward%20Carter"&gt;Howard Carter's&lt;/a&gt; 1922 discovery of &lt;a href="w%3ATutankhamun"&gt;Tutankhamun&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb. The discovery was made by a team from the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Memphis"&gt;University of Memphis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="w%3AZahi%20Hawass"&gt;Zahi Hawass&lt;/a&gt;, head of the &lt;a href="w%3ASupreme%20Council%20of%20Antiquities"&gt;Supreme Council of Antiquities&lt;/a&gt; said in a statement that five intact &lt;a href="w%3Asarcophagus"&gt;sarcophagi&lt;/a&gt; that all contained &lt;a href="w%3AMummy"&gt;mummies&lt;/a&gt; and 20 large storage jars that were sealed with pharaonic seals had been recovered.

American archaeologist &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20Weeks"&gt;Kent Weeks&lt;/a&gt;, who was not part of the team but had seen photographs of the site, told the Associated Press that ♡❤"It could be the tomb of a king's wife or son, or of a priest or court official"♡❤. The find refutes the long held belief that the Valley of the Kings has little left to discover. According to Weeks: ♡❤"It's ironic. A century ago, people said the Valley of the Kings is exhausted, there's nothing left,"♡❤ he said. ♡❤"Suddenly Carter found Tutankhamun. So then they said, 'Now there's nothing to find.' Then we found &lt;a href="w%3AKV5"&gt;KV5&lt;/a&gt;. Now we have KV63."♡❤

KV63 is located in the area between &lt;a href="w%3AKV10"&gt;KV10&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AAmenmesse"&gt;Amenmesse&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3AKV62"&gt;KV62&lt;/a&gt; (Tutankhamun), in the very centre of the Valley's eastern branch and near the main crossroads of the network of paths traversed by thousands of tourists every day. The tomb was found at a depth of some three metres beneath the ground. The burial site is believed to date from the latter portion of the &lt;a href="w%3AEighteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt"&gt;18th dynasty&lt;/a&gt; (ca. &lt;a href="w%3A14th%20century%20BC"&gt;14th century BC&lt;/a&gt;), but the occupants have not yet been identified.

&lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; won the opening RBS 6 Nations match 26-16 last Saturday. The match, pitting &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; vs. Ireland at Lansdowne Road, was not the game many thought it would be. The Italian side Captained by Marco Bortolami showed that the Azzuri were a force to be reckoned with. "In the first 20 minutes we really hadn't much ball and didn't get into many attacking positions. They got their confidence out of that and they took the game to us. It was an ugly game of rugby by any standards," said Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan.

The question to be asked is whether or not Italy played well, or Ireland played poorly. "If you go to the Stade de France and play like that you're going to get obliterated," stated Brian O'Driscoll the Ireland Skipper. Italian Boss Pierre Berbizier said, "Against the Irish we succeeded in stopping the opposing attacks." Staying confident of their impressive show against the Irish, Italy's squad to face England next weekend remains unchanged.

The phones of more than 100 people including the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Greece"&gt;Prime Minister of Greece&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AKostas%20Karamanlis"&gt;Costas Karamanlis&lt;/a&gt; and key ministers were tapped for a period of almost a year starting before the &lt;a href="w%3A%202004%20Summer%20Olympics"&gt;2004 Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. The illegal wiretapping was carried out by spy software installed in phone provider &lt;a href="w%3AVodafone"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt;'s central system and discovered when the company started receiving complaints from customers about their phone service last March. The case, as well as the government investigation that followed, became public last Thursday in the &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; press. 

While the government refutes main opposition party's &lt;a href="w%3APASOK"&gt;PASOK&lt;/a&gt; accusations of mishandling the investigation by keeping it secret, the identity of the culprits remains unknown, although both &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMI6"&gt;MI6&lt;/a&gt; agents are widely blamed. The Greek government has said four antennae near the US embassy in Athens were used to transmit the conversations recorded. The embassy is located at approximately the center of the surveillance triangle. On Thursday approximately 800 protesters in Athens marched peacefully to the US embassy and shouted anti-&lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; slogans while about 400 protesters in Thessaloniki clashed with the police, after trying to smash traffic cameras. 

The death of Vodafone employee Kostas Tsalikidis contributes to the espionage-mystery nature of the case. Tsalikidis, who was Vodafone Greece's head of network design at the time, was found hanged in his Athens apartment on March 9, 2005, two days after the illegal taps had been discovered. While his death was at first ruled as suicide, his family has filed a lawsuit claiming he was murdered. The lawsuit calls for his body to be exhumed, an autopsy to be performed and his apartment investigated. A check of emails on Vodafone's server was also requested in order to locate evidence of their deletion, and the company to give details on why they were deleted. His brother Panagiotis Tsalikidis has already given testimony quoting his brother's fiancée claiming that a few weeks before his death Tsalikidis told her that "Vodafone is in danger of closing down," and "leaving Vodafone is a life and death matter."

While the case continues to unfold, a poll shows a great majority of the Greek public believe the government has not revealed all the evidence pertaining to this case. Most also believe that foreign secret services, governments, and embassies are most likely responsible for the wiretaps. 

The government has not released all the names of the people that were victims of the illegal wiretapping. Government figures that were targeted include the ministers of foreign affairs, defense, public order and justice.

The 20 Olympic Winter Games are set to start today in &lt;a href="w%3ATurin%2C%20Italy"&gt;Turin, Italy&lt;/a&gt;.

Producers of the Olympics have promised, "rhythm, passion and speed," as an estimated 35,000 people will pile inside the stadium and nearly two billion will turn out for the events.

Dancers, abutting the majestic Alps, paid a tribute to seven nations, including &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, in the opening ceremonies wearing green sheaths and pulling fake cows on wheels. It was to pay homage to livestock and mountain life, and so the audience could cheer both, everyone was supplied with cowbells. Dancers then brought out big white bubbles which were stuck to their heads. Bacilli, who has performed in concerts for ♡❤U2♡❤ and ♡❤The Rolling Stones♡❤ said the balls signify snow.

Eight women, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; actress Sophia Loren, &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chilean&lt;/a&gt; writer Isabel Allende, &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;American&lt;/a&gt; actress Susan Sarandon, Nobel Peace-prize winner Wangari Maathai of Kenya, and three Olympic medal winners carried the Olympic flag. This was the first time ever that only women carried the flag.

At least 6,100 volunteers who worked an estimated 10,000 hours helped to organize and run the ceremonies.

Unfortunately, in the hours before the games were to start, eight cross-country skiers, a former gold medalist from Germany, and two Americans, were suspended for five days each after they failed blood tests. The tests say that they had elevated levels of hemoglobin, an enzyme within red blood cells that can increase endurance. However, the positives results could be due to the body's acclimation to mountain air, or dehydration. The American skiers are Kikkan Randall of &lt;a href="w%3AAnchorage%2C%20Alaska"&gt;Anchorage Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, and Leif Zimmermann of &lt;a href="w%3ABozeman%2C%20Montana"&gt;Bozeman, Montana&lt;/a&gt;.

According to a report by &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Nation%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;♡❤The Nation♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, the Science Ministry has ordered a halt to work on the much-delayed Ongkharak reactor.

The reactor, first commissioned from &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; firm &lt;a href="w%3AGeneral%20Atomics"&gt;General Atomics&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 by Thailand's Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAP) has had prolonged delays in the project and faced threats from activists.

Despite calls in 2002 for the reactor to be completed within two years, the reported position of the government now is to seek advice from the office of the Attorney General on how to proceed. Irregularities uncovered by the State Audit Commission may lead to cancellation of the contract and legal action taken against people believed to have been involved in corruption or abuse of authority.

A By-Election in the Scottish constituency of &lt;a href="w%3ADunfermline%20and%20West%20Fife%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Dunfermline &amp; West Fife&lt;/a&gt; has seen a once safe &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; seat won by the &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrats"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; party, despite a series of scandals rocking the UK's third party during their search to find a new leader.

The poll was called to replace the &lt;a href="wikt%3AMP"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARachel%20Squire"&gt;Rachel Squire&lt;/a&gt;, who died last month, and saw the Liberal Democrats' candidate &lt;a href="w%3AWillie%20Rennie"&gt;Willie Rennie&lt;/a&gt; overturn a Labour majority of 11,562 to defeat the Labour party candidate, &lt;a href="w%3ACatherine%20Stihler"&gt;Catherine Stihler&lt;/a&gt; (currently an &lt;a href="wikt%3AMEP"&gt;MEP&lt;/a&gt;) by 1,800 votes. The result will come as a blow to &lt;a href="w%3AChancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer"&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AGordon%20Brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in the constituency and represents the neighbouring area of &lt;a href="w%3AKirkcaldy%20and%20Cowdenbeath%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Kirkcaldy &amp; Cowdenbeath&lt;/a&gt;.

However, the result was also viewed as a blow for other parties: the &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20National%20Party"&gt;Scottish National Party&lt;/a&gt;, who came third in the General Election, could only increase their share of the vote by 2% and remain in third place, despite claiming that they were a close second during the campaign. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt;, buoyed by the election of &lt;a href="David%20Cameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; as Party Leader, saw their vote fall by 2.5% The &lt;a href="w%3AScottish%20Socialist%20Party"&gt;Scottish Socialist Party&lt;/a&gt; were also hit, registering a slight fall in their vote despite fielding a high-profile candidate in John McAllion, the former Labour MP and &lt;a href="wikt%3AMSP"&gt;MSP&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3ADundee%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29"&gt;Dundee East&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Illinois"&gt;University of Illinois&lt;/a&gt; student newspaper ♡❤The Daily Illini♡❤ has republished six of the Prophet Mohammed cartoons from the Jyllands-Posten in an editorial published on February 9, 2006.

Opinions Page editor for the Daily Illini, Chuck Prochaska said, "we felt this would be a perfect opportunity for us to have a free-speech debate about a clash of worlds we've had ever since 9/11. It just seemed people didn't have a grasp about why this controversy was going on. Everyone knew there were cartoons and that they were allegedly offensive, but they were very difficult to find (on the Internet) if you don't speak Danish." 

The decision to run the cartoon was reached after Prochaska and editor Acton Gorton discussed the controversy surrounding the cartoon in different humanities classes in the past few days.

Reactions to the cartoon were strong, Prochaska said; however, the controversy did not create any riots or produce any threats. He also stated that several &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Muslims&lt;/a&gt; called the paper's office to complain about the cartoon, but they were not threatening. "It's almost a split. A lot of people are saying 'Congratulations for having the guts to do this and defend the First Amendment.' Others are saying 'Just because you have the right to do this doesn't mean you should.'"

Some Muslim students voiced concern saying, "We don't understand why people have to see the images to understand (their offense)."

However, other &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim"&gt;Muslim&lt;/a&gt; students were not angry with the decision of the paper to print the cartoons. Bilal Aziz, a Muslim student at the university said, "I can see the images opening up further discussion on the Muslim religion." 

In a letter to the editor published February 10, Urbana-Champaign campus Chancellor Richard Herman noted his disappointment in the decision to publish the cartoons but encouraged students and the local community to exercise their rights to freedom of expression.

Some letters to the editor from Muslim students expressed their disappointment and outrage at the newspaper's decision. Other letters, including those from alumni, voiced their approval at the editors' courage to run the controversial cartoons.

So far, many national newspapers have declined to run the cartoons, and at the moment, only one other student newspaper in the whole country has run the cartoons in their paper.

Neil Entwistle, 27, appeared before a Magistrates' court today and agreed to extradition to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, where he will face double-murder and weapons charges. Entwistle is now the prime suspect in the killings of his wife Rachel, 27, and nine-month-old baby daughter Lillian. Both were shot to death and left under a pile of blankets in the bedroom of their &lt;a href="w%3AHopkinton%2C%20Massachusetts"&gt;Hopkinton, Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; home. 

District Judge Anthony Evans said in court, to Entwistle, "You are agreeing to be sent immediately to the US and there will be no extradition proceedings?" Entwistle replied, "that’s right, yes."

Ben Brandon, Entwistles council, said "Neil believes he will receive a fair and proper hearing in the US on these very serious allegations," and wishes to go back to the U.S. "as soon as possible. He is anxious that any delay could cause his late wife’s family, and his own, additional distress."

Earlier on Thursday, Entwistle had said before the court, that he did not agree to extradition "at this stage."

However; Entwistles lawyer said that "he never changed his mind. He was always inclined to consent to extradition. He was going to think about it overnight with our advice. And overnight, after reserving his position, he has consented."

Entwistle was reportedly planning a murder-suicide. Instead, police believe he fled to &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;, where he was subsequently arrested in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;.

If convicted of first-degree murder, Entwistle could face life in prison.

&lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt; underwent emergency surgery at Hadassah Medical Center in Israel to treat intestinal damage revealed by a recent computed tomography, better known as a CT scan. The Chief Surgeon said, "Sharon is out of danger, for the moment. His condition is stable and the surgery was a success." Sharon is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital.

Yesterday doctors treating Sharon had noticed a swollen abdomen and ordered a CT scan on his torso and found the damage to his intestine. Later tests had shown that part of the large intestine had developed necrosis and needed to be immediately removed.

Hospital director Shlomo Mor-Yosef stated a press conference that there were "no complications" during surgery. "His (Sharon's) key problem is lack of consciousness. There is no significant change in his condition. Doctors did not find any occluded artery and there were no blood vessels blocked. He is stable but in critical condition at this time and he is in no immediate danger at this moment."

Yosef also said that Sharon's sons and family had met earlier and decided to go forward with the surgery and treatment.

Doctors removed at least 50cm of Sharon's large intestine.

Yosef also said that possible reasons as to why Sharon's intestine was damaged were, "maybe infection or decline of blood supply to the intestine." Yosef also said that the surgery was both a "routine procedure" and "not a dramatic" one. "Hospitals perform these operations sometimes two or three times a day," he added.

Yael Bossem-Levy, a spokesman for Hadassah Medical Center said earlier that, "the prime minister's life is in danger. His condition is now very serious, or critical. Sharon's digestive tract has undergone severe deterioration while he's been unconscious, and there appears to be a blockage in his blood circulation. The restricted blood flow raised the possibility of necrosis, or death of tissue, in the intestines."

Levy also stated that Sharon's condition has "deteriorated to its most critical point since his admission."

The 77 year-old leader has been hospitalized since January 4th, after suffering a massive stroke which left him comatose. This is his seventh surgery since his hospitalization.

Sharon has been hospitalized for thirty-nine days, and has been on a feeding tube for two weeks.

Charles Gomersall, the director of intensive care at Hong Kong's Princess Margaret Hospital, told a symposium on bird flu that he "predicts will have few staff two weeks into an epidemic if do not have mechanisms in place to minimize the stress and effect on morale."

He said hospitals need to offer staff counseling and daily briefings in order to manage the stress.

H5N1 avian flu virus has mostly affected birds, but at least 88 people in seven countries have died since the re-emergence of the virus late 2003.

There is no evidence yet that the virus has mutated to point where humans can pass it on, but experts predict millions could die if it does.

Gomersall insists hospitals need properly equipped facilities and trained staff now. Once an epidemic starts there is only a very short time between when symptoms present and admission to intensive care.

Coming on the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; has said that if forced to limit its nuclear activities, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; will altogether abandon the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;NPT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Ahmad said that the nuclear program is a peaceful pursuit to better "industry, medicine and economy".
Addressing large crowds in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , he attacked the notion of a referral to the &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;United Nations Security Council&lt;/a&gt;, and the perceived bullying by the board of the &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;.
He further warned, in reference to Article IV of the NPT which allows for civilian development of nuclear energy, in exchange for nuclear weapons states disarming (Article VI), that "On the other hand, if we are seeing that in total disregard for our following these rules and regulations that you still push to impose on Iranian rights- understand that it will not be tolerated and that the nation of Iran will reconsider its policies".

Although the vast majority of sovereign states (187) are ♡❤party♡❤ to the NPT, Iran would join the small minority of states that are not party to the NPT. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; withdrew from the NPT on January 10, 2003. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIndia%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APakistan%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are not parties to the NPT. 

Having previously reiterated in 2004 that it would not leave the NPT, Iran performed a u-turn on its position towards treaty signatories, first showing signs during September 2005 when Iran's top nuclear negotiator that it would quit the NPT when &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Larijani"&gt;Ali Larijani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; warned that Tehran could quit the NPT if brought before the &lt;a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council"&gt;UNSC&lt;/a&gt;.

<h1>Craigslist sued for hosting discriminatory housing ads</h1>

&lt;a href="w%3Acraigslist"&gt;Craigslist.com&lt;/a&gt;, a popular free online classifieds site, has been sued for hosting discriminatory housing ads by the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Inc., a fair housing group.

The housing ads cited as objectionable included such statements as "NO MINORITIES," "Requirements: Clean Godly Christian Male," and "Only Muslims apply."

Stephen Libowsky, a lawyer for the housing group, said "Our goal is to have the Internet places like Craigslist treated no differently than newspapers and other media who have traditionally been posting real estate advertisements. All of the gains are going to get lost if the same rules don't apply."

Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster conceded "We admit that one or two postings per 100,000 are discriminatory" but explained that Craiglist's 19 employees could not physically screen the 8 million new ads posted each month. He continued, "Instead, we've done something much more powerful and effective, in providing our users with a flagging system whereby problematic ads are promptly removed by users themselves." Buckaster claimed the "NO MINORITIES" ad was removed within two hours.

Buckmaster wrote on the site that, "Though well-intentioned, this lawsuit misguidedly demands that we regress to primitive, mistake-prone, and wholly inadequate methods, methods which would actually be less effective in catching discriminatory ads than what we have in place currently, and which would vastly reduce the number of legitimate non-discriminatory ads that the site could process."

He continued, "Ironically, if this lawsuit were to succeed the net effect would be to deal a double blow to civil rights - by significantly reducing access to equal opportunity housing, and by undercutting our fundamental free speech rights - thereby doing a great disservice to the very persons these lawyers purport to represent."

Buckmaster also said "It is our understanding that the law is very clear to the effect that sites like Craigslist cannot be held legally liable for the content of postings submitted by end users." This claim appears based upon &lt;a href="w%3ASection%20230%20of%20the%20Communications%20Decency%20Act"&gt;Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act&lt;/a&gt; which states that "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."

Under section 7b of the web site's &lt;a href="w%3ATerms%20of%20Service"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; agreement, users are not allowed to post an ad "that violates the Fair Housing Act by stating, in any notice or ad for the sale or rental of any dwelling, a discriminatory preference based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap (or violates any state or local law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of these or other characteristics)".

&lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Fossett"&gt;Steve Fossett&lt;/a&gt;, 61, has broken the record for flying the longest nonstop flight in aviation history and has landed safely in England although, Steve Ridgeway chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, the company sponsoring Fossett's record bid said, "he burst two tires on landing and the poor &lt;a href="w%3AVirgin%20Atlantic%20GlobalFlyer"&gt;GlobalFlyer&lt;/a&gt; had to be dragged off the runway."

Fossett had to land at &lt;a href="w%3ABournemouth%20Airport"&gt;Bournemouth Airport&lt;/a&gt; in Dorset instead of his planned destination of &lt;a href="w%3AKent%20International%20Airport"&gt;Manston Airport&lt;/a&gt; in Kent, because of generator problems.

After the flight, Fossett told the press, "I was really lucky to make it here today, there was a lot going on. The tension of the final part really took it out of me, but I will be fine in the morning." 

Fossett broke the previous record of 25,361 miles (40,210 km) (set by &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Rutan"&gt;Dick Rutan&lt;/a&gt; flying the lightweight &lt;a href="w%3AScaled%20Composites%20Voyager"&gt;Voyager&lt;/a&gt; aircraft in 1986) when he passed over Shannon Ireland, even though he lost 750 pounds of fuel just after take-off from &lt;a href="w%3AKennedy%20Space%20Center"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. His record has been recorded to have been broken at; 11:59am on February 11, 2006, (EST). His trip has taken about 80 hours (3 1/2 days) and covered 26,389.3 miles (42,469 km).

The plane Fossett was flying is a lightweight experimental aircraft. The GlobalFlyer is the only plane to make a non-stop circumnavigation of the earth on one tank of fuel.

Fossett has broken 110 world records.

&lt;a href="w%3ASpaceX"&gt;SpaceX Corporation&lt;/a&gt; has postponed the launch of the maiden flight of their &lt;a href="w%3AFalcon%201"&gt;Falcon 1&lt;/a&gt; rocket again at their &lt;a href="w%3AKwajalein"&gt;Kwajalein&lt;/a&gt; launch facility. Although not as damaging as the previous delay on November 11, this is certainly a significant set back for &lt;a href="w%3AElon%20Musk"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;, the founder and CEO of SpaceX.

A full engine test was conducted on the rocket, and the launch pad equipment which holds the rocket on the launch pad after engine firing seemed to work as planned. This safety equipment is designed to keep the rocket from causing damage or being destroyed in the event that some equipment malfunction occurs immediately after the rocket engines start. Under similar circumstances with other rockets the entire rocket together with its payload would have been destroyed due to a computer report of malfunction.

The exact reasons for failure were not disclosed by SpaceX, but Elon Musk said on his web site, "I will post a longer update next week, after we have enough time to finish forensics of recent events and formulate next steps."

<h1>Protest held against Muhammad caricatures in Paris</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Protest%20held%20against%20Muhammad%20caricatures%20in%20Paris&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Several thousand Muslims protested today in &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the eastern city of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AStrasbourg"&gt;Strasbourg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , against the publication of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;caricatures of the prophet Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a Danish newspaper and the re-publication of some of these caricatures in French newspapers: the daily &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrance%20Soir"&gt;France Soir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the weekly &lt;a href="Charlie%20Hebdo"&gt;Charlie Hebdo&lt;/a&gt;.

The protesters consider that these caricatures insulted their prophet, and thus, they contend, their religion and themselves. Charlie Hebdo is a weekly paper known for its extremely acerbic positions against organized religion; it often mocks &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACatholicism"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the largest religious denomination in France.

Some banners claimed that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Afreedom%20of%20speech"&gt;freedom of speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; should not imply the possibility of insulting religious figures. Other banners claimed that French society was applying dual standards. Some protesters demanded a law against "islamophobia"; France does not have &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ablasphemy"&gt;blasphemy laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and has a tradition of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aanticlericalism"&gt;anticlericalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Many of the female protesters wore a scarf to hide their hair, and some wore a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ahijab"&gt;hijab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or veil. The French government enacted a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20law%20on%20secularity%20and%20conspicuous%20religious%20symbols%20in%20schools"&gt;law prohibiting conspicuous religious symbols in government-operated schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a move widely considered to be targeting the veil and scarf, which many consider a sign of subordination of females.

The protest was organized by Muslim associations from the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A%C3%8Ele-de-France"&gt;Paris region&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , most notably the Union of Muslim Associations from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASeine-Saint-Denis"&gt;Seine-Saint-Denis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Seine-Saint-Denis, a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ad%C3%A9partement"&gt;département&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a high proportion of immigrants, is notorious for social tensions. This is where the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005%20civil%20unrest%20in%20France"&gt;2005 civil unrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; started from.

In a related move, the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20Council%20of%20the%20Muslim%20Faith"&gt;French Council for Muslim Worship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CFCM), a private nonprofit considered by the French government to be its main contact with the Muslim community, is litigating against the newspapers, alleging the publication of the caricatures incited to religious hatred. Muslim associations attempted to prevent the publication of Charlie Hebdo, but their claim was rejected on procedural grounds.

The protest was followed at a distance by a large complement of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACompagnies%20R%C3%A9publicaines%20de%20S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9"&gt;CRS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other police forces. No notable incidents were mentioned.

<h2>Additional fake Jyllands-Posten cartoons circulating in the Middle East</h2>
In related news, it has come to attention that a number of additional cartoons not included in the Jyllands-Posten set may have had a role in bringing the issue to international attention. For example, three images which are reported to be considerably more obscene were portrayed in Gaza as if they had been part of the Jyllands-Posten set. One of the pictures, a photocopied photograph of a man with a pig's ears and snout, has been identified as an old Associated Press picture from a French "pig-squealing" contest, and makes no reference to Islam. It was reportedly circulated by Danish Muslims as if it was an anti-Islamic image. These and other images circulating around the Middle-East are partly responsible for much of the violent protest. The problem is being escalated by restrictions on the media in the Middle-East -- for example, attempts to accurately portray the Jyllands-Posten cartoons and paint an accurate picture of the situation in the Jordanian media led to the arrest of two Jordanian editors, and the pulping of many newspapers before they were distributed.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Kwan"&gt;Michelle Kwan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a figure skater on the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Olympic team, has pulled out of the &lt;a href="Olympic%20Games"&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; because of a groin injury. According to a newsbreak bulletin on &lt;a href="NBC"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;, she injured her right hip &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAnatomical%20terms%20of%20location"&gt;abductor muscle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in a fall during practice on Saturday. The muscle pain continued to worsen and at 2:45am she went to the team doctor. The team doctor determined this was a serious injury and Michelle made the decision to pull out of the Olympics and give the alternate Emily Hughes the chance to skate. 

Emily Hughes was contacted at 8:45pm Eastern time that she would be needed at the Games. She is scheduled to fly to Italy on Sunday. Emily Hughes is the younger sister of Olympic medalist &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASarah%20Hughes"&gt;Sarah Hughes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

According to the &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; News Agency &lt;a href="w%3ASondhi%20Limthongkul"&gt;Sondhi Limthongkul&lt;/a&gt;, an outspoken critic of the government and Prime Minister, may face legal action.

This would not be the first time the de-facto leader of the campaign to oust the Prime minister has faced legal action over his words. In 2005, a number of lawsuits were filed by the Prime Minister against Sondhi, most notable being a 1 billion baht suit in November. Thailand's King, &lt;a href="w%3ABhumibol%20Adulyadej"&gt;Bhumibol Adulyadej&lt;/a&gt; (Rama the ninth) made use of his 78th birthday speech to comment on the issue and advise that the government must accept some criticism. This resulted in the dropping of the lawsuits.

Sondhi's recurring open-air rallies and protests have made calls for Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; to resign or to be impeached. It is remarks made at a rally held this weekend at the Royal Plaza in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; that are under scrutiny by lawyers for the ruling &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Rak Thai&lt;/a&gt; party. Dr Surapong, who announced the party's investigation of the remarks, described them as "offensive" and "verbal abuse". He called for a halt to the accusations whilst a petition detailing alleged offenses of the Prime Minister was reviewed.

That petition was submitted for the attention of the King as the climax to Sondhi's last rally in Royal Plaza on February 5. After addressing a crowd estimated to number more than 100,000. Sondhi then delivered the petition through an aid at the residence of the President of the Privy Council. Several accusations are leveled at the Prime Minister in the petition, including allegations that he has used his position for personal financial gain.

A new petition seeking the Prime Minister's impeachment, which was started on February 10, reached 7,500 signatures in just 3 days. Thammasat university's student union has started this effort which, according to the country's constitution, requires a total of 50,000 signatures gathered within 180 days for the impeachment process to begin.

The Vista, a student paper at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, &lt;a href="Oklahoma"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, has published a cartoon including one of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad. The cartoon itself has been perceived as being very offensive, besides the fact that it includes one of the infamous caricatures.
The cartoon was made by Cary Stringfield, the paper's cartoonist. It shows two men of middle eastern origin with the one on the right holding one of the Mohammad caricatures (Caricature: the one with the bomb in his turban). The man on the left is shown as saying: "I'm not sure this response is appropriate for that cartoon." (Pointing to the background of violent protest). The man on the right replies by saying: "I agree, if we only had a Nuclear Bomb, then we could show them."
The Vista is published twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The cartoon was published on Tuesday February 7, 2006. Since then there has been some/many verbal/written protests to the paper. The paper published an explanation in their Thursday paper which is linked to below.

Since then, some have found it hard to decide if the cartoon or the follow-up article was more offensive. The Muslim Student Organization at UCO has issued a letter with numerous signatories to the paper to protest their distaste at the inappropriate content. But in the feedback posted on their website, some readers have supported the cartoon as representing freedom of speech.

The majority &lt;a href="w%3AShia"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; group in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; has nominated &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20Jaafari"&gt;Ibrahim Jaafari&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;. He was chosen in a tight vote with Vice-President &lt;a href="w%3AAdel%20Abdel%20Mahdi"&gt;Adel Abdel Mahdi&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3A%20United%20Iraqi%20Alliance"&gt;United Iraqi Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, who backed both men, chose a nominee today after talks amongst party leaders concerning the nomination, which had originally stalled on Saturday. 

There is little doubt that Mr Jaafari will lead the new government considering that the UIA is the largest of the Iraqi political parties. However, many say that he will be faced with the challenge of getting the support of the nation's Sunni and Kurd populations.

The &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; newspaper &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASunday%20Telegraph"&gt;Sunday Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has reported on alleged plans for a &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; attack on &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. The plans were allegedly made in retaliation for Iran's uranium enrichment program due to suspicions that it is for military application in the development of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction%23Nuclear%20weapons"&gt;nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The paper has also reported that the alleged plans to attack Iran may be a possible motivation for the development of nuclear weapons by Iran; there have been other &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005-2006%20US-Israeli%20threats%20to%20attack%20Iran"&gt;threats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of military response by both the U.S. and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

On February 12, 2006, the Sunday Telegraph claimed that strategists at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are "drawing up plans for devastating bombing raids backed by submarine-launched ballistic missile attacks against Iran's nuclear sites" as '"a last resort" for the situation. 

The newspaper also claims that preparations are extremely active, stating, "Central Command and Strategic Command planners are identifying targets, assessing weapon-loads and working on logistics for an operation,".

Assessments of the time scale for &lt;span class="interwiki-link-forced-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIran%20and%20weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction%23Nuclear%20weapons"&gt;Iran to possibly develop nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; include three to ten years. According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentre%20for%20Nonproliferation%20Studies"&gt;Centre for Nonproliferation Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , cities likely to be targets because of their alleged role in nuclear weapons development include medium-size towns such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABushehr"&gt;Bushehr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or Bushire (بوشهر), population estimated as 165,000 (2005) and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArak%2C%20Iran"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a population of about 511,000 (2005) and the small mountain town of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANatanz"&gt;Natanz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Just a few days earlier, an InterPress Service article by Gareth Porter reported that two ex-&lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; operatives, Paul Pillar and Ellen Laipson, as saying that one of the main reasons motivating Iran to move towards developing nuclear weapons was the belief in a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3A2005-2006%20US-Israeli%20threats%20to%20attack%20Iran"&gt;threat of attack by the United States and/or Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

According to this InterPress Service report, ex-CIA official Paul Pillar led the preparation of all National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) on Iran from 2000 to 2005 in his role as national intelligence officer for the Near East and South Asia, and told the InterPress Service that all of the NIEs on Iran during that period "addressed the Iranian fears of U.S. attack explicitly and related their desire for nuclear weapons to those fears" and furthermore that "Iranian perceptions of threat, especially from the United States and Israel, were not the only factor, but were in our judgment part of what drove whatever effort they were making to build nuclear weapons."

Ellen Laipson, the other ex-CIA official also stated, "the Iranian fear of an attack by the United States has long been a standard element in NIEs &lt;nowiki&gt;[National Intelligence Estimates]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on Iran."

Just a few weeks earlier, on January 25, 2006, former UN weapons inspector &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHans%20Blix"&gt;Hans Blix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; recommended that the United States give a similar commitment not to attack Iran with either conventional or nuclear weapons, just as it apparently has given to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20Korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , stating, "regime changes, we know, from the outside are not that much of a panacea. So I think &lt;nowiki&gt;[the United States]&lt;/nowiki&gt; should contemplate similar offers to Iran as they have to North Korea."

U.S. Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; accidentally shot a fellow hunter in the face on Saturday during a bird hunting trip at a south &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; ranch. 

The victim, 78-year-old &lt;a href="w%3AHarry%20Whittington"&gt;Harry Whittington&lt;/a&gt;, is an &lt;a href="w%3AAustin%2C%20Texas"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt; lawyer who was accompanying the Vice President on a south Texas &lt;a href="w%3Aquail"&gt;quail&lt;/a&gt; hunt when he was sprayed with shotgun pellets to his face and chest. The wounded hunter is currently recovering at &lt;a href="w%3ACorpus%20Christi%20Memorial%20Hospital"&gt;Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital&lt;/a&gt; where he is in stable condition, and is said to be alert and joking with visitors.

Cheney spent several hours at the hospital with Whittington before departing for Washington, praying for a happy and permanent reconciliation with Whittington.

The incident was not disclosed by Cheney's office until Sunday. Lea Anne McBride, the spokeswoman of VP Cheney, explained the delay was in deference to the owner of the ranch, Katharine Armstrong, where the accident occurred. Ms. Armstrong first reported the news to ♡❤The Corpus Christi Caller-Times♡❤ on Sunday , approximately 18 hours after the incident.

Armstrong said that Cheney was the right-most man in a three-man formation and that Whittington had failed to observe hunting protocol when he quietly approached the formation without announcing his presence. Cheney, who was using a 28 gauge &lt;a href="w%3Ashotgun"&gt;shotgun&lt;/a&gt;, fired at a flushed covey of quail, inadvertently hitting the lawyer from a distance of about 30 yards. It is not known if any quail were struck.

The poor weather conditions prompted the shutdown of &lt;a href="w%3ALaGuardia%20International%20Airport"&gt;LaGuardia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport"&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3ANewark%20International%20Airport"&gt;Newark International&lt;/a&gt; Airports. &lt;a href="w%3ADelta%20Airlines"&gt;Delta Airlines&lt;/a&gt; also canceled flights in and out of &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APhiladelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AProvidence%2C%20Rhode%20Island"&gt;Providence&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AHartford%2C%20Connecticut"&gt;Hartford&lt;/a&gt;. In Massachusetts, heavy snow and blizzard warnings were in effect as visibility had been greatly hindered by the falling snow. There were other reports of near-blizzard conditions in parts of Connecticut, and Rhode Island.

Adding to the storm, wind gusts as high as 60 mph in New England prompted concerns over coastal flooding.

In New York City, Department of Transportation employees worked a twelve-hour overtime shift to salt and plow the snow from streets and highways. Alternate-side of the street parking regulations are suspended, but not the city's public schools, much to the chagrin of New York's children.

Although the streets are navigable, the &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island%20Rail%20Road"&gt;Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)&lt;/a&gt; is a different story: Service between &lt;a href="w%3AJamaica%20%28LIRR%20station%29"&gt;Jamaica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3APennsylvania%20Station%20%28New%20York%20City%29"&gt;Penn&lt;/a&gt; Stations remains suspended, as is service along the &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island%20Rail%20Road%23Port%20Washington%20Branch"&gt;Port Washington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Island%20Rail%20Road%23Hempstead%20Branch"&gt;Hempstead&lt;/a&gt; branches. Additionally, all running branches are expected to be running with 30 minute delays. The &lt;a href="w%3AMetropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;MTA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20City%20Subway"&gt;Subways&lt;/a&gt; will cross-honor LIRR tickets, so customers will be able to take the &lt;a href="w%3AE%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29"&gt;E train&lt;/a&gt; from Jamaica instead.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has linked &lt;a href="w%3Acannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; use to &lt;a href="w%3Amental%20illness"&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt;, and called for state governments to take a tougher line on the drug. Speaking at a meeting of Federal, state and territory leaders, Mr Howard said that fighting drug abuse would be a significant element of the new mental health strategy.

At a &lt;a href="w%3ACOAG"&gt;COAG&lt;/a&gt; press conference on Friday, Mr Howard explicitly stated that there was a relationship between cannabis use and mental illness. "We need, as part of the campaign on mental health, to address cannabis and amphetamine abuse which is a key, but not of course the only ingredient in the problem," he said.

Mr Howard has also said that in the past Australians have not taken the problem seriously. "At least a generation of Australians were too passive about the consequences of illicit drug use," he said.

South Australia's Director of Public Prosecutions, Stephen Pallaras QC, called today for courts to be tougher on cannabis related crime, because of the harm to the mental health of cannabis users. "I have heard the research on the link between mental illness and cannabis and it concerns me greatly," he said. "It may be time to reassess the way the court approaches sentencing in light of research on cannabis. We are waiting for the right case to bring before the court of appeal."

South Australia has separate penalties for cannabis possession in public and in private. In South Australia possession of up to 20 cannabis plants for personal use is punishable by a AU$500 fine.

Professor George Patton, of the Centre for Adolescent Health in Melbourne, also made the link between the drug and mental illness, suggesting that there was evidence of a "predictive" link between cannabis use and the development of illnesses such as schizophrenia.
"People presenting with schizophrenia for the first time, depression and anxiety, often have frequent cannabis use (and) there's increasing evidence cannabis use predicts the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic illness," he said.

"The big difference from 20 or 30 years ago is there were fewer people using cannabis then. What we're learning now is that cannabis these days is a potent drug with powerful side effects."

Dan Lubman, consultant psychiatrist at Orygen Youth Health, warned that the relationship was quite complicated, and argued that it was difficult to draw clear conclusions.

"A high percentage of the population we treat are cannabis users with mental health problems, but just because you use cannabis doesn't mean you'll develop psychosis," he said. "It's a complicated relationship and that's why we need to be very clever about how we approach this issue."

The Mental Health Council of Australia has warned the government of over-estimating the role of cannabis in mental health. John Mendozza told ABC "I don't think we should overstate the role of cannabis in the nation's mental health crisis. It is a factor, but it is not the reason that we now face a mental health crisis."

Police last week launched a number of raids across &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding areas, targeting hydroponic &lt;a href="w%3ACannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt;-growing operations. There were seven arrests on Thursday, in Melton and Werribee, across the western and northern suburbs, and a farm near Bacchus Marsh.

Three men appeared in court on Friday. One man, arrested at the farm, was charged with cultivating cannabis after police found 102 plants growing hydroponically.

According to Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Jason Kelly the raids come at the end of a six month operation. He said that more arrests would be following in the next few weeks.

These arrests coincide with the State and Federal governments tough new stance on cannabis, and hydroponically grown cannabis in particular. The Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, and NSW Premier Morris Iemma, have linked cannabis use to mental illness, citing a number of statements by researchers.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; and state and territory leaders have promised to spend an extra AU$1.1 billion on mental health over the next five years. The funding is part of a broad strategy to improve the standard of mental health care, and includes additional places for medical students and a national phone advice network.

The announcement was made at the &lt;a href="w%3ACouncil%20of%20Australian%20Governments"&gt;Council of Australian Governments&lt;/a&gt; meeting. NSW Premier &lt;a href="w%3AMorris%20Iemma"&gt;Morris Iemma&lt;/a&gt; praised the plan. "At long last there is real hope for the mentally ill and their families," he said.

The focus of the strategy will be prevention and early detection. This includes a tougher stance on &lt;a href="w%3Acannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; cultivation. In the past few weeks the Prime Minister and a number of state Premiers have linked cannabis use to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.

The number of medicine positions at universities will be increased by increasing the cap on full fee paying students. Loan assistance for medical students will also be increased.

Federal Opposition leader &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; was critical of the announcement, saying that the mental health system has been in need of reform for ten years.

&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20Rush"&gt;Scott Rush&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ARenae%20Lawrence"&gt;Renae Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, the only female member of the &lt;a href="w%3ABali%20Nine"&gt;Bali Nine&lt;/a&gt;, were today sentenced in the &lt;a href="w%3ADenpasar"&gt;Denpasar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ADistrict%20Court"&gt;District Court&lt;/a&gt; to life imprisonment.

The Bali Nine were arrested in April 2005 in &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;, where they were accused of trying to smuggle 8.3 kg of heroin in to &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

The sentence issued to Lawrence is a surprise to both herself and the prosecution, as a 20-year sentence was all but promised for co-operation.
Although under Indonesian law, Lawrence could have received the death penalty, judges felt a custodial sentence was in order because of her youth, cooperation and general politeness.

&lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; newspaper ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Independent"&gt;The Independent&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ has run a story scrutinizing the accuracy of &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; articles, using eight experts in various fields to comment on particular articles' validity. The experts' opinions ranged on topics from the &lt;a href="w%3ARussian%20Revolution%20of%201917"&gt;Russian Revolution of 1917&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="w%3AKate%20Moss"&gt;Kate Moss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AInvitro%20fertilization"&gt;invitro fertilization&lt;/a&gt;.

Robert McHenry, a former editor-in-chief of ♡❤Encyclopaedia Britannica♡❤ posits his belief that contrary to the underlying notion that Wikipedia articles are constantly improving, the "mass [of articles] tend to the mediocre."

According to historian Antony Beevor, "With Wikipedia's entries, there is a lack of satisfaction, not so much through inaccuracy but there are a lot of vague statements which you cannot really disprove but which you don't think are necessarily helpful."

While noting that Wikipedia's most controversial topics are rife for distortion, ♡❤The Independent♡❤ article goes on to point out that a number of studies have shown articles to be accurate. In comparing the online site to the ♡❤Encyclopaedia Britannica♡❤, ♡❤Nature♡❤ found that on average, Wikipedia had only one more error per entry than the traditional "gold standard" for encyclopaedias. Likewise, the German computer magazine, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3Ac%27t"&gt;c't&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, gave Wikipedia a 3.6 rating out of 5 for accuracy, which surpassed two other rivals, such as &lt;a href="w%3AEncarta"&gt;Microsoft Encarta&lt;/a&gt; which received a 3.1.

&lt;a href="w%3AMain_Page"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the well-known free-to-edit encyclopedia, suffered a period of extended downtime starting approximately 10:00 UTC, following a failure of the primary &lt;a href="w%3ADomain%20Name%20System"&gt;DNS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="w%3ANetwork%20File%20System"&gt;NFS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AServer%20%28computing%29"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt;, which caused numerous cascading failures on other servers within the &lt;a href="http%3A//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers"&gt;Wikimedia cluster&lt;/a&gt;.

This failure led to all &lt;a href="http%3A//rr.wikimedia.org/"&gt;Wikimedia projects&lt;/a&gt; and web sites being rendered inaccessible for several hours. Technical staff worked to restore services using backup equipment, and set up temporary hosts to fulfill some of the roles of ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Zwinger"&gt;Zwinger&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, the failed host.

Following restoration of the backbone of the cluster, several problems arose within the database, causing pages to appear missing. At this time, it was noticed that the normal editing pattern of users was inadvertently causing damage to pages, although no histories were lost. The exact cause for the database issues is not known; while there was a heavy replication lag at the time, it has been asserted that this would not have caused such wide problems.

In order to prevent future problems and to protect the integrity of data, editing was shut off for two hours and 47 minutes. Meanwhile, technical staff worked to restore several &lt;a href="w%3ASquid%20cache"&gt;squid cache&lt;/a&gt; servers and to reduce the dependencies on &lt;a href="w%3ANetwork%20File%20System"&gt;NFS mounts&lt;/a&gt;.

Editing returned to near-normal levels from about 21:45 UTC. 

As of 22:00 UTC, no official statement has been released commenting on the downtime.

<h1>Bali Nine ringleaders sentenced to death</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bali%20Nine%20ringleaders%20sentenced%20to%20death&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The ringleaders of the so-called &lt;a href="w%3ABali%20Nine"&gt;Bali Nine&lt;/a&gt; were today sentenced to death by a Denpasar court. Andrew Chan received the news via translators at about 3:45 p.m. AEDT, and Myuran Sukumaran was sentenced at about 4:50 p.m. AEDT. The two were charged with attempting to smuggle 8.3 kg of heroin from Bali to &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; have been criticised for allowing the Bali Nine to travel to &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, where it was known they could face the death penalty. Yesterday two other &lt;a href="w%3Adrug%20mule"&gt;drug mules&lt;/a&gt;, Renae Lawrence and Scott Rush, were sentenced to life imprisonment.

Prosecutors asked for the death penalty for both men. Chan was alleged to be the mastermind of the operation, and Myuran was alleged to be an enforcer. Chan, who claimed to have rediscovered his Christian faith, prayed for divine intervention prior to the sentence being handed down. Outside the court Indonesian protesters shouted "Death! Death!". Chan fell over after jostling with a media scrum, and Sukumaran threw a bottle of water at the media.

Donald Rothwell, a Professor of International Law at the University of Sydney, has said that, unlike countries such as Singapore, it may not be long before the two are executed.

"The Indonesian judicial system is one in which death sentences are often carried out very quickly," he said.

"So unlike the situation of Van Nguyen in Singapore, where an appeal process and a clemency process played out over quite some time, this may not be the situation in Bali."

Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer told parliament today that he had made a direct request to the Indonesian government that the death penalty not be imposed. "On the 18th of December last year, I wrote to the Indonesian Attorney-General reminding him that the Australian Government was opposed to the death sentence and we didn't want to see, in the context of the Bali nine, any of the Australians sentenced to death," he said.

In Bali the death sentence is carried out by &lt;a href="w%3Afiring%20squad"&gt;firing squad&lt;/a&gt;.

People only ascertain the intended tone on an &lt;a href="w%3Ae-mail"&gt;e-mail&lt;/a&gt; message about 56% of the time, not much better than chance, according to a study led by Prof. Nicholas Epley (&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Chicago"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt;) and Prof. Justin Kruger (&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20University"&gt;New York University&lt;/a&gt;). The research also found that people think they've correctly interpreted the tone 90% of the time.

Epley and Kruger discovered that not only were the receivers of the e-mails overconfident about their understanding of the message's tone, but the senders were as well. About 78% of the senders thought that the receiver would correctly interpret the tone of their e-mail message.

Epley explained that "People in our study were convinced they've accurately understood the tone of an e-mail message when in fact their odds are no better than chance." 

He observed that "people often think the tone or emotion in their messages is obvious because they 'hear' the tone they intend in their head as they write." Kruger likened this to findings from previous research by Elizabeth Newton that people vastly overestimated their ability to convey a tune by tapping out its rhythm. "It's impossible not to hear the song as you're tapping away," he said. "So you have a hard time separating yourself from your own perspective and realizing how impoverished the listeners' data really are."

Epley stated that similar misunderstandings of emotional tone play a major role in starting online .

The study has been published in the ♡❤Journal of Personality and Social Psychology♡❤.

A policewoman in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; has been shot while on a "routine" call-out.

The 23-year-old officer was with a male colleague on her way to the scene of an attempted burglary when she was confronted by a male suspect. As soon as trainee officer Rachael Bown challenged him, he pulled a firearm and shot her in the stomach before making off.

Ms Bown is recovering in hospital where her condition is described as "stable". The incident happened just after midnight in &lt;a href="w%3ALenton"&gt;Lenton&lt;/a&gt;, a district of &lt;a href="w%3ANottingham"&gt;Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;.

Her commanding oficer, Chief Superintendent Marcus Beale told &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News"&gt;♡❤Sky News♡❤&lt;/a&gt; earlier this morning that emergency surgery "looks to have gone very well and, God willing, she'll be OK."

He added: "She was on a routine call out to a burglary and it's ended up having fairly serious consequences. Thankfully, she's stable. We expect her to be in hospital for several days."

PC Bown was wearing her body armour when she was shot.

&lt;a href="Tibet"&gt;Tibet&lt;/a&gt;ans convened on Tuesday in &lt;a href="w%3ADharmsala"&gt;Dharmsala&lt;/a&gt; to protest &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;'s decision to launch a censored version of its search engine in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

Demonstrators are protesting the censorship, which disables any searches linked to issues of Human Rights, Tibet, &lt;a href="Taiwan"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;'s independence and the &lt;a href="w%3A1989%20Tiananmen%20Square%20massacre"&gt;1989 Tiananmen Square massacre&lt;/a&gt;. Under China's censored version of the search engine, searches for these topics will produce omitted sites or direct users back to Chinese government websites.

Google had agreed to compromise with &lt;a href="w%3ABeijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt;'s censorship policies and limit specific searches in order to increase profits.

Teaming with Students for a Free Tibet in order organize a peaceful protest, demonstrators sent out 30,000 e-mails around the world, urging people to boycott Google this &lt;a href="w%3AValentine%27s%20Day"&gt;Valentine's Day&lt;/a&gt;. Tibetans also protested at the &lt;a href="w%3AGoogleplex"&gt;Googleplex&lt;/a&gt; after Google's announcement to censor their search engine for China. 

A popular Tibetan news site run by exiled Tibetans shut itself down on Tuesday, leaving only the message: "We do not have any right to deny you our contents, but we commit this offense to help you realize a fact."

Many people are angry over what they argue is hypocrisy, citing Google's IPO filing:

"Don't be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served--as shareholders and in all other ways--by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains. This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly shared within the company."

A new 154-page &lt;a href="w%3AGovernment%20Accountability%20Office"&gt;Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt; (GAO) report says seven federal departments together spent &lt;a href="w%3AUS%24"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;$1.6 billion on 343 contracts with public relations firms, advertising agencies, and media organizations, as well as individuals involved in such activities.

Congressional Democrats requested the report after several incidents surfaced in which journalists or commentators were paid to promote the Bush administrations programs, but did not disclose the financing, so called &lt;a href="w%3Apayola"&gt;payola&lt;/a&gt;. In one case, &lt;a href="w%3AArmstrong%20Williams"&gt;Armstrong Williams&lt;/a&gt; was paid $186,000 for promotions of President Bush's &lt;a href="w%3ANo%20Child%20Left%20Behind%20Act"&gt;No Child Left Behind&lt;/a&gt; law. The administrations position was that an agencies' mission includes spreading information about federal programs.

At that time, the GAO had independent objections to the ready-to-air news stories the administration's provided to TV stations in order to promote it policies. The administration claimed the burden of disclosure falls to the TV stations.

Congress has now inserted a provision into an annual spending bill requiring federal agencies to include "a clear notification" within the text or audio of a prepackaged news story that it was prepared or paid for by the government.

Rep. &lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20A.%20Waxman"&gt;Henry A. Waxman&lt;/a&gt; (D-Calif.) said "Careful oversight of this spending is essential given the track record of the Bush administration, which has used taxpayer dollars to fund covert propaganda within the United States." 

The seven agencies covered by the report are Commerce, Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Interior, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs.

In response to the &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iranian&lt;/a&gt; newspaper Hamshari's announcement of an anti-semitic cartoon contest inspired by the Jyllands Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, an &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; group announced its own anti-semitic cartoon contest yesterday, open to Jewish cartoonists only. 

From their February 13 release: 

Already organizers have received mixed responses to their contest and have published a number of them, including the following:

Not hesitating to set an example, the group has adopted three logos showing three anti-semitic figures. They set a deadline of March 5, 2006 but due to an unexpectedly large response are considering extending it.

A body was found on a Kingwood Street in &lt;a href="w%3AHouston%2C%20Texas"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; today. Police said the unidentified man appeared to have no signs of injuries from a car, but police said there was a large amount of blood. He was taken to a local morgue for a &lt;a href="w%3Aautopsy"&gt;autopsy&lt;/a&gt; as detectives question people in the neighbourhood on the man's death.

The man was found lying in the middle of a intersection at 2:20 a.m. local time.

A &lt;a href="w%3ALong%20Beach%2C%20California"&gt;Long Beach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; man was shot today by Long Beach police. Police allege that the man lunged at police who returned fire and killed the man.

Two police officers are reported to have been attending another call in the area when they noticed a man bleeding from his head and wielding a knife. The man did not listen to police orders to drop down and unsuccessfully tried to subdue him with a &lt;a href="w%3ATaser"&gt;Taser&lt;/a&gt; stun gun. As the man lunged at the officers with a knife, both fired several rounds at him, killing him.

On February 14, 2006, the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court sentenced &lt;a href="w%3AOmri%20Sharon"&gt;Omri Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, son of the comatosed Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAriel%20Sharon"&gt;Ariel Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, to a nine month prison term, a nine month suspended sentence, and a 300,000 Shekel (USD 63,500) fine. Omri's lawyers have already stated they will appeal a "exceptionally harsh verdict". Ariel Sharon has not been charged so far.

Judge Beckenstein decided to delay his prison sentence six months due to the current health of his father. Beckenstein was quoted as saying: "This is a swamp of political corruption and it must be dried up." In addition Gavriel Manor, an accomplice of Omri, was sentenced to a nine month suspended sentence for his involvement.

Omri was indicted on August 28, 2005 over a fundraising scandal relating to his father's 1999 election. At the time Omri was exempt from prosecution due to &lt;a href="w%3Aparliamentary%20immunity"&gt;parliamentary immunity&lt;/a&gt; but decided to stand trial. 

According to Israeli prosecutors Omri received over $1,300,000 in contributions and donations from Israeli and other companies between July 1999 and February 2000. This violated the amount allowed by party finance laws. He was then charged of investing the funds into a corporation called &lt;a href="w%3AAnnex%20Research"&gt;Annex Research&lt;/a&gt;.

On November 14 Omri Sharon plead guilty in a plea bargain with prosecutors. He later resigned from the &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href="w%3AKnesset"&gt;Knesset&lt;/a&gt; on January 3.

Physicians explained that one of the shotgun pellets still in Mr. Whittington moved to his heart. Doctors have decided to leave the pellet rather than risk surgery in the 78 year old attorney. They are still optimistic that Whittington will make a full recovery.

He is currently in stable condition.

Three &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; soldiers have now been arrested by military police in connection with the video showing abuse of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i civilians by U.K. troops. One of them is reported to be the cameraman.

The video, filmed January 2004 in the town of Amara north of Basra and made public on Saturday, shows the troops punching, kicking and beating four Iraqi teenagers with batons just inside their compound. A leering commentary is provided by the cameraman. 

Earlier footage showed an explosion in the compound, reportedly from one of three hand grenades thrown by Iraqi protesters. The marines then ran outside, apprehended these four Iraqi youths and brought them inside the walls, where the abuse took place.

The provincial council in Basra has suspended relations with the British forces in response to the footage, which has been widely shown in the Arab media. Two Iraqis claiming to be among the abused youths have come forward demanding compensation, and the abuse has been condemned in Britain and across the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="w%3AWarner%20Music%20Group"&gt;Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt; first quarter earnings rose sharply mostly from growth in &lt;a href="w%3Adigital%20music"&gt;digital music&lt;/a&gt; sales offsetting falling &lt;a href="w%3Acompact%20disc"&gt;CD&lt;/a&gt; sales. Warner Music sells digital music to several online services including Apple's &lt;a href="w%3AiTunes"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; at wholesale. The company's first-quarter revenue from digital music sales doubled to US$69 million, accounting for 7% of overall revenue. &lt;a href="w%3AMadonna"&gt;Madonna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGreen%20Day"&gt;Green Day&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Blunt"&gt;James Blunt&lt;/a&gt; are signed to subsidiary labels of Warner.

Warner Music has undergone restructuring after being sold in 2004 by former parent company &lt;a href="w%3ATime%20Warner"&gt;Time Warner&lt;/a&gt;. Cutting costs, exploiting current assets, and digital music has been the company's focus since going public in May.

A group of former senior &lt;a href="w%3ACommunist%20Party%20of%20China"&gt;Communist Party&lt;/a&gt; officials in &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have denounced the recent closure of &lt;a href="w%3AFreezing%20Point"&gt;Freezing Point&lt;/a&gt; (Bing Dian), an investigative newspaper, along with the state of government censorship in that country. The group includes Li Rui, a former aid to Chairman &lt;a href="w%3AMao%20Zedong"&gt;Mao Zedong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMedia%20in%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China"&gt;Hu Jiwei&lt;/a&gt;, a former newspaper editor, and Zhu Houze, an ex-propaganda chief.

In an open letter addressed to the current government, the group said that strict censorship may "sow the seeds of disaster" for China's political transition.

In the letter, signed on February 2 but released on Tuesday, the group called current censorship methods overly restrictive and unnecessary for the modern China: "History has shown that only a totalitarian system needs news censorship, out of the delusion that it can keep the people locked in ignorance."

Freezing Point was a supplement of the &lt;a href="w%3AChina%20Youth%20Daily"&gt;China Youth Daily&lt;/a&gt; and was allegedly shut down due to the publication on January 11 of an article by &lt;a href="w%3ASun%20Yat-sen%20University"&gt;Zhongshan University&lt;/a&gt; professor Yuan Weishi regarding the way history is currently taught in China, although the papers editor, Li Datong, says that it has experienced difficulties with the government on several occasions in the past. Mr. Yuan's article was critical of Chinese textbooks, which never admit the culpability of the government and instead shift the blame to other nations.

No response from the government has yet been issued.

The remaining three members of the &lt;a href="w%3ABali%20Nine"&gt;Bali Nine&lt;/a&gt; have been sentenced to life in prison by a Denpasar court. Matthew Norman, 19, Si Yi Chen, 20, and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, aged 27 were found guilty of exporting narcotics. The court found that the heroin they had been caught with was the same as that found strapped to the bodies of the four others arrested at Denpasar airport.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; have been criticised for allowing the Bali Nine to travel to &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, where it was known they could face the death penalty. All nine have now been found guilty and sentenced, with seven receiving life in prison, and the two ringleaders being &lt;a href="Bali%20Nine%20ringleaders%20sentenced%20to%20death"&gt;sentenced to death yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="Virginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; legislature's &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20House%20of%20Delegates"&gt;House of Delegates&lt;/a&gt; voted unanimously in a sub-committee to kill a bill that would ban public smoking in the &lt;a href="w%3AMid-Atlantic"&gt;Mid-Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; state. The vote was reached during a six-member sub-committee meeting on Thursday.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASenate%20of%20Virginia"&gt;Virginia Senate&lt;/a&gt;, the upper house of the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Virginia%20General%20Assembly"&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;, passed on Monday a week ago a bill that would ban the indoor smoking of tobacco in restaurants, bowling alleys, and other public places, including workplaces. The bill was not expected to pass the House, but the thumbs up signal by the Senate signaled a shift in tolerance towards the product in a state known for its 400-year economic history steeped in the cultivation of the cash crop.

The General Laws sub-committee based its vote on the rights of property owners, rights that would be violated by a state-wide ban. The debate was largely centered on the issue of restaurant smoking. The committee noted there was no law that said a restaurant must allow smoking. 

"They have a right not to go where people are smoking," said delegate John Cosgrove (R-Chesapeake). He noted the consumer and the restaurant businesses can decide whether to allow smoking. "They have a right and responsibility to take care of themselves," he said.

A &lt;a href="w%3AVirginia%20Beach"&gt;Virginia Beach&lt;/a&gt; restaurant owner, Matt Falvey, said "The plain truth is that the majority of our citizens do not smoke, and do not want to be around smoke," according to the ♡❤Richmond Times-Dispatch♡❤. Falvey, who owns three restaurants, said "In addition, restaurant workers should not be subjected to the harm caused by secondhand smoke."

Falvey said he has smoking sections in his restaurants because not to would put him at a competitive disadvantage with other restaurants that have smoking sections. An across the board state-wide ban would level the playing field by settling the issue.

Senate Bill 649, known as the Virginia Indoor Clean Air Act, to become law in the nation's 4th largest tobacco growing state would require passage by the House. Last year, the Senate killed a similar bill to ban indoor smoking in public places. New procedural rules introduced in Virginia this year allow a bill's passage to be blocked by sub-committee, but there remains a slim chance it could be revived. 

The original version of the bill, which allowed cities and counties to decide locally on the issue, was voted down by the Senate. The bill was brought back by Brandon Bell of &lt;a href="w%3ARoanoke%20County%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Roanoke County&lt;/a&gt;, and passed in a revised version that would make than ban state-wide, with no local authority on the issue. The measure was passed by the Senate in a 21 - 18 vote, after it received the support from the Virginia Restaurant Association. 

In &lt;a href="w%3AMaryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, a similar ban was voted down this week by a House committee. &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; is the latest state to join the ranks of a total of 11 states that ban smoking in restaurants, bars, and workplaces.

Soybean over-took tobacco as Virginia’s top cash crop in 2005.

On Monday, the &lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Bar%20Association"&gt;American Bar Association&lt;/a&gt; denounced President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush's&lt;/a&gt; program of domestic surveillance without court issued warrants. The program has been the subject of much debate, with the opposition claiming it is unconstitutional, and supporters saying that it is constitutional and that it helps to catch terrorists.

In the past, wiretap warrants could be secretly obtained from a special court created by the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or publicly obtained from any federal court. The Bush administration maintains that the congressional measure authorizing war in September 2001 empowered eavesdropping without any court issued warrant. The ABA has also asked Congress to affirm that granting such authority was not its intention.

President Bush has claimed that only a small number of Americans were subject to NSA eavesdrop without the usual requisite warrants. But, &lt;a href="w%3ARussell%20Tice"&gt;Russell Tice&lt;/a&gt;, who worked for the NSA for 20 years, has disagreed, saying that millions of Americans could be affected "if the full range of secret NSA programs is used."

Mr. Tice said that individual conversations can be isolated based upon keywords, such as 'jihad', but such technology is most often used for keyword based &lt;a href="w%3Atraffic%20analysis"&gt;traffic analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the conversations of suspects, as well as their acquaintances.

The ABA sets academic standards for law schools and controls the code of ethical standards for lawyers. 

Last May, the NSA revoked Tice's security clearance based upon so-called psychological concerns, and later dismissed him. Tice has responded that this is simply the NSA's way of dealing with whistleblowers. NSA has made no further comment.

<h1>New photos of Abu Ghraib prison abuse</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20photos%20of%20Abu%20Ghraib%20prison%20abuse&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

An &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n TV station has shown new photos allegedly showing more of the prisoner abuse in the &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20prison"&gt;Abu Ghraib prison&lt;/a&gt;. 

"Dateline", a current affairs programme broadcast on the &lt;a href="w%3ASBS%20World%20News%20Australia"&gt;SBS&lt;/a&gt; public network, claimed the images they displayed were examples of the range of abuses carried out at the Abu Ghraib prison in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and included previously unseen material such as killing, torture and sexual humiliation. The program also alleged that prisoners at Abu Ghraib had been killed when &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; soldiers ran out of rubber bullets as they tried to handle a jail riot, and started to use live rounds.

Executive producer Mike Carey said Dateline had obtained a file containing hundreds of pictures, some known and others that show new abuses. However, he declined to say how the pictures came into their possession.

Some pictures appear to show &lt;a href="w%3ACharles%20Graner"&gt;U.S. soldier Charles Graner&lt;/a&gt; who had a leading role in the earlier Abu Ghraib abuse scandal. Many of the new images are more graphic than those previously published - these new photos include prisoners performing sex acts and wounded/dead prisoners. SBS alleged the photographs of the dead bodies were of people who had died at Abu Ghraib during interrogation. 

The Guardian cites an unnamed US defense official saying that the Army had reviewed the pictures posted by SBS and confirmed that they were among those that are subject to the &lt;a href="w%3AFreedom%20of%20Information%20Act"&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/a&gt; request made by the &lt;a href="w%3AACLU"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt;. The American Civil Liberties Union has been granted access to pictures in possession of the army that had not been publicly released by a U.S. federal court in September, but the U.S. government appealed the decision.

Pentagon spokesperson Bryan Whitman stressed it is U.S. policy to treat all detainees humanely. He further said that "The abuses at Abu Ghraib have been fully investigated," and that "When there have been abuses, this department has acted upon them promptly, investigated them thoroughly and where appropriate prosecuted individuals."

The pictures have been shown widely on television throughout the Middle East, including in Iraq. Saleh al-Humaidi, a Yemeni journalist, told Reuters "This is truly American ugliness that no other country in the world can compete with... the Americans ought to apologize to mankind for their government's lie to the world that it is fighting for freedom and that it came to Iraq to save it from Saddam Hussein's oppression." 

&lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; testified that not all known photographs of the abuses at Abu Ghraib had been publicly released at the Senate Armed Services Committee inquiry in May 2004. Mr Rumsfeld said, "beyond abuse of prisoners, there are other photos that depict incidents of physical violence toward prisoners, acts that can only be described as blatantly sadistic, cruel and inhuman."

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=RU486%20debate%20complicates%20with%20amendments%20posed%20in%20Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The ongoing debate over whether the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Health Minister &lt;a href="Tony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATherapeutic%20Goods%20Administration"&gt;Therapeutic Goods Administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (TGA) regulate the abortifacient &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Amifepristone"&gt;mifepristone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (RU486) has complicated with a number of members proposing amendments to the &lt;a href="Australian%20Senate"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; bill, now in the &lt;a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJackie%20Kelly"&gt;Jackie Kelly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Australian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Lindsay"&gt;Lindsay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) has said that "There should be a transparent process in which the minister is accountable for his or her decision" on so-called ♡❤restricted goods♡❤ (of which RU486 is such a good) as listed in the TGA legislation. Kelly has proposed an amendment with points stating that "the Minister for Health and Ageing continuing to have the decision making role in relation to the approval of restricted goods...", "the Minister being required to obtain written advice from the Therapeutic Goods Administration prior to giving written approval or refusal to approve", "the Minister's decision being subject to disallowance".

In the debate on February 14, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Laming"&gt;Andrew Laming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Liberal, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Bowman"&gt;Bowman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) noted his intent to propose an amendment in the later &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aconsideration%20in%20detail"&gt;consideration in detail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; stage, noting his views that the TGA process is "so far removed...from the concerns and the beliefs of the community" and that he is "unable to convince [himself] that completely leaving these decisions to the TGA is the right thing to do". His amendment loosely aims to propose a "disallowable instrument in Parliament where there is a disagreement with the findings of the TGA."

The introduction of amendments has caused confusion on procedural matters February 15 in the Questions to the Speaker period (that follows &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ), where members can ask questions of the Speaker on procedural and other technical matters. In the following vote on the proposed legislation, if one of the votes on the amendments succeeds, this has the effect of discontinuing the other amendment proposals, as each of the amendments proposed has the effect of being a complete alternative bill.

The RU486 debate will have precedence over all other matters in the House until it is dealt with. Voting is expected on Thursday.

The website of &lt;a href="w%3AHamshahri"&gt;Hamshahri&lt;/a&gt; newspaper was brought down this week in response to an internet attack. Hamshahri Daily is an &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;ian newspaper that sponsored a contest to produce cartoons &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust%20denial"&gt;denying the existence&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AHolocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;. Service to the website was restored today, after several days offline.

Hamshahri Daily sponsored the cartoon competition on February 8. The contest followed upon &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;the controversy caused by the twelve cartoons&lt;/a&gt; published by the &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; newspaper [[w:Jyllands-Posten|. Those twelve cartoons sparked outrage and have led to widespread demonstrations and boycotts.

Last year, [[w:President of Iran|Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] denied the existence of the Holocaust, saying "They have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God, religions and the prophets".

The Hamashahri website was the subject of a [[w:Denial-of-service attack|'denial-of-service' attack]]. In a denial-of-service attack, attackers bombard the website with requests for pages until the server overloads.

Hamshahri Daily is owned by the [[w:Tehran Municipality|Tehran Municipality]], which is allied with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ahmadinejad is the former mayor of Tehran.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABundesverfassungsgericht"&gt;Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/a&gt; has declared legislation which would have allowed the &lt;a href="w%3ALuftwaffe"&gt;German Air Force&lt;/a&gt; to shoot down hijacked passenger planes unconstitutional.

The &lt;a href="http%3A//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftsicherheitsgesetz"&gt;Luftsicherheitsgesetz&lt;/a&gt; (literally: Aviation Safety Act) was passed in January 2005 and mainly dealt with uncontroversial matters concerning the safety at airports. One provision however allowed the minister of defense to order the Air Force to shoot down a hijacked plane as a last resort if it could be presumed that that plane would be used as a weapon to kill people on the ground.

The court based its decision to strike down that provision on three considerations:

<h2>Reactions</h2>
Gerhart Baum, a former interior minister and one of the plaintiffs, hailed the decision as "historic" and said that were it not for that ruling "we would have martial law while fighting crime".

Defense minister &lt;a href="w%3AFranz%20Josef%20Jung"&gt;Franz Josef Jung&lt;/a&gt; said "it is our duty to protect the citizens from terrorism". He announced that he would consider lobbying to change the Basic Law.

The ruling is expected to also have bearing on current discussions to extend the mandate of the &lt;a href="w%3ABundeswehr"&gt;Bundeswehr&lt;/a&gt; (German military forces) to help police large events like the upcoming soccer world championship in Germany, as it implicitely reaffirms the separation of armed forces and the police.

Two graduate students at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20University"&gt;Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; claim to have shown that evolution can happen much faster than previously thought. Physics student Peter Lu and his former roommate, economist Motohiro Yogo, decided to apply an economics model to a well-known marine &lt;a href="w%3Afossil%20record"&gt;fossil record&lt;/a&gt; in order to predict how fast life can adapt to changes in the environment. The technique, &lt;a href="w%3Avector%20autoregression"&gt;vector autoregression&lt;/a&gt;, is used to predict the stock market based on its historical behavior.

Initially their model confirmed previous analysis that life was slow to adapt. However, fossil-preserving rocks from some periods are more commonly found than from others. When they compensated for this, the lag disappeared. So far as could be seen from the geological record, the biosphere seemed to respond immediately to changes. This would mean that life could rapidly recover from large extinctions; it was previously thought such recovery would take millions of years.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20House%20of%20Representatives"&gt;Australian House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; have considered the bill regarding whether the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Health Minister &lt;a href="w%3ATony%20Abbott"&gt;Tony Abbott&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="w%3ATherapeutic%20Goods%20Administration"&gt;Therapeutic Goods Administration&lt;/a&gt; (TGA) regulate the abortifacient &lt;a href="w%3Amifepristone"&gt;mifepristone&lt;/a&gt; (RU486), and has passed the bill unamended.

Earlier today, the &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberal%20Party"&gt;Australian Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Bennelong"&gt;Bennelong&lt;/a&gt;) has spoken on the amendments earlier proposed by &lt;a href="w%3AJackie%20Kelly"&gt;Jackie Kelly&lt;/a&gt; (Liberal, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Lindsay"&gt;Lindsay&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Laming"&gt;Andrew Laming&lt;/a&gt; (Liberal, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Lindsay"&gt;Bowman&lt;/a&gt;), speaking in favour of the Laming amendments and reiterating his support for Abbott, stating that he is the "best friend that &lt;a href="w%3AMedicare"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; ever had", Abbott's usual phrase he states in &lt;a href="w%3AQuestion%20Time"&gt;Question Time&lt;/a&gt; in support of the Government's handling of Medicare.

Howard's counterpart, the Leader of the Opposition, &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADivision%20of%20Brand"&gt;Brand&lt;/a&gt;), spoke in support of the bill in its unamended form, noting that it is "simply commonsense that the minister does not have the scientific capacity" to evaluate the drug, and reiterating that the bill is "not really about Tony Abbott". More controversially he however said that those with certain personal views such as Tony Abbott's conservative Catholic faith should not hold certain offices in Government, which drew criticism from the Government later in the debate noting that an earlier Labor Prime Minister of Australia &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Curtin"&gt;John Curtin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3Apacificism"&gt;pacificism&lt;/a&gt; was a strong wartime leader.

Later, the Kelly amendments were put to the vote and were lost on the voices and in subsequent division with 49 agreeing to the amendments and 96 disagreeing. The vote on whether the bill should be &lt;a href="w%3Asecond%20reading"&gt;read a second time&lt;/a&gt; 95 for to 50 against. In the consideration in detail stage, the Laming amendments were debated, but the vote on these amendments were lost with 56 supporting the amendments and 90 against them.

The bill as unamended was agreed to and passed the &lt;a href="w%3Athird%20reading"&gt;third reading&lt;/a&gt; on the voices, without having to resort to a vote.

<h3>Reactions from Australian bloggers</h3>

Larvatus Prodeo (LP) blogger "Kate" welcomed the decision, but warned that the abortion issue was far from settled. "Personally, I think this is not only a good thing for women in Australia, but also demonstrates democratic processes at work. Now we can commence stoushing about whether or not the TGA should allow the drug into the country," she said. 

One commenter on LP, Paul Norton, suggested that division over the issue would deepen in the next few years, and that people opposed to legalised abortion would become more vocal. "I expect that the loud minority will become louder over the next couple of years, and more authoritarian and fanatical in their attempts to twist legislators’ and candidates’ arms, until State and Federal election results show that their loudness is directly proportional to their minority status amongst Australians."

The &lt;a href="w%3AVietnam_Veterans_Memorial"&gt;Vietnam Veterans Memorial&lt;/a&gt; is the most visited monument in the &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt; at close to 4 million visitors a year. Conceived as a symbol of a never ending reminder of our connection to the veterans of &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, the wall holds strong memories for everyone who visits the wall.

There are nephews like David Quatrone of &lt;a href="New%20Jersey"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; who came to find his Green Beret Uncle Ferdinand Quatrone who served six tours of duty. 

There was Alan Earls of &lt;a href="Missouri"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; who came to find his Aunt's younger brother who perished during the &lt;a href="w%3ATet%20Offensive"&gt;Tet Offensive&lt;/a&gt;. 

There was even 11 year old Gema from &lt;a href="w%3AMiami"&gt;Miami&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; who came to see the wall and connect hereself to her schoolwork; "I wanted to see the wall to understand what they were teaching us. I want to write an article about it." 

Stephen Birks of &lt;a href="w%3AFort%20Long%20Beach%2C%20Florida"&gt;Fort Long Beach&lt;/a&gt; came to find Larry Rabren who dated his sister when Stephen was just 14.

Each has a story to tell and to remember this &lt;a href="w%3AValentine%27s%20Day"&gt;Valentine's Day&lt;/a&gt; night.

This weekend, March 25 and 26, was a big weekend in the area for &lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Idol"&gt;Canadian Idol&lt;/a&gt; want a Be's. Canadian Idol is a national singing competition that is organized by CTV Inc. a Canadian broadcasting communications company for Canadian citizens. The television show, greatly based on "American Idol," has been on going for several seasons. In the past auditions have been know to have line-ups of thousands of people, however, this year after taking a tour around the new location it appears that line ups were manageable. Having the auditions at the St. Laurent Shopping mall makes this easier said Idol's security coordinator Rick Paciorek. Organizers have decided to change the way the auditions will "rock and roll."

Having decided last minute, Saturday evening, to participate in the singing contest I decided to practice "I heard it through the grape vine" and "It's all coming back to me now." Lined up and registered on Sunday at around 10:30 a.m. the whole thing was fairly easy. Compared to previous year’s contestant may show up at any time they wish, in between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.

At 10:30 a.m. Sunday morning there were no real line ups for registration. Security and Canadian Idol greeting staff did however say that Saturday was "crazy (busy) with people lining-up as early as 5:00 a.m."

After receiving my competition number 16350 I tagged it to my shirt and ran back around to wait in line. Compared to my previous experience in Toronto 2003 this was heaven. A few competitors explored the shopping mall during this time. In Toronto 2003 the line up lasted about 18 hours before I got passed the first step.

Anxiety was in the air and to sooth the feeling a lot of people socialized. I talked to the closest person to me, a girl called Bambi that sings regularly at a local pub called the Royal Oaks. She sings every Thursday. Just before heading off to the audition a large pack of competitors just came back from the new Museum of War. As I waited in line I wondered if I should practice my songs. Within no time, we were up! We were called to sing in front of two judges in groups of five. The whole ordeal was over within approximately 2 hours. Actually, by 12:30 I was at home eating lunch and a little disappointed in my last minute decisions.

Also, compared to last year the maximum age limit went up from 26 to 28 years old. Participants may now be between the age of 16 and 28 years old.

There is even a "forum" discussion for those that want advice or comments about Canadian Idol. &lt;a href="http%3A//ctvforum.insinc.com/forums/forumdisplay.php%3Fs%3D58557139ee9f21cd798f02a93558ca7f%26amp%3Bforumid%3D5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The next Canadian Idol Auditions will be held in Halifax April 8 &amp; 9, 2006.

♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Australian"&gt;The Australian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ has reported today that the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has confirmed the authenticity of the images aired by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; television network &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASBS"&gt;SBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Contradicting claims made by some media outlets, SBS Dateline's executive producer Mike Carey claimed on Thursday that the program's researchers have found cases of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Ghraib%20prison"&gt;Abu Ghraib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; prisoner abuse that have not been dealt with by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; authorities. He described the new images available to SBS as a "quantum leap" compared to the previously broadcast pictures.

Carey announced that next week's program will show more abuse pictures, but he noted that some images featuring prisoners in sexually humiliating acts will not be broadcast, as they were deemed too graphic. Next week's program will also include interviews with a US soldier that has been convicted of prisoner abuse and another former soldier who witnessed the crimes. 

The ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWashington%20Post"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ has noted, as suggested by SBS, that several news outlets including themselves have "not published a substantial number of photographs they are holding." The ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ further explains that "Newspapers that have held these images have been constrained, in large part, by the sheer graphic nature of them, especially the nudity."

The ♡❤Washington Post♡❤ also cites SBS's ability to circumvent "the U.S. government's efforts to keep Abu Ghraib images out of the public eye" as another reason why the images were not first published by other media outlets.

The U.S. internet news site ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASalon.com"&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ has now published some of their own previously held back pictures and confirmed that they possess "files and other electronic documents from an internal Army investigation into the Abu Ghraib prisoner-abuse scandal", which include the originally published pictures, as well as the ones published by SBS. 

♡❤Salon♡❤ notes that some of the files from the Criminal Investigation Command refer to &lt;a href="CIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; agents that interrogated prisoners at Abu Ghraib, but that no CIA officers have been prosecuted "despite the death of at least one &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i during a CIA interrogation there", underscoring the claim made by SBS that some of the pictures document previously unprosecuted abuse. 

The US government expressed concerns about the new abuse pictures being published. John Bellinger of the State Department told ♡❤&lt;a href="BBC"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, "We felt that it was an invasion of the privacy of the detainees themselves to have these photographs come out... (and that the publication could also) fan the flames around the world and cause potentially further violence".

Tests have confirmed that wild swans in &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; had died from the deadly &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of the virus. Other suspected cases of the virus have been detected in &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;.

European health officials had expected wild birds migrating from &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; to Europe in spring to carry the disease into Western Europe. It is thought that swans were migrating from &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Ukraine"&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Sea"&gt;Black Sea&lt;/a&gt; driven by unusually cold weather.

Globally, 91 people have died after contracting the virus from close contact with diseased birds, but the greatest concern for European authorities is that an outbreak will occur among domesticated fowl, destroying local poultry industries. The H5N1 strain of bird flu is highly contagious, and lethal to birds. A single outbreak can kill tens of thousands of birds, and all birds must be culled across a wide region to prevent the spread of the disease.

No domesticated poultry or humans are thought to be infected in Western Europe at this time. Authorities continue to conduct intensive checks.

A number of countries across Europe, including Denmark, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; have required that domesticated fowl be kept indoors. In Germany and Hungary, two mile protection zones have been placed around the locations where dead swans, with all poultry required to be kept indoors and the shipping of meat outside the zones prohibited.

The &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; has toughened its bans on poultry products and now bans the importation of untreated bird feathers into its 25 member nations. The EU also hopes to test 60,000 wild birds and 300,0000 domestic birds as part of its bird flu surveillance program.

In France, the government asked citizens to keep domesticated fowl indoors throughout the country. Domesticated ducks will be vaccinated.

<h1>France says Iran's nuclear program is a &quot;military cover&quot;</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=France%20says%20Iran%27s%20nuclear%20program%20is%20a%20%26quot%3Bmilitary%20cover%26quot%3B&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; went on French TV and accused &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; of having a "clandestine" nuclear program saying, "no civilian nuclear program can explain the Iranian nuclear program. So it is a clandestine Iranian military nuclear program. The international community has sent a very firm message by saying to the Iranians: 'Come back to reason. Suspend all nuclear activity and the enrichment of uranium and the conversion of uranium', but they are not listening to us. That is the reason why, for the first time for days, the international community is united. It's not just the Europeans -- France, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt;, it's also &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;."

However, on a French radio station the Iranian chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani said, "contrary to all the propaganda against us, we are not seeking a nuclear bomb, since we are a signatory to (the nuclear) &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANon-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;(NPT)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . We are a responsible country - it is Western propaganda that keeps on saying that Iran is seeking a bomb, but it is not true. We want to be in this camp of countries that have nuclear energy technology but no nuclear weapons, such as &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;" 

China has expressed concern. Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang has said that &lt;a href="Beijing"&gt;Beijing&lt;/a&gt; wants a "peaceful solution by diplomatic means."

Iran resumed small-scale &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium%20enrichment"&gt;uranium enrichment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Tuesday, after the &lt;a href="IAEA"&gt;IAEA&lt;/a&gt; reported it to the &lt;a href="UN%20Security%20Council"&gt;UN Security Council&lt;/a&gt;. Iran had stopped the enrichment process nearly 2 1/2 years ago.
"Now it's up to the Security Council to say what it will do, what means it will use to stop, to manage, to halt this terrible crisis of nuclear proliferation caused by Iran," added Douste-Blazy. During discussion of the crisis of nuclear proliferation less than one year earlier, in the month-long 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, several representatives of non-aligned states complained about the violation of Article VI of the NPT by the official nuclear weapons states, including France, who allegedly have not yet made significant moves towards nuclear disarmament as required under Article VI, and about nuclear proliferation to previously non-nuclear weapons states, such as Germany, under ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Anuclear%20sharing"&gt;nuclear sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ arrangements.

The people of &lt;a href="Tokelau"&gt;Tokelau&lt;/a&gt; have rejected greater independence from &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in a referendum held this week. 60% of the eligible voters voted "yes" to become an independent state in free association with New Zealand, but this failed to reach the two thirds support required to take effect. The turnout for the referendum was high, reaching almost 95% of registered voters.

Tokelau, a 12 square-kilometre archipelago with a population of 1,500, consists of three islands that do not have roads, an airport or a capital. It is a dependent territory of New Zealand, but New Zealand's Prime Minister said Tokelau is already "exercising virtually all the responsibilities of a self governing country". According to the &lt;a href="UN"&gt;UN&lt;/a&gt; and New Zealand, Tokelau would have relied heavily on New Zealand for financial assistance even if independence had been chosen.

On February 13, &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%20Ravens"&gt;Baltimore Ravens&lt;/a&gt; cornerback &lt;a href="w%3ADeion%20Sanders"&gt;Deion Sanders&lt;/a&gt; announced his re-retirement from the &lt;a href="w%3ANFL"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;. Last January, many assumed Sanders would be leaving the league after spending 14 years in it. 

Sanders won back-to-back &lt;a href="w%3ASuper%20Bowl"&gt;Super Bowls&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco%2049ers"&gt;San Francisco 49ers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ADallas%20Cowboys"&gt;Dallas Cowboys&lt;/a&gt;. Sanders is the first professional athlete to win a &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Series"&gt;World Series&lt;/a&gt; and Super Bowl in his pro career. The All-Pro Cornerback had 53 interceptions, was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times and was once Defensive Player of the Year. 

Reports speculate Sanders, who broadcast with &lt;a href="w%3ACBS"&gt;♡❤CBS♡❤&lt;/a&gt; after his first retirement, may go back into news broadcasting, possibly on the [w:Fox Broadcasting Company|♡❤Fox♡❤]] NFL Pre-Game Show. 

After his retirement, current Ravens Cornerback Chris McAlister stated, "I'll miss Deion, just as the rest of the Ravens organization will. I learned a lot from him."

The &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Olympic%20Committee"&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IOC) announced that &lt;a href="w%3Abiathlon"&gt;biathlete&lt;/a&gt; Olga Pyleva, &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russian Federation&lt;/a&gt;, has been excluded from the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20Winter%20Olympics"&gt;XX Olympic Winter Games&lt;/a&gt; after failing an anti-doping test carried out by the IOC. This is the first instance of an athlete being ejected from the 2006 Winter Olympics.
Pyleva, 30, tested positive for &lt;a href="w%3Acarphedon"&gt;carphedon&lt;/a&gt;, a prohibited substance, on February 13 after the &lt;a href="w%3ABiathlon_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics%23Individual_.2815_km.29"&gt;women's 15 km individual, biathlon event&lt;/a&gt;, in which she won the silver medal.

ITAR-TASS News Agency reports that Pyleva tested positive for cordedon, a stimulant banned by the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Anti-Doping%20Agency"&gt;World Anti-Doping Agency&lt;/a&gt; (WADA). The substitute, phenotropil, was prescribed by her doctors following an ankle injury according to Nikolai Durmanov, head of the Russian Anti Doping Committee.
The IOC determined that Pyleva would be disqualified from the 15km Women’s Individual Biathalon, would be excluded from the remainder of the XX Olympic Winter Games and would have her Olympic accreditation immediately withdrawn.

The IOC routinely performs pre and post event tests for a broad array of illegal substances. For each individual sport, the top five finishers plus two random finishers are tested. So far the IOC has conducted 400 of the expected 1,200 tests to be done at these games.

Under IOC rules, Olympians that test positive for a banned substance are considered guilty regardless of circumstances.

Martina Glagon of &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, who finished with a Bronze medal, will be awarded the Silver. Albina Akhatova, Pyleva's Russian teammate will get the Bronze.

<h1>UN calls for Guantanamo shutdown</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=UN%20calls%20for%20Guantanamo%20shutdown&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

In a 40-page report released today, the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; special envoys on &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; reported their findings regarding the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; detention facility at &lt;a href="w%3AGuantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt;. The report concludes that certain procedures practised at the facility, and during transport to it, constitute torture. Moreover the report states that "attempts by the United States Administration to redefine 'torture' in the framework of the struggle against terrorism, in order to allow certain interrogation techniques that would not be permitted under the internationally accepted definition of torture, are of utmost concern." The report goes on to state that "the interrogation techniques authorized by the &lt;a href="w%3ADepartment%20of%20Defense"&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, particularly if used simultaneously, amount to degrading treatment in violation of article 7 of &lt;a href="w%3AICCPR"&gt;ICCPR&lt;/a&gt; and article 16 of the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Nations%20Convention%20Against%20Torture"&gt;Convention against Torture&lt;/a&gt;."

The report recommends that the United States bring the detainees to trial "in accordance with criminal procedure" or "release them without further delay", and that "The United States Government should close the Guantánamo Bay detention facilities without further delay." To avoid further practices amounting to "torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, discrimination on the basis of religion, and violations of the rights to health and freedom of religion" the report recommends that "In particular, all special interrogation techniques authorized by the Department of Defense should immediately be revoked."

In response to the report, White House spokesperson Scott McClellan said that the facility housed "dangerous terrorists". US officials have dismissed most of the claims as "largely without merit" and pointed out that the authors of the report never visited Guantanamo Bay, despite an invitation issued to three of the five investigators in November.

In an interview with the German weekly newspaper &lt;a href="w%3ADie%20Zeit"&gt;♡❤Die Zeit♡❤&lt;/a&gt; the United Nation's Special Rapporteur on torture and coauthor of the report Manfred Nowak said that it was the "sole responsibility of the United States that we could not visit Guantanamo". He adds that the United States explicitly barred the UN inspectors from talking to detainees, without which proper investigations are impossible. He pointed out that the need for interviews with prisoners, in order for considering investigations to be comprehensive, "is also the position of the United States when it concerns other countries, like &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;".

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANyon"&gt;Nyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The prosecutor did not withhold complains for "simple" and "severe" physical harm by negligence against gendarmes Poget and Deiss in the trial of the &lt;a href="w%3A29th%20G8%20summit"&gt;Aubonne Bridge affair&lt;/a&gt;. Verdict will be given of Friday in the morning.
<h2>Facts</h2>
On the 1st of June 2003, during the &lt;a href="w%3AG8"&gt;G8&lt;/a&gt;, a 19-person group of altermondialist militants held an illegal barricade, without notice, on the highway bridge which crosses the Aubonne river.

A rope was put across the road: at one end, 20 metres above the river, militant Martin Shaw had tied himself; the rope would get up to the bridge, loop around the barrier, bar the road, loop again at the other barrier, and get down to its other end, with militant Gesine Wenzel.

The rope was protected by two barrages of militantes and by posters reading "Do not shoot", and "Stop here or you will kill two people" (photo &lt;a href="http%3A//www.aubonnebridge.net/slideshowen/3.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Neither Wenzel not Shaw had any form of security system and the rope was not tied to the barriers; thus, the lives of the two militants depended on the integrity of the rope barring the road. Both activists were invisible from the road, unless looking over the barrier.

A dozen minutes afterward, the police arrived and tried to free the way for the 200 cars stalled by the blockade. The policemen saw the militants hanging at the end of the rope, and thus tried to have the cars drive below the rope by lifting it. Then, 25-year old gendarme Deiss, from Schaffouse, moved in and cut the rope with his knife. Gesine Wenzel was saved ♡❤in extremis♡❤ and pulled onto the bridge, shocked. Martin Shaw fell 20 metres into the shallow river, suffering severe injuries to his spine and several fractures; he had to spent one full month in hospital to recover, and still suffers from his wounds.

Deiss did not speak any &lt;a href="w%3AFrench%20language"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; (the indident took place in the French-speaking part of &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;) and was unaware of the presence of the militants; sergeant Poget was responsible for the intervention of the police. The plaintifs requested that Poget and Deiss be convicted for simple (for Wenzel) and severe (for Shaw) injuries by negligence.

<h2>Plaintifs</h2>

The plaintifs argued that the policemen had not tried to discuss with the activists and were not properly coordinated.

The clause of "rupture of causality links", which describes cases where things cannot be predicted, does not apply here because once the situation was assessed, it was the duty of the policemen to warn their colleagues.

Maître Garbade, lawyer of the plaintifs, also underlined the risks of being softer with the police and of the feeling of impunity which could follow. Since policement are typically confronted to delinquents, he said, their errors bring to context the offences committed by their victims, which tends to induce clemency for them (in this matter, the activists were trialed and convicted for blocking traffic circulation).

He also mentionned the difficulty of the investigation; the police was tempted to negate that a policeman had cut the rope, refused to aknowledge some testimonies, and gave immediate psychological support to Deiss, which was not done for the victims. "I do not believe that this trial would have taken place if it was not for the two video recordings", he said.

Maître Garbade went on saying that it was common sense to check the end of a rope before cutting it and requested that Poget and Deiss be convicted for simple (for Wenzel) and severe (for Shaw) injuries by negligence.

<h2>Prosecutor</h2>
M. Stoll, first substitute to the procuror, warned against the "myth of police impunity" and argued that he had recently requested and obtained conviction of two policemen. "Then are no preferences within the prosecution," he said.

The prosecution went on arguing that the "rupture of causality links" did in fact apply, since the time between Poget realising the situation and Deiss cutting the rope was very brief (one minute). Absence of dialogue between the policemen and the militants was understandable because the protest was unexpected, illegal and dangerous (the activists had blocked the highway without adequate signs warning the motorists).

The confused messages of the posters were also alluded to "Do not shoot" and "Stop here or you will kill two people", while a simple drawing of two people hanging from a bridge would have make the situation instantaneously clear for everybody; such drawings are featured on the web site of the activists.

The prosecution conclued saying that the "most probable cause" of the accident was the protest itself, and dropped the charges.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Savarino Construction Services Corp. has proposed a &lt;a href="U.S.%20dollar"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;7 million hotel project at the Forest and Elmwood Avenue intersection, according to ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Buffalo%20News"&gt;The Buffalo News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. The proposal calls for a 5-story, 45,000 square-foot 80-room hotel with underground parking for at least 50 vehicles, and 4,500 square-feet of retail space on the lower level.

Hans Mobius, the owner of the five properties to be purchased in the plan (1109 to 1121 Elmwood), reportedly signed a contract with Savarino to assemble the development. 

"We saw a huge opportunity to bring something to the Elmwood Village that will make sense and bring a service that's currently not available," said Eva Hassett, vice president of Savarino. "Elmwood is such a wonderful place to eat, shop, walk and spend time. We believe this project will add to that vibrant environment."

Some business owners in the area see it differently. ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ interviewed 2 of the 4 owners whose business's would be demolished if the development goes through.
Nancy Pollina, of Don Apparel at 1119 Elmwood, who found out about the development only yesterday, said she is "utterly" against the proposal. Her apparel shop has stood at the same location for nearly 14 years. She has volunteered in the community, and helped create several gardens around bus shelters in the city, and served on Forever Elmwood Board for six years as head of Beautification. Patty Morris co-owns Don Apparel with Pollina.

"To say this is a good looking project, I want to say the emperor has no clothes. This [project] does not take into consideration the needs of the college students. I have been told by college students, these shops here, are the reason they leave the campus," said Mrs. Pollina. 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20State%20College"&gt;Buffalo State College&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is 500-feet from the intersection.

Michael Faust, the owner of Mondo Video said, "Well, I do not really want to get kicked out of here. The landlord was very open, and the deal he made with me when I moved in here was 'the rent is cheap and I [the landlord] will not fix anything and that will not change.'" Faust said he first learned of the development plan, "about 48 hours ago. I found out on Tuesday when the Buffalo News called and asked for my opinion on this." Faust has not said if he will make plans to relocate. "We have to see if this [house] is going to get knocked down first," said Faust.

An "informational" meeting, where citizens can voice opinions and learn about the proposal, will be held on Tuesday February 21, 2006 at 5:00pm (eastern), at the Burchfield-Penney Art Center Gallery at Buffalo State College, Rockwell Hall.

Executive director of Forever Elmwood Corporation, Justin P. Azzarella would not comment on whether or not the organization supports the development, saying, "you will just have to come to the meeting."

Forever Elmwood Corp. is designed to preserve and protect the unique and historic nature of Elmwood Avenue and its surrounding neighborhoods and encourage neighborhood commercial revitalization. The organization was founded in 1994.
<h3>Same area was up for previous developments</h3>

Nearly two years ago, the Forever Elmwood Corp. assisted in the blocking of the demolition of the Edward Atwater house at 1089 Elmwood next to ♡❤Pano's♡❤ Restaurant which is at 1081 Elmwood. Owner Pano Georgiadis wanted to expand his restaurant onto the property where the house now stands, but the Common Council denied his permit to demolish saying the house is a historical landmark and needs to be protected. Georgiadis, who has a bleeding ulcer, said that all the court cases landed him in the hospital. "I got a bleeding ulcer, and since then, I don't care about this house anymore, or this city. I just go to work every day. I think [preservationists] are parasites," said Georgiadis.

Georgiadis will not be attending Tuesday's meeting saying, "I will be out of town."

In 1995 Hans Mobius proposed a plan to develop a ♡❤Walgreens♡❤, that was to be placed in the same location, but residents and business owners shot down the proposal. ♡❤Walgreens♡❤ eventually withdrew its request for a variance after pressure from the community.

Two &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n researchers at the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20National%20University"&gt;Australian National University&lt;/a&gt; estimate that a global &lt;a href="w%3APandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; of the deadly &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20influenza"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; could kill between 1.4 and 140 million humans and cause a global recession. They will formally present their research to the &lt;a href="w%3ALowy%20Institute"&gt;Lowy Institute&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; today.

Professor Warwick McKibbin, a well respected economic modeller, member of the board of the &lt;a href="w%3AReserve%20Bank%20of%20Australia"&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia&lt;/a&gt; and health expert and Dr Alexandra Sidorenko modelled the effect of a bird flu pandemic on human health and the global economy. Their study looks at four possible scenarios - mild, moderate, severe and extreme.

Under the mild scenario, they predict that 1.4 million people worldwide and 2,100 Australians would die. The extreme scenario predicts 140 million worldwide deaths with 214,000 Australians among them. 30 percent of the Australian population would be expected to become infected should a pandemic occur.

In the extreme case, the global ecomomy would suffer losses of &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;4.4 trillion or 12.6 percent.

Prof. McKibbin says that his economic estimates do not only include the cost of death but also for lost productivity. In an interview with &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;, Professor McKibbin said "Firstly, there's a reduction in the labour force. Now, interestingly it's not just that people die which is causing economic loss, but actually there is a substantial amount of illness in any influenza pandemic. "

"And so we try and capture both the death and the impact of that on the economy as well as illness during the pandemic, and including the fact that different economies have different labour market structures and that it's not just workers that get sick but also children, and we try to model the fact that carers will be taking time off work. " said Prof. McKibbin.

Pandemics have broken out every 10 to 40 years since the 19th century. The last pandemic was in 1968 caused by the &lt;a href="w%3AHong%20Kong%20flu"&gt;Hong Kong flu&lt;/a&gt;. 

"It is 37 years since the last pandemic and many argue that another pandemic is overdue," warns the report. The report advises investment in &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, where health systems are less developed.

Ex-&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; agent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARaymond%20McGovern"&gt;Ray McGovern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVeteran%20Intelligence%20Professionals%20for%20Sanity"&gt;Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has called for people with inside information on the alleged &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUS"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIsrael"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; threats to launch an attack on Iran to become &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="wikt%3Awhistleblower"&gt;whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by revealing this information. McGovern is strongly critical of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; administration of the US.

He claims that he personally had missed a chance to try to stop the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVietnam%20War"&gt;Vietnam War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by failing to whistleblow about a cable sent by General &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACreighton%20Abrams"&gt;Abrams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on August 20, 1967 regarding a significant underestimate of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVietnam"&gt;Vietnamese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; troop numbers.
He called for "shedding light on what the Bush administration is up to beneath the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aspin%20%28public%20relations%29"&gt;spin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; " and asked that "Those of you clued into Israeli plans and U.S. intelligence support for them might clue us in too."

McGovern alleges that an attack on Iran is likely to happen in March, saying "Anyone who has been near a TV in recent weeks has heard the drumbeat for war on Iran. The best guess for timing is next month."

He recommended from his personal experience "Don't bother this time with the once-independent congressional oversight committees... Nor should you bother with the once-independent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York%20Times"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Find some other way. ... just be sure you get the truth out – information that will provide the oxygen for democracy."

McGovern also claims that whistleblowing could have stopped the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;2003 Invasion of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , saying "Any number of people would have had a good chance of stopping the Iraq war, had they the courage to disclose publicly what they knew BEFORE it was launched." Just five days before the attack on Iraq officially started, McGovern and his colleagues called for whistleblowing and claimed that the Bush administration was misrepresenting the case for an attack on Iraq. McGovern described the administration's information on March 15, 2003, saying "It's been cooked to a recipe, and the recipe is high policy."

In September 2004, McGovern along with &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Ellsberg"&gt;Daniel Ellsberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who had precipitated a national uproar in 1971 when he released the &lt;a href="w%3APentagon%20Papers"&gt;Pentagon Papers&lt;/a&gt;, the US military's account of activities during the Vietnam War, to The New York Times, along with several other colleagues had already announced that they would form a whistleblowers' support network for revealing possibly classified information regarding the conduct of the occupation of Iraq.

&lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt;, White House spokesman, dismissed a &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; report today dealing with the &lt;a href="w%3AGuant%C3%A1namo%20Bay"&gt;Guantánamo Bay&lt;/a&gt; facilities. The UN report said that the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; government should "expeditiously bring all Guantánamo Bay detainees to trial" without further delay, and called upon the U.S. to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility.

McClellan responded, "These are dangerous terrorists that we're talking about that are there and I think we've talked about that issue before and nothing's changed in terms of our views." McClellan added, "We know that these are dangerous terrorists that are being kept at Guantanamo Bay. They are people that are determined to harm innocent civilians or harm innocent Americans. They were enemy combatants picked up on the battlefield in the war on terrorism." 

Three months ago, the US Ambassador to the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, Jan Krc, asked that country to give &lt;a href="wikt%3Aasylum"&gt;asylum&lt;/a&gt; to a group of Guantanamo detainees which would have set them free in Europe. The U.S. request to the Czechs about asylum was "a humanitarian request because we clearly need to place these people somewhere," Krc said.

In a press encounter, &lt;a href="Kofi%20Annan"&gt;Kofi Annan&lt;/a&gt; responded to a journalist, he didn't accept all the conclusions of the report but, "Sooner or later there will be a need to close Guantanamo, sooner or later". He said, "I cannot agree with everything in the report, but I did indicate that the basic premise, that we need to be careful to have a balance between effective action against terrorism and individual liberties and civil rights, I think is valid."

The United Nations report is based upon information from the United States Government, interviews conducted by the experts with former Guantanamo Bay detainees currently residing or detained in &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. government's invitation for UN investigators to visit the prison was turned down because the United States would not allow the UN investigation team to conduct interviews with detainees. The report follows an 18 month study by 5 experts in various areas of human rights.

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n based pharmaceutical company &lt;a href="w%3ACSL%20Limited"&gt;CSL&lt;/a&gt; has announced that despite promising human trials of their &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20influenza"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; vaccine, more research is needed before the final formula can be developed.

Late last year the Australian federal government gave CSL AU$ 5 million to speed up research into the bird flu vaccine.

The vaccine was tested on 400 Australians aged between 18 and 45 in October last year to determine its safety and effectiveness. The strain of bird flu used for the trials was taken from a bird flu victim in &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; and neutralised to prevent it from being contagious.

The next phase of the trial will include 700 people from varying age groups. 

CSL has previously indicated that once their vaccine is approved, it could take between three and six months to manufacture enough of the vaccine to inoculate every Australian.

After 6 policemen who supervised the manual &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3Acoca%20eradication"&gt;eradication of coca&lt;/a&gt; plants were killed in the &lt;a href="w%3Aes%3A%20Serran%C3%ADa%20de%20la%20Macarena"&gt;Serrania de la Macarena National Park&lt;/a&gt;, 270 km south of &lt;a href="w%3ABogot%C3%A1"&gt;Bogotá&lt;/a&gt;, President &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AAlvaro%20Uribe"&gt;Alvaro Uribe&lt;/a&gt; announced this Thursday from &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AWashington"&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt; that he authorized the &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;]n &lt;a href="w%3AColombian%20Air%20Force"&gt;Air Force&lt;/a&gt; to bombard the area, where, according to the authorities, they found eight sites with tents and equipment belonging to the &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3ARevolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia"&gt;Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia&lt;/a&gt; (FARC), allegedly responsible for the death of the police officials.

“We are going to define the way to evacuate the area of Macarena to bomb it before the coca eradicators enter again” said the president. “This is a difficult confrontation, which represents an important effort to defeat terrorism once and for all”, stated the Minister of defense Camilo Ospina.

Even though the bombing started this Thursday, the authorities confirmed that the manual eradication in the Macarena area will continue. Some coca eradicators, most of whom are peasants, decided to give up the job due to the difficult security conditions. However, General Jorge Daniel Castro, director of the National Police, stated that since January 20th when the operation started more than 140 ha of coca crops have been eradicated.

The announcement made by Uribe has outraged environment activists who warn about the ecological damages that the military actions may cause in the area which was declared national park in 1971. The Macarena area has been saved from fumigations.

<h1>Graffiti game banned in Australia</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Graffiti%20game%20banned%20in%20Australia&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Film%20and%20Literature%20Classification%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Office of Film &amp; Literature Classification Review Board&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has refused to classify &lt;a href="w%3AMarc%20Ecko%27s%20Getting%20Up%3A%20Contents%20Under%20Pressure"&gt;Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure&lt;/a&gt;. The computer game's premise is a future world where freedom of expression is suppressed by a tyrannical city government and to win the game the player has to express his message through &lt;a href="w%3Agraffiti"&gt;graffiti&lt;/a&gt;. 
The decision was made by 5 members who voted 3/5 against the classification of the game; Ms Maureen Shelley, the convenor, broke the deadlock on the grounds it encourages crime. The game cannot be sold, demonstrated, hired or imported without a classification. Australia is the only country to ban the game so far. The decision comes even though &lt;a href="w%3AOffice%20of%20Film%20and%20Literature%20Classification%20%28Australia%29"&gt;OFLC&lt;/a&gt; guidelines state that adults may hear, read and see what they wish.

The game was originally rated MA15+ for Strong violence, and strong themes on 18 November 2005. 

Other games to be banned in Australia include &lt;a href="w%3APostal%28computer%20game%29"&gt;Postal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ABMX%20XXX"&gt;BMX XXX&lt;/a&gt;, while
'Combat: Task Force 121', a game whose premise involves shooting people to defend US interests from Marxist rebels &lt;a href="http%3A//www.atari.com.au/games/info.do%3Fid%3D378"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
was rated M (below the maximum rating of MA for a video game in Australia) and is therefore available to buy by anyone of any age.

Atari Australia, the games local &lt;a href="w%3Adistributor"&gt;distributor&lt;/a&gt; has said it strongly disagrees with the outcome and they defend the original MA rating 
"We are definitely investigating all our options at the moment. If we can appeal it we will," said Mr David Wildgoose, public relations manager at &lt;a href="w%3AAtari"&gt;Atari&lt;/a&gt;.
Any action to be taken would take place after they receive the Review Board's written decision.
&lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Ecko"&gt;Mark Ecko&lt;/a&gt; has been also expressed his point of view
“I am extremely disappointed in the Australian Government Classification Review Board’s move to ban my video game ... based solely on a perceived notion that it somehow will promote the crime of graffiti.” 

Ms Maureen Shelley, when questioned on her decision by the ABC’s &lt;a href="w%3ALateline"&gt;Lateline&lt;/a&gt;, said she didn’t need proof that video games encourage crime—only that she thought they could.

Some men imprisoned at &lt;a href="Guantanamo%20Bay"&gt;Guantanamo&lt;/a&gt; are not considered a threat by &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Pentagon"&gt;the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;. 
For months &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; officials have been trying to find a country which will grant these men asylum.

"What's clear here is that the military had its own military secret tribunal. There were no lawyers there, I wasn't there," said a &lt;a href="w%3ABoston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; attorney who represents two of the detainees in question. "They determined at this tribunal that these men were not &lt;a href="w%3Aal%20Qaeda"&gt;al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, they were not &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;. They were not criminals, they were not enemies. They were a mistake."

Three months ago, the US Ambassador to the &lt;a href="Czech%20Republic"&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, Jan Krc, asked that country to give asylum to a group of Guantanamo detainees which would have set them free in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. request to the Czechs about asylum was "a humanitarian request because we clearly need to place these people somewhere," Krc said.

US Judge &lt;a href="w%3AJames%20Robertson%20%28judge%29"&gt;James Robertson&lt;/a&gt; said in December 2005 that "nothing… establishes that the government has or could reasonably have a concern that these petitioners would return to the battlefield if released." 

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; yesterday in a written statement,"It is the long-standing policy of the United States not to transfer a person to a country if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the person will be tortured… we are looking into resettlement… outside &lt;a href="w%3AChina"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;." However,the US government has denied granting asylum within the USA to these men.

With regard to Guantanamo Bay prisoners in general, the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; spokesman, &lt;a href="w%3AScott%20McClellan"&gt;Scott McClellan&lt;/a&gt; said yesterday, "These are dangerous terrorists that we're talking about that are there and I think we've talked about that issue before and nothing's changed in terms of our views." McClellan added, "We know that these are dangerous terrorists that are being kept at Guantanamo Bay. They are people that are determined to harm innocent civilians or harm innocent Americans. They were enemy combatants picked up on the battlefield in the war on terrorism."

&lt;a href="w%3ABBC%20News"&gt;BBC News&lt;/a&gt; is now reporting that at least 83 people were rescued after a massive &lt;a href="w%3Alandslide"&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt; buried three villages in &lt;a href="w%3ASaint%20Bernard%2C%20Southern%20Leyte"&gt;Saint Bernard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Leyte"&gt;Southern Leyte&lt;/a&gt; province, in central &lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, Friday. So far, 19 people have been confirmed dead. Up to 1,500 are thought to still be missing. The &lt;a href="w%3APhilippine%20National%20Red%20Cross"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; has despatched a plane with rescuers and basic equipment; they have also appealed for &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;1.5 million for relief supplies for the affected area. 

It is believed that the slides were triggered by heavy rains of up to 200cm (79 inches) in just 10 days and an &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; of magnitude 2.6. Some residents had already left the area previous to the disaster fearing landslides but had returned following easing of the rain.

Houses and an elementary school packed with children were buried, officials and witnesses said. Photographs and footage show only coconut trees and a few tin roofs sticking out of the soil after part of a mountainside collapsed on the farming village of &lt;a href="w%3AGuinsaugon"&gt;Guinsaugon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Leyte"&gt;Southern Leyte&lt;/a&gt; province.

Rescue efforts are being hampered due to continual rock falls, washed out bridges, chest deep mud and a lack of heavy equipment. "Rescuers are scared because they can still hear the mountain rumbling," said Maria Lim, the mayor of Saint Bernard, where a minor earthquake was felt on Friday morning. President &lt;a href="Gloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; has ordered the navy and the coast to the area to assist with relief efforts when conditions improve. Two &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; vessels are also on their way to help.

MPs at the &lt;a href="w%3ABritish%20Parliament"&gt;British Parliament&lt;/a&gt; have voted by large majority of 200 to bring in legislation &lt;a href="w%3ASmoking%20ban"&gt;banning smoking&lt;/a&gt; in all pubs, clubs and workplaces in a landmark free vote. The ban is expected to come into force from summer 2007. 

The originally proposed fine of £200 was raised to £2500 for failing to stop people smoking in banned areas in the late stages of the parliamentary process. Other fines include a fixed penalty notice of £50 for lighting up in banned areas and spot fines of £200 for failing to display no smoking signs in banned areas.

Smoking may also be banned in "substantially enclosed" venues such as railway stations and football stadiums; this may also include cars carrying passengers but no decision has been taken on this as yet. Ministers will finalise precise regulations after a three month consultation.

The vote was politically fraught, as the &lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; in government had proposed a 'compromise' bill, in line with their election manifesto, which would allow pubs not serving food to be exempt from the ban. With many Labour MPs threatening to rebel against this compromise however, in favour of a full ban, Labour granted its members a free vote. MPs then voted for the full ban by a margin of 453 votes to 125,­ a majority of 328.

MPs then debated a last-minute amendment to exempt private members clubs, which was also rejected, by 384 votes to 184,­ a majority of 200. The Prime Minister, &lt;a href="Tony%20Blair"&gt;Tony Blair&lt;/a&gt;, voted for a complete ban along with his health secretary, &lt;a href="w%3APatricia%20Hewitt"&gt;Patricia Hewitt&lt;/a&gt;.

The ban will bring England in line with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, which will all be introducing a full smoking ban for pubs and clubs. The bill also gives ministers powers to increase the age for purchasing cigarettes from 16 to 18 which ministers will begin the consultation process upon shortly.

The online magazine, &lt;a href="w%3ASalon%20magazine"&gt;Salon.com&lt;/a&gt; claims to have received a DVD containing what may be all of the material from an Army investigation into the infamous Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal.

According to Salon's report, the DVD includes an investigative report by the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID). In a report by Special Agent James E. Seigmund, the summary of the content includes, "a total of 1,325 images of suspected detainee abuse, 93 video files of suspected detainee abuse, 660 images of adult pornography, 546 images of suspected dead Iraqi detainees, 29 images of soldiers in simulated sexual acts, 20 images of a soldier with a Swastika drawn between his eyes, 37 images of Military Working dogs being used in abuse of detainees and 125 images of questionable acts."

Salon claims their source is a uniformed officer who spent time at Abu Ghraib and is familiar with the CID investigation. The DVD of material is described as all from a period of October 18, 2003 to December 30,2003.

In reporting on Salon's scoop, the &lt;a href="w%3AGuardian"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; reported that a Pentagon spokesman said recent reports, "could only further inflame and possibly incite unnecessary violence in the world". &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20al-Jaafari"&gt;Ibrahim al-Jaafari&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Minister of Iraq condemned the abuse, whilst pointing out that members of US Forces had already been punished for it. 

Whilst the Salon report concedes that prosecutions related to the abuse continue, it notes that none of the CIA interrogators who were said to operate at the prison have been prosecuted and no high-ranking officer or official has yet been charged in relation to the abuse.

Harry Whittington, the person who was shot by Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; in a hunting accident, was released from the hospital today. He said to reporters that "My family and I are deeply sorry for all that Vice President Cheney and his family have had to go through this week."

Only minutes later, Cheney received a standing ovation from &lt;a href="Wyoming"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; lawmakers. "I want to thank you for that welcome home," Cheney said in his first public appearance after the shooting, when he was addressing the Wyoming state Legislature.

The chief of emergency care Dr. Blanchard, who treated Whittington explained that the reasons for the discharge are Whittington's "excellent health". He added that Whittington was "a lucky person" to survive the shooting.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANyon"&gt;Nyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — After the prosecution dropped the charges on Wednesday, the local tribunal of Nyon pronounced a double acquittement for sergeant Poget and gendarme Deiss () — &lt;i&gt;Original Reporting&lt;/i&gt;

<h2>Nearly one hour of judgement</h2>
The 23-page judgement, particularly long for such an affair, was pronounced by the president on Friday at 11:45.

Acknowledging the lasting physical and psychological harm caused to Shaw and Wenzel, the tribunal reacted to the deliberate will to turn the trial into a political tribune: "The tribunal is not the control authority for the police", the president reminded. He ruled out any commentary about preliminary investigations, which had been subject to the criticism of Maître Gerbade, attorney for the plaintiffs, during his requisitory.

The judging underlines the non-violence of the alter-globalisation militants, who "cannot be compared to the vandals" who has made a rampage in Geneva and Lausanne the same day. He also reminded a particularly difficult context for the policemen, who were facing their 4th important intervention of the morning. A filling station had notably been put to fire, fortunately without any harm to people. The tribunal also specifically quoted Indymedia, which it said is an "honourable source". 

Reminders of facts insisted on several points:

The militant who was acting as a sentry to protect the rope was not forcibly evacuated by the police, but rather left her station on her own will, in an attempt to interdict the passage of cars under the rope, then lifted by the police.

"One minute and ten seconds" at most passed before the rope was cut by Deiss, one minute of "confusion and general mess", according to the court.

Several policemen were tempted to cut the rope to allow the passage of cars and remove the blocking of the highway, but were told not to do so by a sergeant; thus, cutting the rope seems to be what one would naturally be tempted to do, according to the Court.

The numerous cars stranded on the highway because of the blockade were a risk of major accident; the drivers were infuriated by the stop and the radio was reporting the unrest in Lausanne and Geneva, creating and atmosphere of stress and fear, according the president.

The warnings put by the militants ("do not shoot" and "Stop here or you will kill two people") were seen by the Court as "ambiguous" at best, and "incomprehensible" at worst, since the militants were sitting on the highway, a dangerous place where their own lives were in jeopardy.

"As a consequence, noting can be reproached to the policemen", the president said. "Bullshit", shouted Shaw, who then rose, and barred the room with a poster reading "Police everywhere, justice nowhere"; after insulting the tribunal, the militants and their friend in the audience left in much turmoil, letting the President free to proceed.

The accident occurred as a "series of misunderstandings" and of unlucky causes. Confronted to a completely new situation (no such event had ever occurred then), the policemen acted for what they though was the best interest of the militants and the users of the highway. Denying any will to call the attention of the offence committed by the plaintiffs, the Court however the lack of security rope, of signals, of notification to the authorities and the possibility for the militants to rope themselves at 4 or 5 metres high rather than 25.

In conclusion, the Court pronounced acquittement for Poget, acquittement for Deiss, the payement of the spendings of Justice by the State, and the restitution of the evidences to the parties.

<h2>Demonstration of the alter-globalisation militants</h2>
Even before the audience, in anticipation of the verdict, the militants protested in front of the courthouse, brandishing posters ("Your cops are your responsibility") and mocking the Court.

In addition to the noisy events of the court room, Shaw also gave much talking after exiting the courthouse, criticising the Justice of the canont of Vaud: "The whole system is corrupted from bottom to top", he said. He complained that it is not possible to obtain justice in Switzerland.

A press conference followed. The commucation to the press on the site of the militants calls of "direct action".

The has successfully launched another of their &lt;a href="w%3AH-IIA"&gt;H-IIA&lt;/a&gt; space rockets. Its payload, the &lt;a href="w%3AMulti-Functional%20Transport%20Satellite"&gt;MTSAT-2&lt;/a&gt; satellite designed to control air traffic and track weather patterns, has successfully separated from the rocket. It is due to be inserted into a geostationary orbit on the 21st of February.

The satellite is owned by the Civil Aviation Bureau and the Japan Meteorological Agency, part of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.

The first cases of &lt;a href="w%3Abird%20flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; have been registered in the world's second most populous country, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. The cases registered are reportedly from the Nandurbar Slaughter House in the western state of &lt;a href="w%3AMaharashtra"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt;. Some 1500 birds have been reported as having the disease. Maharashtra Animal Husbandary Minister Anees Ahmed confirmed the reports and said that effective steps will be taken with the help of eminent veterinarians. Ahmed also said a high-level meeting was under way in Mumbai to assess the situation and to decide how to cull the large flocks of birds in poultries in Nandurbar and Dhule districts.

The minister also stated that state authorities had decided to cull all 500,000 chickens in the farms in an area of roughly three kilometres around the farms where the infected birds were found. 

More than 25,000 chickens had died in poultry farms in the district over the past 10 days, district official Jayant Gaikwad said.

This is the first time that the disease has been reported in India, a nation of 1.1 billion people. There were no reports of infected people and Maharashtra government officials said there was no reason to panic. 

The federal cabinet was meeting in New Delhi to take stock of the situation. 

India's animal husbandry and health authorities have a contingency plan in place in case of an avian flu outbreak. The government has said that there are adequate supplies of the generic Tamiflu drug to meet an emergency. 

Ahmed said consignments of the drug had been flown to northern Maharashtra, but there have so far been no reports of humans becoming infected.

Doctors have been rushed to the affected areas to take precautionary measures, he added. India's Animal Disease Laboratory also confirmed the virus in dead chickens. 

&lt;a href="w%3AMaharashtra"&gt;Maharashtra&lt;/a&gt; is the second most populous state in India, having a population of 120 million.

The &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of bird flu, which has killed at least 90 people since early 2003, can infect humans in close contact with birds.

An explosion has been reported near the gate of the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippine&lt;/a&gt; army's 104th Brigade headquarters, inside a karaoke bar on southern Jolo Island. At least 20 people are reported to have been injured. 

According to witnesses, most of the wounded were female entertainers, and men who were drinking at the bar.

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S&lt;/a&gt; troops are encamped on the grounds for joint military exercises.

Security is a major concern for these exercises, mainly due to the presence of the &lt;a href="w%3AAbu%20Sayyaf"&gt;Abu Sayyaf&lt;/a&gt; guerilla group, which is related to &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, and is stationed about 580 miles south of &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;.

Lt. Col. Mark Zimmer, a military spokesman said that no American deaths have been reported.

University academics in the Association of University Teachers (AUT) and NATFHE unions in &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;Britain&lt;/a&gt; have voted in favour of strike action in protest against academic salaries. The unions claim that academic pay has fallen 40 per cent in relative terms over the past 20 years and that employers have broken public promises to use extra government funding to improve pay.

Members were given the options of voting for strike action and also for 'action short of a strike'. 64% of those who voted in the AUT, and 70% of the NATFHE members, voted for strike action. 81% of members voting in AUT, and 87% of NATFHE members, voted for action short of a strike. Turnout for AUT members was 51%, and turnout for NATFHE was 47%.

NATFHE general secretary Paul Mackney said, "This is a strong mandate for action and shows the level of dissatisfaction throughout higher education." Speaking to the employers, he said that they must respond immediately with an offer - not talks about talks - if they are to prevent disruption. AUT general secretary Sally Hunt said, "University staff do not appreciate being lied to and today they have said that enough is enough."

The Universities and Colleges Employers' Association (UCEA) claimed that the ballot represented only a "small minority" of academic staff and offered 'constructive negotiations', but only if the threat of industrial action was dropped. Jocelyn Prudence, Chief Executive, said that they would seek to minimise any impact upon students.

<h1>H5N1 confirmed in France</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=H5N1%20confirmed%20in%20France&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
The strain of bird flu lethal to humans, &lt;a href="H5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;, has been confirmed to have infected a dead wild duck, found on Monday, in marshland near &lt;a href="Lyon"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; in the east of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;. France is the seventh country in the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; to suffer this virus; following &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Slovenia"&gt;Slovenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bulgaria"&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. Suspected cases of H5N1 in &lt;a href="Croatia"&gt;Croatia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt; remain unconfirmed.

Globally, The H5N1 strain has infected 171 people, and killed 93 of them, since 2003.

<h3>Emergency measures</h3>

A 3 km (2 mi) safety area has been set-up from the area in which the bird died. In accordance with EU guidelines, vets will check all the birds in this zone. Surveillance has increased on wild birds within 10 km (6 mi).

In an attempt to address the public concern, a telephone line and website has been set-up. This notifies them not to touch dead birds, but to report them straight away to the authorities.

France, as the largest producer of poultry in Europe, already has farmers worrying about their livelihood; despite the fact the avian flu has not affected any of the nation's poultry. If the disease transfers to poultry, the transport of poultry can be restricted.

Further tests have been done on two ducks that have died in the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASomme"&gt;Somme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; region in the north of France.

<h1>Avian Flu is confirmed in Egypt</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Avian%20Flu%20is%20confirmed%20in%20Egypt&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Yesterday February 17, 2006, the &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; officially declared presence of the &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; strain of the &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20influenza"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt; virus in &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;.

"There is avian flu now in Egypt," Hassan el Bushra, regional adviser for emerging diseases at the eastern Mediterranean regional office of the WHO said. His response was to the reported presence of H5N1 virus in dead birds in three areas in Egypt - namely &lt;a href="w%3ACairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AGiza"&gt;Giza&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Minya"&gt;Al-Minya&lt;/a&gt;.

Today February 18, 2006, a responsible source from Egyptian ministry of health announced reporting of another 25 cases of infected birds in &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Minya"&gt;Al-Minya&lt;/a&gt; with aftermath of 35 confirmed cases between birds, yet there are no human cases reported.

<h3>Control measures</h3>
Egypt has banned the import of live birds and has tightened quarantine controls at airports to keep out bird flu. It has also canceled the annual bird hunting season to minimize contacts between people and migrant birds.
In Cairo phone numbers 3912136, 3907147, and the hotline 152 have been assigned for reporting any suspected cases. 
A newly formed unit formed of veterinarians and preventive medicine specialists in &lt;a href="w%3AGiza"&gt;Giza&lt;/a&gt; actively studying more than 70 reports of dead birds for exclusion of H5N1.

Egyptian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AAhmed%20Nazif"&gt;Ahmed Naxif&lt;/a&gt; has advised people who breed poultry at their homes to dispose of their birds to prevent the virus from spreading.

"The time has come to get rid of the idea of breeding chickens on the roofs of houses, especially under current circumstances," he said.

Many Egyptian citizens breed chickens and pigeons on the roof of their residences for their own consumption and as a source of extra income.

Despite avian flu mainly being a disease of poultry, it has also infected 171 people, killing 93 of them, and is steadily &lt;a href="w%3AMutation"&gt;mutating&lt;/a&gt;. If it acquires the ability to pass easily from person to person it could cause a pandemic that might kill millions.

The &lt;a href="w%3AIran%20Policy%20Committee"&gt;Iran Policy Committee&lt;/a&gt;, a pressure group meant to influence &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; government policy towards &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, made up of former &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AState%20Department"&gt;State Department&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APentagon"&gt;Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt; officials, and supported by several members of the US &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Congress"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt;, called for covert military action on Iranian territory and support for the &lt;a href="w%3APeople%27s%20Mujahedin%20of%20Iran"&gt;Mujahedin-e Khalq&lt;/a&gt; (MKO or MEK), which is presently (though controversially) listed by the State Department as a &lt;a href="w%3AU.S.%20State%20Department%20list%20of%20Foreign%20Terrorist%20Organizations"&gt;Foreign Terrorist Organization&lt;/a&gt;. The MKO has had public support in several &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; countries and the US, including from many members of Congress.

Members of the Iran Policy Committee proposed removing the MKO from the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations and supporting it as part of Iranian "Civil Society". Their proposal is to support Iranians by both covert military methods and other methods to remove the system of government under which president &lt;a href="Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt; was recently elected, in the second round of presidential elections in 2005, and replace it by a new form of government. 

On February 15, 2006, &lt;a href="w%3AHuman%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; (HRW) defended its May 2005 report on the MKO, describing additional interviews and verifications it had taken to check claims of inaccuracies in its report. It claimed that the former report was accurate. In the May 2005 report, HRW claimed on the basis of various documents and interviews with ex-members of the MKO that "abuses &lt;nowiki&gt;[occurred]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ranging from detention and persecution of ordinary members wishing to leave the organization, to lengthy solitary confinements, severe beatings, and &lt;a href="w%3Atorture"&gt;torture&lt;/a&gt; of dissident members." The report also noted that the MKO is strongly focused on its leadership, the husband and wife team of &lt;a href="w%3AMassoud%20Rajavi"&gt;Massoud&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMaryam%20Rajavi"&gt;Maryam Rajavi&lt;/a&gt;, to the extent that members burned themselves alive in protest when Maryam Rajavi was arrested in &lt;a href="w%3AParis"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;.

Meanwhile in the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20Kingdom"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="w%3AConservative%20Party%20%28UK%29"&gt;Conservative Party&lt;/a&gt; said that military action against
Iran "should not be ruled out to deal with its controversial nuclear programme", that "it was wrong for the &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;'s foreign affairs spokesman &lt;a href="w%3AJavier%20Solana"&gt;Javier Solana&lt;/a&gt; to rule out the use of force" and that "it is wrong for Britain's Foreign Secretary, &lt;a href="w%3AJack%20Straw"&gt;Jack Straw&lt;/a&gt;, to echo &lt;nowiki&gt;[Javier Solana]&lt;/nowiki&gt;."

The previous removal of an elected government in Iran in which the US was involved was &lt;a href="w%3AOperation%20Ajax"&gt;Operation Ajax&lt;/a&gt; in 1953, a complex plot involving the CIA and British intelligence services, motivated by &lt;a href="w%3AMohammed%20Mossadegh"&gt;Mohammed Mossadegh&lt;/a&gt;'s nationalisation of oil companies.

Children on a field trip in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have discovered what may be the finest giant &lt;a href="w%3APenguin"&gt;penguin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AFossil"&gt;fossil&lt;/a&gt; yet found. These early penguins stood 1.5 metres (5 feet) tall, weighing over 100 kilograms (220 pounds), and lived some 40 million years ago. 

While the party of 22 from the Hamilton Junior Naturalists Club were looking for fossils, they did not expect to find anything this significant in their trip to &lt;a href="w%3AKawhia"&gt;Kawhia&lt;/a&gt;, an hour southwest of &lt;a href="w%3AHamilton%2C%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;. Group leader Chris Templer said that the sea was already beginning to erode the fossil, and if it had not been found for another 18 months, there might not have been much left. He has dreamed of making a find like this since he began hunting fossils as an eight-year-old. "I went 'Oh my God', and just about keeled over on the reef," he said. 

The fossil has been carefully removed after consultation with &lt;a href="w%3ATe%20Papa"&gt;Te Papa&lt;/a&gt; (the national museum) and local &lt;a href="w%3AM%C4%81ori"&gt;Māori&lt;/a&gt;. Experts are excited by the completeness of the Kawhia fossil. Although roughly a dozen extinct penguin species have already been discovered in New Zealand, only a few fossilised bones have been found from most of these species. Te Papa has only three bones from the largest giant penguin. According to Alan Tennyson, curator of fossils at Te Papa, the Kawhia discovery might be of international significance. "I think it's very exciting to find something like this...it's a very rare event to find such a well preserved specimen," he enthused.

At least 11 people died in &lt;a href="Benghazi"&gt;Benghazi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; on Friday when about 1,000 protesters surrounded and set fire to an &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt; consulate and burned &lt;a href="Denmark"&gt;Danish&lt;/a&gt; flags. The demonstration was in protest of Italian Reforms Minister &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Calderoli"&gt;Roberto Calderoli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who had worn a T-shirt displaying the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons"&gt;Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

A Libyan government statement said, "eleven casualties, including dead, resulted from the clashes." some of the casualties were police officers.

After wearing the T-shirt, Calderoli offered to resign.

On Saturday, Libya suspended its Interior Minister, Nasr al-Mabrouk. Libya said that "excessive use of force" was used in the riots the day before. The government also said that "all those involved in Friday's riots and the officials responsible for them" should be investigated and referred to the courts. "We condemn the excessive use of force and the inappropriate way that went beyond the limits of carrying out the duties of the police."

A December CIA report revealed several incidents of sloppy undercover work by agents. In one humorous series of incidents, a clandestine operative booked herself at foreign hotels under aliases, but insisted that frequent-flier miles earned at the hotels be credited to her personal frequent-flier account.

Other incidents detailed included cases of covert agents who failed to remove their cell phone batteries, making them vulnerable to electronic tracking even if the phone was off.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organization"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; reported on February 15, 2006 that &lt;a href="w%3Apolio"&gt;polio&lt;/a&gt; had been eradicated in &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Niger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;. There has been no reported case of the disease in the past year, leading officials to believe the disease is no longer present.

Egypt's Minister of Health Hatem Mostafa El-Gabaly said Wednesday, "Polio has been endemic in our country for all of recorded history. The best tools of our age finally defeated this enemy, who has been with us from pharaonic times."

The disease, poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio was reported in 16 countries in the past year. In 2005, 1926 cases of polio were reported up from the 1255 cases reported in 2004. 

<h3>Nigeria's boycott</h3>

In August 2003, prominent &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;n clerics called for a boycott of immunizations. The clerics called the vaccine a plot led by the United States to sterilize Nigerians or infect them with &lt;a href="w%3AAIDS"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt;.

Immunizations started up after local officials ended the boycott in July, 2004. Nigeria reported having 782 cases of the disease in 2004, up 427 from the previous year.

The United States Secretary of Defense &lt;a href="w%3ADonald%20Rumsfeld"&gt;Donald Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt; said that U.S. public diplomacy efforts need to do more in the media to communicate a message friendly to democracy. 

"We'll need to do all we can to attract supporters to our efforts and to correct the lies that are being told, which so damage our country, and which are repeated and repeated and repeated," Rumsfeld said in an address to the &lt;a href="w%3A%20Council%20on%20Foreign%20Relations"&gt;Council on Foreign Relations&lt;/a&gt; in New York city on Friday. He said that insurgent groups have learned to use media and its new satellite and Internet technologies, and are working &lt;a href="w%3A24/7"&gt;24/7&lt;/a&gt;, to manipulate public opinion.

Rumsfeld called for the need to implement a "strategic communications framework" to present news information in Afghanistan and Iran. He warned, " ...the [news] vacuum will be filled by the enemy and by news informers that most assuredly will not paint an accurate picture of what is actually taking place." He said there was a need for communications training of military public affairs officials. The Department of Defense would begin with an emphasis on using out-sourced media expertise found in the private-sector, as was done with the controversial use of &lt;a href="w%3ALincoln%20Group"&gt;Lincoln Group&lt;/a&gt; who placed pro-democracy stories in Iraqi media in a business arrangement with the U.S. military. 

Rumsfeld was critical of the U.S. media for its sharp response to that program at his address in New York, which he said had the effect of stopping that military effort. In an appearance on the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3A%20Charlie%20Rose%20%28show%29"&gt;The Charlie Rose Show&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, a televised program taped earlier and then aired by PBS last Friday, the same day as his New York address, Rumsfeld said "When we heard about it, we said, 'Gee, that's not what we ought to be doing.' ... They stopped doing that." But in a ♡❤Los Angeles Times♡❤ report, a Lincoln Group insider and a U.S. commander in Iraq, &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20Casey"&gt;General George W. Casey&lt;/a&gt;, said the program was still in existence.

The White House has signaled a shift towards the use of media in the "War against Terror". The U.S. Secretary of State &lt;a href="w%3ACondoleezza%20Rice"&gt;Condoleezza Rice&lt;/a&gt; said in Senate testimony on Wednesday last week that $10 million is already appropriated to support political dissidents, labor union leaders and human rights activists in &lt;a href="w%3AIran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. The Bush administration will be asking for an additional $75 million in funding for the 2006 fiscal year to expand the program.

India won the final match of the recent cricket series. Yuvraj Singh made a unbeaten 107 (93b, 15x4)helping India's , chasing 287, achieved with 19 deliveries remaining on a good batting pitch. India have clinched the Hutch Cup ODI series 4-1. Mahendra Singh Dhoni (77 not out, 56b, 6x4, 4x6) was another important contributor to the Indian Innings.

The Pakistani bowling, apart from a probing spell from paceman Rao Iftekar Anjum, was made to look ordinary. The Pakistani fielding let the side down again. Mohammed Sami lost the ball twice. When on 64, Yuvraj was put down at covers by Shoaib Malik.

India preferred to rest Sachin Tendulkar and Irfan Pathan. Tendulkar carried the drinks, indicating that in this Indian side experience and youth blended into one.

In Tendulkar's absence, Rahul Dravid opened the innings with Gautam Gambhir.

The left-handed Gambhir sparkled with a few pick-up shots on the leg-side; this also showed Pakistan's pacemen were not bowling the right line.

Mohammed Asif has not been a big factor in the ODIs since the away going delivery is a lesser weapon in this variety of the game, especially if a side is bowling in the afternoon. It was his two-way movement that made him so dangerous in Tests.

Gambhir once again wasted a start, but the opening pair had, importantly, raised 69. Dravid's 50 (6x4) might have consumed 82 deliveries, but he made sure that, in the absence of Virender Sehwag and Tendulkar, the Indians had enough wickets in hand before they began the final onslaught. The chase was splendidly orchestrated.

It was Sreesanth who dented Pakistan in the morning after Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar shared the new ball. The Kerala paceman, who is learning fast, cut down on his pace realising that there was not too much assistance for him from the wicket. He struck thrice and Pakistan, from 62 without loss, slumped to 77 for three. In the context of the match, Sreesanth's spell of 5-1-25-3 was crucial. Both Imran Farhat and Kamran Akmal, after putting together 62, fell to pull shots, and Shoaib Malik steered right into Suresh Raina's hands at gully. There is fluency about Sreesanth's run-up and action that is hard to ignore, and he did bowl well at the death, swinging the ball into the right-hander.

And off-spinner Ramesh Powar won a leg-before decision against an ominous looking Inzamam on the sweep; the delivery drifted into the right-hander from outside the off-stump and then straightened.

Pakistan recovered through a strokeful fifth-wicket stand of 95 in 110 balls between Mohammad Yousuf (67, 85b, 6x4) and vice-captain Younis Khan (74 not out, 79b, 3x4, 2x6). Yousuf appeared set for his hundred when he flicked Ajit Agarkar into Zaheer Khan at mid-wicket.

Abdul Razzaq biffed a 15-ball 24 before miscuing a pull of R.P. Singh, but Pakistan lost some momentum towards the end. However, the 18 runs off the last six balls by Zaheer came in handy for the side; Younis twice smote the left-armer over the mid-wicket ropes.

The bowlers, backed by aggressive fielding, had performed a fair job, under the conditions.

Major General Chamlong Srimuang, the leader of the 1992 pro-democracy movement that ended &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; last military junta, has joined the calls for Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; to resign.

Chamlong is expected to join the next anti-Thaksin rally, announced by &lt;a href="w%3ASondhi%20Limthongkul"&gt;Sondhi Limthongkul&lt;/a&gt;, in Sanam Luang (Royal Plaza) in &lt;a href="w%3ABangkok"&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; on February 26. Chamlong initially introduced the current PM to the political stage, making his stand against Thaksin all the more embarrassing for the Prime Minister.

The forthcoming rally is expected to have over 100,000 in attendance. The People's Alliance for Democracy is leading the affair with various academic and pressure groups all calling for the displacement of the Prime Minister.

The main thrust of calls for the PM to resign or be impeached are over regulation changes in the telecoms sector that are widely held to have benefitted Thaksin and his family. Changes permitting 49% foreign ownership in the telecoms sector had been implemented for only a few days prior to the Prime Minister's family netting over 70 billion baht from selling their stake in the &lt;a href="w%3AShin%20Corporation"&gt;Shin Corporation&lt;/a&gt;.

The home town of a Washington Post article source about hackers attacking and controlling networks of personal computers to install spyware and send spam advertising was revealed by a &lt;a href="w%3ASlashdot"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; reader. The reader found meta-data information inside the Washington Post image of the hacker and was able to extract the town entered as the location of the photo. The article in the February 19th Washington Post details 0x80's earnings of around $6,800 a month sending out spam from controlled personal computers

The hacker, calling himself "&lt;a href="w%3A0x80"&gt;0x80&lt;/a&gt;" agreed to be interviewed for the Post article under the condition that he not be identified by name or home town.

After a link to the article on Slashdot, a reader uses the &lt;a href="w%3AIPTC"&gt;IPTC&lt;/a&gt; information encoded into the image to learn the location entered as part of the picture's metadata: Roland, OK. Posters on Slashdot said that the Washington Post removed the image in an effort to contain the damage.

The Washington Post has not commented on if this will instigate a change in their use of meta information for undisclosed sources.

Bettis, a &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Notre%20Dame"&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; graduate, began his career in 1993 with the Los Angeles Rams, but was picked up by the Steelers in 1996 and became the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Football%20League"&gt;NFL&lt;/a&gt;'s 5th leading rusher in Pittsburgh.

&lt;a href="w%3AChief%20executive%20officer"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3ARadioShack"&gt;RadioShack Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Edmondson"&gt;David Edmondson&lt;/a&gt; resigned Friday after admitting to lying in the contents of his resume. Claiming to have two college degrees, a &lt;a href="w%3ATheology"&gt;theology&lt;/a&gt; diploma called a ThG, and four years of education, Mr. Edmondson only attended two semesters at a college known now as &lt;a href="w%3AHeartland%20Baptist%20Bible%20College"&gt;Heartland Baptist Bible College&lt;/a&gt; (formerly known as Pacific Coast Baptist College). There are no records of any diplomas issued to Mr. Edmondson. These discrepancies caused Edmondson and the board to mutually agree to his resignation as president and CEO of RadioShack. Initially, RadioShack launched an internal investigation of Mr. Edmondson's statements; however, this investigation has since been halted.

The company had recently suffered a drop of 62% of &lt;a href="w%3ANet%20income"&gt;net income&lt;/a&gt; in its fourth-quarter, prompting restructuring plans and a closing of up to 10% of stores.

David Edmondson will receive a severance package valued at less than one million dollars in cash from RadioShack.

Teams are preparing for the &lt;a href="w%3AAlgarve%20Cup"&gt;2006 Algarve Cup&lt;/a&gt; international soccer tournament, March 9, 11, 13 and 15. The annual &lt;a href="w%3ACategory%3AWomen%27s%20football%20%28soccer%29"&gt;women's invitational&lt;/a&gt;, held in the &lt;a href="w%3AAlgarve"&gt;Algarve&lt;/a&gt; region of Portugal, features some of the &lt;a href="w%3AWomen%27s%20football%20around%20the%20world"&gt;world's top teams&lt;/a&gt; and may foreshadow face-offs in the &lt;a href="w%3AWomen%27s%20World%20Cup"&gt;2007 Women's World Cup&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20WNT"&gt;United States women's national soccer team&lt;/a&gt;, champions in four of the last six Algarve Cups and second &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fifa.com/en/womens/statistics/index.html"&gt;ranked&lt;/a&gt; in the world, will join the number one ranked &lt;a href="w%3AGermany%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; at this year's competition. The three "groups" of four teams who will play each other at the beginning of the tournament have yet to be finalized. However, it's been reported that the U.S. will be in a group with France, Denmark and China. The U.S. recently beaten China and tied France to win the 2006 Four Nations Tournament. 

Teams with the luxury of being full-time players (some &lt;a href="w%3AWomen%27s%20professional%20sports"&gt;women professional athletes&lt;/a&gt; must keep regular jobs) will take a break from training before they begin arriving in Algarve next week.

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n government has confirmed it will send an extra 200 troops to &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; as part of a security and reconstruction team. Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; says troops will leave from late July and will spend about two years in Afghanistan separate from the &lt;a href="w%3ASpecial%20Forces"&gt;Special Forces&lt;/a&gt; and commandos already serving there. In a press conference in Canberra today, Mr Howard said the deployment was "further evidence of the government's ongoing commitment to assist the people of Afghanistan in consolidating their embrace of democracy and resisting any attempt on the part of the Taliban to come back."

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; oppose the deployment of new troops. In a press release, Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; voiced his opinion on the matter, and said the following about Australia's deployment: "The announcement that Australia will be sending 200 more troops to Afghanistan comes hard on the heels of the Bush administration announcing the withdrawal of 3000 troops from the same theatre," he said. "Without the US withdrawal there would be no Australian deployment. This is John Howard once again using the ADF to meet the Bush administration's political shortcomings. Our troops should be kept at home."

"The ADF contribution will be a mixed security and reconstruction taskforce of approximately 200 personnel and will be deployed over a period of two years," Howard told reporters. The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Defence%20Force"&gt;Australian Defence Force (ADF)&lt;/a&gt; troops will be deployed from late July and work alongside &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; soldiers as part of a &lt;a href="w%3ANATO"&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt; force. The extra 200 troops will bring the number of ADF personnel to more than 500.

Australia sent 1,550 troops to Afghanistan in 2001, including special forces, to join the U.S.-led strikes against the &lt;a href="w%3ATaliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt; regime. Australia's only fatality in Afghanistan came in February 2002 when a soldier was killed after his vehicle hit a land mine. Violence has intensified in Afghanistan in recent months, particularly in the south and east, with a wave of raids, roadside and suicide bombings killing dozens of people.

Tangent Computer, a computer services and hardware company based in Burlingame, &lt;a href="w%3ACalifornia"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; has filed a lawsuit against &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit filed on February 14, 2006 claims that Microsoft continues to breach federal &lt;a href="w%3AAntitrust"&gt;antitrust&lt;/a&gt; laws.

Tangent alleges that Microsoft fosters tactics "to prevent and destroy competition" while raising prices of its software to "supra-competitive levels." Tangent is arguing that the tactics are a violation of section 2 &lt;a href="w%3ASherman%20Antitrust%20Act"&gt;Sherman Antitrust Act&lt;/a&gt;, a federal law prohibiting unfair business practices and monopolies.

The lawsuit details legal issues which have faced Microsoft since the 1980s, and requests that an amount of monetary damages to be determined by a jury at a trial.

Tangent is an original equipment manufacturer who has purchased and installed Microsoft operating systems since 1995. In addition to their hardware business, they also provide Internet content monitoring, spam filtering, anti-spyware and adware solutions, network vulnerability assessments, active directory tools and migration services.

&lt;a href="Microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has recently made changes to the &lt;a href="w%3AMicrosoft%20Windows"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; license agreement, saying that, “An upgrade of the motherboard is considered to result in a new personal computer to which Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred from another computer."

This will force users who upgrade their motherboard, even via the OEM, to purchase a new license agreement. The only exception is a defect for which the OEM replaces the motherboard.

Microsoft claims it needs to have "one base component left standing that would still define that original PC. Since the motherboard contains the CPU and is the heart and soul of the PC, when the motherboard is replaced (for reasons other than defect) a new PC is essentially created.”

Microsoft has asked its OEM partners to begin enforcing the new policy when they upgrade a client's computer.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACockeysville%2C%20MD"&gt;Cockeysville, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — On February 14th, students at Pot Spring Elementary School in &lt;a href="w%3ATimonium"&gt;Timonium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; noticed police activity in and around their school. School officials did not immediately offer an explanation for the presence of police cars and officers at the school.

The following day, Principal Karen Harris sent a brief letter to parents. The letter acknowledges that an incident involving the school required assistance from the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%20County"&gt;Baltimore County&lt;/a&gt; police. The letter assured parents that the situation was not dangerous, but did not describe the incident. 

The Harris letter asked those with questions to contact the school by phone. Jane Martin, the assistant principal, declined to describe the event that had called for police assistance. She indicated school administrators became concerned that rumors of a bomb, gun, or other violence were spreading mainly among 4th and 5th grade students. This concern prompted the principal’s letter. Martin said that the school was not evacuated on February 14th.

At the time of this article the Baltimore County Police Department has not responded to inquiries.

&lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Bernardo"&gt;Paul Bernardo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;'s most notorious serial murderer, has admitted more crimes. Bernardo has admitted to raping at least ten additional women during his time as the "Scarborough Rapist."

In the early 1990s, Bernardo murdered three young women in &lt;a href="w%3ASouthern%20Ontario"&gt;Southern Ontario&lt;/a&gt; with his wife &lt;a href="w%3AKarla%20Homolka"&gt;Karla Homolka&lt;/a&gt;. After his trial, he admitted to being the "Scarborough Rapist." Bernardo had previously claimed to have raped 15 women between 1986 and 1991. Today, his lawyer announced that he has confessed to 10 additional rapes.

Paul Bernardo is serving a life sentence as a &lt;a href="w%3Adangerous%20offender"&gt;dangerous offender&lt;/a&gt;. In Canada, dangerous offender status allows the courts to impose an indefinite sentence. Bernardo will almost certainly never be released.

Bernardo's wife, Karla Homolka, was released last year in what has been widely called a "Deal with the Devil". Homolka provided testimony that helped convict Bernardo, but which minimized her own participation in the murders. Investigators later discovered that Homolka had played an active role.

A Federal grand jury in &lt;a href="w%3ACleveland"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/a&gt; handed down indictments Tuesday against three &lt;a href="Ohio"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; men on terrorism related charges, including their alleged involvement in planning attacks overseas to kill &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMultinational%20force%20in%20Iraq"&gt;coalition&lt;/a&gt; military personnel in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; and other countries.

The three men, Mohammad Zaki Amawi, Marwan Othman El-Hindi, and Wassim Mazlous, all pleaded not guilty. The men were arrested over the weekend in &lt;a href="w%3AToledo%2C%20Ohio"&gt;Toledo&lt;/a&gt;, the town where they lived over the past year. They are expected to appear in a Federal District Court on Tuesday afternoon.

The indictment does not specify that any attacks were imminent. In a press conference in Washington, Attorney General &lt;a href="Alberto%20R.%20Gonzales"&gt;Alberto R. Gonzales&lt;/a&gt; said the indictments were intended to stop potential attacks before they could be launched. "We cannot wait until an attack happens," he said. "We will continue to use our criminal laws as Congress intended." He declined to say how far the alleged conspiracy had progressed or how close the group was to attacking American interests abroad or at home. 

The three men are accused of having learned how to make bombs and suicide vests, of carrying out Jihad training exercises that included firearms training and target range practice, and conspiring to provide material support, money, training, and communications equipment to themselves and co-conspirators in the &lt;a href="Middle%20East"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;. They are also accused of using a business front to funnel money to co-conspirators in the region. 

The indictment said the men recruited others to wage holy war against the United States and its allies. Mr. Gonzales would not say how large a group they had assembled. 

One of the men, Mohammad Zaki Amawi, a citizen of both the United States and &lt;a href="Jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, is alleged to have twice threatened to kill or harm the &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt;. He is also charged with distributing information about how to make and use an explosive device, relating to a plot that prosecutors claim to have begun in November 2004.

John Pistole, the deputy director of the &lt;a href="F.B.I."&gt;F.B.I.&lt;/a&gt;, described the men as "hiding in plain sight", and said Toledo had been added to a growing list of small towns where groups with roots in the Middle East are alleged to plot actions against the United States. 

Mr. Gonzales declined to comment on the controversial use of phone wiretaps before obtaining a court warrant, and how that might have played a role in the case. 

Mr. Gonzales noted that the three men could face as much as life in prison, if convicted of the charges.

At a private luncheon in his home state of &lt;a href="Utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, Republican &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3AOrrin%20Hatch"&gt;Orrin Hatch&lt;/a&gt; delivered some strong words for critics of &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush's&lt;/a&gt; domestic surveillance program and war on terrorism.

Speaking to a few dozen political and business leaders, Hatch defended the President's surveillance actions: "I have to tell you, this president has guts and he deserves your support." He reserved specific criticism for his fellow Congress leaders, saying that while they are "moaning and groaning in Congress because [the President] didn't abide by what's called the FISA Act, the &lt;a href="w%3AForeign%20Intelligence%20Surveillance%20Act"&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt;," the act was no longer applicable to current conflicts.

On &lt;a href="Iraq%20War"&gt;the war&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Hatch was even more disdainful of the critics. He said that the United States stopped a mass murderer in &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; and that nobody denies that Saddam Hussein was supporting &lt;a href="al-Qaeda"&gt;al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;, adding "Well, I shouldn't say nobody. Nobody with brains."

Notably, the bi-partisan &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Commission%20on%20Terrorist%20Attacks%20Upon%20the%20United%20States"&gt;9/11 Commision&lt;/a&gt; charged with investigating issues related to the &lt;a href="9/11"&gt;September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks&lt;/a&gt; did not find an operational link between al-Qaeda's 9-11 attack and ousted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

Senator Hatch is expected to run for reelection for his 6th term in November 2006. His challengers include State House Majority Whip &lt;a href="w%3ASteve%20Urquhart"&gt;Steve Urquhart&lt;/a&gt; (R) and &lt;a href="w%3APete%20Ashdown"&gt;Pete Ashdown&lt;/a&gt; (D).

A raid on a village in &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thailand's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat Province&lt;/a&gt; has netted a variety of munitions believed to be being held for insurgency activity. According to security forces, this includes weapons stolen from the Cho Airong army base in January 2004 &amp;mdash; a raid widely seen as the start of current insurgency in the country.

The cache of weapons was located in Tanyong Limoh village buried behind a house. According to the security forces, the area is known for harbouring Islamic insurgents. The munitions recovered in the raid include AK47 assault rifles, dynamite, handguns, and fertilizer which can be used in the manufacture of home-made explosives.

In one of the other troubled southern provinces, &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt;, a border police officer was shot near his home. Other local policemen quickly arrived on the scene and opened fire on the militants who had killed Sergeant Major Prapon Suwankota; one insurgent was killed.

Barbara Kathleen Higgs, 43, a manager of the Bulan Baru (New Moon) resort on the &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;n island of &lt;a href="w%3ALombok"&gt;Lombok&lt;/a&gt; has been charged with possession of &lt;a href="w%3ACannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; and could face a maximum 10 years in prison if convicted.

Indonesian police allege that they found 50 grams of cannabis and two bags of cannabis seeds at Higgs' house in &lt;a href="w%3ASenggigi"&gt;Senggigi&lt;/a&gt;, where she has lived for five years with her husband.

Under Indonesian law there is no provision for bail. Ms Higgs will remain in custody until her trial is complete.

According to Police Brigadier Kadek Sudeartana, Ms Higgs has been the "target of operations for one month". Sudeartana also said that Ms Higgs was suspected of being in possession of drugs after tip-offs from a number of members in the community.

The husband of Ms Higgs, who refused to give his name claims the arrest is a misunderstanding. "It's been a mistake", he said. "You'll find that by tomorrow all the charges have been dropped". 

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n consular officials from &lt;a href="w%3ABali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt; have visited Ms Higgs and offered their assistance.

Ms Higgs is the most recent Australian to be caught up in drug offences in Indonesia, with the &lt;a href="w%3ABali%20Nine"&gt;Bali Nine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASchapelle%20Corby"&gt;Schapelle Corby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMichelle%20Leslie"&gt;Michelle Leslie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AGraham%20Payne"&gt;Graham Payne&lt;/a&gt; facing the Indonesian legal system in recent times.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Prime%20Minister"&gt;Australian Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; and Minister for Foreign Affairs &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt; have once again warned Australians to avoid drugs when travelling overseas.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=An%20interview%20with%20Jimbo%20Wales&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Just five years ago, when &lt;a href="w%3AJimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimbo Wales&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, the project's goal of 100,000 articles &lt;a href="http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20010331173908/http%3A//www.wikipedia.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seemed ambitious. Yet today, the project, now one of the top 25 websites in the world according to &lt;a href="w%3AAlexa%20Internet"&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt;, is nearing closer 1,000,000 articles in English, and 3.5 million articles across all languages. This week, we interviewed Jimbo Wales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡Wikinews:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ARaul654"&gt;Raul654&lt;/a&gt; asks: "Recently, there were revelations about organized attempts by US Congressmen to whitewash their articles. What is your take on this, as well as earlier reports of Corporate astroturfing?"♡❤

♡❤♡Jimbo Wales:♡❤♡ The question is invalid. There were no revelations of organized attempts by US Congressmen to whitewash their articles. Not any evidence of "corporate astroturfing" of which I am aware. There was evidence that some congressional staffers edited Wikipedia in inappropriate ways. But the internal evidence of the type and style of these edits do not suggest "organized attempts".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ANichalp"&gt;Nichalp&lt;/a&gt; asks: "&lt;a href="w%3ABudget"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt; permitting, are there any plans to increase the number of Wikipedia &lt;a href="w%3AServer%20%28computing%29"&gt;servers&lt;/a&gt;, specifically into the less developed countries?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ We are always buying new servers. There are no specific plans to add servers in less developed countries, but we have looked into it as a possibility. We are particularly interested in doing so if it helps increase access and reduce costs for those users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤An anonymous reader asks: "How much of a role do you feel the Wikipedia community (and the communities of its sister projects) should have in the running of the Wikimedia Foundation? Do you see an increasing separation of the organization from the projects? If so, do you regard that as beneficial or a potential problem?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ The community has always been and will always be absolutely crucial to the running of the Wikimedia Foundation. We are increasing the community input and activity in the foundation through a new series of committees to delegate things to community members which have traditionally been handled by me or the Board. I do not see any increasing separation of the organization from the projects, quite the opposite. I consider the increasing integration of the community and the foundation as overwhelmingly beneficial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AALoan"&gt;ALoan&lt;/a&gt; asks: "English Wikipedia is approaching 1 million articles, but less than 1 in a thousand are Featured articles. The list of featured articles English Wikipedia should have has few featured articles, and recent surveys of articles chosen at random show that many articles are poorly written. How can we get from here to an encyclopedia of well-written articles? Or should we not worry too much about coverage and content?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ We should be tightly focused on the quality of our coverage and content. The goal of Wikipedia is to create and distribute a freely licensed high quality encyclopedia. The path to that goal will require us to be flexible and thoughtful. The first steps will come soon with the article review system, which will initially be used simply to gather data. After we have data, we can begin to work on how we will focus our attention to improve quality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AGeorgeStepanek"&gt;GeorgeStepanek&lt;/a&gt; asks: "You've said that 'Wikimedia's mission is to give the world's knowledge to every single person on the planet in their own language.' But very few of the wikipedias in the languages of third-world countries are seeing as much activity as the first-world language wikipedias. Do you have any ideas on how this could be turned around?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ I am a believer in outreach. I would like for the Foundation to raise money specifically to pay one or more minority language co-ordinators. The goal would be to reach out in a more organized way to professors and graduate students and expat communities who have good Internet access, to seed projects for languages where the majority of speakers have poor internet access.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AJacoplane"&gt;Jacoplane&lt;/a&gt; asks: "How do you feel we will be able to reach Wikipedia 1.0? The tools currently available for vetting our articles are crude at best. The Featured article process seems too slow, and the article validation feature seems to have died a quiet death. Are you planning a big push on this front?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ Isn't that the same question as the quality question? The article validation feature has not died a quiet death at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AQuadell"&gt;Quadell&lt;/a&gt; asks: "Most important decisions on Wikimedia projects are handled with consensus. However, we sometimes have to deal with legal issues, especially related to copyright law. For instance, we as a community may need to decide whether to consider a certain use "fair", or how to deal with conflicting copyright claims. Dealing with this through consensus is problematic, since we can't do something illegal even if there is widespread misguided support for it. In general, how can we as a community deal with these issues?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ I don't think there is any real problem with this. The community is strongly in support of following the law. I don't know of any particular cases of widespread misguided support for something illegal. In particular cases, there can of course be [dis]agreement, but I have never seen anyone in the community argue that we should not listen to the advice of our legal team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ARaul654"&gt;Raul654&lt;/a&gt; asks: "Where do you see Wikipedia in 10 years?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ I don't know. My favorite answer to this is to say, the real question is: where will the world be after 10 more years of Wikipedia. :) Seriously, I think we'll eventually see a tapering off of new article creation in the large language wikipedias as more and more "verifiable" topics are covered. At this point, most changes will be expansions and updates and quality improvements to existing articles. But in 10 years, it seems likely to me that many languages which are now quite small will have very large Wikipedia projects. Our community will continue to become more diverse as more and more people worldwide come online.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AKevin%20Myers"&gt;Kevin Myers&lt;/a&gt; asks: "The values reflected in certain Wikipedia policies (anti-censorship, neutral point-of-view) are problematic in cultures where freedom of expression is limited, as the &lt;a href="w%3ABlocking%20of%20Wikipedia%20in%20mainland%20China"&gt;blocking of Wikipedia in mainland China&lt;/a&gt; and arguably the &lt;a href="w%3AJyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy"&gt;Muhammad cartoons controversy&lt;/a&gt; attest. As Wikipedia expands internationally, do you foresee Wikipedia becoming increasingly controversial in countries where "Western values" are seen as a potential threat?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ I don't think that neutrality and objectivity are really controversial among most people of the world. It is true that the leadership in some places does not value these things, and may actually work against these things, but we can not deviate from our goals to accommodate them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤On a similar topic, &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AVsion"&gt;Vsion&lt;/a&gt; asks: "Are there currently any efforts being undertaken by the Foundation to address the People's Republic of China's blocking of Wikipedia or to alleviate its effect?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ Beijing-area Wikipedians are working to have the block lifted. Our position is that the block is in error, even given China's normal policies. Wikipedia is not propaganda, it is basic information. We expect that the block will be lifted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ADavid.Monniaux"&gt;David.Monniaux&lt;/a&gt; asks: "The Foundation receives daily accusations of libel from semi-well-known people who have an entry on Wikipedia or are mentioned in some Wikipedia entry. What do you propose? Would a strict application of the rule of citing controversial claims suffice, in your opinion?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ Yes. I think that our current systems do a good job of addressing these sorts of complaints, although it is very time-consuming for us here in the office. What really works wonders is a very strict application of the rule of citing controversial claims particularly relating to biographies of living persons. The new policy on biographies of living persons is a very strong step in the right direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ATony%20Sidaway"&gt;Tony Sidaway&lt;/a&gt; asks: "In the past six weeks the number of &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AUserboxes"&gt;userboxes&lt;/a&gt; on English Wikipedia has risen from 3500 to 6000 and, despite your &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3ADeletion%20review/Userbox%20debates"&gt;appeals for restraint&lt;/a&gt;, the number pertaining to &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AUserboxes/Beliefs"&gt;political beliefs&lt;/a&gt; has risen from 45 to 150. Can the problem of unsuitable userboxes still be resolved by debate?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ My only comment on the userbox situation is that the current situation is not acceptable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ALarsinio"&gt;Larsinio&lt;/a&gt; asks: "How can Wikipedia effectively explain to the public its open-contribution model without simultaneously worrying the public about inaccurate information?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ I think we do a reasonably good job of that. The best thing is to point to our overall quality while at the same time pointing out that we are currently a work in progress. Over time, this answer will change as we move toward '1.0'. At that time, we can point to '1.0' for those who are made nervous by the live editing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ARobchurch"&gt;Rob Church&lt;/a&gt; asks: "Do you consider the encyclopedia to be 'finished'? Do you think it ever can be?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ Nothing is ever finished. Human knowledge is always growing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ARaul654"&gt;Raul654&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUser%3APavel%20Vozenilek"&gt;Pavel Vozenilek&lt;/a&gt; both asked, "What kind of cool new features/announcements can we expect to see in the next year or two?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ I think this question is too hard for me to answer. I almost never "announce" anything, and features are developed publicly by the community. I think other people have a better idea than I do what will happen in the next year or two. :) Ask Brion [Vibber].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3ACelestianpower"&gt;Celestianpower&lt;/a&gt; asks: "If you had not founded Wikipedia, and had just been referred to it by a friend, how active a contributor do you think you would be?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ [I] dream fondly of such a scenario. I might actually get to edit articles then. Instead of spend the morning (this morning) documenting transactions and taking phone calls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AOpenToppedBus"&gt;OpenToppedBus&lt;/a&gt; asks: " was less successful than had been anticipated. Do you see a shortage of money holding back Wikipedia/Wikimedia in the short-to-medium-term, and are there any plans to bring in income from sources other than individual donations?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ The last fundraising drive was more successful than had been anticipated, by a long shot. It was the most successful fund drive in our history. [Regarding a quoted goal of $500,000], Mav wrote something like that somewhere, in a scratchpad kind of way. That number was just a placeholder and had nothing to do with me or the official view of the foundation. He's apologized repeatedly for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

♡❤♡WN:♡❤♡ ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AUser%3AThryduulf"&gt;Thryduulf&lt;/a&gt; asks: "What is your single greatest wish for Wikipedia?"♡❤

♡❤♡JW:♡❤♡ I would have to just point back to our original goal: a freely licensed high quality encyclopedia for every single person on the planet. That's what I remain focused on daily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Almost 600 desperate family members and others remained camped outside the 
&lt;a href="w%3APasta%20de%20Conchos%20mine%20disaster"&gt;Pasta de Conchos coal mine&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Juan%20de%20Sabinas"&gt;San Juan de Sabinas&lt;/a&gt;, in the northern &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; state of &lt;a href="w%3ACoahuila"&gt;Coahuila&lt;/a&gt; where 65 Mexican miners were trapped by a gas explosion around 2:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) Sunday. Some are threatening to storm the mine while soldiers are trying to keep them calm and rescuers continue to pick through the rock and debris with hand tools, fearing that any power equipment might set off another explosion. 

The local newspaper's headline caused panic by quoting one of over a dozen surviving miners who were close enough to the exits to escape: "They are surely dead," (♡❤La Prensa de Monclova♡❤). However, Arturo Vilchis, Civil Protection Director, refused to speculate on the condition of the miners, while Javier de la Fuente, an engineering contractor with mine owner &lt;a href="w%3AGrupo%20M%C3%A9xico"&gt;Grupo México&lt;/a&gt; S.A. de C.V. also tried to hold out some hope.

The men were each supposed to be carrying oxygen tanks, each with a six hour supply, and there's some hope that they could reach other oxygen supply tanks, or that some air might be reaching them through the ventilation shafts into which rescuers have been pumping more oxygen since shortly after the explosion.

Juan Rebolledo, vice president of international affairs for Grupo México, assured onlookers that &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; mining experts were on the way, and officials at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.msha.gov/"&gt;U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed that they've sent a specialized equipment truck and several mining experts which should arrive at the mine site on Wednesday afternoon.

Meanwhile Consuelo Aguilar, a spokeswoman for the National Miners' Union, called for an investigation into Grupo México's responsibility for the disaster. Pedro Camarillo, a federal labor official, said nothing unusual was found during a routine evaluation in early February.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst&lt;/a&gt; Regional Council has begun preparing the Mount Panorama motor racing circuit for the inaugural Bathurst International Motorsport Festival (BIMF) to be held between April 13 and 16, 2006. The Mount Panorama motor racing circuit is considered to be the home of motorsport in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

Council's staff have been busy cleaning the facilities, erecting signage, checking pedestrian bridges and inspecting the track surface for the past few days.

The BIMF will be the first event to be held at the 6.2 kilometre circuit over Easter since 2000. In 2000, Event Management Specialists held the first motorcycle racing event since 1990, but due to EMS going bankrupt a short time after their 2000 event was ran and the inability of the then Bathurst City Council to find another promoter, the Easter event was canned. 

The BIMF is inspired by the Festival of Speed and &lt;a href="w%3AGoodwood%20Circuit"&gt;Goodwood&lt;/a&gt; Revival in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The Bathurst Regional Council and event promoter Global Entertainment Team promise that the event "will cater for all motoring enthusiasts, collectors and historians".

According to the BIMF website, the on-track program consists of:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Manufacturers showcasing their vehicles and track times
BULLET::::- Historic touring car races
BULLET::::- Aussie racing car races
BULLET::::- Australian GT sports car
BULLET::::- Parade laps by car clubs
BULLET::::- Parade laps and races by "Legends of Motorsport"
BULLET::::- Stunt car and bike events
BULLET::::- Rally cars
BULLET::::- Displays of cars from all eras of Mount Panorama's history
BULLET::::- The chance for patrons to purchase a ride around the circuit in a race car.

</ul>
Off the track, the organisers have promised manufacturer displays, merchandise stands, music, joyflights, Off-road demonstrations and joyrides, autograph sessions and interviews with influential people in the Australian motor industry.

<h1>Alternative to controversial hotel proposed to Buffalo, N.Y. business owners and residents</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Alternative%20to%20controversial%20hotel%20proposed%20to%20Buffalo%2C%20N.Y.%20business%20owners%20and%20residents&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
Residents and business owners in the Elmwood Avenue neighborhood and surrounding area in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; heard a competing proposal for development in their neighborhood at the February 22 meeting held at the Burchfield-Penney Art Gallery, at &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%20State%20College"&gt;Buffalo State College&lt;/a&gt;. The meeting, attended by at least 140, was originally to consider the Elmwood Village Hotel but also included a new revitalization proposal from Rocco Termini which would increase retail space, but involves less demolition and no hotel. 

Rocco Termini, a Buffalo, New York developer wants to develop the corner of Elmwood and Forest, the same spot where Savarino Construction Services Corporation want to build the Elmwood Village Hotel.

Termini proposed that a similar revitalization take place on the intersection like one that incorporated 3 buildings on Aurburn and Elmwood just last year. Termini's proposal will add more retail space than Savarino's proposal with the possibility of including up to seven retail outlets.

"I just think it's necessary to preserve the streetscape that we have. That's the whole point of living and shopping on Elmwood," said Termini. "You should be able to go into little shops, that have unique items, and that bring people to Elmwood. When you bring a big box on Elmwood Avenue, it takes something away from the urban-streetscape, just as suburban areas do not want a big box Wal-Mart. We don't want a big box on Elmwood avenue and I think that's just what this (the hotel) does, brings a big box to Elmwood," said Termini. 

When asked if there were any development companies currently interested in his proposal Termini said, "I will be willing to take a look at this myself," said Termini. "Or I would be more than happy to be partners with Sam, Sam Savarino," who is President and Chief Executive Officer of Savarino Construction Services Corp.

An unnamed source close to the project stated, "Rocco has serious concerns that the Mobius's asking price could make his project infeasible."

It is unknown if Savarino Construction or the city of Buffalo will consider Termini's proposal.

Termini purchased and developed several buildings and areas including the Ellicott Lofts on Ellicott Street in &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;, which opened in 2003, The Oak School Lofts which used to be a Buffalo Alternative School, and ‘IS’ Lofts on Oak Street in Buffalo.

Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino Construction, and Karl Frizlen an architect from The Frizlen Group and designer of the hotel commented on the development proposal. Hassett said, "We've been thinking about it and trying to put it together for the last few months, and it was made public a couple of weeks ago." 

"There are lots of different areas you can look at. This is an Elmwood Avenue hotel. Putting it somewhere else makes a completely different kind of hotel. We wanted a hotel that people could walk to from the business on Elmwood. We wanted a hotel that people could walk to from the Albright Knox Art Gallery. This is really a location for this kind of hotel. Other locations end up being for other kinds of hotels," said Hassett

"We are excited about the concept of a boutique hotel at this corner. We think it makes sense to the various businesses in the area or the galleries just down the street. We also believe that this is a way for the visitors of Buffalo to experience what the best of what Buffalo has to offer. We think it will be a great way for people from out of town, to get to know what we know about the city," said Hassett.

Although Hassett had said that the proposal has only been around "for a few months", Karl Frizlen said that he came up with the idea "three years ago when Hans Mobius," former owner of the properties at risk, "came to me and asked what we could do with these properties." Frizlen also said that he introduced Mobius to "four different developers, who after seeing the properties, did not want to tackle them, saying that they felt like it was too much for them to take on."

Hans Mobius did not attend last nights meeting.

Frizlen is also designing the former telephone company building at 504 Elmwood which would be a "mixed use building with retail on the lowest level and lofts on the other two floors."

<h3>Residents and business owners voice concerns</h3>

After speeches from developers, residents and business owners were invited to present questions and comments.

Mark Freelend, a Buffalo resident, and local artist, said "I'm looking at my house in the picture, and I'm picturing all the houses on Granger street behind me, and I'm realizing that, if this is implemented (the hotel), we will get zero sunlight. The Sun is supposed to be free, for everyone. The people on Granger are going to have eighty windows looking at them and their children being raised, and playing in the backyard, guests looking in the windows of their houses twenty-four hours a day. A million people starring into their houses. No sunlight, and they are on permanent reality TV. Put a price on that!"

"I think this hotel is totally out of scale to the area and it does not conform to the style (of Elmwood) at all. It will totally obscure the gateway of Elmwood. The gateway now has open arms that allow for passage and view into the commercial corridor. This hotel stands as a brick wall as far as I can tell," said Nancy Pollina one of the owners of Don Apparel at 1119 Elmwood. Pollina referenced to the recent 'revitalization' project on Auburn and Elmwood saying, "That building was boarded up for years, and that was beautiful a renovation. That building was not in any less need of repair than Hans Mobius's properties."

<h3>Development company may be 'moving too fast'</h3>

Both residents and business owners in the area are concerned that the proposal is moving too quickly and said that the developers should wait before having any city meetings and wait for a consensus from the community on the hotel.

Mrs. Pollina said, "I think people feel passionate about their neighborhood, and this is their neighborhood. I feel that what was most shocking is that the city's planning board meeting and Common Council meeting, which are they need to push this through, is next week without almost no notice. This (the proposal) is being rushed.

However; Sam Savarino did say that "some people have gotten emotional about this project. And I want to let the community know that we will listen to what you have to say. We're not forcing this down anybody's throat. If this is not something this community wants, we do not want to have it here."

The city's Planning Board is expected to meet on February 28, 2006 at 8:00am in room 901 on the 9th floor of City Hall. The city's Legislative Committee meeting of Common Council is expected to take place on the same day at 2:00pm in Council Chambers on the 13th floor of City Hall.

<h3>'Significant changes' to be made to hotel design</h3>

It has just been confirmed from an unnamed source close to the project that "significant changes" will be made to the design of the Elmwood Village Hotel. "Its not being cancelled, just redesigned," he said. The changes are not yet known, but they are could be released "tomorrow. He (Savarino) doesn't want it released until he touches base with a few people today."

<h1>Australian children suffering from iodine deficiency</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australian%20children%20suffering%20from%20iodine%20deficiency&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Almost half of all Australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient, researchers say. A new study documenting iodine nutritional status in Australian schoolchildren has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation. The report's authors say iodine deficiency is "the sleeper health issue in Australia", and potentially a very serious one.

The results of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study published in the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mja.com.au/"&gt;Medical Journal of Australia&lt;/a&gt; this week, revealed that children in mainland Australia are borderline &lt;a href="w%3AIodine%20Deficiency"&gt;iodine deficient&lt;/a&gt;. The report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised. They say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders.

A cross-sectional survey of 1709 schoolchildren - aged 8–10 years, from 88 schools - was carried out in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, between July 2003 and December 2004. Tasmania was excluded from the study - where an voluntary iodine fortification program using iodised salt in bread, is ongoing.

The authors say the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population. They call for "urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia." Most iodine in food comes from seafood, milk and &lt;a href="w%3AIodised%20salt"&gt;iodised salt&lt;/a&gt;.

Professor Cres Eastman, Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study, and Chairman of the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.icpmr.gov.au/accidd/nins/idd.htm"&gt;Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, says it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine. Iodine deficiency can lead to serious health problems including brain damage, stunted growth and deafness.

Professor Eastman says manufacturers could easily remedy the situation by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries. "I suspect they won't do that on a voluntary basis, we've tried so far and haven't succeeded, so we've convinced the &lt;a href="w%3AFood%20Standards%20Australia%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand|&lt;/a&gt; that all salt should be iodised," he said.

The report says the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry, where &lt;a href="http%3A//c3.org/chlorine_knowledge_center/white_paper_2002.html"&gt;chlorine-containing sanitisers&lt;/a&gt; have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers. Iodine released from these chemicals into milk has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades, but is now declining. Another contributory factor has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt used in foods. The report states that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods. 

Professor Eastman says iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation that all salt be iodised. He says authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt.

"The effects of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe it is and when it occurs. So if we go to the pregnant woman, she doesn't get enough iodine, she won't make enough thyroid hormone, and the foetus won't get the amount of thyroid hormone it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain, so you'll then see consequences being loss of IQ, learning difficulties, hearing difficulties and other neurological problems," Professor Eastman said. 

"If an infant's not getting enough iodine... brain development won't be completed and they won't grow normally, and as you get older the problem will be that you will develop a goiter and your thyroid won't function as well as it should, so that may have all sorts of pernicious effects upon normal function in life."

More than two billion people around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency, and yet the problem is easily fixed. &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20World%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;The World Health Organisation (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; recommends that every country should iodise all edible salt. The most well known effects of IDD are visible &lt;a href="w%3AGoiter"&gt;goiter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ACretinism"&gt;cretinism&lt;/a&gt;, a condition characterised by severe brain damage occurring in very early life. WHO say &lt;a href="w%3AIodine%20deficiency"&gt;Iodine deficiency&lt;/a&gt; is the world’s most prevalent, yet easily preventable, cause of brain damage.

Professor Eastman said he is alarmed by what they found. "Pregnant women in Australia are getting about half as much as what they require on a daily basis. So that alarms me, because there's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children born in this country," he said. "If Iodine deficiency is serious you lose 15 IQ points, on average. There shouldn't be anyone suffering from iodine deficiency in a developed country like Australia."

Lydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand, says they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year. She says the issue is complicated and will take time to get right. We need to "make sure there's sufficient iodine added into the food supply, to help those people with a deficiency. But at the other end of the scale we've got to make sure the people who eat a lot of food - we all know the teenage boy who comes home from school and eats a whole loaf of bread - that those people don't get too much and get overdose," Ms Bauchtman said. "One of the reasons that iodine is going down is because people are taking that good healthy eating message and not adding salt during cooking."

Senior researcher Mu Li, of the University of NSW's school of public health, said "it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient, putting the next generation of children born in this country at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency."

&lt;a href="Arsenal%20F.C."&gt;Arsenal&lt;/a&gt; beat &lt;a href="Real%20Madrid"&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/a&gt; 1-0 in a &lt;a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League"&gt;UEFA Champions League&lt;/a&gt; second round, first leg match on February 21, 2006. A 47th minute goal from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThierry%20Henry"&gt;Thierry Henry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; meant that Arsenal became the first side from England ever to win at the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASantiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium"&gt;Santiago Bernabéu Stadium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

Arsenal generally had the better of the game, Henry's goal coming after he made a surging run from midfield, evading challenges from both &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARonaldo"&gt;Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Gravesen"&gt;Thomas Gravesen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; before shooting low past &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIker%20Casillas"&gt;Iker Casillas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . Arsenal's Spanish forward &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJose%20Antonio%20Reyes"&gt;Jose Antonio Reyes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had had an early chance, which was saved by Casillas while &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoberto%20Carlos"&gt;Roberto Carlos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; blocked a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFredrik%20Ljungberg"&gt;Fredrik Ljungberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shot. At the other end, Real's &lt;a href="David%20Beckham"&gt;David Beckham&lt;/a&gt; had two chances, one a missed header and the other a clear one-on-one, but &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJens%20Lehmann"&gt;Jens Lehmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; saved. Late on in the game, Arsenal sub &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAbou%20Diaby"&gt;Abou Diaby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; could have scored a second, but Casillas saved at his feet, before Ronaldo just missed a Beckham cross in front of an open goal.

The second leg of the tie will be played at &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AArsenal%20Stadium"&gt;Highbury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on March 8, 2006.

A magnitude 7.5 earthquake occurred in southern &lt;a href="Mozambique"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; near the small farming town of Espungabera near Malvernia just after midnight.

The region is comparatively remote, and detailed reports of what has occurred at the epicenter are not yet available. According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Geological%20Survey"&gt;US Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS), damage is expected, but there are no detailed reports at this stage. As of February 23, February 23, 2006 07:13 UST there are no reported injuries. The area is approximately 100 km away from the &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;n border.

Residents in the surrounding region have been urged not to return to buildings due to possible aftershocks. The region is home to the East African rift system.

The earthquake was felt as far as 800 km away as Johannesburg and Durban, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href="Zambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;. No damage is expected in those countries.

Earlier USGS reports had estimated the magnitude at 6.9. In comparison, the recent &lt;a href="w%3A2005%20Kashmir%20earthquake"&gt;2005 Kashmir quake&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; had a magnitude of 7.6.

The quake occurred at February 22, 2006 22:19:08 Universal standard time (UST).

Police in Baltimore County, &lt;a href="Maryland"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; asked for the public's help to find 23-year-old Matthew P. Keenan. Police said an arrest warrant had been issued for Keenan on the charge of failing to update his information with Maryland's State Sex Offender Registry.

Police described Keenan as a white male, 5'6" (1.7 m) tall, 150 pounds (68 kg) with brown hair and brown eyes. They believed Keenan was last seen in the Armistead Gardens neighborhood of &lt;a href="w%3ABaltimore%2C%20Maryland"&gt;Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;, Maryland.

Mandatory registration for offenders convicted of certain sexual or violent crimes began in Maryland after 1994. Addresses of offenders have been made public.

According to the registry, Keenan is a child sex offender. Detectives added that Keenan was convicted of raping a child in 2002. This conviction led to the requirement that Keenan keep his current address on file with the registry. Keenan's last verified address listed with the registry was in the 3700-block of North Point Road in Dundalk, Maryland.

Police asked those with information on Keenan to call them at 410-307-2020 or Metro Crime Stoppers at 1-866-756-2587.

Colonel Gordon Messenger, commander of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; forces in Southern &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, has said that troops under his command will not be engaged in the fight against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Aopium"&gt;opium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cultivation. "There will be absolutely no maroon berets [of the marines] with scythes in a poppy field," he said.

The &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; has reported that a "fear that Afghanistan might degenerate into a narco-state is slowly becoming a reality." 

&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; State department officials and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACentral%20Inteligence%20Agency"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; claim that Afghan drug trafficking is a primary source of funding for terrorists. Doug Wankel, a former Drug Enforcement Administration official who is point man for the U.S. counternarcotics initiative at the American Embassy in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , said the opium industry is "financing terrorism. It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism. ... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States."

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; recently committed 200 extra troops to Afghanistan. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; has said that they also will not be involved in destroying opium poppies. "Well, dealing with that is overwhelmingly the responsibility of the local authorities," he said. 

A 2005 U.S. State department report warned that Afghanistan is becoming a "narcotics state". Afghan hectares in opium cultivation has increased by 50% since the coalition invasion; up from an average of 67,000 prior to the invasion (1998-2001), to an average of 97,000 since the invasion (2002-2005). The last year under the &lt;a href="Taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;, 2001, saw production of 185 metric tonnes; in 2005 production was 4,100 metric tonnes.

Afghanistan produced 87% of the world's opium in 2005 with 104,000 hectares in production. &lt;a href="Hamid%20Karzai"&gt;President Karzai&lt;/a&gt; has blamed the coalition for this situation, "This particular operation (controlling opium production) was supposed to be done by an agency, a department that was funded by the international community, by the United States, by Britain. The failure is theirs, not ours." Karzai said. "Where international money and creation of forces for destruction of poppies was concerned, it was ineffective and delayed and half-hearted." Karzai is opposed to aerial spraying which was proposed by the United States, as is done in other drug producing regions of the world, because of what Karzai called "health concerns".

Adrian Edwards of the United Nations stated 2 months ago that early reports indicate "there will be an increase in poppy cultivation in 2006".

The &lt;a href="w%3Aexecution"&gt;execution&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20Morales"&gt;Michael Morales&lt;/a&gt;, convicted in 1983 of the murder of Terri Winchell, has been postponed indefinitely because &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Quentin%20State%20Prison"&gt;San Quentin State Prison&lt;/a&gt; (California) could not comply with a federal court's order that his execution be supervised by licensed medical personnel.

Morales was originally scheduled to be executed at 12:01 a.m. on February 21, 2006, but the execution was postponed until 7:30 p.m. that evening after two &lt;a href="w%3Aanesthesiologist"&gt;anesthesiologists&lt;/a&gt; assigned to participate in the execution withdrew on ethical grounds. The anesthesiologists were originally asked to participate in compliance with an order by a federal judge.

In his February 14 ruling on a motion by Morales's lawyers, U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel required that either Morales should die of a lethal dose of &lt;a href="w%3Abarbiturates"&gt;barbiturates&lt;/a&gt; instead of the standard three drug combination used in &lt;a href="w%3Alethal%20injection"&gt;lethal injection&lt;/a&gt;, or that two anesthesiologists should be on hand to ensure that Morales would feel no pain from the two drugs that caused paralysis and heart failure. Fogel also ruled that the barbiturates should be administered by a licensed medical professional.

Prison officials could not find a medical professional willing to administer the single-drug lethal injection.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (MPAA) has launched seven separate lawsuits against Internet sites in its latest anti-piracy crackdown. The MPAA claims the targeted sites had been "facilitating the distribution of copyright works".

The MPAA has commenced legal action against the following &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; tracking sites&amp;mdash;isohunt.com, bthub.com, and torrentbox.com which are all owned by the same person; torrentspy.com; niteshadow.com as well as &lt;a href="w%3Aed2k"&gt;ed2k&lt;/a&gt; site ed2k-it.com and &lt;a href="w%3AUsenet"&gt;Usenet&lt;/a&gt; search engines&amp;mdash;nzb-zone.com, binnews.com, and dvdrs.net.

The lawsuits mark the first time that the MPAA has targeted Usenet related sites; in the past the MPAA has only brought action against sites who actually hosted copyrighted material or who assisted in the running of the networks used to distribute it.

Generally, the &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millennium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt; (DMCA) limits the liability of search engines for providing links to unauthorised copies, so long as the site operators do not know the content is infringing, are not making profit from the distribution of copyright works, and remove links when requested by copyright owners.

It is thought that the DMCA limitations will not apply to the sites targeted as they are allegedly filled with almost nothing but copyrighted movies, software, and music. 

Isohunt.com, one of the search engines targeted, provides a copyright statement claiming that "We respect copyright, and will filter such P2P links at your request".

&lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Askari%20Mosque%20bombing"&gt;Explosions&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Askari%20Mosque"&gt;Al Askari Mosque&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;i city of &lt;a href="w%3ASamarra"&gt;Samarra&lt;/a&gt; at 6:55 a.m. local time (0355 UTC) February 22 ripped through the mosque, destroying the northern wall which shattered the golden dome.

No injuries were reported from the blast, but sectarian violence has broken out in the region after the attack on the &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a"&gt;Shi'a&lt;/a&gt; holy site.

<h2>The attack</h2>

The Interior Ministry reported that four bombers entered the mosque, one in the uniform of Iraqi Security Forces. Two bombs were planted, which went off in the morning. The blasts damaged the northern wall and caused the dome to collapse.

Police originally feared there may be victims buried in the rubble.

The mosque is one of the most holy sites of Shi'a Islam as it holds the remains of &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20al-Hadi"&gt;Ali al-Hadi&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href="w%3AHassan%20al-Askar"&gt;Hassan al-Askar&lt;/a&gt;, the 10th and 11th &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a%20imams"&gt;Shi'a imams&lt;/a&gt;. The grandson of al-Hadi was the 12th imam, the "hidden imam" &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad%20al-Mahdi"&gt;Muhammad al-Mahdi&lt;/a&gt; whose shrine stood adjacent to the Mosque.

<h2>Violence after</h2>

Within hours of the blasts, Sunni mosques had been attacked or set afire. An association of Sunni clerics reported that ten imams had been killed, and that 15 were kidnapped by Shi'a protesters.

Overnight gunmen in police uniforms seized 11 Sunni men from a prison in Basra and killed them.

Thursday's violence escalated after the protests on Wednesday. In the single deadliest incident, 47 people were killed at a roadblock in &lt;a href="w%3ADiyala"&gt;Diyala&lt;/a&gt; province, northeast of Baghdad, as they were returning from a protest. In &lt;a href="w%3ABaquba"&gt;Baquba&lt;/a&gt;, at least 16 were killed in a suicide bomb attack in a crowded market.

Atwar Bahjat, correspondent for the &lt;a href="w%3Aal-Arabiya"&gt;al-Arabiya&lt;/a&gt; network, and two local journalists were kidnapped and killed leaving Samarra.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACanadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ reports as many as 168 mosques have been targeted, both Sunni and counter-counter attacks on Shi'a.

<h2>Response of the Shi'a religious leadership</h2>

Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani called on Shiites to take to the streets, but peacefully. "We invite the faithful to protest and express their condemnations, on the violation of their sanctities, by peaceful means," says the online message from his office. "We stress upon everyone going through the shock of this atrocious crime not to be drawn into what the enemies want them to be drawn into, which is sectarian discord"

"If its security institutions are unable to provide the necessary security, the faithful are able to do that by the will and blessings of God," the Grand Ayatollah said in a separate, written, statement, suggesting the armed Shi'a militias may be deployed to protect other holy sites if the government and the U.S. troops are deemed incapable of doing so.

<h2>Response from the Iraq government</h2>

Iraqi President Jalal Talabani appeals for calm to avoid a "devastating civil war". Reports in televised news conferences indicate that initial investigations point to "infiltration" of the Iraqi Security Forces.

Thursday declared a day of national mourning.

"The main aim of these terrorist groups is to drag Iraq into a civil war," Iraq's national security adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie told al-Arabiye television.

"Anti-democratic forces have tried everything to push the country into a civil war and sectarian violence," Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said today in a phone interview with Bloomberg. "This is the biggest challenge we as Iraqis face, and efforts are under way to prevent it."

<h2>World wide response</h2>

Ashraf Qazi, the &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nation's&lt;/a&gt; top envoy to the region, has said he will ask the country's political and religious leaders to hold a dialogue moderated by the U.N.

The president of &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ATraian%20B%C4%83sescu"&gt;Traian Băsescu&lt;/a&gt;, continues to be the most popular politician in the country, according to a survey by the Romanian Centre for Urban Resources (CURS). The survey shows that 63% of those interviewed have a good or very good opinion of the president. Even though this result is better than the 60% approval rating he received in October 2005, it is lower than the 71% approval he obtained in June 2005.

The second-most popular major politician is the opposition leader and head of the Social Democratic Party, &lt;a href="w%3AMircea%20Geoan%C4%83"&gt;Mircea Geoană&lt;/a&gt;, who has an approval rating of 47%. He is trailed by the Prime Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AC%C4%83lin%20Popescu-T%C4%83riceanu"&gt;Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu&lt;/a&gt;, with 44%. &lt;a href="w%3AGigi%20Becali"&gt;Gigi Becali&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the New Generation Party, recorded the largest increase in popularity, with an approval rating of 30%, in comparison to the 20% he achieved in October 2005.

The survey also looked at Romanians' opinions towards the major political parties. 42% of the respondents stated that they would vote for the governing &lt;a href="w%3AJustice%20and%20Truth"&gt;Justice and Truth Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, made up of the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. 25% stated that they would vote for the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Romania%29"&gt;Social Democratic Party&lt;/a&gt;, while the right-wing &lt;a href="w%3AGreater%20Romania%20Party"&gt;Greater Romania Party&lt;/a&gt; would receive 14% of the vote. Both of these parties recorded decreases in popularity. On the other hand, the New Generation Party and the National Initiative Party gained in popularity, with the New Generation Party attracting 4% of potential votes.

44% of the people interviewed believe that Romania will join the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; in January 2007, as scheduled, while 18% think that the safeguard clause will be activated, postponing accession until 2008.

&lt;a href="w%3APhilippines"&gt;Filipino&lt;/a&gt; president &lt;a href="w%3AGloria%20Macapagal%20Arroyo"&gt;Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&lt;/a&gt; declared a state of emergency Friday following reports from security forces on a foiled &lt;a href="w%3Acoup"&gt;coup&lt;/a&gt; attempt. Arroyo's emergency powers allow arrests without warrants and the extended detention of prisoners without charges.

Brigadier General Danilo Lim, the commander of the &lt;a href="w%3A1st%20Scout%20Ranger%20Regiment"&gt;1st Scout Ranger Regiment&lt;/a&gt;, an elite military unit, is being held following accusations that he intended to join his troops with anti-Arroyo protestors. The troops were reportedly planning to inform protesters that the soldiers were no longer supporting Arroyo hoping that this news would foment an uprising against the president.

Arroyo has forbidden protest rallies, but more than a thousand Filipinos attended rallies anyway (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.bloomberg.com/apps/news%3Fpid%3D10000080%26amp%3Bsid%3Da.XTNsc0ZRrc%26amp%3Brefer%3Dasia"&gt;Bloomberg.com&lt;/a&gt; says "thousands of Filipinos"), and police broke up a couple of rallies on Edsa, the main street of &lt;a href="w%3AManila"&gt;Manila&lt;/a&gt;, as they were heading downtown (to &lt;a href="w%3AMakati"&gt;Makati&lt;/a&gt;), with shields and nightsticks. The &lt;a href="w%3AFilipino%20peso"&gt;Filipino peso&lt;/a&gt; dropped 1.1% vs. the &lt;a href="w%3AUS%20dollar"&gt;US dollar&lt;/a&gt;, its biggest decline since 2002. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bloomberg.com/apps/news%3Fpid%3D10000080%26amp%3Bsid%3Da.XTNsc0ZRrc%26amp%3Brefer%3Dasia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The crisis comes during the weekend when the country is recognizing the 20th anniversary of the "People Power" revolution that ousted dictator &lt;a href="w%3AFerdinand%20Marcos"&gt;Ferdinand Marcos&lt;/a&gt;, who fled and stayed in exile in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;.

This is not the first time Ms. Arroyo's regime has survived attempts at deletion. At the beginning of her presidency, supporters of the ousted President Estrada stormed &lt;a href="w%3AMalacanang"&gt;Malacanang&lt;/a&gt; and demanded Arroyo's resignation. Later, in 2003, 300 soldiers took over a hotel in Manila in another bid to topple Arroyo. People have alleged that the Arroyo administration engaged in corruption and failed to keep the economy stable. Arroyo won the 2004 election, but some people accused her of doing so by cheating. Those allegations led to an attempt to impeach Arroyo in September 2005, which failed. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.voanews.com/english/2006-02-24-voa30.cfm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Six teenagers were killed in a horrific road accident near &lt;a href="w%3AMildura%2C%20Victoria"&gt;Mildura&lt;/a&gt; in north-western &lt;a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; late at night on February 18. 

Cassandra Manners, aged 16, Stevie-Lee Weight, 15, Cory Dowling, 16, Shane Hirst, 16, and his sister, Abby Hirst, 17, died at the scene. Josephine Calvi, 16, was flown to the &lt;a href="w%3ARoyal%20Adelaide%20Hospital"&gt;Royal Adelaide Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where she later died of head injuries. Seven other teenagers were injured, including 15-year-old Marco Medici who is now in a stable but critical condition in &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Alfred%20Hospital"&gt;The Alfred Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in .

The accident occurred after the teenagers left a 16th birthday party and walked along Myall Road, Cardross, south-east of Mildura. A car allegedly came speeding around a bend, hit the gravel on the side of the road, lost control and struck the group. The alleged driver, later identified as 34-year-old Thomas Graham Towle, fled the scene on foot, leaving his 10-year-old daughter and four-year-old son in the car. Towle was later arrested by police in Redcliffs. He was taken to Mildura police station for questioning.

Towle has been charged with six charges of culpable driving causing death, four charges of negligently causing serious injury, one charge of failing to stop and one charge of failing to render assistance after an accident. Towle faced Mildura Magistrates' Court on February 20. Magistrate John Dugdale remanded him into custody to reappear before the court on June 26.

Meanwhile, the town of Mildura and surrounding areas is in deep mourning. Premier Steve Bracks said the State Government will provide &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;$AU&lt;/a&gt;40,000 for counselling and support services.

Around 3,000 people attended the funeral for Josephine Calvi today. Funeral services for the other five teenagers were held last week.

In the face of mounting pressure and a hostile political climate in urban areas, &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; has announced the dissolution of the lower house, the &lt;a href="w%3AHouse%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Thailand"&gt;House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; of the country's parliament.

The move follows an audience earlier today with the King at the Dusit Palace and is despite defiant statements yesterday that the PM would neither step down nor dissolve parliament. An increasing number of voices have questioned Thaksin's suitability to hold the office of Prime Minister, with a petition to the Constitutional Court and a student-led petition for his impeachment contributing to the political uncertainty.

The Prime Minister announced the decision in a live TV broadcast, offering to "accept and respect the public's decision" in the forthcoming election. Following discussions with the Election Commission of Thailand, he stated that the election &amp;ndash; required to be held within 60 days &amp;ndash; would be on April 2. This should lead to the Lower House reconvening on May 2. Election of a Prime Minister and appointment of Cabinet ministers would be the first item of business.

Protestors who are planning a mass demonstration at Sanam Luang in Bangkok this Sunday are undeterred by the move. According to Suriyasai Katasila they will protest anyway, aiming for resignation "because Prime Minister Thaksin is the centre of the problem".

Majid Majhoul Hawi al-Moussawi said his family "locked the door and left for &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, the only country that would have us. We are grateful, but there is no work. There is nothing for us here." He took his family out of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; after his daughter Hanan, 16, was kidnapped.

Professionals in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; say they face a deteriorating situation. Young physicians are looking for other countries to train in and even the patients are leaving, no longer confident in the care they can get in Iraq.

Dr. Omar Kubasi supported the claims that a systematic campaign to destroy Iraqi academia is occurring, stating, "I think it's part of the plan for the country's destruction. The situation in the last six months has gotten so bad, we couldn't continue."
Amer Hassan Fayed, assistant dean of political science at &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad%20University"&gt;Baghdad University&lt;/a&gt; said; "It's creating a brain drain, we could end up with a society without knowledge. How can such a society make progress?"

Hundreds of Iraqi academics have been assassinated since the &lt;a href="w%3AIraq%20War"&gt;U.S.-led coalition invasion&lt;/a&gt; in March 2003, and there have been no charges brought against any suspects in the murders. 
&lt;a href="w%3ACaroline%20Lucas"&gt;Caroline Lucas&lt;/a&gt;, the Green Party &lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament"&gt;MEP&lt;/a&gt; for Southeast England, is calling for a &lt;a href="United%20Nations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; investigation into the killings which, she said, is forcing thousands of Iraqi educators to flee for their lives. 
"Iraq is undergoing a major brain drain, and can ill afford to lose academics and teachers to a continuing wave of violence. Iraq's education system, once one of the best in the region, has been decimated: some 84 percent of the country's higher education institutions have been burned, looted or destroyed, according to the United Nations University. These assassinations, which appear to be countrywide, non-partisan and non-sectarian, must be investigated by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on summary executions -- and those responsible brought to justice. Iraq needs security and stability, but it is clear that the continued U.S. and (British) occupation is contributing to the problem, not the solution," Lucas said.

The &lt;a href="w%3AAdjudication%20Panel%20for%20England"&gt;Adjudication Panel for England&lt;/a&gt; has ruled that &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Livingstone"&gt;Ken Livingstone&lt;/a&gt; should be suspended from office for one month over an insult given to an ♡❤Evening Standard♡❤ reporter in which he likened the reporter to a concentration camp guard after being hassled by the reporter outside his home.

The suspension of an elected representative by an unelected panel over an issue in which a law was not broken is unprecedented. The Mayor's deputy, Nicky Gavron, has condemned the decision, as has the chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Councils"&gt;Association of London Government&lt;/a&gt; Robin Wales.

Ken Livingstone will announce next week what his action will be. He may appeal to the High Court.

"An &lt;a href="w%3Aearthquake"&gt;earthquake&lt;/a&gt; struck &lt;a href="w%3AOttawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; at approximately 8:45 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 24, 2006." said one area resident. Natural Resources Canada, however, says the earthquake of 4.5 magnitude struck Western Quebec on February 25 at approximately 1:39 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) which is effectively GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). (Earthquakes are generally listed in UTC time to ensure an absolute and consistent basis of when they occurred.) This may have been felt several hundred kilometres away.

<h3>Located North of Thurso</h3>

According to the ♡❤Canadian Press♡❤ the earthquake was centred north of &lt;a href="w%3AThurso%2C%20Quebec"&gt;Thurso, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;, "approximately 45 kilometres east-northeast of Ottawa, said John Adams, a seismologist with Natural Resources Canada." Witness reports state somewhat violent shaking with little or no property or personal damage. "It started as a rumble, then shaking... the whole house was shaking and the glasses were rattling," said Jeff Thiessen, a resident of Manor Park. One Ottawa resident said "the ground shook for about 30 seconds and was felt by residents near the city center." There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage to property.

According to the &lt;a href="w%3AUSGS"&gt;U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; (USGS) "A magnitude 4.0 eastern earthquake typically can be felt at many places as far as 100 km (60 mi) from where it occurred, and it infrequently causes damage near its source."

Follow-up reports indicate that rumbles could be felt as far as &lt;a href="w%3AKingston%2C%20Ontario"&gt;Kingston, Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AMontreal"&gt;Montreal, Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;. The Canadian Geological Survey stated 14 &lt;a href="w%3ASeismometer"&gt;seismometer&lt;/a&gt; stations revising a magnitude of 4.5 from 2.99 on the &lt;a href="w%3ARichter_magnitude_scale"&gt;Richter Scale&lt;/a&gt;. The USGS pronounced it to be a 4.0 tremor.

<h3>Seismic region far from plate boundaries</h3>

The Edinburgh earth observatory also demonstrates that this earthquake, with a reported depth of approx. 18 km, occurred near the &lt;a href="w%3ANorth%20American%20Plate"&gt;North American Plate&lt;/a&gt;. However, according to USGS, "the Western Quebec seismic zone is far from the nearest &lt;a href="w%3ATectonic_plate"&gt;plate boundaries&lt;/a&gt;, which are in the center of the Atlantic Ocean and in the Caribbean Sea." Because the area has many faults, some smaller, deeper and some not yet detected, few, if any, earthquakes can be linked to named faults. Furthermore USGS says that the best guide to predicting earthquakes of the sort, in the Western Quebec seismic zone, is actually having the earthquake.

<h3>Pattern of quakes in the area</h3>

The Ontario region has not encountered a major earthquake since October 1990 when a 5.0 occurred in &lt;a href="w%3AEastern_Ontario"&gt;Eastern Ontario&lt;/a&gt;. The Ottawa Sun reports this is the third significant tremor in the region for 2006. The two largest damaging earthquakes for this region occurred in "1935 (magnitude 6.1) at the northwestern end of the seismic zone, and in 1732 (magnitude 6.2) 450 km (280 mi) away at the southeastern end of the zone where it caused significant damage in Montreal." Smaller earthquakes, such as this, are felt about three to four times a year.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Federal treasurer &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, next in line for Prime Minister, has called for Muslim extremists to be stripped of their citizenship. In a speech to the &lt;a href="w%3ASydney%20Institute"&gt;Sydney Institute&lt;/a&gt; on the 23rd February, he described multiculturalism as "mushy and misguided". 

Politicians from all sides have spoken out at the remarks and many from the Islamic community say they're offended by Mr Costello's comments, with Muslim leaders saying that it is "extremely divisive" and a blight on Australia's international reputation.

Mr Costello particularly singled out Muslims in his remarks, saying extremists should move to countries where they feel more comfortable. Mr Costello's comments targeting Muslim extremists, won support from Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;, and controversial ex-politician Pauline Hanson. 

"Before entering a mosque visitors are asked to take off their shoes," Mr Costello said. "This is a sign of respect. If you have a strong objection to walking in your socks don't enter the mosque. Before becoming an Australian you will be asked to subscribe to certain values. If you have strong objection to those values don't come to Australia."

Abdul El Ayoubi, a director of the &lt;a href="w%3ALebanese%20Moslems%20Association"&gt;Lebanese Muslim Association&lt;/a&gt; said, "it's upsetting to hear such comments, especially when you consider that the majority of Muslims have accepted the Australian way of life and Australian values."

45 per cent of Australia's population are from culturally diverse backgrounds. The Ethnic Communities' Council of Victoria (ECCV) has called for tolerance rather than division. "Peter Costello's comments are divisive, arrogant, provocative and do nothing to unite the nation at a time when responsible leadership on this issue is called for," ECCV chairman Phong Nguyen said. 

"To have the leaders of our nation, such at the Prime Minister and Treasurer, making gratuitous comments about race and religion based on ill-founded perceptions rather than facts, is extremely divisive and will harm Australia nationally and internationally," he said.

Mr Nguyen said Mr Costello appeared to be aligning himself with the "now discredited argument of his colleague Danna Vale – that Australia is in danger of becoming a Muslim nation". 

In his speech Mr Costello made a public call for Muslims who want to live under sharia law to find another country, while also referring to "mushy multiculturalism". 

Justin Li, vice chair of the NSW Ethnic Communities' Council, said Mr Costello's comments had deliberately and unfairly targeted Muslims.

"Obviously nobody supports violent people in our society, but what we don't understand is why allegedly violent Muslims are any different from any violent people of other cultures or religions," he said. "What about deporting the people who participated in riots in Cronulla last year? Those people did not exhibit any Australian values in their actions."

Mr Li added the comments were "political point scoring" made to sit well with sections of the community which do not support multiculturalism. "Our political leaders think that there is advantage to be gained making comments against our Muslim Australians at this stage in time," he said.

Malcolm Thomas from the Islamic Foundation of Victoria says it's the fact that Mr Costello singled out Muslims. "If you remove the word Muslim from what he said, well then I totally agree with Peter. Yeah, I'm prepared, just as much as Peter, to be as intolerant to anyone who wants to attack Australia and the Australian values, irrespective of their race or religion or ethnicity," said Mr Thomas. "Language is everything. The words are marginalising a segment of our community and creating division within the community."

Mr Thomas also points out that the suggestion to strip people of citizenship has limited potential, given that a third of Muslims living here were born here. "Australian Muslims are Australian. We can't differentiate that. And I think people need to keep that in mind." he said.

Another Muslim community leader said Costello is promoting division and Islamophobia and should be censured. Keysar Trad, president of the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia, has said he genuinely hoped the Prime Minister would censure Mr Costello.

Mr Trad said nobody was protesting Australia's secular laws through any other means than the normal democratic process. "We have not asked for sharia law to be imposed. I don't know anyone in this country who is asking for sharia law to be imposed and I don't known anyone in this country who has rejected the rule of law," he told ABC radio. "Rather than try to promote understanding and harmony in this society, his comments are highly divisive and he is stirring up Islamophobia, and these comments should really be beneath any decent politician."

In his speech, Mr Costello said where there was reason to believe people were not truthfully or honestly meeting their citizenship test, there was every right for them to be denied citizenship.

"If by subsequent conduct they show that they don't meet the test then we could invite them to forfeit their Australian citizenship," he said. "Now you can only do this if they have another citizenship." 

But Mr El Ayoubi said: "If you've come to this country, you've come to this country to live under a democratic system and you've come into this country to abide by the rules, the principles and the values of this country, and you should do that."

Mr Costello emphasised that Australia is a secular state under which the freedom of all religions is protected. "But there is not a separate stream of law derived from religious sources that competes with or supplants Australian law in governing our civil society," he said. "The source of our law is the democratically elected legislature. If a person wants to live under sharia law these are countries where they might feel at ease. But not Australia."

Mr Costello said there were some beliefs and values which were so central to Australian society that those who refused to accept them refused to accept the nature of Australian society.

"If someone cannot honestly make the citizenship pledge, they cannot honestly take out citizenship," he said. "If they have taken it out already they should not be able to keep it where they have citizenship in some other country."

His comments follow Prime Minister John Howard's claims this week that a fragment of the Islamic community is "utterly antagonistic to our kind of society". Last week Liberal backbencher Danna Vale said that Australia could become a Muslim nation within 50 years because "we are aborting ourselves almost out of existence".

Mr Costello said he had attended an Australia day citizenship ceremony at the Stonnington Town Hall in his electorate of Higgins during which a state MP "extolled the virtues of multiculturalism". He said the MP said becoming an Australian did not mean giving up one's culture or language or religion — and it certainly did not mean giving up the love of their country of birth.

"The longer he went on about how important it was not to give up anything to become an Australian, the more it seemed to me that, in his view, becoming an Australian didn't seem to mean very much at all, other than getting a new passport."

Islamic Council of Victoria president Malcolm Thomas said he was disappointed at Mr Costello's speech. "We have had the uninformed comments of Danna Vale, we have had the comments made by the Prime Minister and now we have these comments — all they do is reinforce a stereotype which doesn't exist." Mr Thomas said that singling out Muslims was pandering to a conspiracy that Muslims wanted to overtake Australia.

"Australian Muslims are Australians first," he said. "They abide by the law and they want to live here in peace and harmony. They are not interested in taking over the country. They are not interested in creating a theocracy".

Ikebal Patel, an executive member of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, said the comments were "inflammatory". "Islam law teaches that when you go into a country you embrace the laws of that country," Mr Patel said. "I hope we are not going away from multiculturalism as the founding stone of our immigration policy."

Mr Patel said the timing of the comments smacked of an attempt by the Government to deflect attention from the AWB scandal. 

Mr Costello said Muslims who did not like the depiction of the Prophet Muhammad in newspapers should recognise this does not justify violence.

The &lt;a href="w%3AFBI"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that the chunky substance discovered in the Moore-Hill dormitory at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Texas"&gt;University of Texas&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday is not the poison &lt;a href="w%3Aricin"&gt;ricin&lt;/a&gt;.

Ricin is one of the most deadly poisons in the world and can exist in the form of a pellet, mist, or powder. Some symptoms of exposure can include vomiting and dehydration, sweating, nausea, fever, cough and difficulty of breathing.

An earlier report by the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; had said tests had found the substance might be ricin. Such tests are designed to error on the side of caution, thus ensuring that possible poisoning victims receive treatment in time. 

Last year there were similar false positive reports of ricin in &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, which were further publicized by Vice President Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGarda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na"&gt;An Garda Síochána&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have regained control in &lt;a href="Dublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; following riots in which a &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Republicanism"&gt;Republican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; counter-demonstration against &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Loyalist"&gt;Loyalist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; marches in the city descended into violence that engulfed the city centre. Shops on some of Dublin's major thoroughfares including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AO%27Connell%20Street"&gt;O'Connell Street&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANassau%20Street%20%28Dublin%29"&gt;Nassau Street&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AKildare%20Street"&gt;Kildare Street&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were closed as the Garda Riot Squad moved in from &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AGrafton%20Street"&gt;Grafton Street&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and hundreds of shoppers were caught up in the disturbance. 

40 protesters have been arrested, and 14 people have been hospitalised, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ART%C3%89%20News"&gt;RTÉ News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; main correspondent &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACharlie%20Bird"&gt;Charlie Bird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and six gardaí. 13 of the arrested will be dealt with tonight during a special sitting of Dublin District Court.

The riots, which have been described as the worst that Dublin has seen in a quarter of a century, broke out at 12.45 pm. About 1,000 Loyalist protestors, including members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AOrange%20Order"&gt;Orange Order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , had travelled from &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in order to march from Parnell Street down to &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALeinster%20House"&gt;Leinster House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (the seat of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20parliament"&gt;Irish parliament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ) on Kildare Street. 

The march never got underway, however; the protesters were transported to the location by bus following a consultation with gardaí that suggested a march would be unsafe. The march was intended to commemorate victims of Republican paramilitary activity. 

Loyalist protesters proceeded to demonstrate outside Leinster House for a short time, but the parade was cancelled as around 300 Republican protestors from across Ireland moved onto Kildare Street. Gardaí ordered major premises to shut as the violence increased. Missiles, fireworks, petrol bombs, and rubble and tools from a building site on O'Connell Street were thrown by Republican protestors onto gardaí. As the rioting proceeded, looting broke out, the Loyalist protesters were advised to leave the region, and cars were burned out between Kildare Street and O'Connell Street.

Political figures, led by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20Ireland"&gt;President of Ireland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMary%20McAleese"&gt;Mary McAleese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and including leaders of major political parties from across Ireland's political spectrum such as &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFianna%20F%C3%A1il"&gt;Fianna Fáil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AFine%20Gael"&gt;Fine Gael&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , the Irish &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALabour%20Party%20%28Ireland%29"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20and%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have condemned the violence. &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATaoiseach"&gt;Taoiseach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has commented that "It is the essence of Irish democracy and republicanism that people are allowed to express their views freely and in a peaceful manner. People who want only to attack gardaí and property have no respect for their fellow citizens." 

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUnionists%20%28Ireland%29"&gt;Unionist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; politicians due to participate in the rally, including &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist%20Party"&gt;Democratic Unionist Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMember%20of%20Parliament"&gt;MP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJeffrey%20Donaldson"&gt;Jeffrey Donaldson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionists"&gt;Ulster Unionist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; deputy leader &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADanny%20Kennedy"&gt;Danny Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , have issued a complaint to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMinister%20for%20Justice%2C%20Equality%20and%20Law%20Reform%20%28Ireland%29"&gt;Irish Minister for Justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20McDowell"&gt;Michael McDowell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , who has admitted that An Garda Síochána were not expecting the level of hostility that was realised. Mr McDowell has also commented that the riots were perpetrated by people who did not understand what Irish republicanism means and who have damaged the cause of Irish unity that they purported to support.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Sinn%20F%C3%A9in"&gt;Republican Sinn Féin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a party which split from the main body of Sinn Féin in 1986 and which had been involved in the organisation of the counter-demonstration, have declared that it was irresponsible for the authorities to allow the marches to go ahead. It is believed that around €50,000 will be necessary to clear up and repair the damage caused to O'Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare, and the street will remain closed until tomorrow. It is feared that the riots will have a significant impact on the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland%20peace%20process"&gt;Northern Ireland peace process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , and on plans by the Irish government to recommence annual commemorations of the 1916 &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AEaster%20Rising"&gt;Easter Rising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

A Unionist march in central &lt;a href="w%3ADublin%2C%20Ireland"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt; turned violent after republican protesters tried to disrupt the parade. So far, several &lt;a href="w%3AGarda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na"&gt;Garda Síochána&lt;/a&gt; police officers and a journalist have been injured. Due to the violence, the march has been called off.

Hundreds of republican protesters turned out to oppose the "Love Ulster" march organized by the victim's group Fair. &lt;a href="w%3ADemocratic%20Unionist"&gt;Democratic Unionist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AUlster%20Unionist"&gt;Ulster Unionist&lt;/a&gt; politicians were planning to take part in the march. The march was to highlight the deaths of Protestants in Northern Ireland by Irish nationalists. A delegation was also to meet the Justice Minister, &lt;a href="w%3AMichael%20McDowell"&gt;Michael McDowell&lt;/a&gt;, after the march.

A counter-protest was organised by &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican%20Sinn%20Fein"&gt;Republican Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt;, a political party that is believed to be linked to the &lt;a href="w%3AContinuity%20Irish%20Republican%20Army"&gt;Continuity Irish Republican Army&lt;/a&gt; and which split away from &lt;a href="w%3ASinn%20Fein"&gt;Sinn Fein&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, just as the Continuity IRA split away from the &lt;a href="Provisional%20IRA"&gt;Provisional IRA&lt;/a&gt;. Sinn Fein stated they had no involvement in the violence. Counterprotesters threw bottles, fireworks and many different objects at riot police. 

However, an on-looker stated "They have no right to be coming down here and rubbing our noses in it." He added that many Catholics also suffered during the conflict known as the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Troubles"&gt;The Troubles&lt;/a&gt;♡❤. Kelly Ann Moore, 20, a republican protester said "Loyalist protesters knew what was going to happen if they tried to do this. They were trying to provoke this violence."

♡❤The Troubles♡❤ is an ongoing conflict that stems from the partition of Ireland in the 1920s into two entities, the &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20Free%20State"&gt;Irish Free State&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ANorthern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;. The Irish Free State eventually became the Republic of Ireland, an independent nation, while Northern Ireland became a constituent part of the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict is split into two camps, the &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20nationalism"&gt;nationalists&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3AIrish%20republicanism"&gt;republicans&lt;/a&gt; which advocate a united, single Ireland and the &lt;a href="w%3Aunionists%20%28Ireland%29"&gt;unionists&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="w%3Aloyalists"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; which advocate a continued union with the United Kingdom. The conflict also boils down into religious divides as unionists are generally &lt;a href="w%3AProtestant"&gt;Protestant&lt;/a&gt; and nationalists are usually &lt;a href="w%3ARoman%20Catholic"&gt;Catholic&lt;/a&gt;.

Taoiseach (Prime Minister) &lt;a href="w%3ABertie%20Ahern"&gt;Bertie Ahern&lt;/a&gt; condemned the violence and stated "There is no excuse for it and that it is the essence of Irish democracy and republicanism that people are allowed express their views freely and in a peaceful manner." 

Other politicians condemned the violence too. Sean Crowe, Sinn Fein TD for Dublin South West said the rioting was "disgraceful" but included that the unionist rally had been "provocative". 

Alban Maginness of the &lt;a href="w%3ASocial%20Democratic%20%26amp%3B%20Labour%20Party"&gt;Social Democratic &amp; Labour Party&lt;/a&gt; stated "It is disturbing that marchers have been prevented from peaceful demonstration. This action of extreme republicans simply plays into hands of those of the unionist right who cannot conceive unionist rights being upheld in a new Ireland."

The &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. Department of State&lt;/a&gt; says that the &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;n government's measure to restrict flights to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; violates the agreement of 1953.

In a press release the Venezuelan Institute for Aviation (Inac) announced the decision to "reduce" starting on March 1st all operations of American airlines in Venezuela.

Later, the official Institution ordered Delta and Continental Airlines the suspension of all of its activities in Venezuelan territory. It also ordered American Airlines to reduce the frequency of its flights to and from the United States.

Venezuela argues that the American Aviation Services does not respect the terms of the agreement between both countries that allows the operations of US-based companies and vice versa.

&lt;a href="w%3AOxford"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; - Today saw the first demonstration in support of &lt;a href="w%3AOxford%20University"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt;'s new animal testing facility on &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Parks%20Road"&gt;South Parks Road&lt;/a&gt;. Around 600 students marched under the banner of &lt;a href="w%3APRO-test"&gt;PRO-test&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation set up several weeks ago in opposition to &lt;a href="w%3ASPEAK"&gt;SPEAK&lt;/a&gt;, which campaigns and demonstrates frequently in the city for &lt;a href="animal%20rights"&gt;animal rights&lt;/a&gt;.

The demonstration began at 11:30am outside &lt;a href="w%3ABalliol%20College"&gt;Balliol College&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="w%3ABroad%20Street"&gt;Broad Street&lt;/a&gt;, in the historic centre of the city, and (just before midday) marched along &lt;a href="w%3AHolywell%20Street"&gt;Holywell Street&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMansfield%20Road"&gt;Mansfield Road&lt;/a&gt; up towards South Parks Road. Police prevented the PRO-test demonstration from reaching the actual building site because of a SPEAK protest (around 150 people, according to &lt;a href="w%3AThames%20Valley%20Police"&gt;Thames Valley Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.thamesvalley.police.uk/news/default.asp%3Fdismode%3Darticle%26amp%3Bartid%3D5800"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) which was occurring there at that time. The crowd was addressed&lt;a href="http%3A//www.pro-test.org.uk/past.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="w%3Aneurosurgery"&gt;neurosurgeon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ATipu%20Aziz"&gt;Tipu Aziz&lt;/a&gt;, Dr &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Festing"&gt;Simon Festing&lt;/a&gt; (executive director of the &lt;a href="w%3AResearch%20Defense%20Society"&gt;Research Defense Society&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="w%3ALiberal%20Democrat"&gt;Liberal Democrat&lt;/a&gt; MP Dr &lt;a href="w%3AEvan%20Harris"&gt;Evan Harris&lt;/a&gt;, amongst others.

Students demonstrated for different reasons, however. Some were obviously marching in favour of animal testing in order to further medical research, while others wanted to show solidarity with researchers and the university, who have been coming under increasing pressure from organisations such as the &lt;a href="w%3AAnimal%20Liberation%20Front"&gt;Animal Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; (ALF). 

Last year, the ALF claimed responsibility for its arson attack on the Long Bridges boathouse, and recently it put out a communiqué&lt;a href="http%3A//www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/communiques/2006-02-02_oxford.htm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stating that they "must target professors, teachers, heads, students, investors, partners, supporters and ANYONE that dares to deal in any part of the University in any way." SPEAK and the ALF are separate organisations; the former campaigns peacefully, while the latter often uses tactics such as threatening letters, intimidation and criminal damage to further its cause. It should be noted, however, that in an interview for &lt;a href="w%3ASky%20News"&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.sky.com/skynews/video/videoplayer/0%2C%2C31200-animals_p7191%2C00.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the 25th February, a spokeswoman for SPEAK refused to condemn their activities.

The PRO-test march returned back down Mansfield Road and Holywell Street (in order to avoid passing the SPEAK demonstration), and finished outside the Radcliffe Camera. After a few speeches, everyone dispersed, the demonstration having passed off peacefully, though there was an attempt by five SPEAK demonstrators to break through the police line. SPEAK activists continued to leaflet on &lt;a href="w%3ACornmarket%20Street"&gt;Cornmarket Street&lt;/a&gt;, and marched down from outside the research lab into the centre around 2pm.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3A9th%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals"&gt;9th Circuit Court of Appeals&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Francisco"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday voted to reconsider an earlier decision against &lt;a href="w%3AKamehameha%20Schools"&gt;Kamehameha Schools&lt;/a&gt;, an independent school in &lt;a href="w%3AHonolulu"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, regarding the legality of its admission policy that favors &lt;a href="w%3ANative%20Hawaiian"&gt;Native Hawaiian&lt;/a&gt;s.

A majority of the 23 eligible judges (one judge from &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; recused himself) on the 9th Circuit Court voted to reconsider the August 2, 2005 decision, in which the court ruled 2-1 that the school's admission policy violates federal civil rights law by absolutely barring non-Hawaiians from attending the school.

A date has not been set for the rehearing of the case before a so-called ♡❤en banc♡❤ panel of 15 of the 24 judges. 

The case was filed in June 2003 on behalf of an anonymous non-Hawaiian student who applied for admission to Kamehameha and was rejected. U.S. District Judge Alan Kay ruled in November 2003 that Kamehameha's admission policy was not in violation of civil rights law, citing the school's unique historical circumstances and its mission in remediating the socioeconomic and educational disdvantages that Native Hawaiians face. Kay's ruling was overturned by the 9th Circuit in its August 2005 ruling.

The student is currently completing his final year at a public high school. The rehearing of the case means that the student will most likely not be able to attend Kamehameha before he graduates in June.

Kamehameha Schools was established in the 1884 will of Hawaiian princess &lt;a href="w%3ABernice%20Pauahi%20Bishop"&gt;Bernice Pauahi Bishop&lt;/a&gt;, the last direct descendant of King &lt;a href="w%3AKamehameha%20I"&gt;Kamehameha I&lt;/a&gt;. Her will directed that the schools give "preference to Hawaiians of pure or part aboriginal blood." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ksbe.edu/pauahi/will.php"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Kamehameha Schools' admission policy, according to its web site, is to "give preference to applicants of Hawaiian ancestry to the extent permitted by law." &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ksbe.edu/admissions/mainpage.html%23Policy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In theory, qualified non-Hawaiians may be admitted after all qualified Hawaiian applicants are offered admission, but in practice there are usually fewer spaces than there are qualified Hawaiian applicants.

Former taxi driver Joseph Terrence Thomas has become the first &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; convicted under new new anti-terrorism laws.

Thomas was convicted by a Supreme Court jury of receiving a plane ticket and AU$4,740 (US$3,500) from &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt; associate Khalid bin Attash. The 32-year-old was also convicted of having a &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistani&lt;/a&gt; visa changed to appear that he had been in the area for two weeks, instead of two-and-a-half years.

The jury &lt;a href="w%3Aacquittal"&gt;acquitted&lt;/a&gt; Thomas on further charges of intentionally providing himself as a resource at the &lt;a href="w%3AAl%20Farooq"&gt;Al Farooq&lt;/a&gt; terrorist training camp in &lt;a href="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; and of agreeing to become a sleeper agent for Al-Qaeda in Australia. 

During the trial, prosecutor Nicolas Robinson alleged that Thomas told &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; officers that Al-Qaeda wanted him to conduct surveillance of Australian military installations. 

Outside the court, Thomas’s father, Ian Thomas, told reporters he was happy his son had been acquitted of the more serious charges. "The acquittal has been a great victory - I've always supported our son and family and will continue," he said.

Thomas’s wife, Maryati Thomas, said she was relieved Thomas was not convicted of all charges. "It's a big victory for us, the fact that he's here and all the family have been standing right next to us," she said.

Federal &lt;a href="w%3A%20Attorney%20General"&gt;Attorney General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3APhilip%20Ruddock"&gt;Philip Ruddock&lt;/a&gt; said the convictions show Australia’s new anti-terrorism laws are working. "The importance of not engaging with terrorist organisations and in this case receiving money from such an organisation ought not be underestimated by the broader community,” he said.

Defence barrister Lex Lasry applied for bail, telling the court that Thomas had no previous convictions and had already spent time in custody in Pakistan and three months in the maximum security Acacia Unit at &lt;a href="w%3ABarwon%20Prison"&gt;Barwon Prison&lt;/a&gt;. Justice Philip Cummins remanded Thomas into custody for a pre-sentencing hearing on March 2, 2006. 

Thomas faces a maximum of 25 years imprisonment for receiving funds from Al-Qaeda and a maximum of two years imprisonment for altering his visa.

The &lt;a href="w%3AChurch%20of%20England"&gt;Anglican Church&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ASouth%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to pay up to AU$4 million to 36 victims of alleged paedophile Robert Brandenberg.

Brandenberg, a priest and former Church of England Boys Society leader, committed suicide in 1999, on the same day he was to face court on child sex offence charges.

Peter Humphries, lawyer for the victims, said the deal was the result of three years of negotiations with the church. "Two thirds of the batch of claims have been assessed and we're satisfied that the church has made sensible offers – we'll be recommending settlement in next day or so," he said.

Humphries said he has recommended most of the victims settle with the church. "For those clients who accept offers that will be it," he said.

24 victims have agreed to accept the church’s offer and have settled their claims. The remaining 12 are expected to be finalised soon.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
♡❤&lt;a href="Wikinews"&gt;Wikinews&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ was the first to tell you that the Elmwood Village Hotel development in Buffalo, New York was to undergo "significant changes".

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a proposed project that would be placed at Elmwood and Forest Aves. in Buffalo. In order for the development to take place, at least five buildings that house both businesses and residents, must be demolished.

To confirm and to get more information about the changes, ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ interviewed Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino Construction Services Corporation, the development company in charge of building the hotel.

♡❤♡♡❤Wikinews:♡❤♡♡❤ The hotel proposal is being redesigned. Could you comment on that? What changes are being made? Are they significant?

♡❤♡♡❤Eva Hassett:♡❤♡♡❤ The hotel has been resized as a 72-room, four story building. This is 10% smaller in number of rooms and a full story lower. We are also redesigning the facades in a way that will minimize the mass - more of a vertical feeling than horizontal. Different materials, windows, details. The smaller size of the hotel also makes the number of on-site parking spaces more appropriate and hopefully represents less of a challenge to an already difficult parking situation.

♡❤♡♡❤WN:♡❤♡♡❤ Will you still be going before the city's planning board as scheduled on February 28? Same for the Common Council?

♡❤♡♡❤Hassett:♡❤♡♡❤ We will be on the Planning Board agenda this Tuesday morning but I do not expect that the Board will vote on the item that morning. I think we will be mainly explaining the new design and hearing input/questions.

♡❤♡♡❤WN:♡❤♡♡❤ Will there be anymore public meetings?

♡❤♡♡❤Hassett:♡❤♡♡❤ We would be happy to do one more big public meeting. We will be talking to Forever Elmwood about that on Monday (February 27, 2006). We would like to see if there is support for the new design and we also want to honor the public's request for another meeting. I am hopeful that meeting can take place the week of March 6th.

♡❤♡♡❤WN:♡❤♡♡❤ Is Savarino considering Mr. Rocco Termini's design/proposal? If no, do you (Savarino) support/oppose?

♡❤♡♡❤Hassett:♡❤♡♡❤ We are hopeful that we can build the hotel as redesigned. We think it would be a great addition to the Elmwood Ave. area, a good way for out-of-towners to see what Buffalo offers and a big help to the businesses there.

♡❤♡♡❤WN:♡❤♡♡❤ Are you considering more time for the community to make a judgment?

♡❤♡♡❤Hassett:♡❤♡♡❤ As I mentioned above, we expect to have one more meeting to get public reaction to the new design, and I think the Planning Board may want an additional meeting to make their determination. We do however, have constraints that will limit the amount of extra time. We still think it is a great project for the City and Elmwood; and we still want it to be something that the community wants as well.

So far, the City of Buffalo's City Planning Board is still scheduled to meet at 8:00 a.m. (Eastern) on February 28, 2006 followed by the Common Council meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the same day.

Images of the design are not yet available. "We are working on the renderings this weekend, but I will likely have some early in the week," stated Hassett.

Having outlined his manifesto in his last pre-election radio broadcast, beleaguered &lt;a href="Thailand"&gt;Thai&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AThaksin%20Shinawatra"&gt;Thaksin Shinawatra&lt;/a&gt; has failed to deflect calls for his resignation.

Offering an increased minimum wage, additional debt relief for farmers, and pay rises for civil servants the PM starts the election campaign with his &lt;a href="w%3AThai%20Rak%20Thai"&gt;Thai Loves Thais&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Phak Thai Rak Thai♡❤) party in good shape for the snap election announced last Friday.

Thaksin's dissolution of the lower house of parliament, and move to re-establish his authority through elections has met with criticism from leaders in the troubled southern provinces as well as from political opponents. Zafi-in Jae-loh, the deputy chairman of Narathiwat Islamic Committee said the move would do nothing to help the situation faced by ethnic Malay Muslims in the south. The three southernmost provinces, &lt;a href="w%3ANarathiwat%20Province"&gt;Narathiwat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APattani%20Province"&gt;Pattani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3AYala%20Province"&gt;Yala&lt;/a&gt; face near-daily bombings and shootings with a considerable armed forces presence contributing to tensions in the area.

Opposition parties concerned that the three years early election will not resolve the current political situation have announced that they may boycott the April 2 poll. The &lt;a href="w%3ADemocrat%20Party%20%28Thailand%29"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Phak Prachatipat♡❤) and the smaller &lt;a href="w%3AMahachon%20Party"&gt;Great People's Party&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Phak Mahachon♡❤) took over 25% of the vote in the February 2005 elections. Third placed at the last election with 11.4% of the vote, the &lt;a href="w%3AChart%20Thai%20Party"&gt;Thai Nation Party&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤Phak Chart Thai♡❤) have yet to announce their decision, leaving party leader Banharn Silapa-archa to decide.

Despite the upcoming election, and in the face of rumours of violence, a mass protest against the Prime Minister still went ahead. The People’s Alliance for Democracy was reported to be monitoring a crowd they were suspicious of ahead of the rally in Sanam Luang, Bangkok. However the main rally went off peacefully. Noon saw the arrival of former politician Chamlong Srimuang with the Santi Asoke Buddhist sect, including barefoot monks and nuns. Reports indicated that the total number in attendance and supporting the call for the now-caretaker Prime Minister to go were in the tens of thousands. Many protesters vowed to stay overnight. Alluding to past protests that had toppled Thai governments, Chamlong said "We can eat anything, sleep anywhere. Tonight we will sleep here". Anti-Thaksin banners displayed at the open-air rally stated that the he had "No right to rule", while others read "Thaksin=Toxin" below an image aimed at comparing the PM with Adolf Hitler.

Calls for the PM to go have a long history, with his policy of pursuing his opponents through the courts drawing the attention of the King, thus leading to Thaksin dropping cases against media firebrand, &lt;a href="w%3ASondhi%20Limthongkul"&gt;Sondhi Limthongkul&lt;/a&gt;. A challenge through the country's Constitutional Court was brought by 28 of the country's senators following the PM's family selling their 49% share in &lt;a href="w%3AShin%20Corporation"&gt;Shin Corporation&lt;/a&gt; tax-free. The sale, to &lt;a href="w%3ATemasek%20Holdings"&gt;Temasek Holdings&lt;/a&gt;, was widely seen as allowing control of key telecoms infrastructure to pass into foreign hands. &lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; describes Temasek as, "the investment arm of the Singapore government."

The &lt;a href="w%3ABoston%20College"&gt;Boston College&lt;/a&gt; men's basketball team defeated the &lt;a href="North%20Carolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; State Wolfpack at home in a 74-72 double-overtime thriller on Feb. 25. The BC Eagles, ranked #11 going in to the contest, left with a 22-6, 9-5 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference, while the NC State Wolfpack dropped to #19 after the game with a 21-7, 10-5 record.

&lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Crean"&gt;Simon Crean&lt;/a&gt;, Shadow Minister for Regional Development, has accused the &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; Government of abandoning regional development and showing no commitment to rural &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;. In a media release timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Howard Government, Mr. Crean said that the privatisation of Telstra and a failure to reform the Regional Partnerships program demonstrated the governments lack of commitment to the bush. 

"The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has failed to clean up the Regional Partnerships program, four months after a Senate Inquiry recommended major changes," he said. "AU$1.1 million dollars spent on the Gunnedah Grains to Ethanol project has been wasted - it still hasn't produced a single litre of ethanol. Likewise Beaudesert Rail, the recipient of $5.7 million in Government grants, has not travelled a single kilometre."

Regional Partnerships program provides government assistance for projects in regional areas. According to a government media release, there is $360.9 million available under this program for the period 2005-06 to 2008-09.

Mr Crean also criticised the National party for "[selling out] rural and regional Australia - on Telstra, on trade and on essential services."

"Last week's revelation that Telstra plans to get rid of 5000 payphones after privatisation show the serial contempt of the Bush by the Coalition."

The Minister for Transport and Regional Services, &lt;a href="w%3AWarren%20Truss"&gt;Warren Truss&lt;/a&gt;, has distanced himself from the Telstra announcement, saying that Telstra has an obligation to maintain services. "Certainly, there is a still a demand for payphones around Australia. Telstra are expected to provide those kinds of services," he said. 

"I think the time will come when we will move on to new technology and some of those systems that were more important in the past will be less important in the future but there are still many Australians who still depend on payphones and community telephone systems. Telstra has an obligation to provide those."

Warren Truss' office was contacted to provide a response to Mr. Crean's criticisms, but had not responded by the time this article was published.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; says the refugees he falsely accused of throwing their children into the ocean deserve no apology because they did the next worst thing - "they irresponsibly sank the damn boat, which put their children in the water".

The "&lt;a href="w%3AChildren_Overboard"&gt;children overboard&lt;/a&gt;" affair became a controversial focus in the 2001 federal election campaign, when the Prime Minister was roundly accused of cynically exploiting Australia's fears of illegal immigrants by demonising asylum-seekers. Mr Howard and senior ministers falsely claimed on the eve of the election that children had been thrown in the water to guarantee their rescue by the Australian navy.

The boat sank, and the crew of HMAS Adelaide saved 219 asylum-seekers. The then Defence Minister, Peter Reith, released dubious photos of the rescue as evidence that children had been thrown in the water. The Australian government only corrected the record after the election. 

Mr Howard says: "They irresponsibly sank the damn boat, which put their children in the water. I'm sorry, if I had have been told definitively, if I had been told that that story was completely wrong, I would have said so, but I wasn't," he says in the book 'The Howard Factor'. 

"And my last act before the election was to put that video in the public domain so that I wasn't accused of concealing it, because it was ambiguous. Watching that video, you couldn't tell whether people were being thrown in the water or not, it was just impossible. But after all, they did sink the boat." Mr Howard said the refugees "don't carry any visible signs of being demonised".

Figures from the Department of Immigration (DIMIA) about the 219 mainly Iraqi asylum-seekers, shows the group wound up with the highest success rate for all refugee claims made under the so-called &lt;a href="w%3APacific_Solution"&gt;Pacific solution&lt;/a&gt;. DIMIA 96.5 per cent of the Iraqis who were awarded humanitarian protection, though most have since been settled in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, not Australia.

Refugee rights advocate, Jack Smit, from the West Australian-based group Project SafeCom says: "Refugees don't sink damned boats, Mr Howard!" He said in a media statement: "The Prime Minister remains one of the very few politicians in Australia who maintains the slandering descriptive word 'illegals' to denote boatpeople." 

"Refugees rarely sink their boats," said Mr Smit, "Usually it is the people smugglers who do the sinking, sometimes the sinking is due to physical sabotage by sting operators working from countries such as Indonesia, and sometimes these sting operators are contracted by countries such as Australia."

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n federal treasurer, &lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, has announced a study to compare the Australian taxation system with those of other countries. It will include overall tax levels, as well as indirect tax, income tax and company tax systems. Mr Costello says that the results are intended to inform discussion of the future of the tax system.

"The aim of the study is to provide a public document that compares Australian taxes to those in other countries. This will identify those areas where Australia leads comparable countries and those areas where it lags. It will enable a focus on the most important areas," Mr Costello said in a media release.

The study will be lead by Mr Richard (Dick) Warburton and Mr Peter Hendy. Mr Warburton is Chairman of Caltex Australia Ltd, and has been Chairman of the Board of Taxation since its inception in September 2000. According to its website, the Board of Taxation is "a non-statutory advisory body charged with contributing a business and broader community perspective to improving the design of taxation laws and their operation."

The &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the study but warned that nothing would be achieved without serious reform of the tax system.

"The Inquiry announced yesterday by the Treasurer may turn out to be a step in the right direction but will be a pointless exercise if it ends up being simply a 'desktop' report," said Senator Murray, Democrats Tax Spokesperson.

"The problem with Mr Costello's approach is that in contrast to the approach taken on the GST, the New Tax System, and the Business Tax System, he has seen income tax change to be solely part of the budget process. Across the whole of the political and public policy spectrum, there is strong agreement that reform is needed, not just tax cuts, and that the income tax system needs redesigning, not just fine tuning."

A five-month-old girl is in a critical but stable condition in Sydney's Westmead Children's Hospital after receiving burns to 11 percent of her body in a house fire. The fire broke out at around 2am Sunday in the Department of Housing property in Kelso, a suburb of &lt;a href="w%3ABathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales"&gt;Bathurst, NSW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.

Police and fire crews were called to the house after a neighbour reported seeing the fire and four men, described as being of "Aboriginal" appearance, running from the area.

Police said that the five-month-old girl and her twin sister were sleeping in a front room when the fire broke out. The twins' parents rescued their children and fled before flames engulfed the entire house.

Inspector Chris Davey said police thought the fire may have been deliberate and had spent Sunday gathering evidence at the scene. "We're treating the fire as being deliberately lit at this point in time - we have investigators on the ground trying to identify four males seen to be leaving that area," he said.

An explosion occurred at the &lt;a href="w%3ARafael%20Advanced%20Defense%20Systems%20Ltd."&gt;Rafael Arms Development Authority&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3AKiryat%20Bialik%2C%20Israel"&gt;Kiryat Bialik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; today.

At least six people have been injured including police officers and medics. Rescue services say the injuries range from "moderate" to "light."

The explosion is not believed to be terror related. "We are not talking about a suicide attack. It is a work accident. We don't know exactly what, a chemical that blew up in a bottle," said Moshe Weizman, a regional police spokesman.

Rafael makes electronic warfare systems, missiles and tank armor.

The news that London Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Livingstone"&gt;Ken Livingstone&lt;/a&gt; is to face a one month suspension over comments made to an ♡❤Evening Standard♡❤ journalist was a surprise to many across the political spectrum when it was announced on Friday.

Deputy Mayor &lt;a href="w%3ANicky%20Gavron"&gt;Nicky Gavron&lt;/a&gt;, who would take over the Mayor's duties in the event of a suspension, said "This decision is absurd - millions of Londoners elected the Mayor, and three unelected officials remove him. An elected Mayor should only be removed by the law or by the electorate, not by an unelected body."

Support was also received from the Stop the War Coalition, who said in a statement that they were appalled - "Ken Livingstone was elected by millions of Londoners and he has been suspended by an unelected quango". The &lt;a href="w%3ATrades%20Union%20Congress"&gt;Trades Union Congress&lt;/a&gt; also condemned the statement, praising the Mayor's "absolute commitment and exemplary and consistent record in opposing racism of any form". The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Assembly%20Against%20Racism"&gt;National Assembly Against Racism&lt;/a&gt; Vice Chair said that they were "outraged" at the decision, also praising the Mayor's record of anti-racism campaigning.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABoard%20Of%20Deputies%20Of%20British%20Jews"&gt;Board Of Deputies Of British Jews&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the Mayor had been "the architect of his own misfortune" by failing to apologise over the incident, but said that they had not sought anything other than an expression of regret.

The &lt;a href="w%3AMuslim%20Association%20of%20Britain"&gt;Muslim Association of Britain&lt;/a&gt; argued that the suspension was a serious blow to democracy and free speech by undermining "the essence and values of democracy".

The Chairman of the &lt;a href="w%3ALondon%20Jewish%20Forum"&gt;London Jewish Forum&lt;/a&gt; Adrian Cohen welcomed the decision, but suggestion that it should never have reached the point of a suspension "when a simple apology could have avoided all the pain caused to so many Jewish Londoners", a sentiment echoed by the &lt;a href="w%3AJewish%20Leadership%20Council"&gt;Jewish Leadership Council&lt;/a&gt;.

The Editor of the &lt;a href="w%3AEvening%20Standard"&gt;Evening Standard&lt;/a&gt;, whose journalist is at the centre of the controversy, claimed that the journalist had behaved impeccably and accused Mr Livingstone of being stubborn.

The &lt;a href="w%3APower%20Inquiry"&gt;POWER Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;, set up in 2004 to examine participation and involvement in British politics, today published "Power to the People", its final report, making 30 key recommendations designed to "save &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;British&lt;/a&gt; democracy from meltdown".

The recommendations include decentralising power, from central government to local government, replacing the &lt;a href="w%3Afirst-past-the-post"&gt;first-past-the-post&lt;/a&gt; electoral system with a more responsive one, reducing the voting age to 16, and giving citizens the right to initiate legislative processes.

The Independent newspaper covered the story with a front page splash titled "Blueprint to give power to the people". The paper has been "campaigning for democracy" ever since the 2005 general elections, in which the Labour Party won 55.2% of the seats with just 35.3% of the votes. The newspaper ran a petition urging the Prime Minister to institute urgent reform of the voting system.

The final report credited the use of &lt;a href="w%3ASingle%20Transferable%20Vote"&gt;proportional voting&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere in &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; with both a reversal of declines in voter turnout and the formation of flexible, responsive coalitions,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[I]t is significant that most European countries have proportional systems which should provide a wider choice of parties from a more diverse political spectrum who all stand a good chance of winning places in Parliament or even in a governing coalition. This therefore raises the question of whether this factor can be treated as a genuinely significant cause. We feel it still can. Firstly, because it is such a commonly cited factor in all the expert and public evidence received by the Inquiry. And, secondly, because there is recent research to suggest that proportional systems have, on the whole, limited if not halted election turnout declines in comparison to Britain."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The POWER inquiry is funded by the &lt;a href="w%3ARowntree%20trusts"&gt;Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust&lt;/a&gt; and the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust Limited, and the inquiry is holding a conference on Saturday, March 25, 2006 to discuss their findings, before formally ending.

Chair of the inquiry, &lt;a href="w%3AHelena%20Kennedy%2C%20Baroness%20Kennedy%20of%20The%20Shaws"&gt;Helena Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; challenged politicians to "rise above their party ranks and start treating democratic reform as a non-partisan necessity - not a political toy".

The Prime Minister's Official Spokesman said that the report dealt with many issues, which were all matters to be debated within parties and between parties, adding that the report had added to the debate.

&lt;a href="w%3AOliver%20Heald"&gt;Oliver Heald&lt;/a&gt;, Shadow Constitutional Affairs secretary for the Conservative Party, welcomed the call to give more power to MPs, but opposed the plan to drop the voting age to 16. The Liberal Democrats acting president &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Hughes"&gt;Simon Hughes&lt;/a&gt; welcomed the report, saying "British Democracy is in crisis whatever the Government pretends - most voters are ignored and most people feel they have no influence".

&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Centre%20for%20Independent%20Studies"&gt;The Centre for Independent Studies&lt;/a&gt; has released a paper calling for reform of university student fees system. The paper, authored by &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Norton"&gt;Andrew Norton&lt;/a&gt;, argues that the cap on loans to full fee paying students is too low. The current cap allows for loans during a lifetime of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;50,950.

"Setting the FEE-HELP limit at this amount biases the market against courses that are long or have high per year costs, or both," argues Norton in the paper. "The loan cap is a crude way of controlling lending, taking no account of course costs or capacity to repay."

According to Norton, this undermines student choice and competition. He argues that the system should function more like commercial lending.

"A truly radical reform would make student loans mimic commercial loans: students with good earning prospects could borrow large sums, other students could borrow less, and some could not borrow at all," he said. "Instead of denying or limiting loans to people doing high cost courses, as now occurs, the government could deny loans to people who are unlikely to repay."

The paper was criticised by Senator &lt;a href="w%3AKerry%20Nettle"&gt;Kerry Nettle&lt;/a&gt;, Education Spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt;. She argued that the changes would mean an increase in costs to students already struggling to pay, and called on Education Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJulie%20Bishop"&gt;Julie Bishop&lt;/a&gt; to rule out the changes.

"To consider refusing loans to those deemed less able to repay would further cut off higher education for Australians from low socio-economic backgrounds," she said. "Julie Bishop should use her address to the National Press Club tomorrow to rule out any moves to further deregulate the HECS system."

"Student fees have spiralled upward under the Howard government and any further deregulation would just make a bad system worse," she added.

<h2>Australian student fees system</h2>

The Australian government has a system of subsidising student tuition fees. This system has undergone many changes during the Howard government. There are currently three strands:

<ul>
BULLET::::- HECS-HELP for students receiving federal government tuition subsidies
BULLET::::- FEE-HELP for full-fee students
BULLET::::- OS-HELP for study overseas

</ul>
<h2>The Centre for Independent Studies</h2>

On its website, The Centre for Independent Studies describes itself as "the leading independent public policy 'think tank' within Australasia. The CIS is actively engaged in support of a free enterprise economy and a free society under limited government where individuals can prosper and fully develop their talents. By critical recommendations to public policy and encouraging debate amongst leading academics, politicians and journalists, the CIS aims to build a better society." It claims to be funded by "private sector donations-from individuals, companies and charitable trusts-as well as subscriptions and books sales."

In a press release the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Greens&lt;/a&gt; described the think-tank as "rightwing".

The third author of ♡❤The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail♡❤ &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AHenry%20Lincoln"&gt;Henry Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , is not involved in the case.

Random House is the of publisher of both ♡❤The Da Vinci Code♡❤ and ♡❤The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail♡❤.

The central theme of the two books is that the bloodline from a marriage between &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJesus"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMary%20Magdalene"&gt;Mary Magdalene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; survives today. 

Random House has denied the claim and, Random House chief executive Gail Rebuck says in a statement that she believed the lawsuit was without merit.

"As publisher of both ♡❤The Da Vinci Code♡❤ and ♡❤The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail♡❤, we are genuinely saddened that two of the three authors of HBHG have chosen to bring this litigation against us...Random House takes no pleasure in defending a legal action that it believes is without merit and we are confident that we will prevail."

If this case is successful it could threaten the film; starring &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATom%20Hanks"&gt;Tom Hanks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASir%20Ian%20McKellen"&gt;Sir Ian McKellen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from opening. 

♡❤The Da Vinci Code♡❤ is a fiction book and has over 36 million copies in print worldwide. The dust jacket for the novel apparently includes longitude and latitude coordinates which lead to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACIA"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; headquarters near &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALangley%2C%20Virginia"&gt;Langley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AVirginia"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . 

Brown's next book, ♡❤The Solomon Key♡❤, is rumoured to be about the Yale &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASkull%20and%20Bones"&gt;Skull and Bones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; society.

The Maymont Zoo in Richmond, Virginia killed two black bears for their involvement in the biting of a 4-year-old boy. The boy sustained minor injuries after reaching his hands through the fence.

Citizens expressed outrage when it was reported the bears were destroyed and their carcasses disposed of by the zoo at a city landfill. The furor caused an investigation by Mayor Wilder into the decision by the zoo. A report issued by ♡❤WTVR♡❤ during the Monday evening news said that a "bear monument" would be erected in memory.

When informed on Monday of the zoo's decision to destroy the bears, the mother of the boy said she wept for the bears. The bite wounds will require the boy to under-go treatment for rabies.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a seven million dollar proposal by Savarino Construction Services Corp. The hotel would be built on the intersection of Elmwood and Forest Aves. in Buffalo. In order for the hotel to be built, the demolition of at least five currently occupied buildings will be required.

Golombeck found out about the proposal just three weeks ago when Sam Savarino of Savarino Construction Services Corp. called Golombeck. 

Golombeck said that he was asked, by the City of Buffalo to "approve" the proposal "tomorrow", (February 28, 2006). When asked to do so Golombeck replied, "That is just not possible. I did not realize how fast tracked this plan was. My first question to Savarino was, did you talk to the neighborhood?"

Golombeck also stated that he would not approve or deny the proposal until a reasonable amount of time was given to the community to make a judgment on the new design.

Golombeck also stated that the City of Buffalo wanted Savarino to obtain both 605 Forest and 607 Forest for the proposal, but, according to Golombeck, Savarino "does not want to do that." In order for the two buildings to be included in the development, Savarino will have to apply for a C-2 zoning permit. It is unknown if an attempt will be made to obtain those properties or make the zoning changes.

Wendy Pierce of Forever Elmwood stated that she had found out about the proposal only "two weeks ago from today." She also stated that the original design "felt too massive." Pierce also stated that she wanted to "speak more with the block clubs and residents" around the area.

Ms. pierce also stated that "other options" for parking will be looked into "if possible."

The new design will have less retail space and now has at lease three conference rooms. Parking has been increased to a total of fifty-five spaces, both underground and above.

Rocco Termini, a Buffalo developer also attended the meeting still stating that the hotel would "destroy Elmwood's urban streetscape." Mr. Termini has proposed a second development that would not include a hotel, but increase retail shops to at least seven.

The City of Buffalo Planning Board is still scheduled to meet at 8:00a.m Tuesday. The Common Council is still expected to meet at 2:00p.m. on the same day.

Joel Golombeck is expected to attend both meetings.

It has been revealed at the &lt;a href="w%3ACole%20inquiry"&gt;Cole inquiry&lt;/a&gt; that former &lt;a href="w%3AAWB%20Limited"&gt;Australian Wheat Board&lt;/a&gt; chairman Trevor Flugge was paid almost &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;1,000,000 by the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development"&gt;Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)&lt;/a&gt; to provide "agricultural assistance" to &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; for less than one year. The &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; today defended the payment, saying that Mr Flugge's background and experience justified the sum.

The Opposition attacked the government over the issue, suggesting that the money was wasted and could have been better spent helping children.

"AusAid is now tied up in the wheat for weapons scandal, [having] spent almost $700,000 sending Trevor Flugge off to Iraq to take photos of himself with guns," said &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Sercombe"&gt;Bob Sercombe&lt;/a&gt;, Labor spokesman on overseas aid and Pacific Island affairs.

"Every dollar spent on Trevor Flugge is one less dollar for spending on children in developing countries."

During an interview today Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; defended the payment of money to Mr Flugge, arguing that he had the appropriate skills. 

"Well you have to look at the availability of people, you have to look at the fact that we wanted to have somebody in that position who knew a lot about the wheat industry generally, about agriculture and certainly somebody who on his track record to them was somebody who would look to the interests of the Australian wheat industry. When you know and appreciate and acknowledge the value of wheat exports to this country, having somebody with the background that Flugge had in the wheat industry able to look after &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;'s interests," Mr Howard said. 

It was also revealed at a recent Senate estimates hearing that ninety percent of Australia's foreign aid budget goes to Australian companies. The revelation was made by an AusAID official, Dereck Rooken-Smith. 

According to Tim O'Conner of AID/WATCH, the news comes as no surprise. "For ten years now the Howard government has focused on advancing business and strategic interests through the aid program," he said.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABureau_of_Meteorology"&gt;Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)&lt;/a&gt; say ex-&lt;a href="w%3Atropical%20cyclone"&gt;tropical cyclone&lt;/a&gt; "Emma" has weakened below tropical cyclone intensity, after crossing the coast at 11am WST near Mardie in Western &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; (WA) today. Widespread squally thunderstorms with heavy rain and flooding are expected as the system moves further south. Approximately 280 millimetres of rain was recorded at &lt;a href="w%3AKarratha"&gt;Karratha&lt;/a&gt; in 36 hours.

The cyclone bore down on Australia's Pilbara region, bringing with it winds of up to 105kph. Dampier's port was closed, some flights to the region were cancelled and communities in the storm's path were battening down.

Cyclone Emma was west of Karratha and northeast of Onslow at 8am (WST) today, and travelling south at 23kph. The weather bureau said by the time the category one storm crosses the coast between Dampier and Onslow the worst of the weather will have passed.

"Most of the weather is travelling ahead of the system", weather forecaster Andrew Burton said. "They've probably had the worst weather by now, and by the time the system crosses the coast it will all be over really."

People near the communities of Onslow, Karratha, Dampier, Mardie, Point Sampson, Roebourne and Wickham were warned the storm could cause gales with gusts of up to 105kph. At Karratha, torrential rain has left parts of the town awash. Roebourne shire airport spokesman Alan Wright said there was flooding on the road to Karratha airport. 

Six people were rescued after two cars were swept away by flood water dumped by the cyclone, oil and mining operations were shut down, Karratha, Tom Price and Pannawonica suffered localised flooding and three Pilbara schools had minor classroom and roof damage. 

Fire and Emergency Services (FESA) issued an "all clear with caution" alert an hour after Emma crossed the coast and began breaking up as it moved inland. A spokesperson said: "With a category one cyclone you are not looking at destructive winds and in this case the rain that preceded the cyclone was the biggest issue. But residents should only proceed outside with caution as there may be downed powerlines, fallen trees, broken water and sewage lines, loose roof sheeting and debris."

Cyclone Emma's approach sparked a series of precautionary shutdowns of mining, oil and shipping operations. Open cut mining operations around Tom Price were shut. Guests at the Fortescue River Roadhouse, 1425km north of Perth, were stranded because of flooding. 

The weather also forced Woodside Mining to cease production at two of its operations in the Pilbara region. The company said it expected no major impact from the production interruption at the North West Shelf with operations to start producing again when the weather improves.

Cyclone Emma is the third cyclone of WA's cyclone season, which runs between November and April, with most activity in the latter half of the period. The Bureau of Meteorology say they are watching another developing tropical low that could impact WA over the weekend. 

The first major tropical storm this year was category three cyclone Clare which battered Dampier and brought flooding rains to mining regions and much of the wheatbelt in early January. A week later category two cyclone Daryl threatened North West WA but moved off the coast.

An "aggressive" strain of &lt;a href="w%3AAvian%20Flu"&gt;Avian Flu&lt;/a&gt; has been detected in two tufted ducks in &lt;a href="w%3AOskarshamn"&gt;Oskarshamn&lt;/a&gt;, Southeast &lt;a href="w%3ASweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.

This makes Sweden the ninth country in the &lt;a href="w%3AEU"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt; to confirm Avian Flu on their soil.

Some 35&amp;ndash;40 wild birds were found dead. The birds were brought to &lt;a href="w%3AUppsala"&gt;Uppsala&lt;/a&gt;, where an analysis confirmed the presence of an "aggressive" form of Avian Flu. Tests at a laboratory in the &lt;a href="w%3AUK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; will later eventually confirm whether the birds died of the lethal &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt;.

Sweden's Minister of Agriculture, &lt;a href="w%3AAnn-Christin%20Nykvist"&gt;Ann-Christin Nykvist&lt;/a&gt;, said at a press conference the discovery was "serious but not unexpected." Sweden has been on high alert since the virus was found on the German island &lt;a href="w%3AR%C3%BCgen"&gt;Rügen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="w%3ABaltic%20Sea"&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/a&gt;.

Two security zones are being established around the location where the birds were found. Dead birds will be destroyed and domestic stocks in the affected area will be monitored.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sizzler%20salad%20bars%20shut%20after%20rat%20poison%20found%20in%20food&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The &lt;a href="w%3ASizzler"&gt;Sizzler Restaurant&lt;/a&gt; franchise in &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; has closed the &lt;a href="w%3ASalad_bar"&gt;salad bars&lt;/a&gt; in all of its 29 restaurants across the country, after rat poison was discovered in food at two of the chain's outlets in &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;. Self-serve salad bars at the restaurants have been closed in response to a sabotage scare. Sizzler Australia Managing Director Bo Ryan said customer safety was always the restaurant chain’s first priority. 

A media release on the Sizzler website states: "As a precautionary measure and because customer health and safety is our number one priority, we have temporarily closed salad bars in all Sizzler Restaurants. We sincerely apologise for this major inconvenience." 

Police said green pellets were found in pasta sauce at a Sizzler restaurant in Brisbane's inner-west on January 20. A regular customer at the &lt;a href="w%3AToowong%2C%20Queensland"&gt;Toowong&lt;/a&gt; restaurant told Sizzler staff she had found something odd in her bolognese pasta sauce. Similar pellets were found in a vegetable soup at Sizzler's Myer Centre outlet in the city about 5pm on Saturday. 

Bo Ryan said the decision to close all of its Australian salad bars was made after laboratory tests confirmed that the substance in the pasta sauce was indeed rat poison. He said trainees who tasted the poisoned soup had been been taken to hospital by ambulance as a precaution, but had suffered no ill effects. 

&lt;a href="w%3AQueensland%20Police"&gt;Queensland Police&lt;/a&gt; Inspector Bob Hytch said no one had been reported ill as a result of eating the poisoned food and there had been no extortion threats. Sarah Kenny, a university student, said she and two friends had eaten spaghetti bolognese that "tasted really weird".

"The inconvenience to customers and the economic impact on the company and its 1600 employees will be severe, but as a family restaurant our first priority is the welfare of our diners," said Bo Ryan. "Steak and seafood and a limited range of salads would continue to be available." He hopes that customers will understand the action was taken in their best interests, and that "they can be patient while temporary product security procedures are developed and implemented in all restaurants." 

The 29 Australian Sizzler Restaurants, along with 107 &lt;a href="w%3AKFC"&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken&lt;/a&gt; outlets are operated by the Collins Foods Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Worldwide Restaurant Concepts Inc. Mr Ryan said Sizzler was assessing measures which could be taken to prevent a recurrence of the sabotage. "As soon as new measures are introduced, over and above existing strict protocols, we will reassess the situation," he said.

<h1>Random driver drug testing to become permanent in Victoria</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Random%20driver%20drug%20testing%20to%20become%20permanent%20in%20Victoria&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

After the world's first-ever 12 month trial of random drug testing for automobile drivers, the &lt;a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; government yesterday introduced legislation into parliament for the testing to become permanent starting July 1, 2006. The government tests targeted for the presence of &lt;a href="w%3ACannabis"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AAmphetamine"&gt;amphetamines&lt;/a&gt; by use of a saliva swab. During the trial period, the presence of &lt;a href="w%3AEcstacy"&gt;ecstacy&lt;/a&gt; was not tested, because at the time the trial period began, there was uncertainty over the accuracy of saliva tests for the drug.

The legislation comes in response to the discovery that one in 46 drivers tested were found positive for cannabis and/or amphetamines. Victorian Assistant Commissioner of Traffic, Noel Ashby said, "It is one in 46 drivers that we're testing are prepared to take a risk and endanger the lives of other people and that's really what we're about, we're trying to prevent people endangering the lives of others".

Of 13,176 tests carried out during the trial, 199 drivers tested positive for amphetamines only, 19 for cannabis alone and 69 for both amphetamines and cannabis. Each driver who tested positive was fined at least &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;307 and lost three demerit points.

Police also conducted tests for ecstacy, despite being unable to prosecute those driving under the influence of ecstacy alone. During the trial, 25 drivers tested positive to ecstacy alone and more than 200 tested positive for both ecstasy and amphetamines.

Victorian Police Minister, Tim Holding said existing penalties – which are softer than for drink-driving offences – were inadequate and would be toughened to ensure they reflected the seriousness of the offence.

At present, a first drug-driving offence incurs a $307 fine and three demerit points; subsequent offences a $1227 fine and up to a six-month loss of licence.

In comparison, a drink-driving offence attracts a fine of up to $1200 plus disqualification from driving for at least six months and up to 10 demerit points. Repeat drink-drivers face the possibilty of being penalised with a fine of up to $2500 or up to three months' imprisonment, plus a minimum one-year loss of licence and use of an alcohol interlock device for at least six months.

Under the random roadside drug-testing system, drivers who test positive are forced off the road for 24 hours. A second swab is then taken and sent for testing to identify the drug before penalties are issued.

Ken Ogden from the RACV said he would like to see every booze bus in Victoria be able to also operate as a drugs bus.

♡❤Knight Ridder♡❤ reports that "&lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; intelligence agencies repeatedly warned the White House beginning more than two years ago that the insurgency in &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; had deep local roots, was likely to worsen and could lead to civil war, according to former senior intelligence officials who helped craft the reports."

This is in stark contrast to public statements made by the &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;Bush&lt;/a&gt; administration. In his November 1 radio address &lt;a href="w%3APresident%20of%20the%20United%20States"&gt;President&lt;/a&gt; Bush said "Some of the killers behind these attacks are loyalists of the &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam&lt;/a&gt; regime who seek to regain power and who resent Iraq's new freedoms. Others are foreigners who have traveled to Iraq to spread fear and chaos. ... The terrorists and the &lt;a href="w%3ABaath%20Party"&gt;Baathists&lt;/a&gt; hope to weaken our will. Our will cannot be shaken."

In a May 2005 interview Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ADick%20Cheney"&gt;Cheney&lt;/a&gt; said "I think they're in the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency." 

Accoding to Robert Hutchings, the chairman of the National Intelligence Council from 2003 to 2005, and now diplomat in residence at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, there was a "steady stream" of intelligence reports warning Bush and his administration that the insurgency was intensifying and expanding, including a major study, called a National Intelligence Estimate, which was completed in October 2003.

Hutchings said that from early 2003 on the intelligence reports reflected that there were "signs of incipient civil war".

"Frankly, senior officials simply weren't ready to pay attention to analysis that didn't conform to their own optimistic scenarios," Hutchings told ♡❤Knight Ridder♡❤.

The office of Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte declined Tuesday to comment on the ♡❤Knight Ridder♡❤ article.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; have charged a 37-year-old &lt;a href="Vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;ese-born &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n woman after 2.6 kilograms of &lt;a href="w%3Aheroin"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt; was allegedly found in the lining of her suitcase. 

Thitanh Ho and her two children, aged 18 months and three years, were travelling to Australia from &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;. The woman's bags were selected for closer inspection when her behaviour aroused the suspicion of customs officials. 

"Upon closer examination, customs officers discovered a white powder, which allegedly tested positive for heroin," said a customs officer.

Senator Chris Ellison, Minister for Justice and Customs, said the detection was the largest seizure of heroin at the border in Western Australia for 12 years. “This seizure sends a clear message to those who attempt to import drugs that they will be caught,” he said.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Federal%20Police"&gt;Australian Federal Police&lt;/a&gt; spokesman Peter Wood said officers are investigating possible distribution networks. “Obviously we are looking at the source of the drugs and we're also looking to identify the network here in Australia where it was going to be distributed to," he said.

Ho appeared before Perth Magistrates' Court today charged with importing a border-controlled drug. She was remanded into custody and her children were placed into Government care.

The maximum penalty for drug trafficking is a fine of up to &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;750,000 and/or life imprisonment.

The arrest comes just three months after Singapore executed convicted Australian drug trafficker Nguyen Tuong Van.

&lt;a href="w%3AQueensland"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; police have charged a 57-year-old woman with the alleged contamination of the salad bar at two &lt;a href="w%3ASizzler"&gt;Sizzler&lt;/a&gt; restaurants.

Rat poison pellets were found in food at Sizzler restaurants at &lt;a href="w%3AToowong"&gt;Toowong&lt;/a&gt; on January 20 and the &lt;a href="w%3ABrisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; Myer Centre outlet last Sunday. Yesterday Sizzler closed salad bars nationwide, but they did not report the incidents to the Queensland Health Department until last Monday. 

Queensland’s Health Minister Stephen Robertson criticised the restaurant chain for delaying reporting a possible incident of food contamination for 37 days. "I think this is a case that - a real life case - that we should perhaps learn some lessons from,” he said.

Queensland Police Inspector Bob Hytch said the woman is the same woman police asked to come forward after she told Sizzler staff she had found pellets in soup at the Myer Centre restaurant last Saturday. 

The woman is expected to face Brisbane Magistrates' Court tomorrow charged with two counts of contamination of goods and four counts of an act intending to cause grievous bodily harm.

<h1>Possible first case of mad cow disease in Sweden</h1>

A suspected case of &lt;a href="w%3ABovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy"&gt;BSE&lt;/a&gt;, better known as mad cow disease, has been discovered in &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; at a farm near &lt;a href="w%3AV%C3%A4ster%C3%A5s"&gt;Västerås&lt;/a&gt; some 80 kilometres west of &lt;a href="w%3AStockholm"&gt;Stockholm&lt;/a&gt;.

The affected farm has been quarantined and no ruminants from the farm are allowed to be sold or transported. The cow was destroyed earlier after symptoms of calving paralysis had been discovered, and the tests where carried out in accordance to rules set by the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; (EU).

The Swedish Board of Agriculture (Jordbruksverket) analysed a specimen from the cow at the farm this weekend. The tests confirmed the presence of BSE and the specimen was sent for further analysis at a &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; laboratory.

If the British analysis confirms BSE in the specimen, it will be the first case of BSE in Sweden. The affected farmer told the Swedish public service radio: "As my father said, if we have to make history it would be a pity to do it this way."

BSE isn't transmitted directly between animals, but rather from feedstuffs containing tainted tissues from infected ruminants to healthy animals. Such cattle feeds have been prohibited in Sweden for many years, but as the affected cow was born in 1994 she might have been given such food in her early life.

The disease has been declining in the EU after restrictions and regulations were put in place or tightened following an epidemic of the disease in humans in the UK. In that outbreak 150 people died. 

Sweden has been considered a low-risk country. Ten previous tests have all proven to be false alarms.

A new report on the commercial &lt;a href="w%3Alogging"&gt;logging industry&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea"&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/a&gt; (PNG) released by international forestry organization, Forest Trends, shows that the overwhelming majority of current commercial industrial forestry operations in PNG are &lt;a href="w%3Aecology"&gt;ecologically&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3Aeconomy"&gt;economically&lt;/a&gt; unsustainable.

Foreign logging companies are in open defiance of the law and cutting down Papua New Guinea's &lt;a href="w%3Arainforest"&gt;rainforests&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to corruption and government inaction, the report alleges. &lt;a href="w%3AWashington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington&lt;/a&gt;-based environmental group, Forest Trends, linked &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;n loggers to Papua New Guinea's political elite. It described working conditions as "modern-day &lt;a href="w%3Aslavery"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;" and said forests were effectively being logged out.

While the PNG Government does have laws and regulations to ensure sustainable timber production, these were not being enforced, the report states. It identified "a political vacuum with no demonstrated government interest in controlling the problems in the sector."

The report summarised independent reviews of the timber industry between 2000 and 2005. Forest Trends claimed corruption had devastated rural living standards and ignored the basic rights of landowners: "There are a few logging operations in the country which are deemed beneficial to both local landowners and the country, but they are lost in a sea of bad operators. The Government needs to support these companies, or risk having the international community boycott all of PNG's exports."

Natural forests are being chopped down unsustainably, mostly by Malaysian companies, the organisation says.

It reports that much of the labour is imported, and says that Papua New Guineans are not getting an acceptable return for the logging while one of the country's precious natural resources is dwindling. Most of the timber is exported to &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, and is often turned into products for export to &lt;a href="w%3AWestern%20World"&gt;Western countries&lt;/a&gt;.

If foresting continues in this manner, they warn, Papua New Guinea could be bereft of its natural cover in a decade. 

"The system must be fixed," said Michael Jenkins, President &amp; CEO of Forest Trends. "The nexus between the logging companies and the political elite needs to be broken. One way to do this is to help local landowners better understand their rights and to establish a legal fund so that they can be defended. Papua New Guinea's legal system does exist outside of political control and the courts have a track record of ruling against illegal logging."

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
In an unanimous vote, the &lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;City of Buffalo&lt;/a&gt;'s Planning Board voted to table the Elmwood Village hotel Proposal, postponing voting on legislation for up to 30 days.

The Board said its decision was due to the lack of public involvement, saying that there have not been enough meetings.

The Elmwood Village Hotel is a proposed project by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and was designed by Karl Frizlen of The Frizlen Group. The hotel would be placed on Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo, New York. In order for the hotel to be built, at least five buildings, that include both businesses and residents, must be demolished.

The Forever Elmwood Corp. is a Buffalo-based non-profit organization founded in 1994. Justin Azzarella, the Executive Director for the organization voiced support for the proposal, stating: "I am here today to lend Forever Elmwood's support the hotel project. Particularly, Forever Elmwood is encouraged by the fact that this building follows the more stringent Elmwood Village Design Guidelines. We have been speaking with Savarino Construction, and they have promised us [Forever Elmwood] that they will engage the community further, including the surrounding Block Clubs and businesses. For that reason, while Forever Elmwood is in support of this project and the type of project that it is, we are asking also that the project be tabled so that the community can be further engaged. Specifically the surrounding Block clubs which include the Granger, Claremont, Asland and The Lincoln Parkway Block Clubs."

"Because of the excellent work that Karl does and the game plan that they have, I think its an ideal use of this particular location. I think that this particular type of development needs to be encouraged and promoted as opposed to roadblocked," said a man who owns five properties near the proposal site.

However, Evelyn Bencinich, a resident of Granger Place and whose house would be located directly behind the hotel said, "My property value will be depreciated or non-existent because no one is going to want to live behind a multi-story hotel. We are facing up to a year of noisy and dangerous demolition and construction. Children, pets and even drunk rebellers could wander on site and get hurt. Traffic tie-ups caused by large machinery and garbage bins is inevitable. Where will pedestrians walk? We could experience increased unsanitary flooding in our yards and basements due to the digging and cementing for the underground parking garage. Rats will be displaced into the immediate neighborhoods and be in great abundance. Once we get past the year of nightmare construction, what if you build it and they don't come? We could ultimately have a seven million dollar rooming house on our corner."

Patty Morris, co-owner of Don Apparel with Nancy Pollina at 1119 Elmwood also asked that the project be tabled saying, "this has only been public knowledge for less than two weeks and the public never saw the redesign. How can you vote on anything that no one has seen yet? The Board cut off Morris saying, "so specifically you don't have any problem with it [the design] you just..." Morris then said, "Oh I am totally against this project, but thats besides the point isn't it."

<h3>Planning board wants hotel smaller</h3>
The planning board is also concerned that the current design may still be too big.

At one point Board member Susan Curran Hoyt said, "we know you've cut down your number of rooms on this project, but we still see it doesn't seem to fit the description of a 'botique' hotel," and asked Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino Construction, "we wonder if you could reduce the rooms further."

"One thing I didn't talk about was the price levels of these rooms and that will be important to know. The room rate will be somewhere between US$120 and $160 a night, which is about the same price of the Hampton Inn down town and the smaller you make the hotel, the more expensive the rooms will get. We believe that we've made a good compromise in terms of the size of the hotel and perhaps botique means different things to different people," said Hassett. 

The board was also concerned that there is not enough parking asking, "are there alternative plans for valet parking off-site, in the event that you have a full hotel or a large event going on?"

"We are exploring several possibilities with respect to additional parking for valet and parking near-by," replied Hassett. "We are also exploring the possibility of using the rear of 1105 Elmwood for additional parking, which would give us an additional ten or eleven spaces."

The new design has a total of 55 parking spaces for 72 rooms, with 39 of them underground and the rest on ground level.

Hassett also said that a "parking study" will be done on the area.

Concerns that the second floor of the hotel will be too close to the property of 605 Forest were also brought up. The board asked how far the hotel would be from the property and Karl Frizlen replied saying it would "be approximately five feet from the property line," but he also admitted that, "I do not know exactly how close the house next door" will be from the hotel, but did say "I think the house is about four or five feet away from the property line and we [the hotel] sit right on the property line."

The board is concerned the setback from the property is not enough saying the space between the building and the hotel is "pretty narrow."

<h3>Common Council also tables hotel proposal</h3>
The City's Common Council also agreed to table the proposal also citing the need for more public engagement and the need for more organizations to respond including the Buffalo Preservation Board and the Office of Historic Preservation.

During that meeting, Hassett also said the proposal to try and get a variance to obtain the properties of 605 and 607 Forest were "now off the agenda."

The Common Council is expected to meet and hold a public hearing about the project and the rezoning of the properties to be demolished (1119-1121 Elmwood) on Tuesday March 7, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. in Council Chambers at City Hall. At the moment the properties are not zoned for a hotel.

Former leader of &lt;a href="Iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Saddam%20Hussein"&gt;Saddam Hussein&lt;/a&gt; has admitted before the court on Wednesday that he had ordered the trial of Shia Muslims, 148 of which were ultimately executed, as well as the 1982 raze on the farming village of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADujail"&gt;Dujail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after an assassination attempt by members of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADaawa"&gt;Daawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; party. During the raze, 1,500 residents were incarcerated and tortured, and over 1,000 square kilometers of land was destroyed. The town was rebuilt shortly after the attack.

The former leader defended his actions and suggested that the court should be trying him, and him alone. 

"I razed them... we specified the farmland of those who were convicted and I signed," he told the court. He later added, "If it was a crime to refer for trial those accused of shooting at the president, then try me and save a lot of trouble…"

"I am Saddam Hussein. I was in charge, and just because things have changed, I am not going to say someone else was responsible."

Chief prosecutor, Jaafar al-Moussawi, presented the court with documents and letters in an attempt to link Hussein to the trials and subsequent executions. The documents consisted of over 100 death certificates of villagers hanged after being convicted by the Revolutionary Court, which has been called an "imaginary trial" by the prosecution. The documents also contained transfer orders for families that were relocated to the desert. One document, apparently originating with the Iraqi secret service, said that close to fifty of the accused had died during interrogation. 

Defending his co-accused, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAwad%20al-Bandar"&gt;Awad al-Bandar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , Hussein stated, "I referred them to the revolutionary court according to the law. Awad was implementing the law, he had a right to convict and acquit."

His defense team indicated that he was Iraq’s president at the time and all actions were taken in accordance with Iraqi law. Nehal Bhuta, a legal expert for &lt;a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch"&gt;Human Rights Watch&lt;/a&gt; told ABC news, "What we saw today was not Saddam admitting guilt, but admitting to the fact that he acted in accordance with his official duties and powers." 

Both Hussein and his defense team remained subdued during the prosecution's testimony, a contrast with the often chaotic outbursts that eventually lead to Hussein and his lawyers refusing to return to court. 

The trial thus far has seen the deaths of two defense lawyers, the resignation of a the judge who first presided in the trial, and numerous complaints by human rights groups that a fair trial is impossible.

The trial, which began last October, has been adjourned until March 12th.

Announcing his plan to lead Thai Rak Thai candidates to sign up for the April 2 snap election on Thurday morning, Thaksin stated that it was business as usual in his role as now-caretaker Prime Minister. His intention is to address a rally this Friday at &lt;a href="w%3ASanam%20Luang"&gt;Sanam Luang&lt;/a&gt;, the location of last Sunday's protest.

An amateur sex video allegedly filmed in &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; using a mobile phone has become an Internet phenomenon. Various blogs are reporting that tens of thousands of Internet users are searching for the video, creating what bloggers call a "blogstorm". According to unconfirmed reports, the female in the video is "Tammy", a 17 year old student at &lt;a href="w%3ANanyang%20Polytechnic"&gt;Nanyang Polytechnic&lt;/a&gt; (NYP) in Singapore, and the male is her 21 year old boyfriend. The incident has stirred controversy, with many bloggers critical of the interest the video has attracted.

Terms such as "tammy nyp" and "tammy video" topped the list of search terms on &lt;a href="w%3ATechnorati"&gt;Technorati&lt;/a&gt;, a blog search engine, for days. Bloggers appear to be creating entries containing the terms to increase hits to their blogs. Domain names such as nyptammy.com have been registered, in an attempt to make money through advertising. Further, ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Malaysian%20Star"&gt;The Malaysian Star&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ (A major newspaper in a neighbouring country, &lt;a href="Malaysia"&gt;Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;) reported last week that a DVD version of the clips is available for sale on the streets of &lt;a href="w%3APenang"&gt;Penang&lt;/a&gt;.

It has been reported in the Singapore press that the female student in the video is currently undergoing counselling. The student has also lodged a complaint with the police, who are currently investigating the matter.

While it is unlikely that the culprits who uploaded the video will ever be caught, a warning must be sounded to people seeking to exploit this unfortunate incident. Under Singapore Law, bloggers who intentionally spread the "Tammy videos" are liable in &lt;a href="w%3Atort"&gt;tort&lt;/a&gt; to "Tammy".

Today will mark &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard's&lt;/a&gt; 10th anniversary holding what is arguably the most powerful office in Australia. John Howard is Australia's second longest serving Prime Minister, behind &lt;a href="w%3ARobert%20Menzies"&gt;Sir Robert Menzies&lt;/a&gt;.

Howard celebrated his decade in office last night at a gala dinner at &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Parliament%20House"&gt;Australian Parliament House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ACanberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;. Around 700 conservative supporters and business figures were present at the dinner.

Mr Howard gave a speech to his delegates, saying he was grateful to Australians for their support and promised to try not to abuse their trust. 

"I am deeply conscious of the trust that you have put in us and I am deeply grateful... for the privilege that has come our way," Mr Howard said. 

"We have tried not to abuse it and we will try in the future never to abuse it, because public life is the ultimate in terms of serving a nation and serving a community,” he said. 

&lt;a href="w%3APeter%20Costello"&gt;Peter Costello&lt;/a&gt;, Mr Howard's most likely successor gave a brief speech to the delegation saying "It's not just a wonderful 10th anniversary for the coalition government."

"There is another 10th anniversary that we ought to acknowledge tonight - it's the 10th anniversary of Labor in opposition," he said.

Despite many political commentators believing that Howard (now aged 66) will soon retire and hand the reins over to Peter Costello, Mr Howard told ABC radio, "I will remain in the position as long as my party wants me to."

Mr Howard also showed his support for his likely successor saying "If I were to go under a bus, the person who would and should become the leader of the Liberal party is Peter Costello. I am very careful crossing roads."

<h2>Little to celebrate - Opposition</h2>

The opposition has used the occasion to attack the government on its performance over the last ten years. Opposition leader, &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt; told a press conference on Wednesday that "On this 10th anniversary of the Howard government we find record foreign debt - more than twice what it was that John Howard inherited."

&lt;a href="w%3AWayne%20Swan"&gt;Wayne Swan&lt;/a&gt;, Shadow Minister for Family and Community Services, said the government's celebrations come at a time when Australians are paying too much tax. "Sadly, for the Australian people 10 years of the highest taxing Government in our history has given all of those taxpayers a much bigger hangover," he said

<h2>A turbulent political career</h2>

John Howard has had a turbulent political career, since first becoming elected as a Member of Parliament in 1974. He was treasurer under the &lt;a href="w%3AMalcolm%20Fraser"&gt;Malcolm Fraser&lt;/a&gt; government from 1977 until 1983, when it was defeated by &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Hawke"&gt;Bob Hawke&lt;/a&gt;.

Following the resignation of Fraser, Howard contested the Liberal Party leadership but was defeated by &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Peacock"&gt;Andrew Peacock&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being defeated as leader, Howard stayed on as deputy leader.

After being defeated by the incumbent &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; government of Bob Hawke, Peacock became nervous and attempted to protect his leadership by removing Howard from the deputy position. Howard restood for the position and won, putting Peacock in an uncomfortable position and prompting his resignation. This allowed Howard to succeed to the leadership unopposed.

Howard held the Liberal Party leadership from 1985 until 1989, when he was defeated in a leadership challenge by Peacock. Howard's support was weakend following a speech in which he claimed that the rate of Asian immigration into Australia was too high. Following his defeat Howard was relegated to the backbench for a short time before taking a position on the front bench again. When Peacock lost the 1990 election, the Liberal Party began to look for a young leader - electing &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Hewson"&gt;John Hewson&lt;/a&gt;. It was at this time that Howard conceded it unlikely he would ever be leader again. Howard himself compared the possibility of a political comeback to "Lazarus with a triple bypass".

After Hewson lost the 1993 election to Hawke's successor &lt;a href="w%3APaul%20Keating"&gt;Paul Keating&lt;/a&gt;, the Liberal Party again appointed a new leader, this time current foreign minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;. When Downer resigned in 1995, with deputy leader Peter Costello unwilling to step up, Howard was elected to power for the second time.

Howard's coalition government swept to power in 1996, holding 96 of the 148 seats in the House of Representatives ending 13 years of &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; governance. Howard led his government to comfortable victories in 1998, 2001 and 2004.

<h1>Bush's Katrina statement contradicted by emerging evidence</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Bush%27s%20Katrina%20statement%20contradicted%20by%20emerging%20evidence&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Recently emerging evidence seems to contradict a statement by &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="w%3A%20Hurricane%20Katrina"&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/a&gt;. He stated in an interview with ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AABC%20News"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ on September 1st that, "I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees".

One of the first items to emerge, a video obtained by the ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, shows footage of Bush during a video-conference received at his ranch in &lt;a href="w%3ACrawford%2C%20Texas"&gt;Crawford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, on August 29, 2005, 19 hours before landfall of Hurricane Katrina. During the briefing, Director of the &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Hurricane%20Center"&gt;National Hurricane Center&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3AMax%20Mayfield"&gt;Max Mayfield&lt;/a&gt; warned, "I don't think anyone can tell you with any confidence right now whether levees will be topped or not, but there is obviously a very, very great concern". 

In addition, Michael D. Brown, then director of the &lt;a href="w%3AFederal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency"&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/a&gt; (FEMA), reported that he had spoken with President Bush twice in the morning and that the president was asking about reports that the levees had been breached.

Brown would state later on ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ACNN"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; that, "There's no question in my mind he probably had those reports (about breaches in the levees), because we were feeding in the &lt;a href="w%3AHomeland%20Security%20Operations%20Center"&gt;Homeland Security Operations Center&lt;/a&gt;, into the &lt;a href="w%3AWhite%20House"&gt;White House&lt;/a&gt; sit room, all of the information that we were getting. So he had to have had that information. Plus, I think the president knew from our earlier conversations that that was one of my concerns, that the levees could actually breach".&lt;a href="http%3A//transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0603/02/sitroom.03.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

In July 2004, the Federal Emergency Management Agency completed an exercise called "Hurricane Pam", which, dealt with the scenario of a direct hit on New Orleans by a hurricane with 120 mph winds (a Category 3). It resulted in "10 to 20 feet of water within the City of New Orleans," according to January 24 congressional testimony by the president of the company that designed the Hurricane Pam exercise.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf%3F/base/news-4/1138086166226440.xml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

A report FEMA sent to the White House Situation Room on August 29th, they cited death and destruction anticipated by the "Hurricane Pam" exercise and warned that Katrina was likely to be worse. "Exercise projection is exceeded by Hurricane Katrina real-life impacts," they stated. Furthermore, "The potential for severe storm surge to overwhelm Lake Pontchartrain levees is the greatest concern for New Orleans. Any storm rated Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson (hurricane) scale will likely lead to severe flooding and/or levee breaching. This could leave the New Orleans metro area submerged for weeks or months".&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf%3F/base/news-4/1138086166226440.xml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

When the report was released, Hurricane Katrina was thought to be a Category 4 as of landfall (though after analysis, it's power at landfall would be downgraded to a Category 3).&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL122005_Katrina.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 

White House officials previously clarified Bush's earlier comment, saying that the president was referring to the hours after Katrina swept through and news reports as of August 30th suggested the city had "dodged a bullet", which led to surprise when reports reached them of the levee breaches.&lt;a href="http%3A//www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9179790/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.dod.gov/transcripts/2005/tr20050906-secdef3863.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Contrasting this was the August 30th broadcast of NBC's Today, NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams reported at 7:05 a.m. ET, "There has been a huge development overnight ... the historic French Quarter, dry last night and it is now filling with water. This is water from nearby Lake Pontchartrain; the levees failed overnight."&lt;a href="http%3A//mediamatters.org/items/200509080002%231"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

<h1>Interview with Usenet search sites targeted by the MPAA</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Interview%20with%20Usenet%20search%20sites%20targeted%20by%20the%20MPAA&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Last week, the &lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Picture Association of America&lt;/a&gt; (MPAA) announced it had launched seven lawsuits against operators of websites it claims had been "facilitating the distribution of copyright works".

In its announcement, the MPAA said it had commenced legal action against the following &lt;a href="w%3ABitTorrent"&gt;BitTorrent&lt;/a&gt; tracking sites: &lt;a href="w%3AisoHunt"&gt;isohunt.com&lt;/a&gt;, bthub.com, and torrentbox.com, which are all owned by the same person; torrentspy.com; niteshadow.com as well as ed2k site ed2k-it.com and &lt;a href="w%3AUsenet"&gt;Usenet&lt;/a&gt; search engines nzb-zone.com, binnews.com, and dvdrs.net.

Despite the announcement on its website and in the media, the MPAA has failed to notify the administrators of the sites involved directly. Joe from Binnews told Wikinews he only found out about the MPAA's actions after reading it on several news sites. He said, "At first, I double read the article making sure we were not being punk'd. But then I was shocked that we had to read about it publicly first. As of today (February 25), we have yet to get anything (from the MPAA)".

"Descds", an administrator of dvdrs.net told Wikinews that the first he knew of the action being taken against the site was when he was approached by the press and users of his site. He said, "We haven't been informed by the MPAA and quite frankly are outraged by the method they have adopted to file these lawsuits. In actual fact we would still be none the wiser had our members and members of the press not have contacted us."

"When we found out about the filed lawsuit we was first worried (after all we are only a small site with limited funds), then shocked and finally outraged. Had the MPAA contacted us anytime in the sites history regards their concerns we would have happily worked with them to gain a resolve," he said.

Descds also said that despite attempts to contact the MPAA he has received no response.

When asked by Wikinews how they felt about discovering the MPAA's lawsuits both administrators said they would have appreciated being notified before the announcement was made public.

Binnews told Wikinews, "We do feel they should have notified first. We do not even have a confirmation this is for real."

Dvdrs said, "We have stated many times had the MPAA personally contacted us we would have happily listened to their issues and acted accordingly. We are doing nothing wrong legally on our site and to be made look like an established piracy ring is an outrage. We have worked extremely hard on site to keep within international laws and they have publicly destroyed everything we have worked towards in the last two years. We are receiving negative PR and this is totally unacceptable."

Wikinews has discovered that both Binnews and dvdrs.net have procedures in place for dealing with alleged copyright infringement under the US &lt;a href="w%3ADigital%20Millenium%20Copyright%20Act"&gt;Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, both sites deny ever being contacted by any organisation with a "takedown" notice.

When asked if Binnews ever received a takedown notice, Binnews replied, "Nope, we have never received a notice from anyone. My cell phone is tied to the site, we have proper DMCA guidelines on the site and no one has contacted us."

When asked the same question, Dvdrs said, "No never. We would actively respond to any DMCA request quickly and efficiently. We fully support the law and would never try to evade anything within its scope. Had a DMCA been issued by any member, our site would have immediately deleted the offensive file."

When asked how they would deal with a DMCA takedown notice, Binnews said, "We would act quite quickly. An email sent to the alert system is tied into all of "staff" members, my cell phone and my email."

According to Dvdrs, they would be equally as compliant. "We would immediately delete the offending file on our server and conduct a thorough research into any files that may also be connected to the one mentioned. We would also respond to the request personally with a follow up email expressing our actions," they said.

Wikinews asked the administrators if they thought their sites were any different to conventional search engines like Google and Yahoo. Binnews replied, "No, you can go to any search engine and find just about anything."

Dvdrs also shares Binnews' position telling Wikinews, "No. We index what is already readily available on commercial, tax paying, US based registered companies hard drives. All we are doing is pointing to files not on our network, much the same way google or any search bot operates. We do not host these files and without the premium paid service of third parties our marked up text based XML files are useless. We have never hosted illegal files and only offer information."

Dvdrs has expressed that if the MPAA deems them illegal they should also target those who are actually hosting the files. Descds said, "We feel that should the MPAA deem us illegal then they must also target premium paid Usenet Providers who act as the transit for these files. Ironically both Easynews and Usenetserver offer both indexing and carrier for these files and yet have received no such lawsuits filed."

"We also find it ironic still that Newzbin, creators, instigators and promoters of the NZB format and un-arguably the biggest Usenet Indexing site in the world have received no lawsuits filed. We feel that we are being rail roaded and are not at all happy about it."

On the other hand, Binnews was surprised that the MPAA did not target ISPs and Usenet providers in the first instance. "Cut the head off and there is nothing for us to index and report on. If the ISPs acted in a proper manner and did what they are more than capable of, we would not be assisting people in combating piracy on their networks," they said.

Despite being outraged with the MPAA and its actions, Descds said that despite being outside of US juristiction he is happy to assist the MPAA in anyway necessary. "We would like it known for the record that we are actively trying to reach a resolve regards this action by the MPAA. We have contacted them and said openly many times we would welcome their input and act accordingly. Should they feel that NZBS are illegal we will remove those sections immediately and await a legal judgement on their legality. DVDRS is not a pirate network and to call us such has insulted our member base."

"I would also like it noted that although we host in the US i am actually a UK citizen who currently does not have to adhere to their communications and judgements. However, such is our resolve that I would happily comply should communication between us take place. We can offer little more to help this but hope that the MPAA retract their statement that we are an organised pirate network and restore our good name. Should the MPAA decide to not communicate with us and continue their legal actions we will instruct our attorneys and contact legal bodies like the EFF for help on this matter," he added.

Binnews also had this to say of the MPAA's lawsuit: "Binnews does not host any files, the claim that we read "BinNews.com offers files for over 3,000 movies" is 100% completely false. We do not host any files, never have and never will. We provide a legitimate service to copyright holders. No where on our site does it say, "join us, we can give you free movies." We do not even have pre-made nzb files."

<h2>History of binnews and dvdrs.net</h2>
Binnews started "as a way to monitor what is on usenet," according to Joe.

"Our intent is not and never has been to facilitate piracy. Its quite the opposite. We have several guides that explain how binnews can assist a company in getting rid of piracy," he said.

Dvdrs.net started out as a community site in March, 2004, where people could discuss movies they loved, and hated, offer help to people with home cinema issues, discuss games and basically befriend members. Descds said, "We have evolved several times and have always kept a keen eye on the laws of both local and international authorities."

Dvdrs.net adopted NZBs at users' request several months after the site was launched. Descds told Wikinews that the site had never been contacted by any legal representative to ask for the removal of NZB files.

"There has never been a law passed anywhere, as far as we are aware, that states NZB files are illegal to host. Had there been, we would have dropped them and continue with other aspects of our site. DVDRS is not all about indexing Usenet and has a very healthy community discussion group," he said.

The four week suspension of London Mayor &lt;a href="w%3AKen%20Livingstone"&gt;Ken Livingstone&lt;/a&gt; has been frozen by a High Court judge pending his appeal.

Ken Livingstone spoke out against the ruling, saying it had "been blown out of all proportion". He also attacked the newspaper group that owns the Evening Standard, around whose reporter the row has erupted.

"It is Associated Newspapers that has a long history of anti-Semitism and support for fascism. It welcomes the blackshirts in the 1930s and it has admitted that as recently as the retirement party of the last editor of the Daily Mail, two of its staff dressed in Nazi uniforms and were not asked to leave. Associated Newspapers has never apologised for this or for its record of support of fascism."

Mr Livingstone also responded to claims made in The Independent newspaper that there had been 11 anti-Semitic attacks following his comments, saying the CMA "in fact claimed there had been 11 ♡❤incidents♡❤ following my speech, in which the worst was an offensive letter to a member of Parliament".

As the &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n Prime Minister &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; celebrated his ten-year reign this week, &lt;a href="w%3ABob_Brown"&gt;Greens Leader Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; marked the 10th anniversary of his election into the Federal parliament.
Senator Brown has outlasted 10 other party leaders: &lt;a href="w%3AMeg%20Lees"&gt;Meg Lees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ACheryl%20Kernot"&gt;Cheryl Kernot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ANatasha%20Stott-Despoja"&gt;Natasha Stott-Despoja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Greig"&gt;Brian Greig&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AAndrew%20Bartlett"&gt;Andrew Bartlett&lt;/a&gt;, all former Democrat leaders. &lt;a href="w%3APauline%20Hanson"&gt;Pauline Hanson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ALen%20Harris"&gt;Len Harris&lt;/a&gt; of the One Nation party, plus the Australian Labor Party's &lt;a href="w%3AKim%20Beazley"&gt;Kim Beazley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3ASimon%20Crean"&gt;Simon Crean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AMark%20Latham"&gt;Mark Latham&lt;/a&gt; have all been and gone during that time.
Only Prime Minister John Howard and Senator Bob Brown are left standing as leaders in the &lt;a href="w%3AParliament%20of%20Australia"&gt;Australian Federal Parliament&lt;/a&gt;. Bob Brown was elected to the Senate in 1996, and re-elected in 2001. He has introduced bills for constitutional reform, forest protection, to block radioactive waste dumping, to ban mandatory sentencing, and greenhouse abatement.

Senator Brown says his party has hardly been in the balance of power at any stage, yet the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian_Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; have risen in popularity. "We've become the third major political party in the country and we're on our way to becoming a real power broker in this country and ultimately, the aim has to be becoming part of the Government of the country," he told ABC Radio. 

While there's perpetual media speculation over John Howard's possible retirement, Senator Brown says he's full of beans and ready for the next 10 years. "And there’s no speculation about me standing at next year’s election. I can’t wait," Senator Brown said. "Our election aim will be to rescue the Senate from the Howard government, and doubling our team is not beyond reality."

The &lt;a href="w%3ATasmanian_Greens"&gt;Tasmanian Greens&lt;/a&gt; senator predicts his party could govern the country one day. "We're on our way to becoming a real powerbroker in this country and ultimately the aim has to be becoming part of the government of the country," he said. 

The Greens started with Brown's entry into the Senate after the 1996 election, doubled to two senators in 2001, and has four had senators represented since 2004. 

The four Greens senators and their staff say they will celebrate with a chocolate cake – and 10 green candles. The government held a gala fundraising dinner in the Great Hall of Parliament on Wednesday night to celebrate Mr Howard's milestone. 

Senator Brown said the success of Prime Minister John Howard is in his ability to play on fears. "(Howard)... is able to "dig a little bit below surface to play on fears that people have. He has presided over a country where the rich have got richer much faster than the poor have seen their conditions improve," he said. "And it is a country that says if you are down on your luck, bad luck. The good Samaritan aspect which is very strong in this country, doesn't reside with this government."

Of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Federal Labor Party&lt;/a&gt; the Greens leader said they should move back to humanitarian politics He said Labor was trying to swing to the right but had lost its way. "I think the Opposition has lost its way and I think it is going to get worse," Senator Brown said. "The indications are that the Opposition thinks if it moves to the right it will do better," said Senator Brown.

Bob Brown is among 20 environmentalists, organisations and concerned citizens who were issued a 216 page writ by the Tasmanian-based timber company &lt;a href="w%3AGunns"&gt;Gunns Limited&lt;/a&gt; in December 2004. The woodchipping giant is sueing for a combined AU$6.3 million for actions it claims has damaged their business and reputation. The defendants say the case is 'industrial' style litigation, alleging conspiracy, interference with trade and business and defamation. Nine different campaigns are cited.

The date was changed to avoid conflicts with the 2006 &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Games"&gt;Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;. 

It is the third grand prix that has been raced at Bahrain, since it was completed in 2004. Last year's race was won by &lt;a href="w%3AFernando%20Alonso"&gt;Fernando Alonso&lt;/a&gt; of the Renault F1 Team, who went on to win the championship.

A bus crash outside of &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACusco"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;a href="Peru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt; has killed at least 13 people, police say. The bus hit a parked car as it was leaving &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMachu%20Picchu"&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , outside the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AInca%20Empire"&gt;Incan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; city of Cusco.

The bus then swerved out of control and crashed sideways.

Among the dead are tourists from &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chile"&gt;Chile&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. In addition there are reportedly up to 28 people injured, including a Chilean man who had previously been reported as dead. According to the police, one of the buses was a flat bed truck modified to fit more passengers, which are illegal in Peru.

According to a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20Department%20of%20State"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/a&gt; report, &lt;a href="w%3Acoca"&gt;coca&lt;/a&gt; growth is on the rise in &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Peru"&gt;Peru&lt;/a&gt;, and is a cause for concern. In a statement, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs said, "We are concerned about the inability thus far of Bolivia's new president to articulate whether or not he will allow coca eradication and U.S. counter-narcotics assistance to continue."

&lt;a href="w%3AEvo%20Morales"&gt;Evo Morales&lt;/a&gt; was elected President in December, 2005. At the time of his electoral victory, Morales claimed that he would support coca growth, but not for use in producing cocaine.

This puts Bolivia and Peru at risk of losing financial aid if they fail to meet international narcotics agreements, according to the U.S. State Department report. The report is part of the framework on which the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; establishes its list of major drug-trafficking and drug-producing countries.

Internet search giant &lt;a href="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; announced yesterday that it will move its servers hosting &lt;a href="http%3A//www.google.cn"&gt;Google.cn&lt;/a&gt; - aimed at &lt;a href="China"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; internet users - to the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. 

Until now the servers being in mainland China has forced Google to comply with the censorship policies of the &lt;a href="w%3APRC"&gt;PRC&lt;/a&gt; government. The reason for the move is that Google fears local officials could access the servers' search-data without the company's consent. According to Google, their policy of saving the IP addresses of its users is to gain more knowledge on how the search engine is used.

Google has been heavily criticized for agreeing to the censorship, but nonetheless admits that Chinese officials can also censor its contents through internet service providers, so refusing to remove pages from the search-index wouldn't be a solution. Google also underlines the fact that the service will let the user know when search results have been censored.

<h1>Five dead in attack in Pakistan</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Five%20dead%20in%20attack%20in%20Pakistan&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Two explosions near a US consulate in &lt;a href="w%3AKarachi"&gt;Karachi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3APakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; killed five and wounded more than fifty early Thursday morning. The explosions come just prior to &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="w%3AGeorge%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush's&lt;/a&gt; scheduled visit to the country. According to &lt;a href="w%3AForbes"&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt; report on the incident, Pakistani officials speculated that the attack was timed to coincide with Bush's visit.

According to police, a suicide bomber apparently hit the vehicle of a United States diplomat, detonating one of the explosions. It is not clear whether a subsequent explosion was another bomb or a vehicle explosion triggered by the initial blast.

The &lt;a href="w%3AKuwait%20News%20Agency"&gt;Kuwait News Agency&lt;/a&gt; (KUNA) reports that a hospital in the region has confirmed at least five persons were killed in the attacks, and over fifty more were injured, including a young &lt;a href="w%3AMorocco"&gt;Moroccan&lt;/a&gt; girl. According to the &lt;a href="w%3AAssociated%20Press"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, among the dead was a United States diplomat, a Pakistani official who worked at the consulate, a security guard for the consulate, and an unidentified woman. The driver of the car bomb is also presumed dead.

During a press conference in &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20Delhi"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AIndia"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, President Bush stated he would still travel to Pakistan despite the explosions, saying that: "Terrorists and killers are not going to prevent me from going to Pakistan. My trip to Pakistan is an important trip. It's important to talk with President Musharraf about continuing our fight against terrorists." Bush also expressed his condolences to the individuals lost in the attack during the conference.

The Pakistani news source GEO states that the first explosion occurred at 9:05 local time (0505 &lt;a href="w%3AUTC"&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;), with the second explosion occurring minutes afterwards. The explosions occurred at the parking lot of the &lt;a href="w%3AMarriott%20Hotel"&gt;Marriott Hotel&lt;/a&gt; in Karachi, about 60 feet (18 meters) from the consulate gate. Damage to the building as well as over ten nearby vehicles was also reported.

The Associated Press reports that the same consulate has been targeted twice in the recent past: an attack in 2002 left 14 Pakistanis dead, and in 2004 police defused a &lt;a href="w%3Atime%20bomb"&gt;time bomb&lt;/a&gt; before it was set to detonate.

Argentine President &lt;a href="w%3ANestor%20Kirchner"&gt;Nestor Kirchner&lt;/a&gt; asked &lt;a href="Uruguay"&gt;Uruguay&lt;/a&gt; to halt construction of pulp mills that bring up environmental concerns. He was answered by Uruguay who responded by saying that they would not halt construction. Uruguay Vice President &lt;a href="w%3ARodolfo%20Nin"&gt;Rodolfo Nin&lt;/a&gt; said, "♡❤The request made by the president of Argentina, which we have respectfully taken into account, is an impertinent request♡❤."

The mills are being built on the &lt;a href="w%3AUruguay%20River"&gt;Uruguay River&lt;/a&gt;, a river shared by both countries. The mills cost $1.7 billion to make. The construction has sparked protest in &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; by ordinary citizens. Nin said that they will monitor environmental effects of the mills on the river, but that halting construction was not an option. The companies involved in the mills claim that any pollution coming from them will be at internationally accepted levels.

However this is likely not over, as Kirchner claims that they might take the case to the &lt;a href="w%3AInternational%20Court%20of%20Justice"&gt;International Court of Justice&lt;/a&gt; in The Hague. Argentina is the shape of a circle which makes people confused. Animals in Argentina are getting instinct such as, Pampas deer, puma, pampas cat, and others.

A leaked draft of a report on instances of state repression during &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;'s "dirty war" has been called into question by top officials. The document will be officially published next month. Report author, Ignacio Carrillo, assigned to the task by President Fox, commented by saying, "He will have to render his report. It will be placed in an open, public place," and "that will be there for history, but legally it's over." This being a reference to the fact that the Supreme Court has ruled that it is too late to prosecute possible offenders.

Carrillo claims, however, that his report is similar to the recently leaked draft. He said, "It's not going to totally contradict the draft." The draft was published by a Mexican magazine, claiming that the public has a right to know. The basis for the report is recently declassified military documents from the years 1964 – 1982. Carrillo also claims that his work was hindered by resistance from the courts, bad resources, and people involved being unwilling to cooperate.

The &lt;a href="w%3ADirty%20War"&gt;Dirty War&lt;/a&gt; refers to the use of state terrorism in &lt;a href="w%3ALatin%20America"&gt;Latin America&lt;/a&gt; in a period from the 1960s to the 1980s, usually targeted at groups opposed to the government (usually leftist groups). Much controversy exists in the region about what is to be done with alleged offenders in the Dirty War.

The offices of &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;'s second largest TV and newspaper companies were raided simultaneously this morning by groups of masked police officers. The TV station was taken off the air for 13 hours, and the newspaper's press was damaged and its uncirculated copies burned. The Kenyan government is characterizing the incident as an evidence-gathering step of a national security investigation, in response to the paper and station's recent alleged publishing of false material to incite ethnic hatred and instability.

♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Standard%20%28Kenya%29"&gt;The Standard&lt;/a&gt;♡❤, Kenya's oldest daily newspaper, and the &lt;a href="w%3AKenya%20Television%20Network"&gt;Kenya Television Network&lt;/a&gt; (KTN), the paper's sister TV station, were the targets of the raid. The company that owns both outlets is the second largest media source in the country. The raid marks the first time the Kenyan government has shut down a major media outlet, and punctuates a period of increased media freedom in Kenya.

The CEO of ♡❤The Standard♡❤, Tom Mshindi, has reported that his staff was "roughed up" and intimidated during the raid. The raiders, wearing gas masks and driving unmarked vehicles, did not have a warrant and did not identify themselves as police, but a Standard staffer recognized the voice of a police commander among the raiding party. Later at a press conference, Internal Security Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Michuki"&gt;John Michuki&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged the raid occurred as part of a "state security" investigation. 

On Tuesday, February 28, three reporters from ♡❤The Standard♡❤ were arrested for publishing stories Saturday about an alleged secret meeting between Kenyan president &lt;a href="w%3AMwai%20Kibaki"&gt;Mwai Kibaki&lt;/a&gt;, and minister for the environment and deposed former foreign minister &lt;a href="w%3AKalonzo%20Musyoka"&gt;Kalonzo Musyoka&lt;/a&gt;, who has become an opposition figure to the president's policies, to resolve differences. Both Kibaki and Musyoka have denied having any such meeting.

The journalists are charged with "publishing false rumor with intent to cause alarm to the public", and have pleaded not guilty. The three were released on bail after their arraignment today.

Musyoka has expressed dismay at the government's actions, pointing out that there are standard legal recourses to such media actions that should be used, rather than a police attack.

KTN and ♡❤The Standard♡❤ have been increasingly critical of the president, who is seen by many as losing touch with the country.

♡❤The Standard♡❤ was able to repair presses and produced a special edition late in the day. KTN also returned to the air in the afternoon, showing footage of the ♡❤Standard♡❤ raid. Both outlets reportedly had equipment removed or damaged during the raids, including computers, security cameras, and a backup power supply.

&lt;a href="w%3APalestinian"&gt;Palestinian&lt;/a&gt; extremist group &lt;a href="w%3AHamas"&gt;Hamas&lt;/a&gt; has been invited to meet with representatives of the South African government. Hamas won the Palestinian legislative counsel elections of January 2006 by a landslide and is now faced with forming a government and strained ties to &lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and the United States, which classify it as a terrorist organization responsible for several suicide attacks.

The South African deputy foreign minister &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dfa.gov.za/department/profile_pahad.html"&gt;Aziz Pahad&lt;/a&gt; confirmed on Thursday that the country is preparing a meeting with the controversial group. According to Pahad South Africa wishes to share its experiences on the transformation from the &lt;a href="w%3AApartheid"&gt;Apartheid-era&lt;/a&gt; to democracy with the Palestinians and Israel. South Africa also sees it important to keep in contact with Hamas in the search for peace in the Middle East. Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spookesman said that there is no date for talks with South Africa yet. Israel criticized the South African invitation.

Russia has invited leaders of the Hamas for talks, which will begin on Friday. The Russian invitation was the first one after the elections of January 2006. However, Russia has put Hamas under pressure to recognize Israel and renounce violence. There have been talks between Hamas leaders and the Turkish foreign minister, &lt;a href="w%3AAbdullah%20Gul"&gt;Abdullah Gul&lt;/a&gt;. Another invitation for talks with Hamas came from Venezuela.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.mfa.gov.il/mfa"&gt;Israeli foreign ministry&lt;/a&gt; spokesman voiced his ministry's concerns that "giving legitimacy to an unreformed Hamas" could turn the movement "from a terrorist organization to a political party".

In an exhibition warmup to the &lt;a href="w%3A2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup"&gt;2006 FIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href="Costa%20Rica"&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="w%3ATehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="w%3AAzadi%20Stadium"&gt;Azadi Stadium&lt;/a&gt;. Iran built up a 3 goal lead in the first 34 minutes and never looked back. The final score was ♡❤♡Iran 3, Costa Rica 2♡❤♡.

&lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Karimi"&gt;Ali Karimi&lt;/a&gt; began by scoring in the 10th minute, &lt;a href="w%3AAli%20Daei"&gt;Ali Daei&lt;/a&gt; in the 16th, and &lt;a href="w%3AVahid%20Hashemian"&gt;Vahid Hashemian&lt;/a&gt; in the 34th.

This June, both teams will be in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; to compete in the finals of the FIFA World Cup. Costa Rica have been drawn in Group A, while Iran are in Group D.

The No. 1 ranked &lt;a href="w%3ADuke_University"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; Blue Devils lost to the unranked &lt;a href="w%3AFlorida_State%23School_Athletics"&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; Seminoles 79-74 at FSU.

The loss drops the Blue Devils to 27-2 (14-1 in the &lt;a href="w%3AAtlantic_Coast_Conference"&gt;ACC&lt;/a&gt;) while FSU improves to 18-8 (8-7 in the ACC).

The Seminoles were led by Al Thornton, who was 15 for 16 at the freethrow line and scored 26 points in 36 minutes of play. Alexander Johnson brought in 22 points for FSU, shooting 10 of 13 at the line and bringing in 13 rebounds.

Senior J.J. Redick led the Blue Devils with 30 points, including 4 three point shots, and fellow senior Shelden Williams had 20 points and 16 rebounds. 

Florida State fans swarmed the court with 1.7 seconds left to play, when the team was ahead 77-72. Duke coach Mike Krzyzweski sent all but the 5 Blue Devil players on the court to the locker room. The Seminoles were assessed a team technical foul, and Redick shot two free throws before play commenced. 

This marks Duke's first ACC loss of the season. In an earlier matchup, Duke narrowly escaped FSU at Cameron Indoor Stadium 97-96 in overtime.

The discovery, found in &lt;a href="w%3AMagallanes"&gt;Magallanes&lt;/a&gt;, could mean less dependence on foreign energy, specifically natural gas imported from &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;. Currently Chile imports 97 percent of its natural gas and 98 percent of its &lt;a href="w%3APetroleum"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt;. Magallanes has been an important producer of gas in the past, but resources were thought to have been exhausted until this discovery.

Lagos was interviewed by the local Radio W, where he said that the discovery could help them meet consumption of natural gas in the country, as well as help Methanex, a &lt;a href="w%3Amethanol"&gt;methanol&lt;/a&gt; company that has had difficulty finding enough natural gas for import. The situation has caused Lagos to have Chile's state owned gas company, ENAP, build a plant for conversion of liquid gas. In addition, they have considered importing natural gas from &lt;a href="Bolivia"&gt;Bolivia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago"&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="w%3ANational%20Liberation%20Army%20%28Colombia%29"&gt;National Liberation Army&lt;/a&gt; (ELN), a rebel group in &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, has agreed to a truce for the upcoming congressional elections after attending government-sponsored peace talks, held in &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; beginning in December. ELN representative Antonio Garcia says that the group wants Colombians to be able to vote undisturbed on March 12. According to Reuters, in some previous elections the ELN has attacked security personnel and kidnapped international observers. Some human rights groups are concerned that paramilitary groups might try to influence the vote with intimidation.

The ELN is the second largest rebel group in Colombia. The larger, &lt;a href="w%3AFARC"&gt;FARC&lt;/a&gt;, shares with ELN their &lt;a href="w%3AMarxism"&gt;Marxist&lt;/a&gt; ideology, but has continued attacks. Some analysts suggest that ELN is losing its will to fight and military capacity, while the FARC is still large. ELN has been damaged by illegal paramilitary groups, and the &lt;a href="w%3AColombian%20army"&gt;Colombian army&lt;/a&gt;. According to military officials, ELN still has around 5,000 fighters.

Following elections, there plans for further peace talks in Cuba in April. Garcia has said, "The ELN ... expresses its desire for peace and ... will not realize a single military action that could affect election day March 12." Currently Garcia has not announced a truce for the presidential election on May 28. One of their major concerns is to get recognition as a political organization, rather than as a terrorist group.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Authorities%20impose%20vehicle%20ban%20on%20Baghdad&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

As of Friday, March 3, police will be ordered to confiscate any private vehicle on the roads of &lt;a href="w%3ABaghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; during a day-time vehicle ban. The restrictions come on top of the regular night time curfew, which ends at 6 AM, when the new curfew will kick in. Despite the traffic ban, people may walk on foot to their local mosques for Friday prayers. 

The curfew is part of the efforts by the Iraqi government to combat escalating violence after the bombings of the golden mosque of Sammarra on the 22nd of February. According to the BBC at least 400 people have died in the violence following the assault on the &lt;a href="w%3AShi%27a%20Islam"&gt;Shia&lt;/a&gt; shrine; the Arab network &lt;a href="w%3AAl-Jazeera"&gt;Al-Jazeera&lt;/a&gt; estimates this number to be at least 500. 

The security situation in the country as a whole has greatly deteriorated since the attack that triggered a wave of violence between the &lt;a href="w%3AShiite"&gt;Shiite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASunni"&gt;Sunni&lt;/a&gt; Muslim groups. The Iraqi administration fears that clerics might encourage violence during the day's Friday prayer, and interim prime minister &lt;a href="w%3AIbrahim%20al-Jaafari"&gt;Ibrahim al-Jaafari&lt;/a&gt; made an appeal on Iraqi TV for the religious leaders, asking them to "express themselves in the language of national unity."

<h1>2006 &quot;Stolenwealth&quot; Games to confront Commonwealth Games in Melbourne</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=2006%20%26quot%3BStolenwealth%26quot%3B%20Games%20to%20confront%20Commonwealth%20Games%20in%20Melbourne&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

The possibility of large-scale protests in the face of the 3,000 journalists covering the &lt;a href="w%3AMelbourne%20Commonwealth%20Games%202006"&gt;Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;, has event organisers and the Government worried. 

The group "&lt;a href="http%3A//www.blackgst.com/"&gt;Black GST&lt;/a&gt;" - which represents Indigenous Genocide, Sovereignty and Treaty - are planning demonstrations at prominent Games events unless the Government agrees to a range of demands including an end to Aboriginal genocide, &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Aboriginal%20Sovereignty"&gt;Aboriginal Sovereignty&lt;/a&gt; and the signing of a treaty.

The Black GST say they hope the focus of the world's media will draw attention to the plight of indigenous Australians during the Games. Organisers say supporters are converging from across Australia and from overseas. Organisers say up to 20,000 people may take part in talks, rallies, colourful protests and many cultural festivities designed to pressure the Federal Government on Indigeneous rights issues. They want the Government to provide a temporary campsite for the supporters, saying "organised chaos was better than disorganised chaos."

The 2006 Stolenwealth Games convergence, described by organisers as the "cultural festival of the 2006 Commonwealth Games," was virtually opened on March 2nd with the launch of the official &lt;a href="http%3A//www.stolenwealthgames.com/"&gt;"Stolenwealth Games"&lt;/a&gt; website. Scoop Independent News and Perth Indymedia reported that the launch was held at Federation Square in Melbourne. The site contents were projected via wireless laptop by the Stolenwealth Games General Manager, and a tour of the website was given on the big screen. He said "overwhelming amusement was the response from the audience." The group say permanent access points to the website are being set up at public internet facilities across Victoria during the coming weeks. 

<h3>Support</h3>
"Interest in the Stolenwealth Games is building all over the world and this fresh, exciting and contemporary site will draw in people from Stolenwealth Nations around the globe to find out about the latest news and events," said a Stolenwealth Games spokesperson. "We have been getting many requests from around the world wanting to know about the Stolenwealth Games. We have provided many ways that individuals and organisations can support the campaign by spreading the word."

The Victorian Traditional Owner Land Justice Group (VTOLJG) which represents the first nation groups of Victoria, has announced its support to boycott the 2006 Commonwealth Games until the Government "recognises Traditional Owner rights." The group asserts that culture has been misappropriated in preparation for the Games.

Organisers of the campaign say they welcome the formal support from the Traditional Owners. "While some seek to divide and discredit Indigenous Australia, this support is further evidence that the Aboriginal people are united in opposition to the ongoing criminal genocide that is being perpetrated against the Aboriginal people" said Black GST supporter and Aboriginal Elder, Robbie Thorpe. 

"We now have endorsement from the VTOLJG and the &lt;a href="w%3AAboriginal%20Tent%20Embassy"&gt;Aboriginal Tent Embassy&lt;/a&gt; for the aims and objectives of the Campaign and we are looking forward to hosting all indigenous and non-indigenous supporters from across Australia in March," he said. The Black GST group have said "the convergence will be held as a peaceful, family-focussed demonstration against genocide, and for the restoration of sovereignty and the negotiations towards a Treaty."

But the campaign has received flak in mainstream media, such as Melbourne's Herald Sun, who wrote: ♡❤"the proposal to allow BlackGST to set up an Aboriginal tent embassy at a site well away from the Commonwealth Games will be interpreted by some as the State Government caving in to a radical protest group. A major concern for the Government... is to protect the event from disruption... no chances should be taken..."♡❤

<h3>"Games Management Zones"</h3>
The Black GST has been planning the convergence for months, calling for Aboriginal people and their supporters to converge on Melbourne. The Melbourne-based Indigenous rights group have called on thousands of people concerned about the plight of indigenous Australians to converge on Melbourne during the Games, which they have dubbed "the Stolenwealth Games". But the choice of Kings Domain has made conflict almost inevitable, as the area is one of the areas gazetted by the State Government as a "Games management zone".

Under the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.activistrights.org.au/CommonwealthGamesLaws.asp"&gt;Commonwealth Games Arrangements Act&lt;/a&gt;, any area gazetted as a management zone is subject to a range of specific laws - including bans on protesting, creating a disturbance and other activities. The protest bans will be in effect at different times and places, and offenders can be arrested. 

A spokeswoman for the Black GST, which advocates peaceful protest, said the site had been chosen because it was close to where the Queen will stay on March 15. "We figured that she is only in Melbourne for 27 hours or something like that so we thought we would make it easy for her to come next door and see us," she said. "We are a very open, welcoming group, so she will be welcome to come and join us." 

Kings Domain is the burial site for 38 indigenous forefathers of Victoria. Black GST elder, Targan, said trade union groups have offered to install infrastructure at the site. The group initially worked with the State Government to find a suitable camp site, but the relationship broke down when the Government failed to meet a deadline imposed by the protesters. "While we are disappointed the ministers were not able to meet deadline on our request, we thank them for their constructive approach towards negotiations and the open-door policy exercised," said Targan. 

A spokesman for Games Minister Justin Madden said the Government was still investigating other sites. Victoria Police Games security commander Brendan Bannan said he was not convinced the Black GST represented the views of most indigenous people. "We are dealing with the Aboriginal community and they don't seem to support it at all … the wider Aboriginal community don't support disruption to the Games at all," he said. 

The Government was told that Black GST supporters would camp in Fitzroy Gardens and other city parks should it fail to nominate a site. A spokesman for Aboriginal Affairs Minister Gavan Jennings said the Government was taking the issue seriously, but had not been able to finalise a campsite before the deadline. 

Under special Games laws, people protesting or causing a disturbance in "Games management zones" can be arrested and fined. While prominent public spaces such as Federation Square, Birrarung Marr, Albert Park and the Alexandra Gardens fall under the legislation, such tough anti-protest laws cannot be enforced in the nearby Fitzroy Gardens.

Games chairman Ron Walker has urged the group to choose another date for its protest march through the city, which is currently planned to coincide with the opening ceremony on March 15. The group believes that an opportunity to gain attention for indigenous issues was lost at the Sydney Olympics and has vowed to make a highly visible presence at the Games.

<h3>Sacred Flames</h3>
The Black GST said the Australian Aboriginal Tent Embassy's sacred flame, burning over many years at the Canberra site will be carried to Melbourne before the Games, and its arrival would mark the opening of the protest camp from where a march will proceed to the MCG before the Opening Ceremony. 

Black GST claims supporters from all over Australia, including three busloads from the West Australian Land Council, will gather in Melbourne during the Games for peaceful protests.

Aboriginal Affairs Minister Gavin Jennings had offered Victoria Park to the protesters. Victoria Park, former home of Collingwood Football Club, where one of the strongest statements of Aboriginal pride, when St Kilda star Nicky Winmar in 1993 raised his jumper and pointed to his bare chest after racial taunts from the Collingwood crowd.

Black GST, which has labelled the Games the Stolenwealth Games, said the State Government had failed to find a suitable venue. Black GST may encourage protesters to camp in prominent parks such as Fitzroy Gardens and Treasury Gardens. Graffiti supporting the action has also appeared in central Melbourne.

Melbourne City councillor Fraser Brindley has offered his home to the Black GST organisers. "I offered my home up to people who are organising visitors to come to the Games," he said. Cr Brindley will be overseas when the Commonwealth Games are held and has offered the free accommodation at his flat at Parkville. He said he agreed with the protesters' view that treaties needed to be signed with indigenous Australians. "I'm offering it up to the indigenous people who are coming to remind Her Majesty that her Empire took this land from them," said Cr Brindlley. Nationals leader Peter Ryan said: "This extremist group has no part in the Australian community." Melbourne councillor Peter Clarke said the actions were embarrassing and that he would try to discourage him. "It's not in the spirit of the Games," he said.

Aboriginal elder, Targan, said the possibility of securing Victoria Park was delightfully ironic. "There's a lot of irony going on," Targan, 53, a PhD student at Melbourne University, said. "GST stands for Genocide, Sovereignty and Treaty. We want the genocide of our people to stop; we want some sovereignty over traditional land, certainly how it is used, and we want a treaty with the government," Targan said.

The &lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n foreign minister, &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlexander%20Downer"&gt;Alexander Downer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , has confirmed that Australia will not export &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Auranium"&gt;uranium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; while it is not a signatory of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (NPT). The confirmation was prompted by a recently announced agreement between India and the United States involving the sale of civilian nuclear technology.

"Well our policy has developed over many years, going right back to the time of the Fraser Government actually, our policy has been that we would only export uranium to countries that are signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," Mr. Downer said in an interview on today's AM radio programme.

Mr. Downer also said that the Australian government was disappointed when India and &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; developed nuclear weapons, but supports the new &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; deal with India as an attempt to engage with India and "open up their civilian nuclear industry to &lt;a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency"&gt;International Atomic Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; inspectors."

"We've considered very carefully over the last few months the American proposal for this agreement that &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;President Bush&lt;/a&gt; has signed with the Indians, and our view about it is that it's a good step forward in what's been a difficult situation," Mr. Downer said.

The &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Labor%20Party"&gt;Australian Labor Party&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (ALP) supported the government's stance on exporting uranium to non-NPT countries. "Any future agreement to export to India must be dependent on India becoming a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the negotiation of a bi-lateral agreement ensuring that Australian uranium is only used for peaceful purposes," they said in a press release.

<h3>US-India agreement</h3>

The deal between the two countries involves the US supplying civilian nuclear technology to India, in exchange for money and a promise to open some reactors for inspection. India has said it will reclassify 14 of its 22 nuclear reactors as being for power generation only, which will allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAFA) to inspect them.

In a press briefing, National Security Advisor Steve Hadly said that the agreement would bring India "into the international non-proliferation mainstream", including "placing its civilian nuclear facilities and programs under IAEA safeguards, and also harmonizing its export control lists with those of the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Suppliers%20Group"&gt;Nuclear Suppliers Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMissile%20Technology%20Control%20Regime"&gt;Missile Technology Control Regime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ." The deal stops short of normalising India's nuclear status; however it is not clear that this could occur without a complete renegotiation of the NPT, or an abandonment of nuclear weapons by India.

The director of the IAEA, &lt;a href="Mohamed%20ElBaradei"&gt;Mohamed ElBaradei&lt;/a&gt;, called India "an important partner in the non-proliferation regime".

<h3>Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)</h3>

The NPT permits 5 states to own nuclear weapons: &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; (signed 1992), the &lt;a href="China"&gt;People's Republic of China&lt;/a&gt; (1992), the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ASoviet%20Union"&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1968; obligations and rights assumed by &lt;a href="Russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; (1968), and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; (1968). All other signatories have agreed that they will not seek nuclear weapons technology. 187 sovereign nations are currently signed on to the NPT; however India, Pakistan, and &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; have not. India and Pakistan possess nuclear weapons, and Israel is suspected of possession of nuclear weapons.

<h3>Uranium exports</h3>

Australia has 30% of the world's available uranium. According to the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AUranium%20Information%20Centre"&gt;Uranium Information Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , from 2000 to 2005 Australia exported 46,600 tonnes of uranium, to the value of over &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 2.1 billion. Australia currently exports to the USA, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, France, the United Kingdom, &lt;a href="Sweden"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;. Exports are for electricity generation only, in accordance with the NPT.

Quoting Theodore Roosevelt, who said that we must do “the greatest good, for the greatest number,” Harold A. Schaitberger, of The International Association of Fire Fighters, (IIAF), announced that the his organization was joining the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, (TRCP). 

In a press release, Schaitberger, who is IIAF General President, said, "I’m proud to announce that, along with a number of our sister unions in the Building Trades, the Machinists and others, we, (the IIAF), are joining the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership (TRCP), and will be rolling out its programs and benefits for your enjoyment over the coming weeks."

Praising the TRCP as, "an organization that focuses its efforts solely on conserving, maintaining and enhancing access to land and water available for Americans to enjoy their interests in hunting, fishing and shooting," Schaitberger explained that the IIAF is also, working with (the TRCP) to extend this program to our Canadian members." 

Schaitberger explained that the TRCO, "is founded in the spirit of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States, and an avid outdoorsman who believed, “There can be no greater issue than that of conservation in this country..."

Schaitberger also shared plans for his member workers unions, in the IIAF will "initiate a union-focused sportsman club that will have its own magazine, web site, radio show (in addition to the television shows already in production) and affinity programs to promote union-made products and equipment and offer discount merchandise and trips." 

The IIAF General President indicated that this state "greatest good for the greatest number" statement, "is a guiding principle of TRCP. It is a guiding principle of this IAFF. And together, we hope it will do some good for you as you enjoy the outdoors."
The IIAF web site is located at http://www.iiaf.org

The TRCP is a non-profit organization who's web site says is, "driven by a Board of Directors and a Policy Council made up of leaders from many of the country’s top hunting, fishing and conservation groups. We have a national focus on access and conservation issues affecting hunting and angling and are supported by our own nationwide network of over 90,000 sportsmen and women and more than 1,400 affiliated local and state-level clubs and organizations, that themselves represent nine million Americans."

&lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;i bloggers have been reporting this week that the Pakistani government has started blocking local access to the blogging tool Blogger.com. Blogger.com, along with its companion domain blogspot.com, is one of the most widely used blogging tools in Pakistan. Because of the government's decision to block the site, many Pakistani bloggers are now unable to update their blogs.

Bloggers are debating whether the move by the Pakistani government is a sign of a long-term online censorship campaign, or a temporary move to prevent potentially embarrassing blog coverage of &lt;a href="U.S."&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; President &lt;a href="George%20W.%20Bush"&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;'s visit to the country this weekend.

"Truth is — it may have very little to do with Bush's visit," writes &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n blogger Neha Viswanathan on the Global Voices email list, run by the &lt;a href="w%3ABerkman%20Center%20for%20Internet%20%26amp%3B%20Society"&gt;Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="w%3AHarvard%20Law%20School"&gt;Harvard Law School&lt;/a&gt;. "The anti-Bush protest has hardly found a voice online. I really do think this might be the first of other blocks. This might be on a very experimental basis to see how far they go. The Pakistani govt has hardly had any dialogue with bloggers at all. "

"The other theory is of course the one on Danish cartoons- which is likely," she continues. "But there is so much content on that outside of the blogosphere (the limited one at Blogspot) that it doesn't' seem to fit together. I wouldn't be surprised if the govt of Pakistan comes up with an IT censorship policy."

Other bloggers see a more direct connection with the Bush visit. "I have communicated with several bloggers and friends back in Pak[istan]," writes &lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt;-based Pakistani blogger Omer Alvie. "So far there's no resolution to this problem. Bush's visit in Pakistan is resulting in protests, a strike in Lahore and curfew areas in Islamabad. The feeling among bloggers is this is all rather suspect. Neha, might be right this might be on experimental basis. I feel this a a [♡❤sic♡❤] precursor to what the government can do in the future."

To date, the Pakistani government has offered no comment on the decision to block online access to Blogger.com.

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;n swimmer &lt;a href="w%3AIan%20Thorpe"&gt;Ian Thorpe&lt;/a&gt; is reported to be feeling much better after suffering from chest pain for some time.

The &lt;a href="w%3AOlympic"&gt;Olympic&lt;/a&gt; gold medalist was due to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the &lt;a href="w%3ACommonwealth%20Games"&gt;Commonwealth Games&lt;/a&gt;, but due to his complaints his fitness has been in doubt. He has been unable to take the drugs needed to overcome his pain as they are banned from the Games.

Thorpe told the media Thursday "It's actually the best I've felt in a while; the &lt;a href="w%3Aantibiotic"&gt;antibiotic&lt;/a&gt;s are starting to work."

A sticker for the Pensacola, Florida &lt;a href="w%3Afolk-punk"&gt;folk-punk&lt;/a&gt; band &lt;a href="w%3AThis%20Bike%20Is%20A%20Pipe%20Bomb"&gt;This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb&lt;/a&gt; was found on a bike near the &lt;a href="w%3AOhio%20University"&gt;Ohio University&lt;/a&gt;'s Oasis restaurant by a university police officer.

The university police, who were unaware of the band's existence, summoned the Columbus police bomb squad, who destroyed the bike to ensure that there was no bomb inside. The university later discovered their error.

The bike's owner, a graduate student, has been charged with "inducing panic," a misdemeanor. He has been released and is due to appear in court March 13 on the charge.

The band's label, &lt;a href="w%3APlan-It-X%20Records"&gt;Plan-It-X Records&lt;/a&gt;, has not yet commented on the incident. The font and style of the sticker are common among such humorous stickers.

The &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Jose%2C%20California"&gt;San Jose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; fire department and Hazardous Materials crews today responded to a chemical emergency at a &lt;a href="w%3AJDS%20Uniphase"&gt;JDS Uniphase&lt;/a&gt; manufacturing facility. The incident, at 80 Rose Orchard Drive, off North First St., sent between 15 and 17 people, including two firefighters, to the hospital with symptoms and for observation. 

Those exposed to the hazard reported a smell of "burnt rubber", along with symptoms of eye and throat irritation. 

Over 48 others were held in a nearby building while the incident was assessed. Rose Orchard Way was closed for much of the day while emergency crews responded. Estimates put the incident at about 10 a.m. (1800 UTC). 

As of 6 p.m. television news reports, authorities still had not determined the source or nature of the chemical, but said neighboring buildings were not in danger. 

JDS Uniphase manufactures fiber optic communications and test equipment, and was formed from a merger of JDS FITEL and Uniphase Corporation in 1999.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABuffalo%2C%20New%20York"&gt;Buffalo, New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — 
The Common Council requested on Tuesday that a picture be found on what many thought was the site of a previous hotel.

The Proposed Elmwood Village Hotel would be placed on the intersection of Elmwood and Forest. It was suspected by residents and business owners in the area that hotel once stood in the same spot.

The Elmwood Village hotel is a proposed development by Savarino Construction Services Corp. In order for the project to proceed, at least five buildings (1119-1121 Elmwood) would need to be demolished. All five houses are currently occupied by businesses and residents.

After some research, a freelance journalist writing for ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ was able to determine that there was never a hotel on the proposed Elmwood Village Hotel site. However; there was a temporary hotel located on the northeast corner of Elmwood and Forest.

Buffalo was the host of the &lt;a href="w%3APan-American%20Exposition"&gt;Pan-American Exposition&lt;/a&gt; from May 1 until November 2, 1901. It was a fair designed to feature the latest in technology, including electricity. There was a midway, athletic events, and had African, Eskimo, and Mexican villages. However; what is likely the most famous event that took place at the exposition was the assassination of then President &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20McKinley"&gt;William McKinley&lt;/a&gt; on September 6, 1901. He was shot by &lt;a href="w%3ALeon%20Czolgosz"&gt;Leon Czolgosz&lt;/a&gt; just outside the Temple of Music and died eight days later while in the home of John Milburn on Delaware Avenue in Buffalo. Just a short time later, Theodore Roosevelt was inaugurated on September 14, 1901 at the Wilcox House on Delaware Avenue in Buffalo. Nearly eight million people attended the exposition.

During that time several hotels and rooming houses were built around the exposition including The Elmwood at 717 Elmwood, the Hotel Elmhurst at Forest and Lincoln Parkway, Hotel Gibbs 1005-1021 Elmwood, the R. Palmerton Merritt at 441 Forest and The Norman at 422 Forest. None of these hotels or rooming houses exist today.

Probably the most famous hotel that was built during the exposition was the Statler's Pan-American Hotel built by &lt;a href="w%3AEllsworth%20Milton%20Statler"&gt;Ellsworth Milton Statler&lt;/a&gt; A freelance journalist writing for ♡❤Wikinews♡❤ has obtained the only known reproduction photo of the hotel [pictured at the top]. The hotel stood on the northeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo, had 2,100 sleeping rooms and accommodations for 5,000. At the time, the Statler was the largest hotel [based on the number of rooms] ever constructed. It was also the largest temporary hotel. It was three stories high, plastered on the inside, made mostly of wood and was covered with ornamental staff on the outside, which made it semi-fireproof. Every room was an outside room and was well lighted and ventilated. It was located within one block of the exposition's main entrance.

The Statler was built for only one thing, the exposition. Work began in 1900 and finished just before the beginning of the exposition. When the exposition ended in November, the hotel was taken down.

Maps from 1894 show that there was no hotel, let alone any buildings or houses on the intersection. However; research did show that the homes 1119-1121 Elmwood, the buildings that would be demolished to build the Elmwood Village Hotel, were built sometime before 1915 but were not on the intersection prior to 1902.

Based on research conducted at the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bechs.org/"&gt;Buffalo Historical Society&lt;/a&gt;, it was concluded that between the years of 1890 and 1902, no other major hotel existed in the area. In fact, research had shown that almost every hotel built in the area, existed only during the time of the exposition. 

Research also indicated a hotel or a rooming house at 1089 Elmwood around 1901-1903. The only known name of the hotel was the John C. Hill Hotel. The hotel was in the house now called the Atwater House. The house was the first house to be built on the east side of the block.

The Atwater House is currently vacant and owner Pano Georgiadis wants to demolish it to expand his restaurant. The house was built by 1894 and the original owner and builder of the house is currently unknown. Its earliest known occupant was Edward Atwater who in 1862 founded the oil refinery company of Atwater &amp; Hawes in Buffalo. The site of this company was recently uncovered in the Canal District during an archeological dig. 

At the moment, current research does not show any connection between the two men.

<h3>Statler's Pan-American Hotel was financially unsuccessful</h3>
The exposition was a commercial failure and what profit Statler did make on the hotel, went to build another temporary hotel for the 1904 St. Louis Exhibition. That hotel was successful and the profit made from it was used to build the first permanent Statler Hotel at 107 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo. The hotel is no longer in operation, but small offices are currently operating in parts of the building.

62 Clendon Rd Toorak, Victoria was the address of &lt;a href="John%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt;'s 10 year celebration as scores of Invited guests ranging from fellow &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Liberla%20Party"&gt;Liberal Party&lt;/a&gt; members to the business elite. Yet scores of onlookers without a &lt;a href="w%3AAU%24"&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;10,000 per table invitation had something different to say about &lt;a href="w%3APrime%20Minister%20of%20Australia"&gt;Prime Minister&lt;/a&gt; as they staged a counter party.

Unionists and members of the local Melbourne community chanted at the arriving Prime Minister and other politicians in attendance about the lack of access Australians have to the political process in Australia. John Howard's white ambassadorial sedan headed a convoy that was egged and surrounded before entering the Myer Family's estate. A tarpaulin was laid on the road in-front of the entrance which read "Raise funds for the needy, not the greedy" and "Howard: unforgivable, lies".

The media watched on as a congregating crowd shared pizza and engaged in a game of cricket, as a parody of John Howard's bowling attempts in a mid-2005 game with troops deployed overseas. A couple of people arrived suited up in black after messages had been circulating asking people to attend the counter-party in formal attire.

Police cordoned off a path leading up as guests arrived at which point most people left. One police officer was targeted and heckled by protestors and the media as he was not wearing identification after being involved in man-handling one middle-aged man away from the scene.

No injuries occurred and no arrests were made.

The &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; Pentagon, under court orders, has released the names of hundreds of Guantánamo detainees.

An Associated Press request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) brought about the release of the information, but the U.S. military is not being cooperative in doing so. The Pentagon has released 6,000 pages of documents on a website. 

The documents are the transcripts of Combatant Status Review Tribunals of 500 detainees. The transcripts were released in June 2005 in response to an Associated Press FOIA request, but with the names blacked out.

Last June, &lt;a href="w%3ABlack%20Box%20Voting"&gt;Black Box Voting&lt;/a&gt; successfully sued &lt;a href="w%3APalm%20Beach"&gt;Palm Beach&lt;/a&gt; county, &lt;a href="Florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; for their audit record of the 2004 presidential election. The organization, which opposes most current electronic voting initiatives, examined the machines logs and recently released a report of their findings.

Black Box Voting claims that "The internal logs of at least 40 &lt;a href="w%3ASequoia"&gt;Sequoia&lt;/a&gt; touch-screen voting machines reveal that votes were time and date-stamped as cast two weeks before the election, sometimes in the middle of the night [after the Logic &amp; Accuracy tests but before the election]."

Such access, they claim, requires "a high degree of inside access", but represents a "hasty or clumsy" intrusion. The &lt;a href="w%3AHursti%20experiments"&gt;Hursti experiments&lt;/a&gt; have demonstrated that such access need not leave any trace if done carefully.

The Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections, Arthur Anderson, has responded that his staff investigated the problem and found the votes to be normal, but that "the dates somehow changed."
Jeff Darter, an IT official for Palm Beach County, has declined a request, by a member of the Palm Beach County electronic voting technical committee, for the identities of the individuals who had access to the machines.

Black Box Voting also claims that the logs provide support for claims by some voters that the wrong candidate was selected when they tried to vote. In addition, there appear to be numerous operator errors resulting in date, or other, inconsistencies.

&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ALos%20Angeles%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Los Angeles County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; prosecutors have brought three felony charges against Stephen Heller for stealing documents from his employer, the law firm &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJones%20Day"&gt;Jones Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; .

The legal documents discussed the legal ramifications of activist allegations that &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ADiebold%20Election%20Systems"&gt;Diebold Election Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had used uncertified voting systems in &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAlameda%20County%2C%20California"&gt;Alameda County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; elections beginning in 2002. Jones Day represented the controversial electronic voting machine manufacturer at the time. The firm's lawyers concluded that if such uncertified systems were used, then Diebold could be sued by Alameda County for millions of dollars. The memos also discussed whether the &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;'s secretary of state had the authority to investigate Diebold.

Mr. Heller has been charged with felony access to computer data, commercial burglary and receiving stolen property. He has pled not guilty.

Blair Berk, Heller's attorney said, "It's a devastating allegation for a whistle-blower. Certainly, someone who saw those documents could have reasonably believed that thousands of voters were going to be potentially disenfranchised in upcoming elections."

The &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3ARepublican_Party_%2528United_States%2529"&gt;Republican Party&lt;/a&gt; is distributing a &lt;a href="w%3ACD"&gt;CD&lt;/a&gt; as part of a &lt;a href="w%3Alobbying"&gt;lobbying&lt;/a&gt; effort seeking a definition of marriage amendment, which would outlaw gay marriage.

Along with its pitch for the definition of marriage amendment, the CD asks people their views on various controversial issues, including &lt;a href="w%3Aabortion"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3Agun%20control"&gt;gun control&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="w%3Aillegal%20immigration"&gt;illegal immigration&lt;/a&gt;.

The CD has raised privacy concerns after it was discovered that the information is reported back to the Minnesota Republican Party along with the name of the person filling out the questionnaire, while the CD does not reveal that the data is being sent.

Governor &lt;a href="w%3ATim%20Pawlenty"&gt;Tim Pawlenty&lt;/a&gt; has said that the CD "should make clear that [it] is mining information."

&lt;a href="w%3AAyman%20al-Zawahiri"&gt;Ayman al-Zawahiri&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Al-Qaeda"&gt;Al-Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;'s second in command, has released a new videotape.

In the tape Zawahiri says that &lt;a href="w%3AJesus"&gt;Jesus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="w%3AMuhammad"&gt;Prophet Mohammed&lt;/a&gt; "are not sacred anymore.".

Zawahiri also referred to the Prophet Muhammad cartoons saying, "they did it on purpose and they continue to do it without apologizing, even though no one dares to harm Jews or to challenge Jewish claims about the &lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Holocaust"&gt;Holocaust&lt;/a&gt; nor even to insult homosexuals. The insults against Prophet Muhammad are not the result of freedom of opinion but because what is sacred has changed in this culture. The Prophet Mohammed, prayers be upon him, and Jesus Christ, peace be upon him, are not sacred anymore, while Semites and the Holocaust and homosexuality have become sacred.".

In the video, Zawahiri also called for Muslims to attack the west. He also said Muslims need to prevent the West from "stealing Muslims' oil.".

"(Muslims have to) inflict losses on the crusader West, especially to its economic infrastructure with strikes that would make it bleed for years. The strikes on New York, Washington, Madrid and London are the best examples. We have to prevent the crusader West from stealing the Muslims' oil which is being drained in the biggest robbery in history. Reaching power is not a goal by itself ... and no Palestinian has the right to give away a grain of the soil. The seculars in the &lt;a href="w%3APalestinian%20National%20Authority"&gt;Palestinian Authority&lt;/a&gt; have sold out Palestine for crumbs... Giving them legitimacy is against Islam.".

<h1>Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras celebrated by 450,000 people</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Sydney%27s%20Gay%20and%20Lesbian%20Mardi%20Gras%20celebrated%20by%20450%2C000%20people&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 
Nearly half a million people packed into Sydney's "Golden Mile" on Saturday night to applaud the city's 28th annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade. Parade organisers estimated the crowd at over 450,000. They lined Oxford St - along the parade's route - in Sydney's unofficial gay district, cheering the 6,000 participants and 120 floats. 

The Mardi Gras event was the culmination of a month of gay-pride festivities. Many parade participants adopted the theme of the film ♡❤Brokeback Mountain♡❤. The parade was led as usual by the motorcycle group, Dykes on Bikes. Amongst the frivolity and colour, onlookers saw "Kate Moss dancers" snorting 'cocaine', and the gun-wielding - apparently gay-friendly - Dick Cheney. A lampoon of Prime Minister John Howard - a pirate ship carrying "Captain Crook" was also featured. 

A Mardi Gras participant, Filipino Fyljoy Volefdico, 25, said: "I think within Australia there is really a lot of culture and it's great when the whole community comes together and celebrates it." 

Jay Lynch, who met his partner at the event two years ago, said: "It has become a meeting ground for gays from around the world and as discrimination continues it's important we can connect on this level, and continually redefine what it means to the community." 

Chair of the New Mardi Gras board, Marcus Bourget, said the event is about providing a powerful voice for the lesbian and gay community. Describing the parade as "a great Aussie tradition", Bourget said he was proud of the event. "We've run a fairly sophisticated marketing campaign this year, which has led to gradual growth internationally," he said. 

Newcastle woman Donna Newella said Mardi Gras had become many things to many people, "It is not just about gays and lesbians," she said. "It's about all different issues that have arisen," she said "freedom of speech, being able to represent one's identity and being able to put a political point across."

The first Mardi Gras took place on June 24, 1978 as a protest against a ban on homosexuality in Australia. It began as an improvised street party following a gay-rights rally. However when a city official interrupted the festivities, things turned ugly. On that night there were 53 arrests and many allegations of police brutality. Homosexuality was later decriminalised in Australia in 1984. 

Local businesses realise the economic importance of the event, which is a huge money-spinner, they say. Visitors to Sydney for last year's Mardi Gras contributed an estimated $46 million to the State's economy. Organisers say about 6000 international visitors, the majority from Britain and the USA, attended this year's event. 

"We came all the way from America to see this," Mrs Phyllis Drucker 67, from Los Angeles, said. "We were told it's the best in the world, and we're going to have a ball."

A float entitled "Love Between the Flags" highlighted the need for racial harmony and cultural acceptance following last year's Cronulla riots. Creative director Graham Browning said the theme of the parade, "I believe", aimed to reflect political and social issues. The NSW Police service, with 45 members also marched in the parade. 

Mardi Gras parade chief Deborah Cheetham, an internationally renowned soprano, rejected suggestions the parade was passe. "Maybe we're just in that period of transition. It's not tired," said Cheetham, who led the parade with her partner and 14-year-old daughter. "There will always be a need for Mardi Gras."

Sydney Lord Mayor &lt;a href="Clover%20Moore"&gt;Clover Moore&lt;/a&gt; said the parade was a celebration of Sydney's diversity. "When you're a child the thing that really excites you is either Christmas or the Royal Easter Show and I think as an adult Mardi Gras is the only equivalent," Ms Moore told reporters.

"I didn't want to miss any of this," said 17-year-old Jennifer Mackay from outer Sydney, who arrived with three friends 10 hours before the start. 

"It's like Christmas for the gay and lesbian community," said the parade's creative director, Graeme Browning.

In &lt;a href="w%3AHelsinki"&gt;Helsinki&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Finland"&gt;Finnish&lt;/a&gt; trade union for bus and truck drivers has gone on strike on Sunday evening, mainly over the use of part-time labor. The strike is estimated to affect 100,000 people in the capital area, crowding the remaining transit system on Monday morning. The strike is halting almost half of all bus traffic in and around Helsinki, especially hurting travellers commuting from outlying cities &lt;a href="w%3AEspoo"&gt;Espoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3AVantaa"&gt;Vantaa&lt;/a&gt;, where over 60% of bus traffic will be stopped.

The strike also affects 4,000 of Finland's 55,000 delivery trucks, as well as waste management in many areas. The strike is not affecting trains, trams or the underground, but heavy crowding is to be expected. Authorities are also warning of traffic jams during rush-hours as people use personal cars instead of public transportation.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=New%20Zealand%27s%202006%20Census%20is%20held%20tonight&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Tonight is Census night in &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, when all people in the country are legally required to fill in Census forms. The census of population and dwellings is conducted by the New Zealand government department &lt;a href="w%3AStatistics%20New%20Zealand"&gt;Statistics New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, which (with two exceptions) has done so every five years since 1881. This year is the first time that New Zealanders can choose whether to fill in the traditional paper forms or fill them out online.

6500 Census collectors were employed this year to deliver the forms and collect them over the days following the Census, along with 400 supervisors.

As in previous years, some people have tried to evade the Census. &lt;a href="w%3ALibertarianz"&gt;Libertarianz&lt;/a&gt; party members and others gathered at the Wellington Botanical Gardens to incinerate their forms. Another man announced he had been cryogenically frozen overnight and pronounced "legally dead" to avoid filling in the forms. 

Data collections manager Dave Martyn said legal action would be taken against people deliberately not taking part in the Census. 

"The fine is usually $500 per form plus court costs. If the person still doesn't fill out the form, the ongoing cost is $20 a day until they do."

Preliminary Census results are scheduled to be released in May 2006.

&lt;a href="Wikipedia"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; founder &lt;a href="Jimmy%20Wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt; has said that he's considering a &lt;a href="w%3AWikipedia%3AStable%20versions"&gt;"stable" edition&lt;/a&gt; of the community-edited encyclopedia, according to an interview with the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AToronto%20Star"&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . The edition would be "a body of work" that has already "been through the community-review process," he proposed. 

"The basic idea is that we're going to do a research project to gather feedback on all the articles on the website from the general public. Just a feedback we're going to use for research purposes, first to determine where our strengths and weaknesses are, and then, based on that, we're going to think about what to do as a next step."

With regard to whether this would hurt the democratic spirit of Wikipedia, Wales responded "No, not really. I mean, obviously, we want to be very careful as we change the social model in any way, to not wreck the magic of what works. I guess in that sense it's a concern, but we don't really have any worries about it."

Plans to create stable versions of articles date back for years, with the most serious of discussion happening from fall 2005 on.

To experiment with Wikipedia, ♡❤The Star♡❤ submitted a new article on former East York mayor &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATrue%20Davidson"&gt;True Davidson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; . None of the errors were corrected until after the Star acknowledged the false information.

The 78th &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAcademy%20Awards"&gt;Academy Awards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were hosted by &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AJon%20Stewart"&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , host of &lt;a href="Comedy%20Central"&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/a&gt;'s ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Daily%20Show"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤.

♡❤Crash♡❤ won the Best Picture award, a surprise for many predictors. Co-producer &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACathy%20Schulman"&gt;Cathy Schulman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; commented "[thank you for] embracing our film, about love and about tolerance, about truth. Thank you to the people all around the world who have been touched by this message. And we are humbled by the other nominees in this category. You have made this year one of the most breathtaking, and stunning, maverick years in American cinema, thank you."

&lt;a href="Paul%20Haggis"&gt;Paul Haggis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABobby%20Moresco"&gt;Bobby Moresco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also won best original screenplay for ♡❤Crash♡❤.

Directed and co-produced by Canadian Paul Haggis, film distribution rights were purchased for just USD$3 million by Lions Gate Films. Noted film critic &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ARoger%20Ebert"&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; called it his favourite picture of 2005, and the picture made many North American "10 best" lists.

Backstage, Best Director winner &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAng%20Lee"&gt;Ang Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; commented to the press on how ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ABrokeback%20Mountain"&gt;Brokeback Mountain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ refreshed his will to direct. "Before I get into making this movie, I was very tired from two very ambitious work, ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20Hulk"&gt;The Hulk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ and ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ACrouching%20Tiger%2C%20Hidden%20Dragon"&gt;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤. I almost wanted to retire. I felt I had enough, I hit the bottom, sort of like my mid life crisis or something, and this movie teach me how to look at myself, how to manage myself in movie making again, enjoying making them, and the movie was shot very simple, nothing special, but most important, it taught me again, it's about human emotions, drama and acting."

Foreign Language Film winner Gavin Hood (♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3ATsotsi"&gt;Tsotsi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤) commented that he felt the Oscar win would "change the way South Africans view their moviemaking... hopefully it means that people will keep investing in our local stories, because this gives investors a little more confidence and what we want more than anything else is that people and human emotion is universal and we're more alike than we think we are around the world... we're actually so similar as human beings inside."

♡❤Tsotsi♡❤ was the People's Choice Award winner at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, while ♡❤Crash♡❤ debuted at the fest in 2004. ♡❤Capote♡❤ and ♡❤Brokeback Mountain♡❤ both played at the festival days after debuting at the Telluride Film Festival. TIFF's winners often go on to win Best Picture or Best Foreign Language Film; ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWo%20hu%20cang%20long"&gt;Wo hu cang long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ (♡❤Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon♡❤), ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AAmerican%20Beauty"&gt;American Beauty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤, and ♡❤&lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AWhale%20Rider"&gt;Whale Rider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤ are such examples.

Stewart's humor fell short of expectation for most North American film and television critics who commented on the broadcast.

At one point, Stewart jokingly chastised Hollywood for being "out of touch" with mainstream American values. Actor &lt;a href="George%20Clooney"&gt;George Clooney&lt;/a&gt; later responded to this notion, saying, "We are a little bit out of touch in Hollywood. It’s probably a good thing. We’re the ones that talked about AIDS when it was just being whispered. And we talked about civil rights when it wasn’t really popular. We bring up subjects. This group of people gave Hattie McDaniel an Oscar in 1939 when blacks were still sitting in the backs of theaters. I’m proud of this Academy, of this community. I’m proud to be out of touch."

Dvdrs.net, a usenet search engine targeted by the &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3AMotion%20Pictures%20Association%20of%20America"&gt;Motion Pictures Association of America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (MPAA) in its recent anti-piracy campaign, has closed while the site is restructured. Part of the restructuring will be the deletion of its &lt;span class="interwiki-link-foreign"&gt;&lt;a href="w%3Ausenet"&gt;usenet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; index.

In a statement posted on dvdrs.net just days before its disappearance, Descds, a site administrator, said, "The site will be closed for restructure. All reference to Usenet will be removed, the logo adapted (its a long time coming anyway) and NZB indexing sections dropped."

Descds reports that he is unhappy about Dvdrs.net being seen as a piracy network, as it has been since news of the MPAA's actions. "Since the PR press release broke we have been seen as an organized pirate network and this is unacceptable. In the first day of the press release we had 100 new members sign up looking for pirated movies. This has continued everyday since and we will not allow DVDRS to be used this way. We have not, will not and never shall host illegal files here," he said.

"We also understand that DVDRS will always be seen, in light of recent press, as a site that dealt in illegal file sharing. We feel there is no way we can recover from this and thus will re-launch Talk DVD with some of DVDRS database and ideas." 

Descds also stated that he hoped the MPAA could see that he was happy to work with the MPAA to reach a resolution, maintaining that he had done nothing wrong and that the site was far more than a usenet indexing site. 

"Indexing Usenet is still a part of the site granted, but we are now far more than that with in depth articles on DVD-R/W, DVD+R/W, DVD+R DL, DVDRAM, BLU-RAY and HD DVD media, software and hardware technology. We also have a healthy movie, game and hardware review section as well as active news. Our forums are also more about technology than Usenet," Descds said in his statement.

Australian Prime Minister &lt;a href="w%3AJohn%20Howard"&gt;John Howard&lt;/a&gt; began a visit of India yesterday. Interest in the visit has been dominated by the issue of uranium sales and Australia's stance on the recent agreement between the United States and India.

Before departing, Mr Howard gave an interview at Kirribilli House, in which he stressed the importance of Australia's relationship with India, and emphasised their economic significance. "India is one of the great coming powers of the world. The economic growth has been enormous. It's important that we do what we can to strengthen the economic relationship with India," he said.

This is Mr Howards second visit to India as Prime Minister. He will meet the Indian President, Prime Minister, and also &lt;a href="w%3ASonia%20Gandhi"&gt;Sonia Gandhi&lt;/a&gt; and others. The visit is expected to continue until Wednesday.

<h3>Uranium sales</h3>
Alexander Downer earlier in the week welcomed the US-Indian agreement on nuclear technology, but stated that Australia did not sell to countries that had not ratified the &lt;a href="w%3ANuclear%20Non-proliferation%20Treaty"&gt;Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty&lt;/a&gt;. Mr Howard indicated that there are still no plans to change this policy. "We don't have any plan to change our current policy. We sell uranium to countries which adhere to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty," he said.

In an interview later in the day in Delhi, Howard was less committed on the issue, and suggested that policy may change depending on circumstances. "We do have a long-standing policy of only selling uranium to countries that are part of the NPT regime, but we will have a look at what the Americans have done and when we get a bit more information about that we'll further assess it," he said.

Senator &lt;a href="w%3ANatasha%20Stott%20Despoja"&gt;Natasha Stott Despoja&lt;/a&gt;, Foreign Affairs Spokesperson for the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Democrats"&gt;Australian Democrats&lt;/a&gt;, accused the government of a "backflip" over the issue. "In what looks a policy backflip in less than a week, the PM now appears to be considering the export of uranium to India despite the fact that it has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," she said in a press release. Senator Lyn Allsion also called for policy to remain as it is, saying, "The Government must be consistent in its commitment to achieving a nuclear-free world."

Senator &lt;a href="w%3AChristine%20Milne"&gt;Christine Milne&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; went further, arguing that Howard was crumbling under pressure from Washington and had backed down over the issue of uranium sales. "The deputy sheriff has once taken his running orders from US President George Bush and is yet again undermining international law. Australia has already torn up international law to follow George Bush into Iraq and Guantanamo Bay; now the world will be less safe as they tear up the NPT," she said.

<h3>US-Indian agreement</h3>

Mr Howard adopted a wait-and-see approach to the US-Indian agreement. "Of course it has to run the gauntlet of the American political process. We're certainly not going to suddenly change our policy just because the Indians and the Americans have reached an agreement. We'll study it, and if there are things that should additionally be done that are in Australia's interests then we'll do them," he said.

Two cases of the deadly &lt;a href="w%3AH5N1"&gt;H5N1&lt;/a&gt; avian influenza virus have been confirmed in &lt;a href="w%3APoland"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt; birds. The H5N1 strain of bird flu has already been found responsible for the deaths of over 93 humans in the entire world. Some scientists fear it may be starting to establish a foothold in Eastern and Central Europe.

There have been isolated cases of H5N1 transmission from birds to humans, raising fears among the international scientific community that the virus will combine with a human influenza virus, mutating in such a way that it could transfer readily from human to human. A global pandemic, similar to the &lt;a href="w%3ASpanish%20influenza"&gt;Spanish influenza&lt;/a&gt; outbreak of 1918, could result.
The two cases in Poland were discovered in the northern town of &lt;a href="w%3ATorun"&gt;Toruń&lt;/a&gt;, famous as the birthplace of &lt;a href="w%3ANicolaus%20Copernicus"&gt;Nicolaus Copernicus&lt;/a&gt;. Two swans have been confirmed to have been carriers of the virus. Samples from the subjects have been sent to the European Union (&lt;a href="w%3AEuropean%20Union"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;) laboratories in Weybridge, England, but initial assessments have been seen as highly reliable. "Yes, we have confirmed that it is definitely H5N1," said Jan Zmudzinski, director of Poland's national laboratory, in the town of Pulawy. A hygiene-security zone protected by police has been established, extending up to several hundred metres from the spot on the river bank of the &lt;a href="w%3AVistula"&gt;Vistula river&lt;/a&gt; where the swans were found.

, a resident of Toruń, told Wikinews that he has observed authorities putting precautionary measures in place to attempt to slow the spread of bird flu. He said that during March 6 and 7 he observed:
<ul>
BULLET::::- The establishment of an "inner zone" next to the Vistula river which has been cordoned off by police. No cars or non-residents are allowed to enter this area, which includes Philadelphia Boulevard ("Bulwar Filadelfijski"). Normally the riverbank is a popular place for casual walks and exercising dogs.
BULLET::::- The establishment of an "outer zone" including the entire town centre.
BULLET::::- Placement of special disinfection mats for people to walk over in the main intercity bus station ("PKS") in Toruń. The station is an entry and exit point to and from the outer zone.
BULLET::::- Placement of signs around the town instructing people that the feeding of birds is strictly prohibited.
BULLET::::- Placement of warning signs about infection risks under storks' nests in villages near Toruń.
BULLET::::- Authorities prohibiting transport of animals into or out from the quarantined zones.
BULLET::::- Disinfection "sand mats" on main roads out of Toruń, that vehicles must necessarily pass over to disinfect their tires.
</ul>
The &lt;a href="w%3AWorld%20Health%20Organisation"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; held a three-day emergency meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss plans to deal with the virus, and also to revisit contingency plans for the possibility of a future pandemic. With the discovery of H5N1 in Poland, fears of a pandemic have increased in the scientific community. "Events in recent weeks justify that concern," said Margaret Chan, special advisor to the WHO on avian influenza.

While bird flu has not affected Europe's agricultural output as much as it has that of Southeast Asia, there have been some serious economic consequences of the recent bird flu outbreaks on the continent. France has been forced to increase its subsidies to poultry farmers, spending over 52 million euros ($63 million USD) in aid. Over thirty bird cases have been confirmed in France, while Germany is currently investigating a possible case in a cat.

A survey by &lt;a href="w%3ASonicWALL"&gt;SonicWALL&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ASunnyvale%2C%20California"&gt;Sunnyvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="California"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;-based company, reports that 10% of worldwide &lt;a href="w%3Atelecommuting"&gt;telecommuters&lt;/a&gt; are nude while working, finding 12% for men and 7% for women, respectively.

A gender gap also exists for showering on work-at-home days, with 44% of women showering, while only 30% of men did. The survey also found that 39% of both sexes wear sweats while working from home.

The survey also covered less racy topics, including opinions on productivity. 76% felt that working at home increased productivity.

The number of telecommuters has increased sharply in recent years. For example, 43% of U.S. government employees telecommute at least part of the time, up from only 19% one year ago.

Professor of philosophy &lt;a href="w%3ADaniel%20Dennett"&gt;Daniel Dennett's&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3ATufts%20University"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;) new book ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3ABreaking%20the%20Spell"&gt;Breaking the Spell&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ uses the scientific method commonly employed to analyze natural phenomena in order to examine religion. ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AThe%20New%20York%20Times"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ February 20th review by &lt;a href="w%3ALeon%20Wieseltier"&gt;Leon Wieseltier&lt;/a&gt;, which was strongly negative, has sparked debate about the merits of this approach.

♡❤Breaking the Spell♡❤ attempts to present an understanding of religious &lt;a href="w%3Amemes"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; (pieces of information that can spread from person to person) in the same way as &lt;a href="Richard%20Dawkins"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; approached genetics in his &lt;a href="w%3Aselfish%20gene%20theory"&gt;selfish gene theory&lt;/a&gt;. Dennett's book presents the point of view of an individual religious meme, in competition with other memes, trying to maximize its own successful spread.

Wieseltier objects to Dennett's "meme's eye view" analysis as "scientism", claiming that "Dennett lives in a world in which you must believe in the grossest biologism or in the grossest theism, in a purely naturalistic understanding of religion or in intelligent design, in the omniscience of a white man with a long beard in 19th-century &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt; or in the omniscience of a white man with a long beard in the sky." Not all aspects of human life can or should be illuminated by scientific methods, claims Wieseltier.

Dennett responded that this criticism followed a pattern of recent "stunts" by the ♡❤New York Times♡❤ book review: "When you can't stand the implications of some scientific discipline X, but can't think of any solid objections, you brand them instances of the sin of Xism and then you don't have to take them seriously!" He continues to state that "the very idea of an intensive scientific exploration of religion so upsets Wieseltier that he resorts to flagrant falsehoods — and doesn't even bother supporting his claims with citations."

Wieseltier also criticizes several of Dennett's quotations of fellow philosophers, including &lt;a href="w%3ADavid%20Hume"&gt;David Hume&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="w%3AWilliam%20James"&gt;William James&lt;/a&gt;, and personal friend of Dennett's &lt;a href="w%3AThomas%20Nagel"&gt;Thomas Nagel&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;a href="w%3ABrian%20Leiter"&gt;Brian Leiter&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of philosophy at the &lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Texas"&gt;University of Texas&lt;/a&gt;, also objects to Wieseltier's claim that some aspects of human life can not be illuminated by a scientific approach. "'The view that science can explain all human conditions and expressions, mental as well as physical' is not a 'superstition' but a reasonable methodological posture to adopt based on the actual evidence, that is, based on the actual expanding success of the sciences... during the last hundred years," writes Leiter. &lt;a href="http%3A//leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2006/02/why_review_a_bo.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Dennett is eager for the religious to read ♡❤Breaking the Spell♡❤, and spends the first third of the book motivating and justifying his project; this may have had bearing on the ♡❤Times♡❤♡ selection of reviewers.

Both the selfish gene theory and the idea of memes were originally popularized by Professor &lt;a href="w%3ARichard%20Dawkins"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="w%3AUniversity%20of%20Oxford"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, Biologist), in his book ♡❤The Selfish Gene♡❤. The selfish gene theory is the most widely accepted basis for mathematical models in evolutionary biology, as it has repeatedly correctly modeled various problematic situations, such as gender ratios in insect species with haploid males.

Daniel Dennett is among the most widely read living philosophers, highly regarded for the diversity of his academic contributions. Many of his popular works concern evolution, memetics, and human thought.

Roberto Cipresso, one of &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;'s most respected winemakers, has gone into business with &lt;a href="w%3ASavanna%20Samson"&gt;Savanna Samson&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="w%3ANew%20York"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="w%3Apornographic%20actor"&gt;porn star&lt;/a&gt;, whose real name is Natalie Oliveros.

The wine world had previously suspected that Cipresso's collaboration with Samson would be little more than a publicity stunt. Such fears evaporated when &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; wine expert Robert Parker rated their effort at 91, describing it as "an outstanding wine of exceptional complexity and character".

Samson's husband, Daniel Oliveros, who introduced her to the winemaker, is a &lt;a href="w%3AManhattan"&gt;Manhattan&lt;/a&gt; wine merchant. The couple met when she was a dancer at Scores, a popular strip club. 

Savanna Samson's last film earned her the porn industry's highest award for best all-girl sex scene. Her best-known films are ♡❤Big Blowout♡❤, ♡❤Fetish Underground♡❤ and ♡❤Poke Her♡❤.

Roberto Cipresso's previous investor was &lt;a href="w%3APope%20John%20Paul%20II"&gt;Pope John Paul II&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=AT%26amp%3BT%20to%20buy%20BellSouth%20for%20%2467%20billion&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;a href="w%3AAT%26amp%3BT"&gt;AT&amp;T&lt;/a&gt; Inc. and &lt;a href="w%3ABellSouth"&gt;BellSouth&lt;/a&gt; announced a &lt;a href="w%3AUnited%20States%20dollar"&gt;US$&lt;/a&gt;67 billion merger deal Sunday. If approved by shareholders and regulators, the merger would create the largest telecommunications company in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, with control of over half of the telephone lines in the country and the largest cellular service provider, &lt;a href="w%3ACingular%20Wireless"&gt;Cingular Wireless&lt;/a&gt;.

"This transaction combines two solid, very well-run companies," AT&amp;T Chairman and CEO Edward E. Whitacre said in a press statement. "BellSouth operates in an attractive region with a growing economy. It has great employees and an outstanding network, with fiber optics deeply deployed in its service area. It has a strong record in terms of customer service and a sound, conservative balance sheet. These strengths, added to those of AT&amp;T, will improve our ability to provide innovative services to more customers while returning substantial value to our owners and improving our growth profile."

AT&amp;T and BellSouth had shared ownership and operations of Cingular Wireless, which will be absorbed by AT&amp;T as part of the merger. If the deal passes shareholders, BellSouth stock holders will receive 1.325 shares of AT&amp;T common stock for each single share held of BellSouth stock. at a rate of 1.325 shares of AT&amp;T stock per BellSouth share. Though subject to approval by government regulators and shareholders of both companies, the merger is expected to be completed within the next year.

BellSouth and AT&amp;T employ nearly 316,000 people in the United States. The merger, if approved, would give AT&amp;T 70 million telephone users, almost 10 million broadband subscribers, and AT&amp;T will provide services to more than half the companies on the ♡❤Fortune 100♡❤ in 22 states.

Whitacre will remain as chairman, CEO and a member of the board of directors of the combined company. Duane Ackerman, currently chairman and CEO of BellSouth, will remain in his position for a transition period following the merger. Additionally, three members of BellSouth's board of directors will join the AT&amp;T board.

The announced purchase recalls the planned US$115 billion dollar merger of &lt;a href="w%3AMCI%20WorldCom"&gt;MCI WorldCom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3ASprint%20Nextel"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt; in 1999 that was prohibited by the federal government. Despite this, analysts think the federal actions will be smaller, since these actions came under protest three months ago due to the actions of their &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;an rivals.

With the price of AT&amp;T closing at US$27.99 per share, and the price of BellSouth closing at US$37.09 per share, AT&amp;T will pay an additional 17.9% for each stock of BellSouth. This operation ultimately leads to a capitalization of US$165 billion, and officials with the companies predict a force reduction of at least 10,000 employees, lower costs of operation in networks, and an overall savings of $2 billion after the second year, with altogether savings reaching US$18 billion. 

AT&amp;T also announced that it will try to acquire the US$10 billion worth of stocks that were yielded during the company's bankruptcy in 1984.

The corporate headquarters for the combined company are expected to remain in &lt;a href="w%3ASan%20Antonio%2C%20Texas"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; Governor Sonny Perdue and Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin said Monday that they will work to persuade AT&amp;T executives to move their headquarters to the BellSouth HQ in &lt;a href="w%3AAtlanta"&gt;Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;. Cingular's headquarters will remain in Atlanta, as will the combined company's Southeast regional telephone company headquarters.

&lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Greens"&gt;Australian Greens&lt;/a&gt; Senator &lt;a href="w%3ABob%20Brown"&gt;Bob Brown&lt;/a&gt; today called for a ban on junk food advertisements during times that children are watching TV. In a press release, the Senator referred specifically to the previous night's episode of ♡❤&lt;a href="w%3AFour%20Corners%20%28TV%20series%29"&gt;Four Corners&lt;/a&gt;♡❤.

"The extensive use of psychologists to analyse little children’s responsiveness to TV advertising, including how best to influence parents to buy goods by 'nagging' from children, is exploitation without honour," Senator Brown said.

The documentary, entitled ♡❤How The Kids Took Over♡❤, investigated the increase in marketing to children, who "have a say" in &lt;a href="w%3AAustralian%20Dollar"&gt;AU$&lt;/a&gt;700 billion worth of spending each year. "The marketing assault is aimed not only at getting children to spend. Even companies who market adult products, such as cars, are enlisting children to help persuade their parents to buy the 'right' brand," the program summary said.

In the past the Government has rejected such calls. It recently launched a $6 million advertising campaign encouraging children to exercise an hour each day.

Senator Brown says he plans to propose a Senate Inquiry.

&lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AHugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, has accused the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; of supporting a separatist movement in the oil-rich state of &lt;a href="w%3Aen%3AZulia"&gt;Zulia&lt;/a&gt;. Zulia has a large portion of Venezuela's oil and gas reserves and is ruled by governor &lt;a href="w%3AManuel%20Rosales"&gt;Manuel Rosales&lt;/a&gt;, a friend of the United States.

The Zulian political organization, ♡❤Own Course♡❤, a group of right-wingers opposed to Chávez, has proposed holding a referendum to form a neo-liberal capitalist economy in the Zulia state which shares borders with &lt;a href="Colombia"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;.

Chávez described the secessionist attempts as a crazy move and warned that the &lt;a href="w%3ASeparatism"&gt;separatist&lt;/a&gt;s could face military action. He said that the imperialists are attempting to give strength and form to the secessionist movement, with the goal of controlling the oil in the region.

President Chávez also claimed the secessionist movement is part of a plan by the U.S. to overthrow and kill him.

&lt;a href="w%3AKirby%20Puckett"&gt;Kirby Puckett&lt;/a&gt;, a former professional &lt;a href="w%3Abaseball"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; player and &lt;a href="w%3AMinnesota%20Twins"&gt;Minnesota Twins&lt;/a&gt; legend, died Monday afternoon, March 6, in a &lt;a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Arizona"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, hospital, one day after suffering a &lt;a href="w%3Astroke"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and undergoing emergency surgery for the resultant &lt;a href="w%3Acerebral%20hemorrhage"&gt;cerebral hemorrhage&lt;/a&gt;. He was 45 years old.

The &lt;a href="w%3ABaseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame"&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/a&gt; center fielder, whose .318 career batting average is surpassed only by &lt;a href="w%3AJoe%20DiMaggio"&gt;Joe DiMaggio&lt;/a&gt; among right-handed hitters, was a ten-time &lt;a href="w%3AMajor%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game"&gt;All-Star&lt;/a&gt; in twelve seasons with the Minnesota Twins. "Puck" won six &lt;a href="w%3AGold%20Glove%20Award"&gt;Gold Glove&lt;/a&gt; awards and five &lt;a href="w%3ASilver%20Slugger"&gt;Silver Slugger&lt;/a&gt; awards for defensive and offensive excellence at his position, and led the Twins to World Series Championships in &lt;a href="w%3A1987%20World%20Series"&gt;1987&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="w%3A1991%20World%20Series"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;. He retired as the Twins' all-time leader in hits, doubles, total bases, at-bats and runs, records that he still holds to this day. Unfortunately, his playing career was cut short in 1996, when he was diagnosed with glaucoma, which has left him blind in one eye. Even though his career was considerably shorter than those of most inductees, it was long enough for Baseball Hall of Fame eligibility. He was inducted in 2001, his first year of eligibility.

Puckett had gained weight in recent years, and was reportedly still suffering from a bitter divorce in 2002, and was still depressed about his career being cut short. His professional relationship with the Twins ended in 2002, and he went into seclusion thereafter. However, the Twins have constantly attempted to contact Puckett in hopes that he would return to help the team in some form. He also had his personal reputation sullied by an incident in 2003 where he was accused of groping a woman in a bathroom in a &lt;a href="w%3AMinneapolis"&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;-area restaurant. He was cleared of all charges, but the emotional damage he incurred from the incident had increased his self-imposed seclusion from the baseball community.

Puckett suffered the stroke early Sunday morning at his home in &lt;a href="w%3AScottsdale%2C%20Arizona"&gt;Scottsdale, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. He was initially transported by ambulance to Scottsdale Memorial Hospital, then was airlifted to Scottsdale Osborne Hospital for emergency surgery in an attempt to stop a cerebral hemorrhage. After that, he was transferred &lt;a href="w%3ASt.%20Joseph%27s%20Hospital%20and%20Medical%20Center"&gt;St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;'s Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix in hopes of further treatment. His condition declined, however. He received the &lt;a href="w%3AAnointing%20of%20the%20Sick"&gt;last rites&lt;/a&gt; and passed away Monday afternoon.

Puckett is survived by his ex-wife Tonya, his children Catherine and Kirby Jr., and his fiancee, Jodi Olson. Funeral arrangements are pending.

<h1>Australians need bigger toilets</h1>
&lt;strong class="published"&gt;&lt;span id="publishDate" class="value-title" title=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="Z3988" style="display:none" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rfr_id=rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:User%3ADendodge&amp;rft_id=info:sid/en.wikinews.org:&amp;rft.atitle=Australians%20need%20bigger%20toilets&amp;rft.jtitle=Wikinews&amp;rft.date=&amp;rft.aucorp=Wikinews+contributors&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.rights=CC-BY+2.5&amp;rft.identifier=&amp;rft.artnum="&gt; &lt;/span&gt; 

Standards Australia, the non-government standards setting organisation in Australia has indicated that it is reviewing the weight limit for toilet seats as they need to accommodate the "increasing size of humans".

Obesity levels have been rising for years in Australia. Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that the percentage of Australian men who are overweight or obsese rose 10 percent in the last ten years to 62 percent. The number of females who are considered overweight or obese rose 8 percent to 45 percent. Standards Australia is considering recommending strengthening loos for larger users. They say experts will examine the seats "from the perspective that people are getting bigger." 

Standards Australia says as the community's weight increases, and many more Australians are in the heavier categories, toilet regulations have to be updated. General manager of standards development Colin Blair says toilets are currently required to meet a rigidity test of 45 kilograms (99 lbs) - which accommodates most people's weight in a seated position.

He says a committee including manufacturers and consumers will assess whether that is still adequate. "They will re-look at what the statistics are on weights of people, they will re-look at that rigidity load and then that document will go to public comment, so obviously the experts out there will have an opportunity to re-look and see whether that load is appropriate," said Colin Blair.

Standards Australia review committee member Steve Cummings, head of research and development for toilet manufacturer Caroma Dorf, said toilet seats currently only had to withstand a 45kg load. "We are bringing it in to line with the weight of a heavy Australian," he said. 

The draft seat standard is due to be issued for public comment mid-this year and set for release by the end of 2006. 

Health economist Paul Gross recently said the price of obesity for the community was about $11 billion a year.

Environmental scientists say they have concrete evidence that the planet is undergoing the "largest mass extinction in 65 million years". Leading environmental scientist Professor Norman Myers says the Earth is experiencing its "Sixth Extinction." 

Scientists forecast that up to five million species will be lost this century. "We are well into the opening phase of a mass extinction of species. There are about 10 million species on earth. If we carry on as we are, we could lose half of all those 10 million species," Myers said. 

If we do not do more, Myers says, the planet will continue to lose around 50 species per day compared to the natural extinction rate of one species every five years. He projected this rate in the late 1980s to much criticism, but the figure is now widely accepted by scientists. "The whole thing is taking place in what you might call a flickering of an evolutionary eye," said Myers. "It's hard to keep up with unless we damp down on some of the causes of the evolution."

<h2>Hotspots</h2>
 The Australia Museum's Frank Howarth says "There are over 30 extinction 'hotspots' across the globe. He says up to 80 per cent of crucial habitat has been wiped out. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots"&gt;Biodiversity hotspots&lt;/a&gt; are areas that have more than 1500 endemic plant species and which have lost more than 70per cent of original habitat." Hotspots feature, according to Myers, "exceptional concentrations of species that are found nowhere else in the world."

Evidence shows that insects, which account for more than half the described species on earth, are disappearing faster than birds. "Many areas of Australia's ecosystems depend on the work of insects... we put a lot of effort into looking at these hotspots, about what insects actually occur there, whether their numbers are increasing or decreasing, because they tell us a lot more about some of the high level effects," Howarth said.

Myers argues that we are destroying the Earth’s biodiversity quickly enough to witness the beginning of a mass extinction of species&amp;mdash;one of only six such events in the Earth’s history. He says around 30 hotspots contain the last remaining habitats of at least half of Earth’s land surface. 

He says more parks and reserves are needed, and while warnings are desperate, he believes the situation can be turned around. "We would be the first generation in the whole of human history since we came out of our caves to tackle a mass extinction head on and cancel it... and if we do, I think people will cheer for us from thousands of years ahead." Myers projects that safeguarding the hotspots would cost one billion dollars per year.

<h2>Where are the frogs?</h2>

The Global Amphibian Assessment, an international convention of amphibian biologists, indicated in 2004 that over a third of the world's amphibian species are threatened, making them the most threatened group of animals on the planet. More than 120 species have likely become extinct since the 1980s, and around two-thirds of the South American harlequin frog species vanished in the 1980s and 1990s. The decline of amphibians in protected habitats has puzzled conservation biologists for nearly 20 years. 

Recent research suggests that &lt;a href="w%3AClimate_change"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; may be driving widespread frog extinctions. Results of a study published in the January 2006 ♡❤Nature♡❤ journal reveal how warming alters a fatal skin fungus affecting frogs. The article says hundreds of species around the world are teetering on the brink of extinction or have already become extinct. 

"Disease is the bullet that's killing the frogs," said J. Alan Pounds, the study's lead scientist from the Tropical Science Center in Costa Rica. "But climate change is pulling the trigger. Global warming is wreaking havoc on amphibians, and soon will cause staggering losses of biodiversity," he said.

According to the study, rising temperatures favor the chytrid fungus, which seems to kill frogs mostly in cool highlands or during winter&amp;mdash;implying that low temperatures make it more deadly. National Science Foundation program director Sam Scheiner said their study "demonstrates the complex nature of global climate change, including how climate affects the spread of disease, and why these must be integrated if we are to understand and reduce threats to species extinctions."

Scheiner says the message goes beyond amphibians: "global warming and the accompanying emergence of infectious diseases are a real and immediate threat to biodiversity and a growing challenge for humankind."

<h2>"The Sixth Extinction"</h2>
Scientists are warning that by the end of this century, the planet could lose up to half its species, and that these extinctions will alter not only biological diversity but also the evolutionary processes itself. They state that human activities have brought our planet to the point of biotic crisis. 

In 1993, Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson estimated that the planet is losing 30,000 species per year - around three species per hour. Some biologists have begun to feel that the biodiversity crisis dubbed the "Sixth Extinction" is even more severe, and more imminent, than Wilson had expected.

Professor Myers and colleague Andrew H. Knoll say that what we do now will define a course for evolution. In their 2001 American Institute of Biological Sciences report, Myers and Knoll forecast that the effects of a Sixth Extinction will leave gene pools so depleted that species may not bounce back. Species such as rodents and cockroaches that have adapted to human environments will dominate. 

Niles Eldredge in his paper ♡❤The Sixth Extinction♡❤ says that with the high rate of extinction, there is little doubt left in the minds of professional biologists that the biosphere is currently facing a mounting, unprecedented loss of species. 

Whilst previous mass extinctions were due to natural environmental causes, research shows that wherever on Earth humans have migrated other species have become extinct. Human overpopulation especially in the past two centuries is said to be the underlying cause of the Sixth Extinction.
