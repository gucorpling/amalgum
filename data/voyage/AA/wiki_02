<h1>Afghanistan</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//moic.gov.af/en/Page/1292"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is a landlocked and mountainous country in the heart of &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, bordered by &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; to the south and east, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href="Turkmenistan"&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Uzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Tajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt; to the north. There is a short border with &lt;a href="China"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; to the far northeast, but in extremely inaccessible terrain. The country has great many valleys.

Afghanistan has been the center of many powerful empires for the past 2,000 years. However, in the last 30 years the country has been in chaos due to major wars—from the Soviet invasion of 1979 to their withdrawal in 1989 and from warlordism to the removal of the Taliban in 2001 and the ensuing US/NATO invasion. Economically, Afghanistan is considered poor compared to many other nations of the world. The country is going through a nationwide rebuilding process.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Afghanistan has been in the news since the late 1970s for all the wrong reasons. While visiting has not been advisable for several years, it has much to offer the intrepid traveller. But even the more adventurous should consider looking elsewhere for thrill-seeking.

<h3>Climate</h3>
Temperatures in the central highlands are below freezing for most of the winter, and snow is common at higher elevations. Summertime highs in lower elevations (such as &lt;a href="Jalalabad"&gt;Jalalabad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Mazar-e%20Sharif"&gt;Mazar-e Sharif&lt;/a&gt;) can exceed 50°C/120°F. In higher areas such as Kabul, summer temperatures can be 30°C/90°F and winter around 0°C/30°F. The most pleasant weather in Kabul is during April, May and September.

<h3>Terrain</h3>
Mostly rugged mountains; plains in north and southwest. The Hindu Kush mountains run northeast to southwest, dividing the northern provinces from the rest of the country, with the highest peaks found in the northern &lt;a href="Wakhan%20Corridor"&gt;Wakhan Corridor&lt;/a&gt;. South of Kandahar is desert.

The lowest point is Amu Darya at 258 m, and the highest is Nowshak at 7,485 m.

<h3>People</h3>
Afghanistan is an ethnically diverse country. Tribal and local allegiances are strong, which complicates national politics immensely. The largest ethnic group is the Pashtun, followed by Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek and others.

Baloch tribesmen, still largely nomadic, can be found anywhere between &lt;a href="Quetta"&gt;Quetta&lt;/a&gt; in Pakistan and &lt;a href="Mashad"&gt;Mashad&lt;/a&gt; in Iran, including much of western Afghanistan. They make marvellous rugs, if somewhat simple.

Hazaras in the central mountains look much more Asiatic than other Afghans. According to some theories, they are descended from Genghis Khan's soldiers.

The two largest linguistic groups speak Pashto and Dari (Afghan Persian). Pashto speakers predominate in the south and east, Dari in the north, west and central Afghanistan. About 11% of the population have Turkic languages, Uzbek. or Turkmen, as their first language. Many of them are in the north, near &lt;a href="Uzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Turkmenistan"&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/a&gt;. Minor native language groups include Nuristanis, Pashais and Pamiris, found in small pockets in the east and northeast.

There are also thousands of Hindus and Sikhs living in different cities but mostly in &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Jalalabad"&gt;Jalalabad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Kandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>History</h3>
Afghanistan has been settled for thousands of years. The modern-day country was founded when Mir Wais Hotak rose up against the Persians in 1709 and established the Hotaki dynasty, with its capital at &lt;a href="Kandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;. It later included what is now Iran and Iraq but the Hotaki dynasty collapsed in 1738. In 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani re-established Afghanistan and expanded it to include much of Pakistan as well as northeastern Iran and the Western parts India. The country has a long history of warfare, mostly against invaders such as Darius I, Alexander of Macedon, Persians, Arabs, Turks, Mongols, and the British. Its recent history is no exception.

In 1919, Afghanistan established independence as an emirate until a kingdom was proclaimed by Amanullah Khan. As king, he attempted to modernise the country through Western designs. In 1933, Mohammed Zahir Shah succeeded to the throne and ruled the country until 1973, when the constitutional monarchy was overthrown in a coup, and the country became a republic.

After the April 1978 revolution and successful coup by pro-Communist forces, the Soviet Union invaded in December 1979 to support the new socialist regime. War ensued. By February 1989 all Soviet forces withdrew from the country but fighting continued between Soviet-backed Afghan government forces and mujahideen rebels, who were funded by the United States, Saudi Arabia and others while trained by Pakistan and Iran.

The Taliban grew out of this chaos in late 1994, providing a solution to what was by this time a civil war. Backed by foreign sponsors, and inspired by a conservative sect of Islam, the Taliban developed as a political force to end the civil war and bring security to the country. They seized the capital of Kabul in late 1996 and controlled most of the country by 2000, aside from some areas in the northeast.

After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, the Taliban refused to hand over Osama bin Laden or other al-Qaeda militants to the United States, though they did offer to try Osama in their own shariah court if the US government shared "solid evidence" of his alleged guilt with them, and also expressed willingness in principle to consider extraditing Osama to a neutral country for a trial before a shariah court there if such an action would stave off US-led invasion. The US refused to share whatever evidence they had with the Taliban and considered the Taliban's offers insufficient, so they and their allies chose to take military action with support from anti-Taliban Afghans — mainly Kazakhs and Kirghiz from the north of the country who fought in the Northern Alliance — causing the Taliban's regime to fall in December 2001.

The same month, representatives from all ethnic groups of Afghanistan met in &lt;a href="Germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and agreed to form a new government with Hamid Karzai as Chairman of the Afghan Interim Authority. Following a nationwide election in 2004, Hamid Karzai was elected as President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. A year later, in 2005, legislative elections were held and the country's parliament began functioning again. In addition to occasionally violent political jockeying and ongoing military action to root out anti-government elements, the country suffers from widespread election fraud, poverty, corruption, and opium cultivation.

In 2005, Afghanistan and the US signed a strategic partnership agreement committing both nations to a long-term relationship. In 2012, Afghanistan and the US signed another more important strategic partnership agreement. It also signed strategic partnership agreements with India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and many other nations. In the mean time, around US$50 billion is being spent on the reconstruction of the country.

<h3>Electricity</h3>
Officially 220 V 50&amp;nbsp;Hz. Electricity supplies are erratic, but slowly improving in major cities. Voltage can drop to below 150 V in some places. The Afghans' enthusiasm for homemade generators or modifying low quality ones means that the frequency and voltage can also vary wildly.

There are three types of electrical outlets likely to be found in Afghanistan. They are the old British standard BS-546 and the newer British standard BS 1363. But the European standard CEE-7/7 "Schukostecker" or "Schuko" is the standard and obviously most common. Generally speaking, U.S. and Canadian travellers should pack adapters for these outlets if they plan to use North American electrical equipment in Afghanistan. You may also find cheap universal adapters in the local markets.

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>Visas</h3>
Most visitors need to apply for a visa in advance, and they are often easier to obtain than you might expect. See the Afghanistan Foreign Ministry's &lt;a href="http%3A//mfa.gov.af/en/page/consular-affairs/visa-information"&gt;visa webpage&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>By plane</h3>

♡❤♡Kabul International Airport♡❤♡ (&lt;b&gt; KBL &lt;/b&gt; ) in &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt; is the main entry point to the country. In late 2008, the barely functioning old terminal was refurbished and is now being used for domestic flights, while the brand new Japanese-constructed terminal is up and running and fielding international flights.

The national carrier, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.flyariana.com/"&gt;Ariana Afghan Airlines&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, is flying with a small fleet of about 14 Airbuses and Boeings (plus Antonovs). They have daily flights from &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;, and periodic flights from &lt;a href="Frankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Islamabad"&gt;Islamabad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Istanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Baku"&gt;Baku&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Tehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt;. Ariana is particularly bad at keeping to schedules — flights can be cancelled or delayed without notice.

A better option is the independent operator ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//flykamair.com/"&gt;Kam Air&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, which has twice daily flights from Dubai, twice weekly flights from &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt; and weekly flights from &lt;a href="Almaty"&gt;Almaty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Istanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Mashad"&gt;Mashad&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the flights on the Dubai to Kabul route stop in &lt;a href="Herat"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt; if you'd prefer to enter the country there. ♡❤♡Safi Air♡❤♡ also provides flights between Dubai and Kabul. They are the only safety-accredited airline in Afghanistan. Safi is the only Afghan airline allowed to fly into Europe and has direct flights to Frankfurt. The service is good and planes are sound. Staff are professional.

♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.piac.com.pk/"&gt;Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ flies four times per week from Islamabad and once per week from Peshawar to Kabul. Another route in may be via through &lt;a href="Tehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Mashad"&gt;Mashad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.iranair.nl/"&gt;Iran Air&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ has periodic flights from &lt;a href="Tehran"&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; to Kabul. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.airindia.com/"&gt;Air India&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ operates six flights a week from Delhi to Kabul. ♡❤♡Turkish Airlines♡❤♡ also began flights between Kabul and Istanbul in 2011. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.airarabia.com/"&gt;Air Arabia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ used to fly four times per week from &lt;a href="Sharjah"&gt;Sharjah&lt;/a&gt; — however, they have suspended operations.

Flights to other cities such as &lt;a href="Mazar-e%20Sharif"&gt;Mazar-e Sharif&lt;/a&gt; may be available if you can hook up with the charter company ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.flypactec.org/"&gt;PACTEC&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡; however, seating is very limited.

<h3>By car</h3>

There are a number of roads into Afghanistan:
<ul>
BULLET::::- From &lt;a href="Peshawar"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, via the &lt;a href="Khyber%20Pass"&gt;Khyber Pass&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Jalalabad"&gt;Jalalabad&lt;/a&gt;, in the east.
BULLET::::- From &lt;a href="Quetta"&gt;Quetta&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan, to &lt;a href="Kandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;, in the south.
BULLET::::- From &lt;a href="Mashad"&gt;Mashad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Herat"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt;, in the west.
BULLET::::- From &lt;a href="Termez"&gt;Termez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Uzbekistan"&gt;Uzbekistan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Mazar-e%20Sharif"&gt;Mazar-e Sharif&lt;/a&gt;, in the north.
BULLET::::- From &lt;a href="Tajikistan"&gt;Tajikistan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Kunduz"&gt;Kunduz&lt;/a&gt;, in the northwest.

</ul>
As of mid-2009, ♡❤♡none of these routes could be considered safe♡❤♡. The Khyber and the Quetta to Kandahar route were particularly dangerous.

<h3>By bus</h3>
Buses run regularly between &lt;a href="Jalalabad"&gt;Jalalabad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Peshawar"&gt;Peshawar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. Also, between &lt;a href="Herat"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Mashad"&gt;Mashad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;. Afghani buses are thoroughly checked by Iranian border police for possible drugs, so expect delays.

<h2>Get around</h2>
<h3>By plane</h3>
Planes fly between Kabul and the major cities (&lt;a href="Kandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Herat"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Mazar-e%20Sharif"&gt;Mazar-e Sharif&lt;/a&gt;) at varying frequency. If weather is suitable, flights are operated daily. Most flights depart cities in the mornings before 11:00 only. Civilian airplanes are not operated after sundown.

<h3>By car</h3>

There is a growing network of public transportation between the country's cities. Buses ply some routes and Toyota vehicles have a near monopoly on minivan (HiAce) and taxi (Corolla) transportation.

A new highway connects &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Mazar-i-Sharif"&gt;Mazar-i-Sharif&lt;/a&gt;. The highway is in good condition and is considered "relatively" safe. The trip takes a minimum of 5 hr. The highway goes through the famous Salang Mountains and cross the Hindu Kush mountain ranges. If you hire a ♡❤relatively♡❤ new Toyota Corolla, this would cost you about USD100 (if bargained by a local) for one direction from the ♡❤Mazar Station♡❤ in Kabul to anywhere in Mazar-i-Sharif.

There is no metered taxi in large parts of Afghanistan. Taxis are yellow and clearly identifiable. You should normally strike a deal with the driver before you take a seat. You can consider 2–3&amp;nbsp;km of road in ideal conditions to be around USD1 worth (AFN50).

Jeeps and Land Cruisers are available for hire along with drivers who speak some English (do not keep your hopes high that you might bump into one of them). There are tour operators in &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt; that can provide a car and guide; these people are available for hire at the Kabul International Airport itself. Petrol stations are scarce in the countryside, and fuel is expensive.

Paved roads are the exception, not the rule, and even those roads can be in poor repair. Once outside the major cities expect dirt roads (which turn to mud during rain or snow melt). The highway between Kabul and &lt;a href="Bagram"&gt;Bagram&lt;/a&gt; is dominated by military convoys and "jingle trucks".

A new highway links &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Kandahar"&gt;Kandahar&lt;/a&gt;. The highway is in good condition but should not be considered safe due to frequent attacks by anti-government forces such as the Taliban who often plant powerful mines (bombs) next to highways in which civilians are killed, and the poor standard of driving. The trip takes a minimum of 5 hours.

<h2>Talk</h2>
&lt;a href="Pashto%20phrasebook"&gt;Pashto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Dari%20phrasebook"&gt;Dari&lt;/a&gt;, an Afghan dialect of &lt;a href="Persian%20phrasebook"&gt;Persian&lt;/a&gt;, are the official languages of Afghanistan; many Afghans speak both. The latest CIA country profile mentions that Dari is spoken by about 50%, mainly in the Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e Sharif and Central Afghanistan regions. Pashto is spoken by 35%, mainly in the south and east; it is also spoken in neighbouring Pakistan. The remaining are Turkic native language, primarily &lt;a href="Uzbek%20phrasebook"&gt;Uzbek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Turkmen%20phrasebook"&gt;Turkmen&lt;/a&gt;, and there are also 30 minor languages such as Balochi. You'll find a few people in Kabul who speak a little English, but otherwise it isn't widely understood.

The English language is at its apex in Afghanistan. The percentage of those who now speak some English has reached unprecedented rates. President Karzai and his cabinet are fluent in English. English was taught in the past from the 7th grade, but now is taught from the fourth grade. Signs in English in the streets are becoming common now all over the country. English is the second foreign language in Afghanistan.

<h2>Buy</h2>
<h3>Money</h3>

The ♡❤♡Afghani♡❤♡ (♡❤♡AFN♡❤♡) is the currency of Afghanistan, denoted by the symbol "♡❤♡Af♡❤♡" or "♡❤♡؋♡❤♡" (ISO code: ♡❤♡AFN♡❤♡).

<h3>Carpets</h3>

&lt;a href="Haggling"&gt;Haggling&lt;/a&gt; is very much part of the tradition.

Afghanistan's most famous products are ♡❤♡carpets♡❤♡. There are carpets described as "Afghan", but also at least two other carpet-weaving traditions. The Baluchi tribes in the south and west weave fine rugs, and the Turkoman tribes in the north do as well; both groups are also found in neighbouring countries. All three types tend to use geometric patterns in the design, usually with red as the background colour and with repeated elements called "guls" to make the pattern. Generally, these are not as finely woven as carpets from the cities of neighbouring Iran. However, many of them are quite beautiful and their prices are (assuming good &lt;a href="haggling"&gt;haggling&lt;/a&gt;) well below those of the top Iranian carpets.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Baluchi rugs♡❤♡ are usually small since nomadic people cannot use large looms; sizes up to 1.5 by 2 metres (4 x 7 feet) are common, but not many beyond that. They are popular with travellers because they are fairly portable. One very common type is a prayer rug, just large enough for one person to kneel facing Mecca. Another is the "nomad's chest of drawers" &amp;mdash; a bag, often beautifully decorated, that is a saddlebag when travelling and hangs on the wall of the tent when camped.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Turkoman rugs♡❤♡, often labelled "Bokhara" in the Western rug trade, come in all sizes and a very broad range of quality. Some are woven by nomads, with the same range of sizes and types as Baluchi rugs. Others are made in city workshops; the best of these are almost as finely woven and almost as expensive as top-grade Persian carpets. One fairly common design is the Hatchli, a cross shape on a large rug.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Afghan rugs♡❤♡ are generally made in city workshops, mainly for the export trade. They are often large; 3 x 4 metres (10 x 12 feet) is common. Most are quite coarsely woven to keep costs down, but others have a fairly fine weave. If you need a big rug for the living room at a moderate price, these are likely to be your best choice.

</ul>

It is fairly common for rugs woven by nomads &amp;mdash; such as many Baluchi rugs and some Turkoman &amp;mdash; to show minor irregularities. The loom is dismantled for transport and re-assembled at the new camp, so the rug may not turn out perfectly rectangular. Vegetable dyes are often used, and these may vary from batch to batch, so some colour variation (♡❤arbrash♡❤) occurs and this may be accentuated as the rug fades. To collectors, most such irregularities fall into the "that's not a bug; it's a feature" category; they are expected and accepted. In fact, a nice arbrash can considerably increase the value of a rug.

Turkoman designs are widely copied; it is common to see "Bokhara" carpets from India or Pakistan, China produces some, and the Afghan carpet designs show heavy Turkoman influence. To collectors, though, the original Turkoman rugs are worth a good deal more. Good Baluchi rugs are also quite valuable in Western countries. Afghan rugs, or lower grade Baluchi and Turkoman rugs, generally are not collectors' items; most travellers will find the best buys among these. Experts might pay premium prices for the top-grade rugs, but amateurs trying that are very likely to get severely overcharged.

♡❤♡Kelims♡❤♡ are flat-woven fabric with no pile. These are nowhere near as tough as carpets and will not survive decades on the floor as a good carpet will. However, some are lovely, and they are generally cheaper than carpets. Things like purses made of carpet or decorated with kelim weave are also common.

<h3>Shopping</h3>
Another common product and popular souvenir is the Afghan ♡❤♡sheepskin coat♡❤♡. These have the wool on the inside for warmth and the leather on the outside to block wind, rain and snow. They often have lovely embroidery. Two cautions, though. One is that the makers use the embroidery to hide flaws in the leather; top-quality coats will have little or no embroidery. The other is that Australian customs have been known to incinerate these coats on arrival, to protect their large sheep population from diseases (notably anthrax) that poorly tanned Afghan products might carry.

There are also various bits of ♡❤♡metalwork♡❤♡ &amp;mdash; heavily decorated pots, vases and platters, and some quite nice ♡❤♡knives♡❤♡.

Guns are very common in Afghanistan and some are of considerable interest to historians and collectors.

<ul>
BULLET::::- The traditional Afghan jezail is a long ♡❤♡muzzle-loading rifle♡❤♡ often elaborately inlaid with brass or mother-of-pearl. Be cautious about actually firing one of these. The genuine ones are quite old, perhaps with metal fatigue or other problems. Many of the jezails available are not genuine, just copies made recently for the tourist trade; these were never designed to be fired and are more likely to kill the shooter than to hit a target.
BULLET::::- There are also ♡❤♡pass-made rifles♡❤♡, from the &lt;a href="Khyber%20Pass"&gt;Khyber Pass&lt;/a&gt; area. The most common are copies of the 19th-century British army Martini-Henry rifle, a single-shot lever action weapon. Some are .451 caliber like the original Martini-Henry, but some take a more modern round. .303 is common. Until the Russian invasion in the late 70s &amp;mdash; when anyone who could kill a Russian, rob an armoury, or pay the price (i.e., almost any Afghan) got an AK-47 &amp;mdash; these were the most common rifle in Afghanistan. There are also pass-made copies of various other guns, anything from Webley revolvers to AK-47s. Quality is often dodgy, in particular the steel is often of low quality, and firing any of these guns is risky. Ammunition made in the pass often contained less powder or lower-grade powder than the standard ammo; some pass-made guns blow up if subjected to the higher stress of standard ammo.

</ul>
These make a rather problematic souvenir. Importing a firearm anywhere can be difficult and it may be impossible in some places. If you are travelling overland and passing through several countries before you reach home, it is almost certainly not worth the trouble. Also, if you actually fire any Afghan gun, there is a risk that it will blow up in your face.

<h2>See</h2>
While ongoing violence has put an almost full stop to tourism in Afghanistan, the lack of visitors has nothing to do with the country's sights. This is a land full of mystical attractions, telling tales of ancient times and offering beautiful Islamic architecture, medieval city quarters and unexpectedly stunning nature.

Several sites are listed on &lt;a href="World_Heritage_List%23Afghanistan"&gt;UNESCO's World Heritage List&lt;/a&gt;. Most famous of course, were the ancient ♡❤♡Buddhist sculptures of &lt;a href="Bamiyan"&gt;Bamiyan&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. The Taliban destroyed most of the 6th century statues in a cultural crime that outraged the world. Today, what remains in the Bamiyan valley is the silencing and still worthwhile sight of the empty niches. The salvaged pieces of what were once the largest statues of their kind in the world continue to provide a fascinating insight in the history of this place.
♡❤♡&lt;a href="Band-e%20Amir%20National%20Park"&gt;Band-e Amir National Park&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, with its six interlinked lakes, is perhaps the finest natural attraction. At an altitude of 2900 meters, the blue waters in this protected natural area almost seem unreal against the sandy mountain sides that surround them.

Excellent mosques are to be found all around, with particularly grand examples in ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Mazar-i-Sharif"&gt;Mazar-i-Sharif&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and in the rapidly developing ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Herat"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. The ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Jam"&gt;Minaret of Jam&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, just north of &lt;a href="Herat"&gt;Herat&lt;/a&gt;, is UNESCO listed.

<h2>Do</h2>

<h2>Eat</h2>
There are three main types of Afghan bread:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Naan♡❤♡ - Literally "bread". Thin, long and oval shaped, its mainly a white/whole wheat blend. Topped with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, nigella seeds, or some combination of these. Upon request, customers may be able to get all white flour and a helping of oil, which makes it rich and delicious.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Obi Non♡❤♡ - Uzbek-style bread. Shaped like a disc and thicker than naan. Usually made with white flour.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Lavash♡❤♡ - Very thin bread. Similar to the lavash elsewhere. Usually used as plating for meats and stews.

</ul>
Rice dishes are the "king" of all foods in Afghanistan. The Afghans have certainly taken much time and effort in creating their rice dishes, as they are considered the best part of any meal. Wealthier families will eat one rice dish per day. The Afghan royalty spent much time on rice preparation and invention as evidenced in the sheer number of rice dishes in their cookbooks. Weddings and family gatherings must feature several rice dishes and certainly reputations can be made in the realm of rice preparation.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Kabuli Pulao♡❤♡ (or Kabuli Palaw, Qabili Palaw, Qabili Palau or simply Palau) - An Afghan rice dish consisting of steamed rice mixed with lentils, raisins, carrots, and lamb. It is baked in the oven and topped with fried sliced carrots and raisins. Chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds may be added as well. The meat is covered by the rice or buried in the middle of the dish. It is the most popular dish in Afghanistan, and is considered the national dish.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Chalao♡❤♡-White rice. Extra long grains such as Basmati is required. First parboiled, then drained, and finally baked in an oven with some oil, butter, and salt. This method creates a fluffy rice with each grain separated, unlike Chinese or Japanese rice. Chalao is served mainly with qormas (korma; stews or casseroles)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Palao♡❤♡ - Cooked the same as chalao, but either meat &amp; stock, qorma, herbs, or a combination are blended in before the baking process. This creates elaborate colors, flavors, and aromas for which some rices are named after. Caramelized sugar is also sometimes used to give the rice a rich brown color.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Yakhni Palao♡❤♡ - Meat &amp; stock added. Creates a brown rice.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Zamarod Palao♡❤♡ - Spinach qorma mixed in before the baking process, hence 'zamarod' or emerald.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Qorma Palao♡❤♡ - Qorm'eh Albokhara wa Dalnakhod mixed in before the baking process
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Bore Palao♡❤♡ - Qorm'eh Lawand added. Creates a yellow rice.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Bonjan-e-Roomi Palao♡❤♡ - Qorm'eh Bonjan-e-Roomi (tomato qorma) added at baking process. Creates a red rice.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Serkah Palao♡❤♡ - Similar to yakhni palao, but with vinegar and other spices.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Shebet Palao♡❤♡ - Fresh dill, raisins added at baking process.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Narenj Palao♡❤♡ - A sweet and elaborate rice dish made with saffron, orange peel, pistachios, almonds and chicken.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Maash Palao♡❤♡ - A sweet and sour palao baked with mung beans, apricots, and bulgur (a kind of wheat). Exclusively vegetarian.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Alou Balou Palao♡❤♡ - Sweet rice dish with cherries and chicken.
BULLET::::- Sticky Rices -Boiled medium grain rice cooked with its meat, herbs, and grains. Because the water is not drained, it forms a sticky rice texture. Notable dishes include Mastawa, Kecheri Qoroot, and Shola. When white rice is cooked to a sticky consistency it is called bata, and is usually eaten with a qorma, such as Sabzi (spinach) or Shalgham (turnips). A sweet rice dish called Shir Birenj (literally milk rice) is often served as dessert.

</ul>
♡❤♡Qorma♡❤♡ is a stew or casserole, usually served with chawol. Most qormas are onion-based. Onions are fried, then meat is added, as are a variety of fruits, spices, and vegetables depending on the recipe. Finally water is added and left to simmer. The onion caramelizes and creates a richly colored stew. There are over 100 qormas.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Qorma Alou-Bokhara wa Dalnakhod♡❤♡ - onion based, with sour plums, lentils, and cardamom. Veal or chicken.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Qorma Nadroo♡❤♡ - onion based, with yogurt, lotus roots, cilantro, and coriander. Lamb or veal.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Qorma Lawand♡❤♡ - onion based, with yogurt, turmeric, and cilantro. Chicken, lamb, or beef.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Qorma Sabzi♡❤♡ - sauteed spinach and other greens. Lamb
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Qorma Shalgham♡❤♡ - onion based, with turnips, sugar; sweet and sour taste. Lamb.

</ul>
Pasta is called "khameerbob" in Afghanistan and is often in the shape of dumplings. These native dishes are wildly popular. Due to the time-consuming process of creating the dough for the dumplings, it is rarely served at large gatherings such as weddings, but for more special occasions at home:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Mantu♡❤♡ - A dish of Uzbek origin. Dumplings filled with onion &amp; ground beef. Mantu is steamed and usually topped with a tomato-based sauce and a yogurt or qoroot-based sauce. The yogurt-based topping is usually a mixture of yogurt, sour cream, and garlic. The qoroot based sauce is made of goat cheese and is also mixed with garlic. Sometimes a qoroot and yogurt mixture will be used. The dish is then topped with dried mint.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Ashak♡❤♡ - Kabul dish. Dumplings filled with leeks. Boiled and then drained. Ashak is topped with garlic-mint qoroot or a garlic yogurt sauce and a well seasoned ground meat mixture.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Afghan kebab♡❤♡ is most often found in restaurants and outdoor vendor stalls. Sometimes they are put into shishas. Families rarely serve homemade kebab in their home due to the need of inaccessible equipment. The most widely used meat is lamb. Recipes differ with every restaurant, but Afghan kebab is usually marinated with a blend of spices, and served with naan, rarely rice. Customers have the option to sprinkle sumac, locally known as ghora, on their kebab. The quality of kebab is solely dependent on the quality of the meat. Pieces of fat from the sheep's tail (jijeq) are usually added with the lamb skewers to add extra flavor.Other popular kebabs include lamb chops, ribs, kofta (ground beef) and chicken; all of which are found in better restaurants.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Chapli kebab♡❤♡, a specialty of eastern Afghanistan, is a fried hamburger. The original recipe of chapli kebab dictates a half meat (or less), half flour mixture, which renders it lighter in taste, and less expensive.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Bolani♡❤♡, made in a very similar way as Mexican Quesadilla.

</ul>
♡❤♡Desserts and snacks♡❤♡
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Baklava♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Afghan Cake♡❤♡ (similar to pound cake sometimes with real fruit or jelly inside)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Gosh Feel♡❤♡ (thin, fried pastry covered in powdered sugar and ground pistachios)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Fernea♡❤♡ (milk and cornstarch very sweet, similar to rice pudding without the rice)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Mou-rubba♡❤♡ (fruit sauce, sugar syrup and fruits, apple, sour cherry, various berries or made with dried fruits "Afghan favorite is the Alu-Bakhara")
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Kulcha♡❤♡ (variety of cookies, baked in clay ovens with char-wood)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Narenge Palau♡❤♡ (dried sweet orange peel and green raisins with a variety of nuts mixed with yellow rice glazed with light sugar syrup)

</ul>
<h2>Drink</h2>
Since Afghanistan is an Islamic country, alcohol consumption is illegal. However, it is tolerated in Western restaurants in &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Sleep</h2>
Hotels and guesthouses are available in all major cities, and while some may not meet international standards they are usually friendly and reliable.

<h2>Work</h2>
Many foreigners are finding well-paid work in Afghanistan as part of the reconstruction efforts. Often with the UN or other non-governmental organisations. Most of these jobs are within &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;. Local wages are very low, especially outside of Kabul. However, everyone should read and understand the travel advice published by their respective governments or in the ♡❤♡Stay safe♡❤♡ section below.

You will need a work visa if you are planning on working on a US military base.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>

Afghanistan is a volatile country, and downright dangerous in the southern and eastern areas. ♡❤♡Non-essential travel is ♡❤strongly♡❤ discouraged♡❤♡. Banditry is somewhat of an ancient tradition in many parts of the country, including in the northern areas. In addition to that, the Taliban insurgents have declared abduction of foreigners to be one of their primary goals. In July 2007, 23 South Koreans were kidnapped from a public bus in Ghazni province, south of Kabul. Two of them were murdered while the rest were set free several weeks later after controversial negotiations with the South Korean government.

The northern part of the country is considered to be safer than the south and east; however, ♡❤♡occasional incidents can still occur anywhere and a seemingly safe place can become the opposite in an instant♡❤♡. Several reporters for German media were killed in the northern parts of Afghanistan, most likely by criminals or anti-westerners. 10 doctors (8 foreigners and 2 translators) were murdered in August 2010.

♡❤♡Landmines and other UXO (Unexploded Ordnance)♡❤♡ remain a problem across the country, so plan to ♡❤♡stick to well-worn paths, avoid red and white painted rocks, and do not touch or move any suspicious-looking item♡❤♡. According to the Afghan Red Crescent Society, approximately 600-700 people are injured or killed every year in accidents due to landmines and UXO. This is greatly reduced from over 1,600 in 2002. While travelling in Afghanistan you are likely to see mine clearance organisations at work.

♡❤♡Insects and snakes♡❤♡ are also something to be careful of, and the mountainous country has many vicious tiny creatures such as scorpions, spiders, centipedes, bees, etc.

In some areas, &lt;a href="altitude%20sickness"&gt;altitude sickness&lt;/a&gt; is a significant risk.

Homosexual activity between consenting adults is punishable by an assortment of harsh punishments, including death, under Afghan law. ♡❤♡LGBT travelers should exercise tremendous discretion♡❤♡.

If, after considering the risks, you still choose to travel in Afghanistan, hiring an armed escort or travelling with an experienced guide are ways to decrease the risks. You should also check with your embassy, and be clear on what they can and cannot do for you in an emergency.

<h2>Stay healthy</h2>
Afghanistan has its fair share of health issues, and it would be wise to consult a travel doctor ahead of your trip about vaccinations and health risks. Respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis and food-related illness are common, and &lt;a href="malaria"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; is a risk in many parts of the country.

Afghanistan is one of the dustiest countries in the world, and you should be prepared to be covered in it and breathing it for most of your stay, even in the major cities. Pollution from diesel engines can also make life unpleasant.

Flies are notoriously heinous here, likely due to poor sanitation. Winter brings some relief, but they come back full-strength when spring arrives.

Food should be approached with a discerning eye, as hygiene standards can often be lacking. Hot, freshly cooked food is generally safer. ♡❤♡Bottled &lt;a href="water"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is also advised, unless you have your own purification system.

Bring any prescription medicine you may need from your home country, and don't count on being able to find it locally. You may also consider carrying pain relievers and anti-diarrheals, as they'll be hard to find outside of major cities.

As in most parts of Asia, squat toilets are the norm, with toilet paper optional and sometimes scarce. Western-style toilets are seen occasionally in newer buildings and some private homes.

<h2>Respect</h2>
While the majority of women across Afghanistan still wear the ♡❤♡burqa♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡chadori♡❤♡, in cities like Kabul and Herat many opt for the Middle Eastern style hijab. Western women are highly encouraged to wear any type of head scarf (especially outside Kabul). As a general rule, the people get more conservative as you move further south.

<h2>Connect</h2>
Fixed line service is available in major cities (digital in &lt;a href="Kabul"&gt;Kabul&lt;/a&gt;) and mobile phones in most cities. SIM cards are available and international calls to Europe/US typically cost less than USD0.5/minute. Outside of major cities your options are limited to a satellite phone.

An Afghanistan number should is of the form codice_1 where "93" is the country code for Afghanistan, the next two digits are the area code and the remaining 7 digits are the "local" part of the subscriber number that can be called from within that particular area code using abbreviated dialing. You need to dial "0" in front of the geographic area code (of 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 for fixed lines) from outside that particular area code (but when still within Afghanistan).

<h3>Mobile phones</h3>

Mobile numbers in Afghanistan must always be dialed with all digits (10 digits, including a "0" prefixing the "70n" within Afghanistan), no matter where they are being called from. The ♡❤♡70n♡❤♡ is a mobile prefix, not an "area code", as such and the third digit (the ♡❤n♡❤ part) denotes the original mobile network assigned.
An example mobile number looks like codice_2.

Aflao is the coastal town in &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; bordering &lt;a href="Togo"&gt;Togo&lt;/a&gt;. While east of the Togolese side of the border the city is the capital, &lt;a href="Lome"&gt;Lome&lt;/a&gt;, the so-called 'Paris of West Africa', the Ghanaian town is a typical African border town built solely to service the movement of people and goods. There are a few restaurants and hotels and the rest of the economy is driven by street side currency converters who will give rates of varying attractiveness to convert Ghanaian Cedis to Togolese West African Francs.

<h1>Africa</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Africa♡❤♡ is the wellspring of the human race. The second largest continent in the world in both area and population, it offers the visitor a unique blend of natural wonders, renowned prehistoric sites, numerous and often sprawling remains of several of the world's greatest ancient civilizations, vibrant cultures, remote villages and modern cities. Africa has shorelines on the Indian Ocean to the southeast, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Red Sea to the northeast, the Gulf of Aden slightly further south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. This huge continent is more than 8,000&amp;nbsp;km (5,000&amp;nbsp;mi) across north-south and 7,500&amp;nbsp;km (4,800&amp;nbsp;mi) east-west with some islands even further out and contains many vastly different peoples, religions, and cultures. Africa has more than fifty sovereign countries&amp;mdash;the most of any continent.

Africa contains arguably the longest river in the world&amp;mdash;the 6,650&amp;nbsp;km-long (over 4,100 mi) Nile River running from &lt;a href="Burundi"&gt;Burundi&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;while the Congo River in the &lt;a href="DR%20Congo"&gt;DR Congo&lt;/a&gt; is the second largest in terms of discharge, and the deepest with a depth of over 230&amp;nbsp;m (750&amp;nbsp;ft) in some spots. &lt;a href="Tanzania"&gt;Tanzania's&lt;/a&gt; Mount Kilimanjaro is the world's tallest free-standing mountain at 5,890&amp;nbsp;m (19,340&amp;nbsp;ft). &lt;a href="Djibouti"&gt;Djibouti's&lt;/a&gt; Lake Assal is the second lowest point on Earth, the saltiest lake outside &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the hottest places on Earth. While the first activity most people associate with Africa is &lt;a href="safaris"&gt;safaris&lt;/a&gt;, there are endless possibilities for adventure. For example, you can purchase crafts in markets, venture into the Sahara with a Tuareg caravan, visit BaAka ("Pygmy") villages, hike through jungle to watch gorillas, relax on tropical islands in the Indian Ocean, snack on exotic treats, paddle down a river in a dugout ♡❤pirogue♡❤ or travel across savanna on a colonial-era railway.

Africa's cultural diversity cannot be overstated — most countries are internally diverse and there are huge differences between the Muslim countries in the north with their Arab- and Berber-influenced cultures and the Sub-Saharan nations, including the rainbow nation of South Africa that has strong European influences in addition to Bantu and other African traditions. It is also the continent with the largest genetic diversity among the population by far: There is far more genetic diversity among Africans than there is between Africans and inhabitants of any other continent. Despite what lacking media coverage might have led you to believe, Africa is not one country but over fifty different countries, making it impossible to make generalisations about "all of Africa". Also, due to the nature of colonial borders, most African countries are anything but homogeneous (for example, South Africa has 11 official languages), and culture, cuisine, language or even the dominant religion may change dramatically within a few hundred kilometers without ever crossing a border.

Despite rapidly growing economies in many places, there are still many pockets of poverty in both the &lt;a href="Maghreb"&gt;Maghreb&lt;/a&gt; and Sub-Saharan Africa. While poverty, corruption, and ethnic and religious violence exist in some parts of the continent, large parts of Africa have made impressive progress, with many cities that have growing middle classes and deal with problems such as traffic jams or crowded public transport, rather than the war or famine you might have heard about in some 1980s documentary or development aid commercial.

<h2>Regions</h2>
Most people outside the continent divide Africa into two regions: the Arabic-speaking North Africa, and everywhere else as Sub-Saharan Africa. However, Africa is a very diverse continent, and this division represents a somewhat shallow understanding.

<h2>Cities</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; Ghana's capital
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; Ethiopia's capital is one of Africa's "global cities" as a seat of both the African Union and many NGO's. Chinese investment built the AU headquarters and a new light rail.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; Egypt's bustling capital is the most populous city in North Africa and a gateway to the heritage of Ancient Egypt.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; the iconic ♡❤Mother City♡❤ of South Africa with Table Mountain, the Cape of Good Hope, and numerous other attractions.

BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; South Africa's largest city and perhaps the continent's key financial and economic centre.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; Angola's capital and largest city, which has been through a huge renaissance in the past decade.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; a blend of the ancient and modern in Morocco.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; the capital of Kenya, the largest city in East and Central Africa, and home to the only UN agency headquarters outside of Europe and the US.

BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; surely among the best known national parks in Africa
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; intended by the &lt;a href="Roman%20Empire"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt; as a model city, its ruins are still impressive

BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; burial place of several dozen Ancient Egyptian pharaohs and the site of King Tut's tomb
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; These waterfalls between Zimbabwe and Zambia are among the most impressive in the world
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; full of impressive tropical rain forest and volcanic scenery, trekking, and is perhaps the best place in the world to see the rare mountain gorillas.

</ul>
<h2>Understand</h2>

<h3>History</h3>
Non-Africans often think of Sub-Saharan Africa as being comprised only of hunter gatherer societies prior to European colonialism. However, these views often have their roots in racist pseudoscientific theories used by Europeans to justify slavery and later, colonialism from the 16th to early 20th centuries. While hunter gatherer societies were indeed widespread in much of the continent, many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa were in fact home to great cities and civilisations dating back to the medieval era. 

<h4>From the dawn of humanity to the first empires</h4>
Early precursors to human beings, most notably ♡❤Australopithecus afarensis♡❤ (named for the Afar region in &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;), the species "Lucy" belonged to, lived and walked on two feet as early as 3 million years ago. Remains of later species such as ♡❤Homo habilis♡❤ and ♡❤Homo erectus♡❤ (the first hominid to leave Africa, as far as we know) were found in other parts of East Africa such as Kenya, Tanzania and around the Great Lakes. ♡❤Homo sapiens♡❤ (modern humans), most likely originated either in Southern Africa or in East Africa somewhere in what is now Ethiopia or Kenya. The oldest homo sapiens remains to date are about 195,000 years old and were found in Ethiopia but there are also hints that ♡❤Homo sapiens♡❤ may have been present earlier in Southern Africa. Some of the remains of early hominids as well as their tools are on display in various museums in Ethiopia, Namibia and other countries. The &lt;a href="Cradle%20of%20Humankind"&gt;Cradle of Humankind&lt;/a&gt; is a site in South Africa with plenty of early human fossils.

North Africa has a recorded history dating back to about 3300 BCE with numerous buildings, ruins, writings, arts, and crafts which have left traces for us to marvel at. The ancient ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Ancient%20Egypt"&gt;Pharaonic civilization&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ based in Egypt was the most enduring and among the most impressive ancient civilizations. Egypt was one of the earliest cultures to build monumental buildings, form a hierarchical state and wage large scale warfare with standing armies, and was one of the stablest empires in recorded history, frequently surviving and absorbing foreign invaders, immigrants and usurpers and turning them (culturally) Egyptian.

South of the Pharaonic civilization and sometimes in their sphere of influence was the &lt;a href="Nubia"&gt;Nubia&lt;/a&gt;n culture, which had a long history of mutual influence with its northern neighbors and even came to rule over Egypt for a short time. Their most famous remnants are the pyramids of &lt;a href="Meroe"&gt;Meroe&lt;/a&gt;, Sudan. Another early centre of settled civilization and later an early centre of Christianity outside the Roman Empire was Ethiopia, where the &lt;a href="Aksum"&gt;Aksumite&lt;/a&gt; Empire reigned between the fourth century BCE and the 7th century CE and served as an important trading partner of both Indian and Mediterranean powers.

Today, the legacy of ancient African civilizations lives on; many of their monuments, temples and cities are well-preserved and have become popular tourist attractions, and museums host their artifacts. Modern Jews believe themselves to be descendants of slaves from ancient Egypt and Ethiopians of all religions believe they are the descendants of the union of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon (Sheba thought by most to refer to what is now the nation of &lt;a href="Yemen"&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, but the queen is believed by many to have also ruled Ethiopia). Yet outside of North Africa, Sudan and Ethiopia, very little is known about African history prior to 1000CE, as most people were hunter-gatherers (similar to some cultures still found today on the continent), with no writing systems nor lasting structures, arts, or crafts, aside from some &lt;a href="cave"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; paintings.

<h4>Classical antiquity</h4>

The Phoenicians, based in what's now &lt;a href="Lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt; and part of the coasts of &lt;a href="Syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, colonized North Africa, and established the city of &lt;a href="Carthage"&gt;Carthage&lt;/a&gt; (now a suburb of &lt;a href="Tunis"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt;). Eventually, the Carthaginian Republic became a separate one, and a rival of the Romans as the dominant power in the Mediterranean. The Romans destroyed Carthage in the Third Punic War in 146 BCE, burning it to the ground.
In the period after 360 BCE, ♡❤♡Europeans invaded♡❤♡ the continent. Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered what were then the Egyptian parts of the Persian Empire in 326 BCE, founded a &lt;a href="Alexandria"&gt;city named after him&lt;/a&gt; and had himself declared pharaoh. Egypt would come under the rule of one of his generals after Alexander's death and under the Ptolemaic dynasty, Alexandria became one of the leading centres of Jewish, Greek and Egyptian philosophy and culture. It was here that a library holding "the wisdom of the ancient world" stood and it was here that the Jewish holy books were translated into Koine Greek. Starting with the Punic wars, the Romans entered the African picture as a major picture, and they founded cities such as &lt;a href="Leptis%20Magna"&gt;Leptis Magna&lt;/a&gt;, before the partially hellenized Egypt also became Roman in 31 BCE. Northern Africa and later &lt;a href="Nubia"&gt;Nubia&lt;/a&gt; and Ethiopia were also among the earliest centres of Christianity with the first Christians in the area already by the first century CE, even before Christianity would spread to other parts of the Roman Empire. A famous letter exchange of Plinius the younger (then governor in Carthage) and emperor Trajan is among the best known sources of the treatment of Christians in the second century CE. Few documents from this time remain, but evidence suggests that heterodox forms of Christianity such as Gnosticism, which were not in line with the officially sanctioned version practiced in Constantinople, were popular in Northern Africa, and Egypt seems to have been a centre of precursors of Christian monasteries and of apocryphal gospels (i.e. religious texts not included in the "official" Bible). Gnostic Christianity, which was very prevalent in Egypt starting in the 2nd century CE, was largely crushed there by the 5th century, but left behind important papyri such as the Gnostic Gospels, which were discovered in &lt;a href="Nag%20Hammadi"&gt;Nag Hammadi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Upper%20Egypt"&gt;Upper Egypt&lt;/a&gt; in 1945 and have been translated into many languages. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church also recognises several apocryphal gospels, which were not included in the canon by European churches, as being part of the canon to this day.

<h4>Muslim conquest</h4>
The ♡❤♡Muslim invasion♡❤♡ and the beginning of the ♡❤♡Arab Slave Trade♡❤♡ in the 7th century CE changed the cultural landscape of Northern and much of Eastern and Western Africa. The newly formed &lt;a href="Islam%23The_Caliphates"&gt;Arab caliphate&lt;/a&gt; conquered North Africa and the Horn of Africa within a few decades. Due to the shrewd policy of nominal toleration combined with taxation for Christians and Jews, the Muslim conquerors were able to pacify and religiously assimilate the conquered areas remarkably fast. Some scholars have suggested that the aforementioned heterodoxy in much of the African provinces of the Roman Empire helped in the easy conquest by the Islamic conquerors who were more tolerant (or at least indifferent towards) forms of Christianity not in line with Constantinople. In the west, Berbers intermarried with the Arab invaders to become the Moorish population that later invaded the Iberian Peninsula. When Damascus was invaded in the early eighth century, the Islamic religious and political centre of the Mediterranean shifted to &lt;a href="Kairouan"&gt;Kairouan&lt;/a&gt; in Tunisia. Their progress was limited only by the dense forests of West and Central Africa and to coastal areas in the East. The last region to come under Muslim influence was that of &lt;a href="Nubia"&gt;Nubia&lt;/a&gt; (modern-day northern Sudan) in the 14th century. While some of the Christian and Jewish heritage is still visible in Northern Africa, actual followers of those religions have become few and far between and Islam is culturally very dominant from Egypt to Morocco and south to Sudan and the northern parts of Nigeria. While Christianity is shrinking due to conversion and emigration from its erstwhile centres in Egypt and elsewhere, Judaism virtually disappeared in the decades following the establishment of Israel when most Jews left or were forced out. That being said, Jewish communities continue to survive in Tunisia and Morocco, albeit with much smaller populations than before the establishment of Israel.

The 7th-9th centuries were a period of significant change to the history of sub-Saharan Africa. In the west, there was a rise of large and powerful inland kingdoms, such as the ♡❤♡Ghana♡❤♡ (in Mali &amp; Mauritania, no relation to modern Ghana, capital in &lt;a href="Koumbi%20Saleh"&gt;Koumbi Saleh&lt;/a&gt;), ♡❤♡Dahomey♡❤♡ (which lasted until French capture in 1894, now Benin, capital in &lt;a href="Abomey"&gt;Abomey&lt;/a&gt;), ♡❤♡Za/Gao♡❤♡ (in Mali and Niger), ♡❤♡Kanem♡❤♡ (in Chad), and ♡❤♡Bornu♡❤♡ (in Nigeria). As many of these kingdoms converted to Islam (usually the conversion of a king included the conversion of his subordinates, at least nominally), trans-Saharan trade grew as salt and gold were transported to Libya and Egypt in large caravans&amp;mdash;a trade made possible by the introduction of camels from Arabia in the 10th century that would support much of the area from northern Nigeria west to Mali and Mauritania until the 19th century. The introduction of Islam also brought writing to many African civilisations for the first time, with some of their cities eventually growing into major centres of Islamic scholarship. During the 13th-16th centuries, many of these early kingdoms were replaced with new empires, chief among them the ♡❤♡Mali♡❤♡ (in Mali, Guinea, and Senegal), ♡❤♡Kongo♡❤♡ (in Angola, Gabon, Republic of the Congo and Democratic Republic of the Congo, capital in &lt;a href="M%27banza-Kongo"&gt;M'banza-Kongo&lt;/a&gt;), and later ♡❤♡Songhay♡❤♡ (in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, capital &lt;a href="Gao"&gt;Gao&lt;/a&gt;), ♡❤♡Ashanti♡❤♡ (in Ghana, capital in &lt;a href="Kumasi"&gt;Kumasi&lt;/a&gt;) and a plethora of small, single-ethnicity kingdoms and city-states sprouted. Many of Mali's popular tourist destinations, including &lt;a href="Timbuktu"&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Djenne"&gt;Djenne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Gao"&gt;Gao&lt;/a&gt;, rose to prominence during this period as they became hubs of trade and Islamic scholarship. Mansa Musa, one of the kings of Mali, is often said to have been the richest person in history. The Hausa people in northern Nigeria began organizing in walled city states, of which remnants remain in &lt;a href="Kano"&gt;Kano&lt;/a&gt;, and would eventually consolidate into the ♡❤♡Sokoto Caliphate♡❤♡ (1804-1903), with its capital in modern-day &lt;a href="Sokoto"&gt;Sokoto&lt;/a&gt;. Coastal, forested West Africa remained largely unorganized, with the exceptions of a few Yoruba city-states of &lt;a href="Benin%20City"&gt;Benin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ife"&gt;Ife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Oyo"&gt;Oyo&lt;/a&gt;, along with small Dahomey and Igbo empires all in modern-day Benin and Nigeria.

Meanwhile, Islamic influence and prosperity from ♡❤♡Indian Ocean trade♡❤♡ rose in East Africa as ships from Arabia, Persia, India, and as far as Southeast Asia dropped anchor in major ports from Somalia down to Mozambique, bringing spices and in return for slaves and ivory. This area, known as the ♡❤♡Swahili Coast♡❤♡, would become home to many city-states such as &lt;a href="Kilwa%20Kisiwani"&gt;Kilwa Kisiwani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mombasa"&gt;Mombasa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Zanzibar"&gt;Zanzibar&lt;/a&gt;. Between the 7th and 19th centuries, over 18 million people were taken from the region as part of the Arab slave trade&amp;mdash;roughly twice as many as the Atlantic slave trade would take to the Americas. Today, that influence remains in the culture and gastronomy of many places, most notably on the Indian Ocean islands such as Zanzibar, Comoros, the Seychelles, and Mauritius, and descendents of these slaves would go on to form the Siddi community in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, who continue to preserve many African traditions despite now speaking Indian rather than African languages.
Southern Africa remained largely undeveloped, with primarily nomadic hunter-gatherers such as the San people, but it did contain some small kingdoms. The ♡❤♡Kingdom of Zimbabwe♡❤♡ (namesake of today's state) was one of the most notable, constructing the greatest stone structures in pre-colonial sub-Saharan Africa at their capital &lt;a href="Great%20Zimbabwe"&gt;Great Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe in modern eastern South Africa also left smaller stone ruins. Both profited from the trade in gold and ivory with Arab and Asian merchants.

Despite the spread of Islam, Ethiopia would continue to hold fast as a bastion of Christianity. Among the most impressive examples of Christian architecture dating to this period are the 13th century rock-cut churches of &lt;a href="Lalibela"&gt;Lalibela&lt;/a&gt;.

<h4>European exploration and early colonialism</h4>
While a few Genoese, Castillian, and French explorers managed to reach parts of West Africa in the Middle Ages, ♡❤♡European exploration♡❤♡ of the continent began in earnest when Prince Henry "the Navigator" set out to acquire African territory for Portugal in the mid-15th century. The ♡❤♡Portuguese♡❤♡ reached Cape Verde in 1445, and by 1480, had charted the course to and began trade with the entire Guinea coast (modern Guinea-Bissau to Nigeria). In 1482, Diogo Cão reached the mouth of the Congo River, in 1488 Bartolomeu Dias reached the Cape of Good Hope (the southern tip of Africa), and in 1498 Vasco da Gama sailed up the eastern coast, where in Kenya his expedition set up a trading post at &lt;a href="Malindi"&gt;Malindi&lt;/a&gt; before finding a guide to take them to India.

This voyage established the &lt;a href="Cape%20Route"&gt;Cape Route&lt;/a&gt; around Africa. The Portuguese set up numerous forts along the African coast and established a highly profitable trade, (initially) held good relations with locals, and remained the dominant European power in the region until the 17th century while Spain, France, and Britain began exploring the Americas.
The lucrative trade and large amounts of gold obtained by the Portuguese lured other nations to the continent. As the demands for labor in the Americas grew, Portuguese sailors began taking shiploads of slaves to the Americas, beginning the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade"&gt;Atlantic slave trade&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. In the early 17th century, the ♡❤♡Dutch♡❤♡ fought the Portuguese to win control of most of their West and Central African ports, some of which (for example, &lt;a href="Luanda"&gt;Luanda&lt;/a&gt;) would be retaken later, and established a couple dozen forts of their own, notably at Goree Island in &lt;a href="Dakar"&gt;Dakar&lt;/a&gt; and at the Cape of Good Hope&amp;mdash;a port they hoped to use for trade routes to East Asia and which has become modern-day &lt;a href="Cape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt;. In 1642, the French built their first fort on Madagascar (which they claimed in 1667) and in 1663, the British built their first fort on the continent in the &lt;a href="Gambia"&gt;Gambia&lt;/a&gt;. Swedish merchants established a fort on &lt;a href="Cape%20Coast"&gt;Cape Coast&lt;/a&gt;, which later was overpowered by the Danish nearby at modern Accra.

<h4>19th-century imperialism</h4>
In the 19th century, European attention shifted from establishing coastal ports for trade to fighting one another to colonize the continent and explore its uncharted interior. With slavery abolished by Britain and their strong efforts to thwart slavery around the world, Europe began to look for other sources of wealth on the continent. The most successful European colony, the Dutch ♡❤♡Cape Colony♡❤♡, was seized by the British in 1795. Napoleonic France conquered Egypt in 1798, notably discovering the Rosetta Stone, only to be forced out by the British and then the Ottoman Turks. France invaded a significant amount of coastal West Africa and the Barbary states in Algeria, cutting rampant piracy in the region. Accounts of brave adventurers travelling inland to find places such as Mount Kilimanjaro and rumoured "inland sea" (the Great Lakes) and city of gold on the Nile sparked a wave of exploration in the mid-century primarily by Jesuit and other Catholic missionaries in the Southern, Eastern and Great Lakes regions of Africa. Chief among explorers was the British national hero ♡❤♡David Livingstone♡❤♡, who as a poor missionary with few porters explored much of Southern and Eastern Africa, flowed down the Congo River from its sources, and sought the source of the Nile. In West and Central Africa, French, Belgian and Spanish explorers ventured into the Sahara to find the legendary Timbuktu and Malian gold mines and the Congo in search of the Pygmies and hairy, large peoples (gorillas) of Greek legend.
As accounts of Africa's interior reached Europe, nations and merchants began to view the continent as a major source of commerce and wealth, similar to their Asian exploits, while the philanthropic and missionary class saw a great opportunity to "Christianize" and "civilize" the "savage" people of Africa. With social Darwinism introduced, many countries saw Africa as a great opportunity to establish colonial empires and establish their pre-eminence among other European nations — chiefly Germany, to catch up with other European nations, and France, to regain glories lost in North America and under Napoleon. Britain and Portugal joined this ♡❤♡Scramble for Africa♡❤♡ when they saw their interests threatened. In 1885, the ♡❤♡Berlin Conference♡❤♡ brought together European colonial powers to carve up the continent into defined colonial territories with many straight lines and no input from any African kingdom or settlement. Following the Berlin meeting, Italy was designated as a 'protector' over Ethiopia. In 1898, Italy waged an all-out war to colonize Ethiopia and they were defeated at the battle of ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Adwa"&gt;Adwa&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. This was possible because all Ethiopians came together under emperor Menelik II to stand together, more important however was that Ethiopia was armed with European weapons and thus the disparity of arms was not as decisively in the European favor as elsewhere. This marks the first time Africans defeated European invaders, and made Ethiopia the only African country that was never colonised by a foreign power (Liberia, the other country that survived the Scramble for Africa, was formerly a U.S. territory).

At the same time, disaster was befalling the people of the Congo, a land awarded to &lt;a href="Belgium"&gt;Belgium&lt;/a&gt; at the Berlin Conference and treated as the private property of King Leopold II, who proceeded to enslave the people and subject them to mass killings and mutilations when production targets for rubber were not achieved. Millions of people were killed in a genocide which extended into the 20th century, ending only in 1908 when worldwide criticism forced the king to relinquish his private ownership over the land and it was turned into a Belgian colony under the control of their parliament. Joseph Conrad wrote the novel ♡❤Heart of Darkness♡❤ from his experience as a witness to some of these crimes, which were also condemned in the satirical pamphlet ♡❤King Leopold's Soliloquy♡❤ by Mark Twain and another pamphlet, ♡❤The Crime of the Congo♡❤, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

Colonialism would be devastating to many of Africa's civilisations, with the most notable casualties arguably being Benin City and Kumasi, both of which were great pre-colonial cities that were razed to the ground by the invading British in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many cultural artifacts from both cities, as well as other civilisations, were looted in the ensuing wars, and these are now mostly on display in various museums in Western world, such as the British Museum, Louvre and Metropolitan Museum of Art.

At the turn of the 20th century, Britain began a series of deadly ♡❤♡South African Wars♡❤♡ from their Cape Colony into surrounding African and Boer (white descendants of the Dutch) lands in modern South Africa, which brought ♡❤♡Cecil Rhodes♡❤♡ to fame for his vision to unite Africa under British rule from Cairo to Cape Town. There was one &lt;a href="World%20War%20I"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; battle in German East Africa (Tanzania) which the British lost, although post-war, German possessions were divided among France, Belgium and the UK with South Africa ♡❤de facto♡❤ taking over what is now &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; until 1990. The Union of South Africa was granted independence from the UK in 1930 and the Afrikaner minority voted to become a Republic in 1960. During ♡❤♡&lt;a href="World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe"&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, Ethiopia was occupied for three years by Italy, and major fighting took place in North Africa through which the Nazis were eventually evicted by the Allies. It was the social changes stemming from the war, in which tens of thousands of Africans fought for their colonial power, and the Atlantic Charter which led to the spread of nationalistic movements after the war.

<h4>Decolonization and the legacy of the colonizers</h4>

The ♡❤♡decolonization♡❤♡ of Africa began with Libyan independence from Italy in 1951. Colonial powers employed varying means of control over their colonies, some granting natives representation in the government and cultivating a select few civil servants while others maintained a firm grip with an all-European government. In some countries, nationalist movements were quashed and their leaders killed or jailed, while others were able to peacefully achieve independence. In the 1950s, Guinea, Ghana and North African nations gained independence non-violently. In Algeria, France violently fought independence movements until 1963. With the establishment and new constitution of France's Fifth Republic in 1958, French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa ceased to exist, and after a brief "community" with France, the countries of these regions gained independence in 1960. By 1970, all but a handful of African nations were independent. The Portuguese bitterly fought to maintain their African possessions until 1975; all but one gained independence through war. Zimbabwe was the last major colony to gain independence from a non-African colonial overlord, in 1980, following a 14-year period of rule by a white minority government not recognized by Britain, the former colonial power. In 1990, semi-autonomous Namibia gained independence from South Africa and in 1993, Eritrea separated from Ethiopia following a protracted war. South Africa remained under firm control by its white minority, suppressing its black population under a system called ♡❤♡apartheid♡❤♡ until 1994. Morocco maintains control over Western Sahara despite an established independence movement, and this remains a point of contention between Morocco and Algeria. Following years of civil war, South Sudan became independent after a referendum was held in 2011.

Europeans divided Africa with complete disregard for the cultures and ethnic groups in Africa, often dividing a people between two or more countries and forcing peoples with a history of fighting or differing religions into one country. Additionally, a lack of training in civil service before and even after independence left most countries with dysfunctional governments. Leaders tended to reward their own ethnic groups with jobs and money, and in many cases oppressed other ethnic groups. This has been a cause of much strife post-independence across much of sub-Saharan Africa and has led to dozens of prolonged ♡❤♡civil wars♡❤♡ (notably in Sudan, Angola, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), genocides (notably the Rwandan Genocide), countless coups, and countless inept, corrupt leaders. During the cold war some leaders played the big power blocs against each other while others stayed in power mostly because they were backed by either side. Especially after the cold war ended, some countries such as Somalia descended into protracted internal fighting and are considered failed states as nobody really has any power over the state as a whole and local rackets and militias are unable to provide more than the most basic government functions (with the exception, in that case, of the formerly British-occupied area of &lt;a href="Somaliland"&gt;Somaliland&lt;/a&gt;). The discovery of valuable natural resources such as oil, uranium, diamonds, and coltan (columbite–tantalite, an ore from which the rare earth metals niobium and tantalum, in very high demand for technological products such as cell phones, are extracted) is one of the reasons separatist movements have sprung up, motivated in part by the greed of warlords and in part by the neglect of resource-rich areas that want a share in the profits, like the oil-rich exclave of &lt;a href="Cabinda"&gt;Cabinda&lt;/a&gt;, Angola and the &lt;a href="Southeast%20Nigeria"&gt;Niger Delta&lt;/a&gt; in Nigeria.

Fortunately, there are numerous examples in Africa where past conflict has made way for functional governments, offering some hope for the future of Africa. The bleak picture often painted of Africa as a whole could not be further from the truth in many places and thanks to tourism, more stable and accountable governance and rapidly growing economies, some African countries are now looking towards a bright future of which the first signs are already visible.

<h3>Climate</h3>
As the second largest continent, there is a wide range of climates to be found. However, since the continent is nearly centred on the equator, much of the continent is quite warm/temperate with very few, small areas on the continent experiencing any temperatures that can be considered "cold". In the temperate regions (parts of northern Morocco &amp; the Mediterranean coast as well as South Africa), temperatures generally range from the 10s C to the mid-30s°C (40s-90s°F) year round. Closer to the equator and on islands like Cape Verde or Mauritius, temperatures may only vary less than 20 degrees Celsius (15-35°C/65-95°F) throughout the year. In the deserts and arid regions like the Sahel and Horn of Africa, temperatures routinely hit 40°C or higher (and even 50°C or higher in the heart of the Sahara) but because sand does not retain heat like moist soil does, those same places can easily fall down to 15°C at night. There are a few bastions of cooler weather, however. Higher elevations, such as the &lt;a href="Atlas%20Mountains"&gt;Atlas Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in Morocco &amp; Algeria or the mountains in Lesotho, are quite cold and snowy during winter and Mount Kilimanjaro, almost on the equator, is cold year-round (cold enough to support glaciers!). Peaks on islands such as &lt;a href="Reunion"&gt;Reunion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Canary%20Islands"&gt;Canary Islands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; and other countries are cool enough to necessitate a jacket much of the year.

A far more important factor to consider when travelling to Africa is when the ♡❤♡rain/monsoon season♡❤♡ occurs. Timing varies a bit even in neighbouring countries, so check the page of the country you are visiting for more info. In West Africa the season starts in March around Cameroon, but not until June in Senegal or the Sahel and ends around September. While rain may not be a huge factor when travelling to southern or East Africa, it is very problematic in West Africa and on islands in the Indian Ocean. In West Africa, rains will often flood and make many roads and railways impassable and, due to poor drainage, can literally result in rivers of water flowing down streets and sewage lines overflowing. In the Sahel, it can result in flash floods in low-lying areas. In fact it is said that drowning is the most common cause of death in the desert, as flash floods can surprise people walking in wadis (dry riverbeds).

The largest weather-related dangers for travellers to Africa other than flooding are ♡❤♡lightning♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡tropical cyclones♡❤♡. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has more lightning strikes each year than any other country on earth, especially in the eastern part of the country near &lt;a href="Goma"&gt;Goma&lt;/a&gt;. Lightning risk is highest from western Kenya/Tanzania and Ethiopia west to Senegal and south to Angola, Zambia and the Northern parts of South Africa. Tropical cyclones affect the islands of the Indian Ocean, with the season running from 15 November-30 April (15 May in the Seychelles &amp; Mauritius). Tropical cyclones also infrequently affect the horn of Africa near Djibouti &amp; Somalia, but when they do, the arid land results in major flooding. Tropical cyclones often form off the coast of western West Africa (Guinea/Senegal) during the early part of the Atlantic Hurricane Season (June–August) and will rarely impact &lt;a href="Cape%20Verde"&gt;Cape Verde&lt;/a&gt;, for which these particular storms are called "Cape Verde-type hurricanes".

<h3>Politics</h3>
After Africa's messy divorce from its European colonial powers, many African countries became mired in political power struggles and civil war. Since the 1980s, however, the nations of this continent have drawn closer and many conflicts on the continent have seen neighbouring countries intervene positively rather than intervention/invasion by European and Western powers. Most African countries are developing democracies—struggling with corruption, but moving towards democratic values, like free and fair elections, freedom of speech, and involvement in government by several strata of society.

Nevertheless, there are a few countries which still retain authoritarian governments, dictatorships, and kleptocracies. Prior to peace agreements ending civil war in each, Angola and Mozambique were Communist one-party states and remain under the control of these parties, which have shifted from Marxist-Leninist to far-left/socialist ideology and retain Communist symbols in their flags, coats of arms, national anthems, and other national symbols. Equatorial Guinea and Eritrea remain among the most authoritarian countries on Earth, with severe repression of opposition.

Several national governments have a weak hold of their territory, such as Somalia, both Congos, the Central African Republic, Chad, Libya and Mali. In addition to national governments, some "tribes" continue to retain kings/chiefs recognized by the national government as well as local people and are sometimes even given limited autonomy/authority over "tribal" lands. The problem of "tribalism" that plagues many African countries is somewhat of a misnomer, as many of these "tribes" are ethnically and linguistically more diverse and different from each other than most European ethnicities, and often they were forced to live in one state due to the arbitrary nature of colonial borders. Still in some African countries ethnic and personal loyalties were more important than party ties or ideologies and the marginalized ethnicities often strived to overturn these regimes, only to replace them with one dominated by their ethnicity. 

Today, more than at any time in the continent's history, the nations of the continent are cooperating on important issues and increasingly relying on themselves to stop conflict and broker peace, rather than allowing the UN and Western powers to do so. The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.au.int/en/"&gt;♡❤♡African Union♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤♡AU♡❤♡) is the continent's answer to the United Nations and promotes unity and the resolution of conflicts. It was established in 2002, with its administrative seat in &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;, and represents all African nations and territory, and various European possessions in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. The AU has been able to achieve some accomplishments in promoting human rights, development, economic integration, harmonizing business/customs/immigration rules, and intervening to stop conflicts (notably in &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;) and unconstitutional power plays in member states. However, much work remains to be done and corruption remains rampant, numerous countries suffer from political/ethnic strife, and quality measures in development, education, health, and human rights remain low.

<h4>European influence and development aid</h4>
European colonial powers remained active in many nations post-independence; France retains close diplomatic ties with many of its former colonies, and many of the others, such as the United Kingdom, Portugal and Belgium, have large African immigrant communities originating from their respective former colonies. The U.S., largely unburdened by the "former colonial power" stigma, has long been active in promoting conflict resolution, human rights, and providing development aid and emergency assistance. While development aid rarely exceeds 1% of the donor countries' budgets, some African countries are or have in the past been dependent on aid money and credits from countries and international institutions such as the World Bank. While there has been a change in focus from large-scale projects such as dams and highways to more local initiatives such as rural electrification or public transport for individual cities, the topic remains controversial and some African voices have even called for an end to development aid altogether. Another problem with the World Bank credits is that new (democratic) governments often have to pay back old credits that their (authoritarian, kleptocratic) predecessor have taken out and wasted or outright embezzled, thus forcing their political agenda to conform to the wishes of the World Bank in large part instead of their own people. The question whether some or all of those "onerous loans" should or could be forgiven is another contentious issue between the (mostly European and North American) creditor nations and the African debtors. Another source of money for many people as well as countries is so-called "remittances" — that is, money that emigrants from African countries send back to their friends and relatives in their former home countries. While this has sometimes helped grow local economies and bring direly needed investment, the extreme dependence of some areas on this source of revenue has created a great deal of economic problems. As a traveller you will probably notice that Western Union and similar services are available almost ubiquitously, as they are frequently used for the purpose of receiving remittances.

<h4>Chinese influence</h4>
China has notably been a major player on the continent since 2000 and Western diplomats are now trying to play catch-up and fight for influence with China. The Chinese demand for natural resources is great and the Chinese have accosted many African governments without the stigma of being a rich, Western nation or caring much about the values (human rights, political freedom, etc.) of the governments they deal with. Another selling point for them is the large number of state-run companies they have and the integration between the Chinese government and the state-owned companies they use to mine and build roads and infrastructure compared to the relationship between Western governments and private businesses. China has largely sought mineral rights by building infrastructure and seeking lucrative concessions for their state-owned companies as up-front "payment" for resources to be later extracted. When building, they will almost always import Chinese workers to complete such projects, while the native Africans are rarely if ever employed. As a result it is not uncommon to see teams of hundreds of Chinese camped along and working to build a new road or housing project. The most auspicious gift from the Chinese is likely the new US$200 million headquarters complex for the African Union, built and financed by China and opened in 2012. Whether the Chinese involvement proves beneficial or just another form of neo-colonialism remains to be seen and is a controversial topic both inside the countries China is involved in and outside of them. The Chinese, much like the Americans and European colonial powers before them, build infrastructure primarily to serve their own interests and not to serve the people of the country they do it in. A railway for example is more likely to connect a mine and a port than two important cities.

<h3>Religion</h3>

The primary religions of Africa are &lt;a href="Christianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;, with a sizable number of irreligious/atheist Africans and adherents to traditional religions. The exact percentages of religious adherents vary widely among respected sources, with roughly 40-45% Christian, 40-50% Muslim, 10-15% indigenous beliefs and 5-10% irreligious.

Christianity is spread across a large region, encompassing nearly all of Southern, Central and Eastern Africa, and has a long history in Africa. Egypt is closely associated with early Christian Church history. Ethiopia was among the first nations to adopt Christianity as their official religion (in 330&amp;nbsp;C.E.) Most Christians are Protestant or Roman Catholic and mix it with indigenous beliefs, except for the Orthodox populations of Egypt, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Christian missionaries and the desire to "civilize" tribal Africans through conversion was a major drive of European colonization.

Islam is the largest religion on the continent by number of adherents (according to most sources) but, bolstered by the large Muslim populations of Egypt and Nigeria, covers a smaller geographic footprint. All North African countries are 97-100% Muslim except Egypt (not far behind, at 90%). Nearly all of West and Sahelian Africa is also majority Muslim, except for Cape Verde, Liberia, Ghana, Benin and Togo. Nigeria, Chad and Cote d'Ivoire are all about equally split between Muslim populations in the north and Christians in the south. Islam was first brought to the continent in the centuries after its birth, spreading across northern Africa and later spread down the Indian Ocean coast by merchants and seafarers to the coasts of Kenya, Tanzania and the Comoros. The Swahili language is strongly influenced by Arabic. Most Muslims are Sunni, with a large population of moderate Sufis in West Africa and Sudan, who often blend Sunni Islam with traditional beliefs. An attempt has been made to promote more conservative forms of Islam since the 1990s, through Muslim NGOs and Saudi Arabian assistance, although this coincides with a fear of radicalisation and the emergence of al Qaeda and other Islamist groups in parts of North Africa and the Sahel (particularly Mali, Niger and Algeria). In certain Muslim regions, adherence to religious law is expected such as no alcohol consumption (but khat is fine, ♡❤where legal♡❤) and the covering of women's limbs, and extreme offence is taken when these rules are broken or, worse, Islam or its prophets are insulted.

Traditional African religions are practiced by many Africans either exclusively or as syncretic elements woven into their practice of Christianity or Islam. There is no single uniting aspect to these religions beyond the fact that they all rely on oral tradition and animism. In some cases, the belief isn't in particular deities, but rather "magic". Among common, but certainly not universal, elements of indigenous African religions are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Recognition of one god or dual gods and respect for natural elements as supernatural beings
BULLET::::- Respect of the cyclical nature of life (agriculture, rain/drought, wax/wane of the moon)—the "circle of life";
BULLET::::- Communication with ancestors is practised or integral to communication with god and other deities;
BULLET::::- Medicine men and traditional healers are consulted for a broad range of topics, such as physical, psychological, spiritual, moral, and legal matters. They may also facilitate communication with ancestral spirits and/or use magic &amp; sorcery — hence the term "witch doctors".
</ul>
Magic plays a role in many traditional African beliefs. Magic refers to the interaction between the natural &amp; supernatural worlds, the seen &amp; the unseen. Magicians, witches, shamans and sorcerers are believed to have special skills to manipulate communication/relations between the two worlds, either for better or for worse. Unfortunately, it is a somewhat common occurrence (especially in rural Central &amp; West Africa) for people to claim that others are using magic for improper reasons and are witches. Accusations of being a witch or using magic/witchcraft often lead to ostracism of individuals — women are thrown out of homes, children are abandoned by parents, are subjected to violent/painful exorcisms, and are frequently murdered. In some places, witches are believed to be the source of terminal illnesses such as cancer and AIDS.

The Vodun religion practised in &lt;a href="Togo"&gt;Togo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Benin"&gt;Benin&lt;/a&gt; (a precursor to Haitian Voudou and related religions among the African Diaspora in the Americas) believes that all creation is divine and thus carries the power of the divine. This explains how certain plants have the ability to heal and why mundane "fetishes", such as statues or dried plants/animals, hold healing &amp; rejuvenating powers.

Hinduism is practised by the large ethnic Indian populations in former British colonies of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and South Africa, where many Indians were indentured servants under British masters. &lt;a href="Mauritius"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt; is the only African country where a majority of the population practices Hinduism (52%). &lt;a href="Judaism"&gt;Judaism&lt;/a&gt; has a long, if not well known, history on the continent. The Beta Israel of Ethiopia are legally-recognized Jews and believed to be descendants of one of the Ten Lost Tribes (the Tribe of Dan). There is also a large Jewish community in South Africa, mostly descended from immigrants from Lithuania in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Many Jewish communities existed throughout North Africa, some from the early Diaspora while others fled persecution in Iberia in the 7th and 15th centuries. Those communities are now almost entirely gone, having emigrated to North America, Israel and France to escape persecution or being outright forced out after the founding of the state of Israel, though vestiges of these communities do still survive in &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Tunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;.

BULLET::::- Achebe, Chinua. ♡❤Things Fall Apart♡❤. The classic work of modern African literature. Though set in pre-colonial &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, Achebe's magnum opus is in some sense the story of European colonization of Africa as a whole. It was groundbreaking when published for telling an African story from the perspective of Africans, rather than Europeans. At the time, it was standard to portray African cultures as primitive and simple; Achebe broke this assumption by depicting the richness and complexity of an African society.
BULLET::::- Battuta, Ibn. ♡❤The Travels of Ibn Battuta.♡❤ The travel diaries of the legendary explorer Ibn Battuta, considered one of the greatest travellers in history. In 1325, he set out on the &lt;a href="Hajj"&gt;Hajj&lt;/a&gt; pilgrimage to Mecca from his native Morocco, age 21, and over the next three decades passed through more than 40 modern countries travelling over three times the distance than near-contemporary Marco Polo. His 1325-1332 trip visited &lt;a href="North%20Africa"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;, and the Swahili Coast (&lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Zanzibar"&gt;Zanzibar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Tanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;). A journey between 1349-1354 visited &lt;a href="Timbuktu"&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/a&gt;, passing through modern &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mauritania"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mali"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Niger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;. A few modern translations exist, including the 1829 translation by Samuel Lee (♡❤The Travels of Ibn Battuta.♡❤ Cosimo Classics, 2009. ) and a 2003 one by Tim Mackintosh-Smith (♡❤The Travels of Ibn Battuta.♡❤ Macmillan UK, 2003. ), who also re-traced Battuta's footsteps in the early 21st century and published a few other books about his journeys. Battuta's pilgrimage to Mecca, travelling across medieval North Africa &amp; the Middle East was the basis for the 2009 IMAX film (&lt;a href="http%3A//www.journeytomeccagiantscreen.com/"&gt;♡❤Journey to Mecca: In the Footsteps of Ibn Battuta♡❤&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt1235836/"&gt;IMDb&lt;/a&gt;).

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By plane</h3>

The continent has perhaps the least extensive air route network of all the world's inhabited continents. When flying to major destinations like &lt;a href="Johannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="Accra"&gt;Accra&lt;/a&gt;, there's a good amount of choice and airfare costs about average when compared to routes of similar length around the world. Airfares tend to be cheaper when booked from a European capital that has a strong colonial link to your destination, which typically means from &lt;a href="London"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brussels"&gt;Brussels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Lisbon"&gt;Lisbon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; also has plentiful, cheap connections with the Middle East &amp; Europe. However, less popular destinations like Brazzaville or Niamey may only be served by a few flights per week operated by major airlines and the cost of airfare can be expensive. Some African airlines (such as Air Namibia) only service their neighboring countries, with one or two (or no) flights to Europe.

Africa's major airlines—South African Airways, Kenya Airways, &amp; Ethiopian Airlines—all offer a decent level of service to the continent's capitals and other major cities and fly to many major cities around the world. Few other African airlines operate inter-continental flights and many have poor or questionable safety records and offer poor levels of service. Many flights to Africa are available from/through Europe and the Middle East. Keep in mind that many airlines are part of alliances and code share agreements and you will likely fly on more than one airline.

See your destination's article for more specific information on flights. Bear in mind that many African countries only offer a few international flights each day, or in some cases, each week. While it isn't hard to reach South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria or Egypt, getting to Malawi or Togo can be quite a challenge.

<h4>From Europe</h4>
There are more flights to Africa from Europe than from any other continent. Popular holiday destinations such as &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cape%20Verde"&gt;Cape Verde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; are well-served from Europe's major cities, even with discount and charter airlines. Royal Air Maroc, Afriqyah Airlines, Kenya Airways Jet4you &amp; EgyptAir have a good selection of European destinations and Ethiopian, Kenya Airways, South African Airways &amp; Arik Air serve a couple of major cities (London, Paris, etc.). The cheapest flights to African cities are often through the African country's former colonial power. Cities with large immigrant populations such as London, Marseille, and Paris have a good number of flights to Africa. Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries as of 2014.

<h4>From Asia and the Middle East</h4>
Nearly all North African countries along with Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia have extensive connections with the Middle East. And similarly, countries with large Muslim populations are likely to have a connection to Jedda/Mecca either year-round or seasonal (e.g. during hajj). Middle Eastern airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways have greatly expanded their services to Africa, and offer connections to many major African cities at competitive rates than European airlines.

<h4>From the Americas</h4>
Multiple destinations are served non-stop or directly from the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, including Johannesburg, Lagos, Addis Ababa, Accra, &amp; Dakar. Limited service is available from &lt;a href="Brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; (to Angola &amp; Canary Islands), &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; (to Algeria), &lt;a href="Cuba"&gt;Cuba&lt;/a&gt; (to Angola), and &lt;a href="Venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; (to the Canary Islands). South African Airlines, Delta, United, &amp; Ethiopian Airlines are the main operators between the US and Africa. Delta's Johannesburg to Atlanta flight is the second-longest flight in the world by both distance (13,582&amp;nbsp;km) and scheduled time (16&amp;nbsp;hr 40&amp;nbsp;min).

<h4>From Australia</h4>
There are only a handful of direct flights connecting &lt;a href="Johannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Perth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally there is a connection between &lt;a href="Mauritius"&gt;Mauritius&lt;/a&gt; and Perth.

<h3>By road or ferry</h3>
The only land connection to another continent is the 163&amp;nbsp;km-wide Isthmus of Suez, which is found in Egypt (although the Sinai peninsula is sometimes considered a part of Africa for geopolitical reasons). Thus the only way to drive into Africa is to drive through Egypt. Most people driving from the Middle East to Africa travel through Jordan and take a short car ferry to Egypt to avoid transiting Israel, since Egypt's two African neighbours (Sudan and Libya) &lt;a href="visa%20trouble"&gt;deny entry for persons with Israeli stamps&lt;/a&gt; or Egyptian/Jordanian stamps indicating travel to Israel.

Despite there being just one, narrow land crossing into the continent, there are other ways to bring vehicles into Africa by short car ferries. The short crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar between Spain and Morocco is crossed by several ferries daily and relatively inexpensive. Other car ferries include:

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Tunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; ferries are operated by a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.directferries.co.uk/tunisia.htm"&gt;couple of different companies&lt;/a&gt;. However, you must pass through Algeria to Mauritania/Niger -or- Libya to Egypt, both very expensive and difficult to enter with a car.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt; car ferries are run by Algerie Ferries. Their website is &lt;a href="http%3A//www.algerieferries.dz/"&gt;in French only&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Yemen-Djibouti ferries may be running weekly or more frequently (information about this crossing is little and conflicting) to avoid Egypt (because of the extremely high import taxes) or Sudan (as the Ethiopian-Sudan border is prone to banditry). It is also possible to cross by dhow in motorcycles or small/light vehicles.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Port%20Sudan"&gt;Port Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, Sudan to &lt;a href="Jeddah"&gt;Jeddah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Saudi%20Arabia"&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; car ferries are run daily and are a great way to avoid the ♡❤very♡❤ high tariffs to enter Egypt, although visas for SA are difficult to obtain.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Ferries link &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Gibraltar"&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, there are also connections between mainland Spain and its African possessions &lt;a href="Ceuta"&gt;Ceuta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Melilla"&gt;Melilla&lt;/a&gt;, from which you can drive across the border to Morocco.

</ul>
Several overland trucks make journeys which cross between Europe or the Middle East and Africa, these companies are listed below under "Get around/Overland trucks".

<h3>By boat</h3>

Many Mediterranean cruises stop in North African countries such Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, the Canary Islands and Cape Verde. Some ocean liners will stop in the Canary or Cape Verde Islands on trans-Atlantic crossings or in South Africa, Madagascar, Mombasa, Zanzibar, the Seychelles, or Mauritius on round-the-world trips.

Elsewhere in Africa, cruises are limited to luxury or 'boutique' cruise lines often aboard small vessels and quite expensive or "&lt;a href="Freighter%20travel"&gt;freighter cruises&lt;/a&gt;" which do not offer much to "passengers" but may spend a few days in a handful of ports. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.grimaldi-freightercruises.com/"&gt;Grimaldi Freighter Cruises&lt;/a&gt; has weekly departures to West Africa making the round-trip from Amsterdam in 38 days.

The Seychelles, Reunion and Mauritius are popular destinations for yachts and private vessels, but piracy around the Horn of Africa has kept a lot of the European vessels away.

<h2>Get around</h2>
<h3>Visas</h3>
The general rule that visas are more difficult to obtain for countries that have more authoritarian governments and are less "classical" tourist destinations is true for Africa as well, although there are exceptions. Also with few exceptions it is easier to get into most countries if you are from a "first world" country. Visa requirements and costs for African countries differ depending on your nationality/citizenship and by country. Many countries in southern and eastern Africa have visa-free or visas available at the airport or border crossing for EU, American, Canadian, and a few other nationalities with a minimal amount of paperwork and wait. On the other hand, some countries have burdensome requirements that often differ among their embassies and border crossings.

Most countries in West Africa require visas for travellers from outside the region. In some cases these visas can be arranged at airports or (less commonly) at borders, but this is often not an option. West African embassies are not widespread outside of the region (generally limited to former colonial metropoles), and visa services are sometimes not available in some neighbouring countries. Sometimes visas are issued rapidly, sometimes it's a lengthy and costly process. Check before starting a trip across the region, as regulations and practices often change.

There are four customs unions in effect in Africa:
<ul>
BULLET::::- Southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini)
BULLET::::- West Africa (Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso, Cote D'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Niger, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone)
BULLET::::- Central Africa (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of the Congo, Gabon)
BULLET::::- East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi)

</ul>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<h3>By plane</h3>
There are a number of reliable airlines that ply the African Continent. Chief among them are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡South African Airways (SAA)♡❤♡ (&lt;a href="Johannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http%3A//www.flysaa.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has daily flights to most major Southern, Eastern, &amp; Central African political and economic hubs. If you're flying from the Northern Hemisphere to somewhere north of &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, don't forget to check how much backtracking you'll have to do, and if it's worth it. The flight from Washington, D.C. does stop in &lt;a href="Senegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;, but if you get off there, SAA has no connections to anywhere else.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Kenya Airways♡❤♡ (Nairobi, Kenya), &lt;a href="http%3A//www.kenya-airways.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, connects more African cities than any other airline on the continent. It is partly owned by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, offers good service and frequent flights to all countries within the East African region and many other major African and international destinations.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Ethiopian Airlines♡❤♡ (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ethiopianairlines.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; carries more passengers than any other African airline and offers a direct service from many European cities &amp; Washington to its hub &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;. From there it has a very good coverage to many cities in Africa. The flight from/to Washington refuels in Rome. Its mileage can be used on Lufthansa services and Lufthansa miles can also be used on Ethiopian.

</ul>
There are also many airlines which are noteworthy in particular regions, such as TAAG Angola Airlines (South/Central Africa), Arik Air (Nigeria), Afriqiyah Airways (Central/West Africa, but their hub is in Tripoli), Royal Air Maroc (West/Central/North Africa, but its hub is in Morocco), Air Mali (West Africa), Air Burkina (West Africa), Air Austral (Indian Ocean), Air Mauritius (Indian Ocean), Tunis Air (North Africa), and Jetlink (East Africa). Many other African carriers offer flights to more remote locations.

<h3>By car</h3>

If you want to drive your own car around Africa see also &lt;a href="Carnet%20de%20Passage"&gt;Carnet de Passage&lt;/a&gt;

For sightseeing trips, it may be less expensive to hire a taxi than to rent a car, but be sure to negotiate taxi fares beforehand. Travel on rural roads can be slow and difficult in the dry season and disrupted by floods in the rainy season. If you plan on travelling in rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, avoid the rainy months of May through October above the equator and the rainy months of November through April below the equator. Some roads may be flooded or washed out during these months.

Travel by car outside large towns can be dangerous. Major roads are generally well maintained but there are few divided highways in Africa. In addition, rural auto accidents are fairly common because of high speed limits and the presence of wildlife in these areas. Night driving, especially in rural areas, is not recommended, and visitors are encouraged to hire reputable tour operators for safaris or other game viewing expeditions.

<h3>By bus</h3>
Bus service is extensive in Africa and in almost all countries it is the main means of transportation for locals and tourists alike. Styles of busses and minibusses vary across the continent, refer to country pages for more info.

<h3>By thumb</h3>
Locals &lt;a href="tips%20for%20hitchhiking"&gt;hike rides&lt;/a&gt; in vehicles with strangers throughout Africa, often paying a fee to the driver in return for the favour or service. The distinction between a private vehicle and a taxi is blurred and in many countries, informal taxi business flourish, by picking people up from the side of the road who want a lift. In some areas, such as Johannesburg, specific hand signals are used by hitchhikers to indicate where they wish to go and it is common for vehicles to carry several people at the same time a particular area. Foreigners may expose themselves to considerable personal risk by travelling in this way, and it is important to understand the political and social climate of each region before doing so.

<h3>By overland truck</h3>
Some people with limited amounts of time or who would prefer not to make their own arrangements opt for the "overlander" experience. Many operators run tours in large trucks that are comfortable and equipped with facilities for around 8-30 persons. They're generally run on a pretty tight schedule and cover a lot of distance, such as "Nairobi to Johannesburg in six weeks". These tours are run throughout the whole continent but East and Southern Africa are by far the most popular destinations. Accommodation is mostly camping with tents provided. Most meals are arranged and many are prepared by those on the trip (cooking duties rotated throughout the trip), and free time (like everything else) is scheduled. However, there is plenty of time to participate in the adventure activities that certain areas of Africa are famous for such as &lt;a href="Victoria%20Falls"&gt;Victoria Falls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Swakopmund"&gt;Swakopmund&lt;/a&gt;, Zanzibar, and &lt;a href="Serengeti%20National%20Park"&gt;Serengeti National Park&lt;/a&gt;. Some people really enjoy these tours, especially when they do not have enough time to organize all travel arrangements themselves. Others loathe the very thought of travelling in a group and think that they keep you way out of touch with the "real" Africa. Whatever the case, they're a very different way to travel through Africa. The people that go on these tours tend to be young at heart and slightly adventurous; these tours are not luxury trips.

<h3>By train</h3>

Most railway lines in Africa were built by the colonial powers, often with great human cost, with the main purpose of extracting wealth from the interior to coastal cities for export. After the fall of colonialism, many lines haven't been extended or maintained. passenger railways in Africa are therefore sparse with the majority being short, slow and within one country. However, during the 2010s, Chinese and European investment have rehabilitated several lines and also built new standard gauge railway lines in several countries.

The &lt;a href="North%20Africa"&gt;North African&lt;/a&gt; states of &lt;a href="Algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Tunisia"&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt; all have rail networks of adequate quality, some of them even comparing favorable to a few European or East Asian countries, with connections to most major cities. In 2018, &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; opened Africa's first true &lt;a href="high%20speed%20rail"&gt;high speed rail&lt;/a&gt; line between &lt;a href="Tangier"&gt;Tangier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Rabat"&gt;Rabat&lt;/a&gt;. Due to political tensions (and in part the sparse population in border areas) there are however no international train services between these countries. For travelers to and from &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; the old &lt;a href="Wadi%20Halfa"&gt;Wadi Halfa&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Khartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="Sudan"&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, train is useful as it connects with the ferry across Lake Nasser to the Egyptian rail terminus in &lt;a href="Aswan"&gt;Aswan&lt;/a&gt;. An unique experience, but not very useful as a means of transportation, is to ride the longest train in the world in &lt;a href="Mauritania"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt;, either in the caboose or atop open iron ore carriages. Libya has no railways and plans to change that were derailed by the political troubles that have shaken this country since the 2010s.

&lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; has a long history with passenger rail, there are overnight trains from most major cities several times per week. Additionally &lt;a href="Gauteng"&gt;Gauteng&lt;/a&gt; province is served by the fast ♡❤Gautrain♡❤, connecting the major cities of &lt;a href="Johannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Pretoria"&gt;Pretoria&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="O.R.%20Tambo%20International%20Airport"&gt;O.R. Tambo International Airport&lt;/a&gt;. There are no proper international trains to South Africa but several lines terminates at border cities, making it quite easy to travel from neighboring countries such as &lt;a href="Mozambique"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;. Most other countries in &lt;a href="Southern%20Africa"&gt;Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt; have some form of passenger services, but quality and frequency varies greatly. Finally, for those with money to splurge, there are luxury trains like the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bluetrain.co.za/"&gt;♡❤♡Blue Train♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https%3A//www.rovos.com/"&gt;♡❤♡Rovos Rail♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt; which offers luxurious old world charm. 

&lt;a href="East%20Africa"&gt;East Africa&lt;/a&gt; has had declining services for a long time but due to recent investment several new lines have opened between major cities. Both &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; now boosts brand new trains connecting major cities. The classic ♡❤TAZARA♡❤ line, connecting &lt;a href="Dar%20es%20Salaam"&gt;Dar es Salaam&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="Kapiri%20Mposhi"&gt;Kapiri Mposhi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Zambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; still holds up, passing through several national parks. &lt;a href="Central%20Africa"&gt;Central African&lt;/a&gt; countries have fared worse with little to no investment, and railways to show for it. &lt;a href="Angola"&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt; has rehabilitated its railway lines but services remain spotty. Very limited and erratic services are available in other countries. 

A few services remain in &lt;a href="West%20Africa"&gt;West Africa&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="Ouagadougou"&gt;Ouagadougou&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Burkina%20Faso"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Abidjan"&gt;Abidjan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cote%20d%27Ivoire"&gt;Cote d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt; being the most usable for tourists. &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; is however investing heavily in rail and several new intercity trains have sprung up.

<h3>By boat</h3>

Where there is water, there is usually boat services to some extent. In the DRC, boats are the primary means of transportation due to the extensive network of rivers and lack/quality of roads and railways. Some noteworthy river journeys in Africa are:

Along the ♡❤♡Niger River♡❤♡ small, wooden ♡❤pirogues♡❤ varying in design from a 2-person canoe to wide, ~10 person boats with a canopy and toilet. Travelling by pirogue is slow, but the Sahelian scenery and people you meet on the boat and during stops make this a memorable African experience. Due to cataracts, pirogues on the Niger only operate in Mali &amp; Niger

Along the ♡❤♡Congo River♡❤♡ large, old and often overcrowded ferries connect cities along the river in the &lt;a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="DR%20Congo"&gt;DR Congo&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; &lt;a href="Central%20African%20Republic"&gt;Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt;. Small boats from villages come out and moor themselves to these ferries to sell food and merchandise and the boat is a bustling marketplace of hundreds of people much of the time. Conditions aboard these ferries are poor and bearable only by the most seasoned of travellers. Talk to the captain to see if you can use one of the handful of rooms to sleep.

<h2>Talk</h2>

There is no dominant language in Africa, but if you are travelling in West or Central Africa, &lt;a href="French%20phrasebook"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; and English will be the most useful across these nations and regions. &lt;a href="Arabic%20phrasebook"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; is the dominant language in North Africa, although French is also widely spoken. English is also useful in many countries, and dominant in much of Southern Africa. &lt;a href="Swahili%20phrasebook"&gt;Swahili&lt;/a&gt; is the most useful language in East Africa. In Ethiopia, most people speak &lt;a href="Amharic%20phrasebook"&gt;Amharic&lt;/a&gt;, which is indigenous to Ethiopia. Even if you know a blanket language like French, it is always a good idea to bring phrasebooks for the native languages. In &lt;a href="Senegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;, for example, despite being part of Francophone Africa, visitors are likely to find &lt;a href="Wolof%20phrasebook"&gt;Wolof&lt;/a&gt; very useful and sometimes necessary when dealing with residents. It also helps if you have a basic understanding of the language used by a country's former colonist (e.g. German is useful to know if you are going to Namibia, since there is a large German-speaking white population). The more you wish to interact with locals or go out of the cities, the more important it will be for you to have resources to communicate in the local African languages.

Africa's linguistic diversity is exemplified by South Africa, which has eleven official languages, some of which have the most complex inventory of sounds in any human language, with over a hundred different sounds to distinguish meaning. English in comparison has less than half that number.

<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>
Many visitors are attracted by the &lt;a href="African%20flora%20and%20fauna"&gt;African flora and fauna&lt;/a&gt; and several countries benefit from &lt;a href="safaris"&gt;safari&lt;/a&gt; tourism to &lt;a href="African%20national%20parks"&gt;African national parks&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Natural wonders</h3>

Africa is home to many famous natural wonders, from the Nile River, the world's longest river, to &lt;a href="Victoria%20Falls"&gt;Victoria Falls&lt;/a&gt;. The continent is home to two of the world's four volcanoes with permanent lava lakes&amp;mdash;the dramatic &lt;a href="Virunga%20National%20Park"&gt;Mount Nyiragongo&lt;/a&gt; which rises hundreds of meters above &lt;a href="Goma"&gt;Goma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;DR Congo&lt;/a&gt; and Erta Ale in &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;'s stark Danakil Depression (the others are &lt;a href="Ross%20Sea"&gt;Mt. Erebus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href="Hawaii%20Volcanoes%20National%20Park"&gt;Kilauea&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Hawaii"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;). Both volcanoes can be climbed by the adventurous tourist to stand at the rim gazing in awe at the bubbling lava below, an especially incredible sight at night! Mount Cameroon and its glorious stretch of lava also creates a beautiful site with a variety of flora and fauna.

<h3>Landscapes</h3>
Roughly centered on the Equator, Africa is known for landscapes typical for warm parts of the world.

&lt;a href="Northern%20Africa"&gt;Northern Africa&lt;/a&gt; is dominated by the immense &lt;a href="Sahara"&gt;Sahara&lt;/a&gt; desert wedged between the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Apart from the coastal rim and the banks of the Nile, this is a dry and remote part of the continent. The most notable (and likely easiest accessible) mountain range here is the Atlas mountains range in &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;. The highest peak is &lt;a href="Jbel%20Toubkal"&gt;Jbel Toubkal&lt;/a&gt;, the highest mountain in Africa not located in the east of the continent.

South of Sahara, vegetation gradually increases the further south one travels. From southern &lt;a href="Sahel"&gt;Sahel&lt;/a&gt; onwards, the terrain is rather flat with savanna and steppe. This is however not the case at these latitudes in the eastern part of Africa; this is the northern end of Africa's "backbone" of several mountain chains stretching down all the way from &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt; to South Africa like an extension of the Nile. Eastern Central Africa is also where you can find the largest lakes, including Lake Victoria. Named after the 19th century British queen Victoria, this is the world's second largest fresh water lake by surface area and the source of one of the two forks of the Nile. Southwest of the lake, a little more than halfway to the Indian Ocean, lies Africa's highest mountain, &lt;a href="Kilimanjaro"&gt;Kilimanjaro&lt;/a&gt;.

Bisected by the Equator, unsurprisingly the heart of Africa is dominated by rainforest. The Congo rainforest is the second largest in the world, remote and mostly uninhabited, and going here is often more of an expedition than a tourist trip. The Eastern Central part is also the best place to go on the continent if you are interested in &lt;a href="volcanoes"&gt;volcanoes&lt;/a&gt;.

Further south, the landscape becomes more and more dry again, especially in the western half. &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; in particular is known for its deserts and canyons. The landscape is different in the east with scenic mountains and waterfalls including the mighty &lt;a href="Victoria%20Falls"&gt;Victoria Falls&lt;/a&gt;, yes, it too was named after the queen. On the highland plateau in this corner of Africa is &lt;a href="Lesotho"&gt;Lesotho&lt;/a&gt;, the only country in the world that is entirely located higher than 1400 m above the sea level. The southernmost part of the continent — in other words &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; — is reminiscent of the northernmost rim with Mediterranean climate and subtropical vegetation.

There are also several island nations or territories located in the oceans outside mainland Africa. They are as a rule mountainous with mountain chains often consisting of volcanoes. Surrounded by sea, they as a rule have cooler temperatures than inland locations at the same latitudes.

<h3>Historical civilizations</h3>
While the continent's diverse and unique wildlife is often all that is mentioned in regards to African travel, as home to the oldest civilizations on the planet, Africa has equally impressive cultures and history. The most famous civilization on the continent, and arguably in the world, is that of &lt;a href="ancient%20Egypt"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt;. From the southern city of &lt;a href="Abu%20Simbel"&gt;Abu Simbel&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Luxor"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt; and all the way north to Alexandria and Cairo, including the Pyramids of &lt;a href="Giza"&gt;Giza&lt;/a&gt;, the only surviving of the original Seven Wonders of the World and the most iconic symbols of this ancient kingdom. Sites from the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Nubia"&gt;Nubia&lt;/a&gt;n Kingdom♡❤♡ that had close ties with Egypt can be found in Sudan, such as Gebel Barkal and many other pyramids in &lt;a href="Meroe"&gt;Meroe&lt;/a&gt;. There are also remains of the former city-state of &lt;a href="Carthage"&gt;Carthage&lt;/a&gt; that can be found in modern-day Tunisia.

Ethiopia offers many ruins from the ancient ♡❤♡Axumite Kingdom♡❤♡ where the Queen of Sheba ruled. The obelisks and Dungur ruins in &lt;a href="Axum"&gt;Axum&lt;/a&gt; were built prior to the kingdom's conversion to Christianity, while many other great monuments, such as the Ezana Stone and the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, where the Arc of the Covenant is said to be stored, were built after the conversion as religious sites. Other famous Christian structures built later by the kingdom's successor, the ♡❤♡Abyssinian Empire♡❤♡, especially during the 12th and 13th centuries, can also be found in &lt;a href="Lalibela"&gt;Lalibela&lt;/a&gt;.

In West Africa, structures from the ancient ♡❤♡Mali Empire♡❤♡ can be found in &lt;a href="Timbuktu"&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Djenne"&gt;Djenne&lt;/a&gt;. Although there are Islamic influences, the architectural styles of the Malian Kingdom's mosques are still quite unique and recognizably African. The cliff dwellings in Mali's &lt;a href="Dogon%20Country"&gt;Dogon Country&lt;/a&gt;, built by the Dogon people, are also impressive ancient structures in &lt;a href="Mali"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt;. Remnants of the ♡❤♡Ghana Empire♡❤♡ can be found in parts of Mauritania and Mali, including the archaelogical sites at &lt;a href="Koumbi%20Saleh"&gt;Koumbi Saleh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oualata"&gt;Oualata&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Aoudaghost"&gt;Aoudaghost&lt;/a&gt;. Often overshadowed by Africa's other monuments, ♡❤♡Sungbo's Eredo♡❤♡ in &lt;a href="Ijebu%20Ode"&gt;Ijebu Ode&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, built by the Yoruba people, is actually the largest pre-colonial structure remaining on the continent. Today it towers over the city, covered in vegetation. The royal palaces of the ♡❤♡Dahomey Kingdom♡❤♡ still stand in their former capital of &lt;a href="Abomey"&gt;Abomey&lt;/a&gt;, and ruins of the ♡❤♡Kingdom of Kongo♡❤♡ can still be found in their former capital of &lt;a href="M%27banza-Kongo"&gt;M'banza-Kongo&lt;/a&gt;. While they were largely destroyed by the British during the Scramble for Africa, &lt;a href="Benin%20City"&gt;Benin City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Kumasi"&gt;Kumasi&lt;/a&gt; still contain a few relics of the ♡❤♡Kingdom of Benin♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡Ashanti Empire♡❤♡ respectively. In &lt;a href="Sokoto"&gt;Sokoto&lt;/a&gt;, Nigeria, remnants of the ♡❤♡Sokoto Caliphate♡❤♡ can still be found in the local museums, as well as the sultan's palace, and the city continues to serve as one of Africa's main centres of Islamic scholarship.

Ruins from the ancient ♡❤♡Swahili culture♡❤♡ can be found in the coastal areas of East Africa, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania. The Swahili structures combines elements of African architecture with Islamic architecture, which was quite prominent around the 14th century. Some of the most famous Swahili structures include the ♡❤♡Gedi Ruins♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡Pillar Tombs♡❤♡ around &lt;a href="Malindi"&gt;Malindi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Kilwa%20Kisiwani"&gt;Kilwa Kisiwani&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="Mombasa"&gt;Mombasa&lt;/a&gt; and Zanzibar's &lt;a href="Stone%20Town"&gt;Stone Town&lt;/a&gt; feature Swahili structures spanning hundreds of years from its early days to the 18th century.

In Southern Africa, the ruins of &lt;a href="Great%20Zimbabwe"&gt;Great Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; have fascinated visitors ever since Europeans discovered them. No European had believed that the inhabitants of black Africa were capable of creating any great monuments on their own until the ruins of this ancient culture were discovered.

The ruins of the ancient city of Carthage, near &lt;a href="Tunis"&gt;Tunis&lt;/a&gt; testify to the grandeur of the Carthaginian Empire.

Many cities, such as &lt;a href="Leptis%20Magna"&gt;Leptis Magna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Timgad"&gt;Timgad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Dougga"&gt;Dougga&lt;/a&gt; feature Roman ruins as impressive as those in Europe itself. Many other European structures can be found throughout the continent, dating back to the earliest days of imperialism. One of the most unique European-influenced styles is the ♡❤♡Cape Dutch♡❤♡ style found in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, which traces its origins to the first white settlers in sub-Saharan Africa in the 17th century. Although clearly influenced by &lt;a href="Netherlands"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; architectural conventions, it has also diverged significantly from European architecture to adapt to African conditions, making it a unique style in its own right. Uniquely among white communities in Africa, the descendants of these Dutch settlers, now known as the Afrikaners, have developed their own ethnic identity, and by and large consider themselves to be Africans rather than Europeans.

<h3>Safaris</h3>
Safari – an overland travel to view the stunning &lt;a href="African%20flora%20and%20fauna"&gt;African wildlife&lt;/a&gt; – is arguably the greatest tourist attraction in Africa. Most countries, except in the north, have at least one &lt;a href="African%20national%20parks"&gt;national park&lt;/a&gt; with organized safaris. A safari can take on a range of forms, from a simple one-day minibus ride, to week-long stays at a lodge. Commonly it is a 4x4 ride across the savanna in search of the "Big five": elephants, lions, leopards, rhinos, &amp; buffalo. Such safaris are offered primarily in &lt;a href="Southern%20Africa"&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="East%20Africa"&gt;East Africa&lt;/a&gt;. Many parks have strict regulations both on visitor activities and behavior, along with entry &amp; camping fees. Among the most well-known parks are &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Kruger%20National%20Park"&gt;Kruger National Park&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Ngorongoro%20Conservation%20Area"&gt;Ngorongoro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Etosha%20National%20Park"&gt;Etosha National Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Okavango%20Delta"&gt;Okavango Delta&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Botswana"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt;, and the Tsavo &lt;a href="Tsavo%20East%20National%20Park"&gt;East&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="Tsavo%20West%20National%20Park"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt; National Parks, and &lt;a href="Nairobi%20National%20Park"&gt;Nairobi National Park&lt;/a&gt;.

The three basic safari styles are driving safari, walking safaris, and mobile safari. Some regions also offer safaris on boats/canoes, horses, elephants, or hot air balloon or light aircraft. The ♡❤♡driving safari♡❤♡ is by far the most popular form of safari and is best for most first-timers as it is easier, often cheaper, and generally allows you to see more wildlife. A driving safari can be a one-day affair, but it often includes a couple nights spent &lt;a href="camping"&gt;camping&lt;/a&gt; or in lodges. Low-price driving safaris are often made in minibuses without a guaranteed window seat. Luxury safaris will likely include drives in a 4x4 vehicle in small groups and stays at fine lodges with swimming pools and spas. A ♡❤♡walking safari♡❤♡ consists of hiking, either for a few hours or several days, with fewer opportunities to see many animals, but allows hikers to get closer to some animals and have experiences like stumbling upon the bones of a recent lion kill. For ♡❤♡mobile safaris♡❤♡, a camp is set up each night of your safari; it might also contain a portable lunch camp. At a ♡❤fly-in safari♡❤, the visitor is flown directly (or very close) to a lodge, instead of hours of overland transit.
For the most basic trips, travellers should have a minimum budget of US$70/day, while some of the most visited parks may cost US$100–150/day. Luxury trips can easily run over US$1000/day. If a price offer seems too good to be true, it often is, and there is probably a good reason why. This can be the result of hidden fees, large errors/omissions/lies when calculating a price, an unlicensed operator, abusive labor practices, poor equipment, length of the trip, and extras that you may not have thought of or which this operator plans to charge a steep fee. Thoroughly check what each tour operator provides in their cost, and make sure to get a written agreement before payment and departure. Self-drive safaris are possible in some parks, but highly discouraged for beginners.

<h3>Climbing</h3>
Africa does not have tall, jagged mountain ranges comparable to the Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, or Alps and there are very few mountains requiring technical gear. The Atlas Mountains across Morocco, Algeria, &amp; Tunisia; the Drakensberg in South Africa &amp; Lesotho; the Semian Mountains in Ethiopia; and the Rwenzori Mountains between Uganda &amp; the DR Congo are the only considerable mountain ranges on the continent, all with numerous peaks which can be easily climbed. Additionally, there are some tall volcanoes along the Great Rift Valley, on the Indian Ocean islands, &amp; in Cameroon. Some of the continent's most climbed or unique mountains are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Jbel%20Toubkal"&gt;Jbel Toubkal&lt;/a&gt; (4165&amp;nbsp;m) near &lt;a href="Marrakech"&gt;Marrakech&lt;/a&gt;, Morocco is the tallest peak in the Atlas Mountains and can be climbed without technical gear in summer.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Mount%20Cameroon"&gt;Mount Cameroon&lt;/a&gt; (4040 m) near &lt;a href="Douala"&gt;Douala&lt;/a&gt;, Cameroon, is the tallest peak (actually a volcano) in Cameroon and is famous for the 1986 Lake Nyos disaster, when the lake released a huge volume carbon dioxide gas, suffocating thousands. Fast-paced hikes to the top and back are possible in a day.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Mount%20Kilimanjaro"&gt;Mount Kilimanjaro&lt;/a&gt; (5895&amp;nbsp;m) in Tanzania near the Kenya border is the continent's highest peak, the world's tallest free-standing mountain, and perhaps the most climbed mountain on the continent, owing to its accessibility and the lack of need of technical gear. The range of scenery one passes from base to peak makes it a destination almost all climbers have on their wishlist.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Mount%20Kenya"&gt;Mount Kenya&lt;/a&gt; (5199&amp;nbsp;m) is Kenya's tallest mountain and also popular climb with many non-technical walking and climbing routes through lush scenery and is less than 200&amp;nbsp;km from Nairobi. The surrounding national park is a &lt;a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Site"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Table%20Mountain%20National%20Park"&gt;Table Mountain National Park&lt;/a&gt; (1086&amp;nbsp;m) which dominates the city of &lt;a href="Cape%20Town"&gt;Cape Town&lt;/a&gt; has hundreds or routes to the plateau, ranging from easy walks to technical rock climbs. In November 2011, Table Mountain was named one of the new 7 Wonders of Nature.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Virunga%20National%20Park"&gt;Mount Nyiragongo&lt;/a&gt; (3470&amp;nbsp;m) in the DRC on the Rwanda border is one of just 3-4 volcanoes in the world with a lava lake in its crater. A climb takes ~8&amp;nbsp;hours and involves camping on a ledge at the top&amp;mdash;a safe 700&amp;nbsp;m above the lake&amp;mdash;for the night (of course, the steaming, bubbling lava is more spectacular at night).

</ul>
Abseiling and &lt;a href="rock%20climbing"&gt;rock climbing&lt;/a&gt; can be done in many parts of Africa, with many opportunities in South Africa.

<h3>Trekking and hiking</h3>
Most of Africa's mountain ranges and highlands are suitable for trekking. The ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Drakensberg"&gt;Drakensberg&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ in South Africa &amp; Lesotho, the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Garden%20Route"&gt;Garden Route&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ in South Africa, ♡❤♡Ethiopian Highlands♡❤♡, and Mali's Dogon Country are the most popular trekking destinations in Africa and most guidebooks to these countries describe the most popular routes. In the dense jungles of the &lt;a href="Central%20African%20Republic"&gt;Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt; &amp; DRC treks, almost always organized, to pygmy settlements are available. Established trekking routes exist in the forests of Guinea's &lt;a href="Fouta%20Djallon"&gt;Fouta Djallon&lt;/a&gt; highlands and in &lt;a href="Cameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;.

The Aïr Massif in Niger is popular for hiking around its sand scraped rock formations and oases, usually short distances from your camel or vehicle transport. Hiking can also be done in many forests with established paths. In Uganda, Rwanda, &amp; the adjacent DR Congo, hiking to see the endangered mountain gorilla is a major tourism draw, although permits are US$500 to spend hours hiking through tropical forests to spend 1&amp;nbsp;hour in close proximity to the gorillas.

<h3>Sport fishing</h3>

<h3>Diving</h3>
There are a good number of great &lt;a href="scuba%20diving"&gt;scuba diving&lt;/a&gt; sites across Africa. The ♡❤♡Red Sea♡❤♡ off Egypt offers clear, tranquil waters. Diving in the ♡❤♡Indian Ocean♡❤♡ is common off all islands and on the continent from Kenya south. &lt;a href="Diving%20in%20South%20Africa"&gt;Diving in South Africa&lt;/a&gt; is most famous for "shark dives", where divers are lowered in cages to watch sharks feed on bait, although other diving opportunities exist. Few locations inland are popular with divers; ♡❤♡Lake Malawi♡❤♡&amp;mdash;which is clear, deep and filled with unique species&amp;mdash;is the only lake with a significant number of dive operators.
<h3>Relax on a beach</h3>
Africa has a very long coastal line with thousands of beautiful beaches as it is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.

<h3>Sports</h3>
Soccer is the most widespread and popular sport with games between countries usually drawing tens of thousands of patriotic, cheering fans filling basic stadiums. Watching a football match in Africa is a must; try to dress in the colours of the home team and join the cheering celebration with your neighbors! The biennial ♡❤♡Africa Cup of Nations♡❤♡ is the continent's premier championship. The most recent ACoN was held in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; in 2013. Upcoming Cups will be hosted by &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; (2015) &amp; &lt;a href="Libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt; (2017). South Africa played host to the first African in 2010.

&lt;a href="Rugby%20football"&gt;Rugby&lt;/a&gt; is played by several former British colonies in Southern &amp; Eastern Africa. South Africa's ♡❤Springboks♡❤ are among the best teams in the world. And while they were traditionally associated with the white and specifically the ♡❤Afrikaner♡❤ part of the population they have now significant following among all ethnic groups after Nelson Mandela famously wore a Springbok jersey during the 1995 world cup that was held in and won by South Africa.

Cricket is also played, especially in former British colonies.

<h2>Buy</h2>
<h3>Money</h3>

The three easiest currencies to exchange within Africa are the euro, US dollar, &amp; UK pound sterling. In some countries with a large tourism sector Australian &amp; Canadian dollars and Japanese yen ♡❤may♡❤ be exchanged at large banks and some currency exchanges, but you will receive a poor exchange rate as these currencies are uncommon and more troublesome for the banks in turn to exchange. The continent is roughly split between regions where the US dollar is easiest to exchange and use and others where the euro is. In Southern African countries the South African rand enjoys a regionally dominant position (see below) and may be easier to exchange than other currencies. Generally speaking you will experience poor exchange rates outside of most of these countries, and even currency movement restrictions.

Due to concerns about counterfeiting, money changers, banks, and most likely even merchants will not accept US dollar banknotes that are worn or more than ten years old. As strange as that sounds, it seems to be a rule among anyone dealing much in dollars and you will find it difficult or even impossible to dispose of worn or older dollar banknotes. The same does not seem to hold true for euro banknotes, but may for other non-African currencies.

With few exceptions (most notably the South African rand), African currencies are generally not accepted by banks or money changers outside their native territory, or at least not at a decent exchange rate. The currencies of some smaller countries are non-exchangeable and become worthless abroad, with some countries prohibiting export of their currencies and confiscating and even fining people leaving the country with currency (most notably the Angolan kwanza).

There are three currency unions in Africa:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Common Currency Area (using South African rand): &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Eswatini"&gt;Eswatini&lt;/a&gt; (Swaziland), &lt;a href="Lesotho"&gt;Lesotho&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- West African CFA franc (XOF): &lt;a href="Benin"&gt;Benin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Burkina%20Faso"&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cote%20d%27Ivoire"&gt;Cote d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Guinea-Bissau"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mali"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Niger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Senegal"&gt;Senegal&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; &lt;a href="Togo"&gt;Togo&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Central African CFA franc (XAF): &lt;a href="Cameroon"&gt;Cameroon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Central%20African%20Republic"&gt;Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Chad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Equatorial%20Guinea"&gt;Equatorial Guinea&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; &lt;a href="Gabon"&gt;Gabon&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
Some countries that are part of a currency union still mint their own currency as well (such as Namibia's dollar), meaning that both forms of currency are legal tender.

Despite sharing the same name and same exchange rate (655.957 CFA francs = €1), the two "CFA franc" currencies are issued by different banks and are ♡❤♡not♡❤♡ interchangeable. A 1000 CFA franc banknote from Gabon will not be accepted by a merchant in Benin, and vice versa. Indeed, even with banks and money changers it will likely be easier (and you'll receive a better exchange rate) to exchange euro banknotes or even US dollars. Given the fixed exchange, if visiting any of these countries, the euro will receive a more favorable exchange rate.

The Mauritanian ouguiya &amp; Malagasy ariary are the only two non-decimal currencies in use in the world, divided into 1/5th fractions known as khoums &amp; iraimbilanja, respectively.

<h4>US dollar</h4>
The U.S. dollar has been the ♡❤de facto♡❤ currency of &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; since the collapse of the Zimbabwean dollar and allowance of foreign currency as tender in January 2009. Dollar coins are usually not accepted in Zimbabwe and you may have problems getting change for small purchases. The Djiboutian franc (178.8=US$1) and Eritrean nakfa (16.5=$1) are pegged to the dollar.

The U.S. dollar is the easiest currency to exchange (and may receive a better exchange rate compared to the euro) in Southern Africa and East Africa, as well as the &lt;a href="DR%20Congo"&gt;DR Congo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; &lt;a href="Liberia"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt;. Many tour operators, tourist attractions, and hotels in these regions set their prices in dollars, some even going as far as to offer poor exchange rates for or even refuse local currency. Also, many countries in these regions set their visa prices in dollars and will only accept dollars (or perhaps pound sterling).

<h4>Euro</h4>
The euro is the official currency of France's Mayotte &amp; Reunion territories, Spain's Canary Islands and Portugal's Madeira and Porto Santo. The West &amp; Central African CFA francs are pegged to the euro at 655.975 (formerly, simply 100 to the French franc). The Moroccan dirham is pegged (with a fluctuation band) to the euro at roughly 10 dirhams to one euro. The Cape Verdean escudo is pegged at 110.265 to one euro and the Comoran franc is pegged at 491.9678 to one euro. The &lt;a href="Sao%20Tome%20and%20Principe"&gt;Sao Tome and Principe&lt;/a&gt; dobra was fixed at 24500 to 1 euro in 2010 to guarantee stability&amp;mdash;it was worth just 12000 per euro in 2004.

The euro is the easiest currency to exchange and receives the best exchange rate in countries whose currencies are fixed to the euro, with strong European ties, and/or where the majority of tourists are European. This generally corresponds with North Africa, the &lt;a href="Sahel"&gt;Sahel&lt;/a&gt;, West Africa, &amp; Central Africa with the exceptions of Egypt, Sudan, &amp; Ghana, neither the euro nor dollar is better, and Nigeria, the DRC, &amp; Liberia. Due to the relevantly recent creation of the euro and long-standing status of the dollar, beware that there are some regions of Africa where people either have never heard of the euro or will see it as worthless.

<h4>South African rand</h4>
The South African rand is an official currency and widely circulated in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Lesotho"&gt;Lesotho&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Eswatini"&gt;Eswatini&lt;/a&gt; (Swaziland), &amp; &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;. Although the latter three issue their own currencies, they are pegged 1:1 with the rand and are not legal tender in the other countries as is the SA rand. The rand has also been accepted in &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt; since the Zimbabwean dollar's demise, but not as widely as the U.S. dollar. It is also readily exchanged (and sometimes accepted for payment) in &lt;a href="Botswana"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mozambique"&gt;Mozambique&lt;/a&gt; and most of the tourist spots in &lt;a href="Botswana"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Zambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;. Namibia mints a ♡❤local currency♡❤ which is also legal tender alongside the SA rand in Namibia, so always note the form of currency used on goods for sale.

<h3>Markets</h3>

<h3>Prohibited items</h3>
Trade in ivory is prohibited by nearly all countries in the world, with hefty penalties and even jail time for offenders. Many animal products (some commonly found in fetish markets) are also banned by western countries, such as tortoise shells, tusks of any animal, or any part of or item made with an endangered species. Some African countries keen on conservation will prosecute all violators to the fullest extent of the law...so be careful when purchasing animal products unless you want to spend years in an African prison. Keep in mind that even if an item may be exported from an African country it may be illegal to import into a Western country; the EU and US have strict laws on importing animal products in the name of conservation.

Some medications which may be purchased without a prescription in Western countries or parts of Africa may contain ingredients considered illegal narcotics or controlled substances in some countries. In particular, diphenhydramine is a "controlled substance" in &lt;a href="Zambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; and several Americans have been fined and jailed on drug-trafficking charges for possessing the over-the-counter allergy medicine Benadryl (elsewhere called Dimedrol) and the pain reliever Advil PM whose main active ingredient is diphenhydramine.

Drug trafficking is as common an offense as in most Western countries. The list of which substances are considered prohibited or restricted drugs varies from country to country. ♡❤Khat♡❤ which is readily grown and consumed in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, is an illicit drug in most other African countries. Organized drug trafficking is a major problem in Guinea and Guinea-Bissau en route from South America to Europe.

As with most countries, check local laws concerning antiquities before trying to leave the country with anything that appears to be over 100 years old.

Always make sure that any diamonds or other jewels you are buying can satisfy 2 conditionsː
<ol>
BULLET::::1. The number of, weight, and/or total value of the jewels you purchase can be legally imported back to your home country.
BULLET::::2. No jewels or diamonds are ♡❤♡Conflict Jewels♡❤♡, which means that they are mined and/or sold by terrorist groups, rebel groups, or are mined in non-sustainable ways.

</ol>
<h2>Eat</h2>
Food varies wildly and you can find Arab-influenced cuisine (&lt;a href="North%20African%20cuisine"&gt;in the North&lt;/a&gt;) as well as European-derived (in South Africa and Namibia) or local food originating from times before colonization. While you won't find five-star restaurants in every city or indeed every country, if you keep an open mind, you are in for some truly amazing and once-in-a-lifetime culinary experiences, once you venture out of standard tourist fare.

<h2>Drink</h2>
As could be expected from a continent as huge and diverse as Africa, there are a large variety of drinking options. While South Africa has come to be known as a wine-growing region of international acclaim, drinking anything alcoholic in the Muslim-majority countries or the predominately Muslim areas of countries such as Nigeria may be unwise or even illegal. There are also a variety of non-alcoholic drinks that either originated from Africa or have been perfected here, such as rooibos tea in South Africa or coffee in Ethiopia.

<h2>Sleep</h2>
While business districts and resort cities have high-end hotels, accommodation can be very basic off the beaten path.

While camping in a national park can be an exciting experience, be aware of dangerous animals, and of crime.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>

Africa has a bad reputation for genocidal dictators and while much of Africa is safe for travel and many tourist attractions on the continent are far from conflict, there are many regions in which conflict and/or general lawlessness exists. Terrorism, religious extremism and piracy are also concerns in some areas with a recent rise in militant Salafist groupings.

Jihadist groups are mostly concentrated in the Horn of Africa, North Africa and the Sahel region, as well as their adjacent areas. ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, where warlords have fought for control since the collapse of the central government in 1993, and the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Central%20African%20Republic"&gt;Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, where general lawlessness and rebels exist throughout most of the country, should only be visited by experienced travellers who are ♡❤very♡❤ competent regarding the dangers that exist. Otherwise, these areas should be considered no-go regions. Exceptions are &lt;a href="Somaliland"&gt;Somaliland&lt;/a&gt; which is ♡❤de facto♡❤ independent and relatively safe and the CAR's isolated &lt;a href="Dzanga%20Sangha%20National%20Reserve"&gt;Dzanga Sangha National Reserve&lt;/a&gt;.

The ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is home to the second largest jungle after the Amazon and most of the country is impassable by land. The eastern and northeastern regions are home to rebels and general lawlessness and have been home to the bloodiest conflict since World War II. Safer regions are the west (incl. &lt;a href="Kinshasa"&gt;Kinshasa&lt;/a&gt;), south (near Zambia border, incl. &lt;a href="Lubumbashi"&gt;Lubumbashi&lt;/a&gt;), and a few spots practically ♡❤on♡❤ the border, such as &lt;a href="Goma"&gt;Goma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bukavu"&gt;Bukavu&lt;/a&gt;, &amp; &lt;a href="Virunga%20National%20Park"&gt;Virunga National Park&lt;/a&gt;.

The ♡❤♡Central Sahara♡❤♡ is host to numerous problems, notably that a growing presence (or at least impact) of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in much of Saharan &lt;a href="Algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href="Mali"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt; (north of Timbuktu, east of Gao, and near the Nigerian border), and far eastern &lt;a href="Mauritania"&gt;Mauritania&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in several kidnappings (incl. one Briton beheaded, kidnapped near the Mali-Niger border) and a couple of suicide bombings in &lt;a href="Nouakchott"&gt;Nouakchott&lt;/a&gt;. Since the end of a civil war in Mali in 2012, Northern Mali (including Timbuktu, Gao, &amp; the Mauritania &amp; Niger borders) is highly dangerous on account of the presence of Tuareg &amp; Islamist rebels. A Tuareg uprising has left much of the area around &lt;a href="Agadez"&gt;Agadez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Niger"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;—once a popular tourist destination—off-limits and unsafe. Several borders in the Sahara are closed or very unsafe as a result of banditry: Libya-Sudan (closed), Libya-Chad (closed), Chad-Sudan (unsafe due to &lt;a href="Darfur"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; conflict), Chad-Niger (banditry), Libya-Niger (banditry), Mali-Algeria (no road crossings, AQIM), Algeria-Mauritania (AQIM), Mali-Niger (AQIM/rebels), Mali-Mauritania (AQIM/rebels), &amp; Algeria-Morocco (closed).

Portions of &lt;a href="Cote%20d%27Ivoire"&gt;Cote d'Ivoire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sierra%20Leone"&gt;Sierra Leone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Liberia"&gt;Liberia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Chad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt; are home to rebels and it is important to obtain up-to-date information on which parts of these countries are safe to visit (see warnings on those pages). Northern &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; is home to Islamic extremists who have carried out several attacks against non-Muslims, mostly targeting other Nigerians, but there is still a significant risk to Westerners. The region around the Niger River delta has been home to rebels for decades. Similarly, in Sudan, only the western Darfur regions and south-central "boundary" between the conflicting North-South are dangerous.

Many countries in Africa are ♡❤very dangerous♡❤ for ♡❤♡gay travellers♡❤♡, with extreme levels of homophobia widespread in the general population. Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, and in some cases carries life imprisonment or even the death penalty. &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt; have taken it a step further by making it a criminal offence to know that someone is homosexual and not report it to the police.

<h3>Crime</h3>
Crime in major African cities is generally high, and it is usually unwise to travel around at night. While much of it involves scamming, mugging or petty theft, violent crimes are also common. Check the "stay safe" areas of the individual countries you are going to.

<h3>Wildlife</h3>
In most parts of Africa dangerous wildlife should be of only very minor, if any, concern at all. In some parts of East Africa and South Africa large abundances of potentially &lt;a href="dangerous%20animals"&gt;dangerous animals&lt;/a&gt; can be found, but the majority of the time any traveller would most likely be perfectly safe in a vehicle with their tour guide. Nonetheless, attacks and deaths do occur (rarely with foreigners, but commonly with locals) and it is best to be well-informed. Nile crocodiles can be extremely dangerous and swimming is not an option in most low-lying portions of East Africa. Lions and leopards can be dangerous, but you are unlikely to encounter them on foot unless you are being extremely foolish. Large herbivores such as elephants and rhinos can also be very dangerous if aggravated, even while in a vehicle, Hippopotamuses are the animal most likely to attack or kill a human unprovoked and should be avoided without an experienced guide. Venomous snakes exist and are plentiful, but are very shy and you are unlikely to even see one let alone be bitten by one. When it comes to &lt;a href="pests"&gt;pests&lt;/a&gt;, most insects in the country are no more dangerous than what you would find in any other country, and the spiders are mostly harmless to humans. Despite all of this, easily the most dangerous non-human animal in the entire African continent is the mosquito, which infects a very large number of Africans with malaria every year, and tsetse flies that cause sleeping sickness are also a major problem in some areas. (Check individual country and region pages and WHO reports to see whether the places you plan to travel are affected by these diseases.)

<h2>Stay healthy</h2>

Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of HIV and AIDS infection on Earth. A 2005 UN Report says over 25 million Africans are infected, over 7% of adults on the continent. Be extremely cautious about any sexual activity in Africa. The rates of HIV infection among sex workers are phenomenally high.

Bushmeat from gorillas, monkeys, chimpanzees and mandrills should be avoided. Due to their similarity to humans, a number of diseases (including yet-undiscovered or poorly studied ones) can be spread by consuming their flesh, especially if it is not sufficiently heated. HIV is undoubtedly the most famous disease transmitted from other primates, but others include Ebola, anthrax and yellow fever.

As ♡❤♡&lt;a href="tap%20water"&gt;tap water&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is not always up to hygienic standards, bottled water (be careful to take a look at the seal before opening the bottle as some people simply refill bottles with tap water) is an option if you want to decrease the risk of traveller's diarrhoea, especially on shorter stays. Remember to always drink enough, especially in hot climates, and avoid drinking too much alcohol when you don't know your surroundings and/or have just recently arrived.

<h2>Connect</h2>

<h3>Telephone</h3>
♡❤See also: &lt;a href="Telephone%20service"&gt;Telephone service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="List%20of%20country%20calling%20codes"&gt;List of country calling codes&lt;/a&gt;.♡❤

Country calling codes for Africa, are generally 3-digit numbers beginning with 2—in the form +2XX. Examples are +233 for &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, +263 for &lt;a href="Zimbabwe"&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;,+254 for &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, and +262 for &lt;a href="Reunion"&gt;Reunion&lt;/a&gt;. Exceptions are &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;, with the 2-digit country calling codes +20 and +27, respectively. A full list of country calling codes can be found &lt;a href="List%20of%20country%20calling%20codes"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Traditional landline telephone services are sketchy. South Africa and the North African countries are the only regions of the continent to have decent quality. It is largely owing to this, that mobile phones have proliferated across the continent. Don't be surprised when you are in a seemingly remote corner of the continent and among a poor tribe, when a man whips out a mobile phone to show you pictures of family or ask you to find your Facebook profile for him to send a friend request. In many places, you will receive offers from traders to use their mobile phone for a fee, much as you would be solicited to purchase a wood carving or mat. Texting is more commonly used than calling.

If you decide to purchase a mobile phone locally, beware counterfeit phones. Smartphones are likely to be cheaply-made versions of phones a couple years behind those found in Western markets (that's not to say the latest Galaxy S model or iPhone can't be found). Should you choose to bring a phone from home, you're best bet would be to bring a GSM phone (the most common network type worldwide). A GSM phone will have a removable chip, called a SIM card. The SIM card in your phone can be replaced with a SIM card for a local network, enabling you to access local mobile phone networks. Minutes can then be purchased for use and added to your phone. It's not terribly difficult to find a dealer selling scratch cards to replenish minutes/texts/data for your phone; simply scratch to reveal a PIN number and enter into your phone (per instructions). The cost of purchasing a SIM card and minutes is far less than charges for roaming with a mobile phone network from a Western country.

Continent-wide, faster data networks (3G &amp; 4G) are being installed at a fast pace. However, outside major cities, data service is often at very slow 2G speeds (comparable to dial-up internet or worse). Many telecom companies limit use of 4G/3G networks to post-paid customers.

<h3>Internet access</h3>
Computers are out of the reach of most Africans. Therefore, computer shops (cyber cafés) are common throughout the continent, except perhaps the most isolated corners of the most inaccessible countries (&lt;a href="Chad"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, CAR, &lt;a href="Somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;). Many computers are full of viruses and malware. With a little bit of computer saviness, you can load a flash drive or burn a CD with an anti-virus program and possibly an alternative web browser (Firefox, Opera, Chrome) to use on public computers at cyber cafés.

Wi-fi internet access is becoming increasingly common. Most upscale hotels along with some mid-range hotels (mainly in more developed countries) will offer wi-fi internet access for guests. Some may charge a fee for this. Using your personal laptop, tablet, or smartphone on a wi-fi connection is preferable to internet cafés for accessing banking, email, social networking, and other sensitive accounts.

The fastest internet services can be found in North Africa, parts of West Africa such as &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; and around East Africa (&lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Tanzania"&gt;Tanzania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;), where an impressive roll-out of fiber-optic networks and fast, new undersea cables to the Middle East in has made &lt;a href="Kenya"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt; an up-and-coming hotspot for tech companies and international businesses requiring fast connections. &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; has the most developed and fastest internet connections on the continent. In contrast, some less-developed countries and regions continue to rely on slow satellite connections, with speeds comparable to or even worse than dial-up connections once common in Western countries. &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt; is also emerging as one of the more consistent internet service providers in Africa with the use of dongles especially being common. Wifi hotspots are also available in hotels, pubs and university campuses.

♡❤♡Internet censorship♡❤♡ is an issue in various countries on the continent, often implemented or ramped up for political reasons. This often consists of blocked social media and other communication tools; less commonly, governments may shut off the internet altogether surrounding elections or other contentious events.

<h3>Post</h3>
&lt;a href="Postal%20service"&gt;Postal networks&lt;/a&gt; are generally slow, if not unreliable altogether. Boxes and parcels sent to destinations outside the continent may take weeks or even months to arrive at their destination. FedEx, UPS, &amp; DHL maintain a good network of offices in major cities throughout the continent and the ease of shipping, speed, and better reliability are worth the higher shipping charges.

Post restante is available in some countries (check with the national postal service first) and allow mail to be sent to a post office, where it is kept for the receiver. No address is written on the piece—just receiver's name, city/country, postal code, and "Poste Restante". Make sure the sender spells your (the receiver's) name correctly and clearly. The receiver shows up at the post office, presents identification (such as a passport), and pays a small fee. Since some post offices are rather disorganized, so make sure to have the clerk check under your first name and for any possible spelling errors (describe the piece to them, ask to be shown items with a similar name, look under Q instead of O).

<h1>African wildlife</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
&lt;templatestyles src="Hatnote/styles.css" /&gt; 

♡❤♡African flora and fauna♡❤♡ is a highlight of trips to &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, especially on visits to the &lt;a href="African%20national%20parks"&gt;continent's national parks&lt;/a&gt;. Going on a &lt;a href="Safaris"&gt;safari&lt;/a&gt; is a common way to see it.

Most of Africa is part of the ♡❤♡Afrotropical realm♡❤♡, together with the southern Arabic peninsula. &lt;a href="North%20Africa"&gt;North Africa&lt;/a&gt; is part of the ♡❤♡Palearctic realm♡❤♡, and contains &lt;a href="Eurasian%20wildlife"&gt;Eurasian wildlife&lt;/a&gt;. The wildlife of the island country of &lt;a href="Madagascar"&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt; differs a lot from the mainland.

<h2>See</h2>

While many safari visitors are keen on seeing the ♡❤♡Big Five♡❤♡ — buffalo, elephant, leopard, lion and rhino — but there is a lot more out there if you know where to look.

<h3>Primates</h3>

<h4>Baboon</h4>
<h5>Chacma baboon</h5>
♡❤Papio ursinus♡❤, also known as the ♡❤♡common baboon♡❤♡, lives in social groups guided by a dominant male. Newborn baboons are black and are carried around by their mothers. Later, they ride on the back of their mother and after three to four months they change color to the adult brown-grey. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Gorilla</h4>

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;
<h4>Vervet monkey</h4>
♡❤Cercopithecus aethiops♡❤ is a social monkey that lives close to rivers and feeds on leaves, fruits and insects. Family groups are up to 20 members strong.

Newborn vervet monkeys are dependent on their mother for three months and from then on they become youngsters. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h3>Carnivores</h3>
Meat-eating mammals are the kings of the bush.

<h4>Cheetah</h4>
Cheetahs are the fastest hunters in Africa, but you are quite lucky if you can see them very close because they tend to be hidden in the high grass. You don't see them in the dense thickets of South Africa whereas the savanna in Kenya and Tanzania allows for better viewing. Cheetahs usually travel alone or in small groups consisting of the mother and her offspring. They hunt in the cool hours of the day. Cheetahs reach a maximum speed of up to 100 km/h in a short and explosive burst and tackle their prey in a single attack. The preferred prey is Impala, but birds are on the lunch menu as well. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Leopard</h4>
♡❤Panthera pardus♡❤ are famously elusive hunters that stalk their prey at night. For most visitors, the only chance of spotting one is on night drives, and Zambia's &lt;a href="South%20Luangwa%20National%20Park"&gt;South Luangwa National Park&lt;/a&gt; (which allows night driving) is claimed by some to have the highest density of leopards in all of Africa.

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Lion</h4>
♡❤Panthera leo♡❤ are common in the wider part of Africa and can be best seen in Lake Nakuru, Masai Mara, Serengeti and to a lesser extent in South Africa, nevertheless you have to be lucky to see them very close. Lions hunt early in the morning or in the night and during the day they allow themselves to be lazy. To see them in action you have to get up before the crack of dawn or you see them only resting after a big dinner.

Their menu consists mainly of bigger mammals and zebras seem to be the favourite if available. Males often do not contribute to the hunting but they demand the "lion's" share and female youngsters have to wait until it is their turn.

Lion cubs are dependent on their mother for up to two years and they start to hunt when they are about 11 months old. Lions are social cats and live in prides of 3-30 lions consisting of 1-4 males and several females. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Spotted hyena</h4>

♡❤Crocuta crocuta♡❤ has a bad reputation for no good reason. They are good at hunting and are not dependent on the leftovers from lions.

They live in packs of 3-4 animals and can form larger groups as well. The leader of the pack is a female and they hunt often during the night but can be spotted during the daytime as well. They prey on insects, mammals such as Zebras and Wildebeest and sometimes they bring down a giraffe, or fight off lions from their catch. They tend to explore bins in national parks. 

Puppies are dependent on their mum's milk for 9-12 months and start to look after themselves within 15 months. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Wild dog</h4>

♡❤Lycaon pictus♡❤ live in packs of 10-15 members.
Wild dog sightings are always a big event, so watch out for them because they are considered to be the rarest predator in Africa. Wild dogs are mainly active during the day and they hunt in the early hours or late afternoon. They prey on small mammals, Impalas, Springbok and occasionally buffaloes as well.

The packs have hierarchical structures where only the dominant female has pups and the rest help to care for them.

The pups are born in a den and they stay there for up to three weeks before they explore their environment. After five weeks the pups start to eat regurgitated meat and after 8-10 weeks they leave the den forever and follow the pack until they are about a year old. At that point, young females will leave their birth packs for new ones, while males will remain in their birth pack for life.
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Black Backed Jackal</h4>

♡❤Canis mesomelas♡❤ can be found throughout &lt;a href="Southern%20Africa"&gt;Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Caracal</h4>
♡❤Felis Caracal♡❤

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h3>Antelopes</h3>
Antelopes are among the most common animals seen on safari, but there are numerous species that, to the untrained eye, can be difficult to distinguish.

<h4>Bontebok</h4>

♡❤Damaliscus pygargus pygargus♡❤ are mainly found in the &lt;a href="Western%20Cape"&gt;Western Cape&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;. They have white, light and dark brownish markings and are easily recognised. They live in herds. However, males leave the herd at a certain age and form in small groups of their own.
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Blesbuck</h4>

♡❤Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi♡❤, closely related to the Bontebok, Blesbuck are mainly found on the highveld region of &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Blue Duiker</h4>
♡❤Cephalophus monticola♡❤ is a small (♡❤under 40cm shoulder height♡❤) antelope found in forested areas throughout &lt;a href="Southern%20Africa"&gt;Southern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Central%20Africa"&gt;Central Africa&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Blue wildebeest</h4>
Blue wildebeest (♡❤Connochaetes taurinus♡❤) are large antelopes that form small groups and are seasonal breeders. Offspring arrive from November to February and are born within the herd. Calves may be defended fiercely against any attacker. 

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Impala</h4>
♡❤Aepyceros melampus♡❤ live in big herds and newborn lambs join the herd after 1-2 days. They are excellent sprinters and can outrun many predators. Males have impressive horns which are mainly used for fights over females rather than as a defence weapon.

The impala can be distinguished from other antelopes by its distinctive backside, marked with white and black stripes that resemble the McDonald's logo. Impala are hunted by lions and leopards, although in reality they are hard to catch, because the whole herd will jump and run around, totally confusing the hunting animal.
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Kudu</h4>

♡❤Tragelaphus strepsiceros♡❤ is a big antelope and is very common in the Kruger National Park. Calves are born outside of the herd and are kept in a secret location for 1-2 weeks before they join the herd. They are loved in the national park but farmers hate them because a 2 meter high fence does not stop them from entering farm premises and eating the crops. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Puku</h4>

♡❤Kobus vardonii♡❤ are common in &lt;a href="Zambia"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt;, but not common elsewhere. Usually found in small herds of about half a dozen, puku have large lyre-shaped horns, reddish-brown fur and lack the backside markings of impala and waterbucks.
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Red Hartebeest</h4>

♡❤Alcelphus buselaphus♡❤ can be found in &lt;a href="Botswana"&gt;Botswana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Springbok</h4>

♡❤Antidorcas marsupialis♡❤

Often mistaken for Impalas, because they look like a small Impala. However their colour is different and they prefer living in the wide open fields of the arid regions. They are very difficult to spot, especially in high grass.
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Waterbuck</h4>
♡❤Kobus ellipsiprymnus♡❤ is a medium-size antelope with grey-brown fur and distinctive backside markings. There are two types: one has white ring often likened to sitting on a just-painted toilet seat, while the other has a solid white circle.
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h3>Other mammals</h3>

<h4>Aardvark</h4>
The Aardvark (♡❤Orycteropus afer, sometimes also called antbear or anteater♡❤) is a medium-sized mammal. The name comes from the Afrikaans/Dutch for ♡❤earth pig♡❤ ("aarde" earth, "varken" pig), because early settlers from Europe thought it resembled a pig. However, the Aardvark is not closely related to pigs.

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Bat-Eared Fox</h4>
The Bat-eared Fox is named after its huge ears. Bat-eared Foxes have tawny fur, their ears, legs and parts of the face are black. They are 55 cm in length (head and body), their ears are 13 cm long. It is the only species in the genus Otocyon. The teeth of the Bat-eared Fox are much smaller than teeth of other canid species. This is an adaptation to their insectivorous diet. 80% of the diet consists of insects. Bat-eared Foxes visit termite hills, follow locust swarms or stay close to herds of zebras or antelopes in order to feed on the insects landing on their excrements. In addition to insects Bat-eared Foxes eat rodents, birds and eggs, and sometimes fruits. Bat-eared Foxes are nocturnal animals that live in small groups consisting of a couple and their young. The pairs live in dens and raise the pups (two to five) together.

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Buffalo</h4>
♡❤Syncerus caffer♡❤ are fierce beasts; males may reach up to 700 kg in weight. They live in herds and have a strong social bond. They can form groups of up to several thousand members when the environment permits and groups are organized by dominant males and females. Predators are actively attacked to defend calves, injured or old members. Mothers give birth to 40 kg calves which are capable of walking shortly after birth. Calves are weaned after seven months, but stay close with their mum for 12 months. Their preferred habitat is savannah with thicket or open savannah, with protective properties. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Dwarf mongoose</h4>
♡❤Helogale parvule♡❤ live in social groups with one dominant breeding pair and the rest of the group assisting with raising the offspring. The mongoose is active during daytime . They run quickly into their tunnels when they are frightened but they return quickly and are amusing to watch. They are often found close to streams, rivers, ponds, as well as along open camp sites surrounded by high grass and thicket. The mongoose lives on insects, small birds and eggs. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Elephant</h4>
Most authorities now recognize two separate species of African elephant—♡❤Loxodonta africana♡❤, the ♡❤♡African bush elephant♡❤♡, and ♡❤Loxodonta cyclotis♡❤, the ♡❤♡African forest elephant♡❤♡. The bush elephant is the largest land mammal in the world; the forest elephant is the third-largest (with the related Asian elephant falling in between). Almost all elephant viewing in Africa is of bush elephants, whose typical habitat is far more open and accessible than the forest elephant's home range in the Congo Basin. 
♡❤Loxodonta africana♡❤ are among the most common sightings in the Kruger National Park and you will be able to see them very close up. Amboseli in Kenya is famous for the biggest tusker in the world. For some it may be too close &amp;mdash; it is definitely not for a fainthearted visitor.

Bush elephants are the biggest land mammals in the world. A male can weigh up to 6,000 kg and a female up to 3500 kg. They live in large family groups led by the most experienced female. Males are only tolerated until a certain age when they have to leave the family and often form bachelor groups. Males join the female group when they are in musth but only the strongest bulls are tolerated.

Bush elephants can often be seen around rivers when they have a bath and a good sip of water. They must drink up to 160 litres of water and eat several hundred kilograms of plants per day to survive. Elephants are active at both day and night time. They are peaceful creatures and only become aggressive when they are wounded or when they feel driven to protect their young. 

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Giraffe</h4>
♡❤Giraffa camelopardalis♡❤ are the tallest mammals on earth. Males reach a height of up to 5.2 metres and females 4.7 metres. Giraffes have a maximum mass of 1400 kg. In addition to the common giraffe, a subspecies known as ♡❤♡Thornicraft's giraffe♡❤♡, with white legs and faces, inhabits Zambia's &lt;a href="South%20Luangwa%20National%20Park"&gt;South Luangwa National Park&lt;/a&gt;.

Giraffes give birth after 450 days of pregnancy to a single calf of up to 100 kg and the calf can instantly stand on four legs and walks soon after. Giraffes live in loose family groups and newborn calves join the group after one week. Young giraffes grow fast and reach one meter in height within six months. Family groups can range in from 4 to up to 30 members, but the structure is loose and fluctuations are common.

Giraffes are browsers and can reach leaves that are not accessible by any other ground-based mammal. To maintain such an enormous size as a herbivore, giraffes eat for up to 20 hours a day and rest only during the hottest hours of the day. 

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Hippopotamus</h4>
♡❤Hippopotamus amphibius♡❤ tolerate direct sunlight poorly, so during the day they are often spotted lurking in the river, little more than their nostrils visible. They come out to graze during the night. Hippo calves have a birth mass of around 30 kg and are dependent on their mother for 5 months. After that they start to graze. 

Hippos are said to account for more deaths than any other African mammal: keep well clear of these unpredictable beasts, and ensure that they have a clear path to retreat to water.

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Honey Badger</h4>
♡❤Mellivora capensis♡❤ does not actually eat honey, but will raid bee hives for the larvae. These are tough little creatures that can even survive poisonous snake bites.

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Meerkat</h4>
♡❤Suricata suricatta♡❤ is a tiny mammal and part of the mongoose family. A group of meerkats is called a "mob" or "gang". Meerkat is a loan word from &lt;a href="Afrikaans%20phrasebook"&gt;Afrikaans&lt;/a&gt;. The name itself came from Dutch but by misidentification. In &lt;a href="Dutch%20phrasebook"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; meerkat (♡❤as Meerkatze in &lt;a href="German%20phrasebook"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;♡❤) means guenon, a monkey of the Cercopithecus genus which possibly derives from Sanskrit markata (monkey). The traders of the Dutch East India Company were likely familiar with such animals, but the Dutch settlers attached the name to the wrong animal at the Cape. In Dutch the name for the suricate is stokstêrtje ("little stick-tail"). According to African popular belief, the meerkat is also known as the sun angel, as it protects villages from the moon devil or the werewolf which is believed to attack stray cattle or lone tribesmen. They are fascinating to watch and you could easily do so for hours. These little rascals are also the stars of the highly acclaimed Animal Planet&lt;a href="http%3A//animal.discovery.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; program ♡❤Meerkat Manor♡❤.

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Pangolin</h4>
♡❤Pangolins♡❤ have large scales on their skin and their name is derived from the Malay word pengguling ("something that rolls up"). The physical appearance of pangolins is marked by large, hardened, plate-like scales. The scales, which are soft on newborn pangolins but harden as the animal matures, are made of keratin, the same material of which human fingernails are made. It can curl up into a ball when threatened, with its overlapping scales acting as armour. The scales are razor-sharp, and provide extra defense for this reason. The front claws are so long that they are unsuited for walking, and so the animal walks in a hunched-over manner on its hind legs, balanced by its large tail. The pangolin can also emit a noxious smelling acid from glands near the anus, similar to the spray of a skunk. Pangolins have short legs, with sharp claws which they use for burrowing.

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Rhinoceros</h4>

Africa has two species of rhino—♡❤Ceratotherium simum♡❤, the ♡❤♡white rhino♡❤♡, and ♡❤Diceros bicornis♡❤, the ♡❤♡black rhino♡❤♡. They are among the rarest of all large African mammals. The most common subspecies is the southern white rhino, with an estimated wild population of over 20,000. The northern white, on the other hand, is all but extinct, with no known wild specimens and only two, both female, known in captivity (the last known male died in 2018). The black rhino has three surviving subspecies, with a combined wild population approaching 5,000. Hunted to near-extinction in the 1970s and 1980s, herds have been reintroduced into select parks around the continent and are now slowly growing again.

There is no difference in colour between the "Whites" and the "Blacks". The White Rhino differs from the Black Rhinoceros because of the shape of its mouth – it is wide, for cropping large swaths of grass. According to one theory, the term "White" actually comes from the Afrikaans word "weit", meaning 'wide'.

Calves can stand immediately after birth, but they are very slow at walking. After one month they can follow their mother grazing and stay close to their mother for up to three years. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Warthog</h4>

♡❤Phacochoerus aethiopicus♡❤ are medium sized mammals with a mixed diet. Warthog babies are born at the beginning of the rainy season (December-January) and live for the first 6-7 weeks in their burrow and then start to follow their mother. Note their interesting habit of bending their front legs to graze!
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Zebra</h4>
♡❤Equus quagga♡❤ are common in national parks throughout Africa and easily recognized due to their striking white and black stripes. ♡❤♡Burchell's zebra♡❤♡ is the more common subspecies, with gray "shadow" stripes, while the rarer ♡❤♡Crawshay's zebra♡❤♡ (found in Zambia's &lt;a href="South%20Luangwa%20National%20Park"&gt;South Luangwa&lt;/a&gt;) lack these. The ♡❤♡mountain zebra♡❤♡, a separate endangered species, is found in the dry and hilly regions of southern Africa, notably the &lt;a href="Mountain%20Zebra%20National%20Park"&gt;Mountain Zebra National Park&lt;/a&gt;.

Some national parks in Kenya and Tanzania support groups of thousands of zebras. The mare leaves the herd to give birth to the foal and rejoins after birth. 

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h3>Reptiles</h3>
<h4>Crocodile</h4>
♡❤Crocodylus niloticus♡❤, the ♡❤♡Nile crocodile♡❤♡, live along rivers and are very successful hunters and eat whatever they can. They control their body temperature by lying in the sun to warm up in winter or to cool down in water in the hot summer. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Leopard tortoise</h4>

♡❤Geochelone pardalis♡❤ can be best spotted on tarred roads (they are virtually invisible in the high grass from a car). They like to drink water from tarred roads. 
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h3>Birds</h3>
<h4>African Black Oystercatcher</h4>

♡❤Haematopus moquini♡❤ can be found along the &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;n and &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;n coastline.

<h4>Blue Crane</h4>
♡❤Anthropooedes paradisea♡❤ is the national bird of &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and also the symbol of the Zulu Royal House.

Found almost exclusively in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; (♡❤less than 100 still remain in &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤), these birds are under threat with populations declining rapidly and less than 30,000 remaining in the wild.

&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

♡❤Promerops cafer♡❤ can be found in the &lt;a href="Western%20Cape"&gt;Western Cape&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Carmine-chested bee-eater</h4>
♡❤Merops nubicoides♡❤ is an insect hunting bird that preys on insects such as bees and grasshoppers, easily recognized by its striking red chest and even more striking blue wings (only clearly visible in flight). It breeds in Zimbabwe and Transvaal, but can occasionally be seen in flocks of hundreds &amp;mdash; a stunning sight.
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Crowned Plover</h4>

♡❤Vanellus coronatus♡❤
&lt;br clear="all"&gt;

<h4>Darter</h4>

♡❤Anhinga rufa♡❤ can be spotted close to dams, when drying their feathers from a previous dive.

<h3>Note on Afrikaans</h3>

Like English, double consonants in Afrikaans are pronounced as a single sound, and not two separate sounds, unless occurring at a syllabary break: 'wekker': 'vack-er' (alarm clock) but 'melkkoei': 'melk-koo-ee' (milking cow).

Note that although Afrikaans digraphs and trigraphs contain mostly vowels and sound as though they contain many syllables, they in fact are seen as a single syllable.

For example, the word 'Goeie' sounds as if it contains 3 syllables, but in fact contains only two: 'goei' and 'e' are the 2 syllables.

From this, you can see Afrikaans pronunciation, like English for a foreigner, can be rather irregular. Pronunciation can be hard and the accent is extremely difficult to master, but when spoken correctly, Afrikaans is the most melodic Germanic language.

However, one should not be daunted. Afrikaans grammar is really quite simple and is more similar to English than to any other Germanic language. Verbs are even simpler than English: there is no ♡❤am♡❤ or ♡❤are♡❤ or ♡❤were♡❤ but only ♡❤is♡❤ and ♡❤was♡❤.

One who is learning Afrikaans will probably catch onto it rather quickly and will have no problem with speaking &lt;a href="Dutch"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt; or understanding &lt;a href="German"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Important differences between Dutch and Afrikaans</h2>

A ♡❤rukkie♡❤ in Afrikaans is a short period of time, not a sexual act performed on oneself.

Common use examples are ♡❤Ek gaan 'n rukkie slaap♡❤ or ♡❤Ek sal oor 'n rukkie daar wees♡❤

♡❤Baie♡❤ means ♡❤veel♡❤ (many); however, the word ♡❤veel♡❤ also exists in Afrikaans and has the same meaning.

<h1>Afton</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
Afton is a city in the &lt;a href="Twin%20Cities"&gt;Twin Cities&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Minnesota"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;. It lies nearly on the banks of the Saint Croix River, which forms the natural eastern border between Minnesota and &lt;a href="Wisconsin"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Afton was originally settled in 1837 by a French-Canadian voyageur. In the following decades Afton would become the home for a large concentration of Swedes and Germans. Today, Afton serves as one of the last stops in Minnesota before a traveler plunges into the harsh beauty of the Wisconsin countryside. It is a lovely community with nearly 3,000 individuals living inside the city limits.

<h2>Get in</h2>
From the capital city of Saint Paul potential visitors can easily reach Afton by traveling nine miles east on Interstate 94 before heading south on Minnesota State Highway 95, which is also known as Saint Croix Trail. The town of Afton lies directly in the path of this road and is no more than three miles south of the Interstate 94 exit/entrance.

<h2>Get around</h2>
The downtown area of Afton is compact enough to be easily traversable on foot. Still, as there is next to nothing in the public transit department access to a car is, like most of the United States, somewhat of a necessity. The only other option is to perhaps strap-on some Lance Armstrong spandex, brush the dust off your bicycle and take to the road. You will not be alone.

The park, which consists of nearly 1,700 acres, provides an excellent refuge from the more concentrated and suburbanized atmosphere of the inner-ring East-metro communities. With miles of trails, a plethora of campsites and year round access to the transcendent beauty of the Saint Croix River, Afton State Park is more than worthy of being integrated into the afternoon itinerary of any visitor to the Twin Cities area.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Connect</h2>
The closest public library would be the Valley Branch Library which is located just north of Afton in neighboring Lakeland.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
Afton is perhaps one of the safest and most benign communities that you will ever visit -with non-existent levels of violent crime and a warm and welcoming atmosphere that is exciting and refreshing. The most significant threat to public safety comes from the high level of deer that are native to the surrounding forests. It is not uncommon to have a nighttime drive interrupted by a shocking jolt of adrenaline due to these impish mammals suddenly appearing on the side of darkened road. ♡❤♡Constant♡❤♡ ♡❤♡vigilance♡❤♡ is strongly suggested during the night in order to avoid a costly accident.

<h1>Afyonkarahisar</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Afyonkarahisar♡❤♡, also simply known as ♡❤♡Afyon♡❤♡, is a city in the western part of &lt;a href="Central%20Anatolia"&gt;Central Anatolia&lt;/a&gt;. 

<h2>Understand</h2>
The city's name consists of ♡❤afyon♡❤, "opium", coming from the once large fields of poppies around the city, and ♡❤karahisar♡❤, "black citadel", referring to the ancient castle on the massive hilltop in the centre of the city. For a number of decades in 20th century, the city was officially known as ♡❤♡Afyon♡❤♡, but in 2004, its older (and decidedly longer) name was restored, although you can still hear it called Afyon colloqually.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Afyon lies on a very central point in inner western Turkey, on the main routes between &lt;a href="Ankara"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt;, the national capital, and &lt;a href="Izmir"&gt;Izmir&lt;/a&gt;, the largest city on the Aegean coast, as well as between &lt;a href="Istanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, the largest city in the country, and &lt;a href="Antalya"&gt;Antalya&lt;/a&gt;, the major city of the Mediterranean coast.

<h3>By bus</h3>

<h3>By train</h3>
While the city lies on one of the major junctions of the Turkish railway network, track renovations all over the country and the phase-outs of many passenger services mean that the number of places with a direct train link to Afyon is a bit limited. As of 2017, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.tcdd.gov.tr"&gt;TCDD&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ runs daily passenger train services from &lt;a href="Eski%C5%9Fehir"&gt;Eskişehir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="K%C3%BCtahya"&gt;Kütahya&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and &lt;a href="Konya"&gt;Konya&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast of Afyon. However, as Afyon is not the terminus of none of the major intercity services, many of the trains make their stop in the city in the very inconvenient hours of the dead of the night. Check with the Turkish State Railways for the schedule].

And a bit of a trivial note for the railway fans: Afyon does not have one station but two—the smaller and older British-built ♡❤♡Afyon Şehir♡❤♡ (a stone neo-classical building) and the larger, &lt;a href="Art%20Deco%20architecture"&gt;art-deco&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , built in 1939 (and named after the minister of transportation of that era), closely resembling the central station building of &lt;a href="Ankara"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt;. (And next to Ali Çetinkaya is the beautiful wooden, chalet-type station building, constructed by the Germans in late 19th century as a stop on their ambitious &lt;a href="Berlin"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;a href="Baghdad"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; railway project.) These two stations are separated by 250 m from each other (and there was no railway connection between two for a long time), and used to be run by two rival companies. In the early days of the Turkish Republic, both companies were absorbed by the Turkish State Railways, and a connecting railway between the stations was laid. Until the 1990s trains to the west departed from Afyon Şehir which is now all but practically abandoned, as all passenger trains stop at Ali Çetinkaya since then.

<h1>Afytos</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Afytos♡❤♡, also spelt ♡❤♡Athytos♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡Afitos♡❤♡, is a city on the &lt;a href="Kassandra"&gt;Kassandra&lt;/a&gt; peninsula in &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Athytos (ancient: ♡❤Aphytis♡❤) is known for its traditional architectural beauty and stunning sandy beaches. It is a picturesque and lively community that has kept all the characteristics of a rural seafront village and also offers excellent dining &amp; entertainment options. Athytos is certainly one of the most beautiful villages in Kassandra peninsula. The village's beautiful stone houses with the distinctive architecture and the inscriptions and reliefs, are very interesting. Athytos is known for its rich cultural tradition. During the summer, you can attend numerous events such as music and dance performances, visual arts events, painting exhibitions and folkloric events.

<h3>History</h3>
Since about 3000 BCE people came and settled in the area where Afytos is now. The place was a natural fortress, which was a very important factor at the time. The crag would protect the city against any attacks from the sea. Also, the little lake that existed till 1963, and which was very close to the sea, would serve as a small bay, a natural harbor for the mooring of ships.

During the archaic and classical times, Afytos was a very prosperous city which minted its own currency bearing the head of its patron god, Ammon Zeus. This prosperity was mainly due to agriculture and viniculture. 

Shipping must have played a great role in the financial situation of Afytos, taking into consideration the size of its harbor, which is to be found today in the seaside park with the pine trees. 

In 1307-1309, the village was destroyed by Catalan invaders and the inhabitants settled, for a period of time, in their scattered farm houses. Afytos had been destroyed numerous times by the invaders of the times. The last catastrophe recorded was the one in 1821 during the Greek revolution against the Turkish oppression. 

In 1995, the inhabitants of Aphytos, resisting the wide use of concrete in modern villages, and supporting the initiatives of the then president of the village, Vasili Pavli, pushed forward the idea of a traditional village by re-erecting the old stone houses, paving the streets, creating pavements, etc. So the old local porous stone quarries reopened and today every contemporary edifice is built with the local stone.

<h1>Agadez</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Agadez♡❤♡ is a historic city in Aïr region of &lt;a href="Northern%20Niger"&gt;Northern Niger&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in the 11th century, Agadez was an important stop for caravans crossing the Saharan Desert for centuries. Agadez was held by the Mali empire during part of the 14th century, captured by the Songhai empire in 1515, and controlled by Bornu in the 17th century. It remained a trade center until the late 19th century. During much of this time it was a center of Islamic learning and the seat of several sultanates before its capture by the French in 1900. 

It is a center of Tuareg culture and likewise two Tuareg rebellions in recent years: 1990-1995 &amp; 2007-present. The Tuareg are renowned for their metal and leather workings.The region around Agadez is known for its spectacular desert/mountain scenery. It is also the center of one of the largest uranium mining regions on Earth.

The historic centre of Agadez was added to the &lt;a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20List"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage List&lt;/a&gt; in 2013.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By road</h3>
Agadez lies on the ♡❤♡Trans-Sahara Highway♡❤♡, also known as the Algiers-Lagos Highway. The highway provides access north across the Sahara to &lt;a href="Algiers"&gt;Algiers&lt;/a&gt; and south to &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt; with a terminus in &lt;a href="Lagos"&gt;Lagos&lt;/a&gt;. The Trans-Sahelian (or Dakar-N'Djamena) Highway, bisects the Trans-Saharan Highway about 600 km south of Agadez. 

There is bus service to &lt;a href="Niamey"&gt;Niamey&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>By air</h3>

Agadez is served by &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , while an international airport in name, there are only domestic flights from &lt;a href="Niamey"&gt;Niamey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Zinder"&gt;Zinder&lt;/a&gt;. Flights between Europe and Agadez ceased with the start of the second Tuareg Rebellion in 2007. Thus, the most feasible way of arriving in Agadez by air is via the international airport in Niamey.

Agadez Tuareg Cross - The markings and geometrical design of Tuareg crosses and Tuareg jewelry in general translates into protective symbolism. "God is the center of the universe, we are one with God" and "no matter where you go God and I shall always be with you and protect you" are common Saharan interpretations. Those of the Muslim faith believe that the arms of the cross will disperse all evil from the individual, thus keeping him out of harms way. Tuareg parents are known to give these exquisite silver crosses to their children when they are about to depart from home but they are worn by all as a form of good luck and protection. The silver crosses are uniquely shaped and are named after the town of Agadez from where they originate. The cross bears the jewelers mark on its back. The beaded necklace contains four cylindrical decoratively embossed silver segments.

The Touareg crosses sold come in a number of designs. The Agadez cross is the most common, but many others are available. Each design is associated with a particular Touareg market town. Other examples include the Timia cross, the Iferouane cross and the unusual Ingal cross

It serves all the destinations of CTM and Supratours and many more for often a cheaper fare. It is very usual to arrive there, especially when not relying on CTM or Supratours, and not in Agadir center. A city bus to Agadir center goes for 3.50 dirham/person and is convenient and fast (use buses 97, 98 and 99). The ♡❤grand taxi♡❤ to Agadir costs from 5 dirham/person. One can go to Inezgane directly from the airport, which is closer, easier to catch buses to &lt;a href="Marrakech"&gt;Marrakech&lt;/a&gt; (3&amp;nbsp;hr, 70-80 dirham), &lt;a href="Ouarzazate"&gt;Ouarzazate&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href="Taroudannt"&gt;Taroudannt&lt;/a&gt; and other places.

<h2>Get around</h2>
<h3>On foot</h3>
The touristy part of the city is small enough to be able to walk it.

<h3>By bus</h3>
There is a public bus service which is quite reliable. Fares are usually 3.5-5 dirham, directly paid to the driver, which will hand you a proper ticket. Keep the ticket until the end, there might be controls. Maps can be obtained from the Tourist Office which is along the Boulevard Mohammad V near the Miramar Hotel. Alternatively, also OpenStreetMap has the Agadir bus network available, so get yourself one of the mobile apps using OpenStreetMap, like &lt;a href="http%3A//osmand.net/"&gt;OsmAnd&lt;/a&gt; (complex with many add-ons) and &lt;a href="https%3A//maps.me/"&gt;MAPS.ME&lt;/a&gt; (easy but limited).

<h3>By taxi</h3>
Most of the Agadir's ♡❤petit taxi♡❤ are quite legal and use the taximeter (you can ask the driver to do it without any problems). If you go around the center, they will ask you normally from 10 to 30 dirham (as of 2018).

<h3>By motorbike rental</h3>
Mopeds can be rented around Hotel Kenzi, but they are expensive, more than 100 dirham an hour.

Everything from tourist souvenirs, clothes, leather goods, household items, to fruit and veg. If you are a tourist and enter via Gate 9 or 10 (the main gates) expect to be approached by someone offering to guide you. Which of course means he'll take you to all his friend's stalls. If you wish to avoid this, and explore on your own, enter through one of the lower numbered gates where the Moroccan's go. Haggle hard and note some stores advertise fixed prices. Worth looking there first so you have an idea of the 'right' price to pay before trying your hand at haggling. Personal favourites and the olives and spices stalls. Generally stallholders are happy to be in your photographs, but be respectful and ask permission first.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Buy</h2>
Agadir is maybe the city with the least charm to buy the typical Moroccan handcraft goods. All the ♡❤souk♡❤ is around a big square behind the Uniprix (Blvd. Hassan II with Ave. Sidi Mohammed). There is a concrete building called ♡❤Marché centrale♡❤ with many shops inside. Is possible to get in also from Ave. Prince Moulay Abdallah. All the goods are made outside the Agadir region, and it's difficult to find them at a good price. The good thing of buying in Agadir is that there are many fixed-price shops, which is good if you don't know how to &lt;a href="haggle"&gt;haggle&lt;/a&gt; well. In fact, you may find that the cheap things you bought in Marrakech are not so cheap!

In the Uniprix shop it is possible to buy small typical pieces in maybe the least authentic shop in Morocco, but the prices are not so high and there is nobody pushing you to buy.

</ul>
<h2>Eat</h2>
There are four main zones in which to eat in Agadir:
<ul>
BULLET::::- New Talbourjt: The cheapest restaurants are here. There are menus for 35 dirham. It's one of the cheapest zones in Morocco for tourists.
BULLET::::- The beach: Next to the beach, there are many restaurants. You can find from international fast food to Indian food, good fish restaurants, etc. It's the most expensive and touristic zone.
BULLET::::- Around the Uniprix: It's the mid-price zone. There are touristic restaurants and some restaurants for the local people.

</ul>
If you're looking for a quick snack, keep an eye out for the pastry vendors who roam the beach carrying big plastic trays, selling sweet fried bread that are called "sfinj."

Beware, however, that these friendly hawkers will often approach you on the beach, strike up a conversation, and then thrust a pastry into your hand, whether you asked for one or not. Which, of course, you are then expected to pay for (1-2 dirham, ♡❤not♡❤ 5-10). If you don't want to buy, simply refuse the offer with a polite smile. They ♡❤are♡❤ delicious, though.

<h2>Drink</h2>
Agadir is prepared for European tourists, so you can find night clubs in the touristic zones, where you can find more tourists beside the usual locals looking for tourists.

Alcohol is found in all the touristic places and can also be purchased at the Uniprix and Atacadao supermarkets.

If you are looking just to talk and drink something during the evening, you can go to the nice and big cafes that are at ave. Hassan II, like ♡❤La Fontaine♡❤, ♡❤La Veranda♡❤, ♡❤Le Dome♡❤, etc. It's a real ritual for many Agadir citizens.

<h2>Sleep</h2>
The main budget accommodation area is in the Nouveau Tablorjt. A simple double room will set you back around 150–180 dirham although you might find a really basic hotel with crappy toilets for 80 dirham. Arrive early as hotels tend to fill up quickly in high season.

It's near where the bus stops (1&amp;nbsp;min walk), right next to an internet cafe and about 20 min walk or a 6 dirham taxi ride (don't forget to get them to turn the meter on) to the seafront. It is possible to stay in a room on the roof with a double bed and a single for 100 dirham! The best thing is, it has an amazing warm shower with a large showerhead. The rooms definitely have a "backpackers" feel, but its a great, and cheap, experience.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;130 Dhs for a single room without bathroom, 150 with bathroom&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h1>Hagåtña</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Hagåtña♡❤♡ (pronounced huh-GAHT-nya) is the capital of &lt;a href="Guam"&gt;Guam&lt;/a&gt;. It is the island's second smallest village in both area and population. From the 18th through mid 20th century, it was Guam's population center; but following heavy bombardment during WWII, much of the village was destroyed and a majority of Hagåtna's population permanently relocated to neighboring villages. Rebuilt to include a number of large government and office buildings, as well as storefronts, Hagåtña today is both the seat of local government and one of the island's major commercial districts. It has a population of only 1,100, but the surrounding metropolitan area is much larger.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Formerly known as ♡❤♡Agana♡❤♡ in English, Hagåtña (also spelled as ♡❤♡Hagatna♡❤♡ on various publications) is now known by its original name in the native &lt;a href="Chamorro%20phrasebook"&gt;Chamorro language&lt;/a&gt;, which was restored in 1998. It is speculated that ♡❤Hagåtña♡❤ roughly translates as "related to Agat" or "more/better Agat," &lt;a href="Agat"&gt;Agat&lt;/a&gt; being a southern Guamanian village where the founders of Hagåtña are thought to have migrated from.

<h1>Agdam</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Agdam♡❤♡ ♡❤was♡❤ a city in &lt;a href="Southern%20Azerbaijan"&gt;Southern Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Today Agdam, which bustled with life more than 20 years ago, is completely deserted and in ruins. Azeris hail it their Hiroshima as it was largely wasted when they lost it to Armenian forces during the war which saw the Azeri loss of &lt;a href="Nagorno-Karabakh"&gt;Nagorno-Karabakh&lt;/a&gt;. Officially, tourists are prohibited from entering Agdam without permission due to its close proximity to Azerbaijan border; In the past, this rule was totally unenforced in practice, and travelers who encounter soldiers stationed in the region were not be turned back. As of 2018, there is a police checkpoint in Agdam where tourists are intercepted and kindly turned back. The guards also ask to delete any photos taken around Agdam, so it's best to have a backup ready when approaching the checkpoint. 

The town will not be repopulated since the Karabakh republic treats it not as part of the republic but more as a buffer zone that might be given back in a peace treaty some day.

<h2>Get in</h2>
A taxi should cost something between 8,000-12,000 dram. It is up to the driver if he takes the risk to take you there. It is also easy to hitchhike into Agdam from nearby Stepanakert. However, tall grasses throughout the city make it difficult to find your way, and hitchhiking out can be moderately challenging.

<h2>Get around</h2>
Tall weeds makes visibility difficult during parts of the year. Try to locate the minarets of the Agdam Mosque and walk towards them. Climb to the top of a minaret in order to better orient yourself.

<h2>See</h2>
The ♡❤♡Agdam Mosque♡❤♡ was one of the few buildings not destroyed during the siege. The bottom floors are inhabited by cattle, but you can escape the stench by climbing a terrifying flight of stairs to the top of one of the minarets. From the top of the minaret you will have an opportunity to see most of the abandoned city. A must do.

An old mural on the side of a building a few hundred meters from the mosque is a reminder of the city's once vibrant past. Difficult to find, but don't miss it.

Unless offered food/drinks by one of the friendly Armenian families that picnics here, there will be nowhere to get supplies. Water can be obtained from the guards at the police checkpoint.

<h1>Aggressive dogs</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤Wikivoyage articles have a stay safe section with location specific advice. This article contains general information relevant to many destinations.♡❤ 

<h2>Understand</h2>

♡❤♡Aggressive dogs♡❤♡ are a common problem when travelling in places such as &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="South%20America"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt; and some Eastern European countries like &lt;a href="Romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;. The dogs are often feral (and hence not used to taking commands from people) and may be running wild in packs, which can be extremely intimidating if you are confronted by one. The obvious precautions &amp;mdash; travel in groups, avoid areas where the dogs are, don't go out at night when they are most active, and carry a walking stick if you must go &amp;mdash; will reduce the risks but not eliminate them.

Such dogs are rarely ♡❤♡&lt;a href="rabies"&gt;rabid&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, but it is possible. Consider being vaccinated against rabies before travelling to such areas. See individual articles here for region-specific information and consult a physician (preferably one with expertise in travel medicine) for advice on vaccinations before you travel.

<h2>Encounter</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡DO NOT RUN!♡❤♡ Although it may seem counter-intuitive when you suddenly see an angry, barking and snarling dog running towards you, the most important thing to do is not to turn and run. The dog's natural instincts will kick in and it will chase after you.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Stay calm, don't make any sudden movements, and don't look the dog directly in the eye: dogs see this as a challenge and may react by becoming more aggressive.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Try to turn sideways on: this isn't necessarily a submissive gesture but will minimise the chance that the dog will see you as a threat. Also, if the beast does attack, this protects your throat and other sensitive areas.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Throwing stones, dirt or sand at dogs that begin to approach you is often effective. In certain areas such as &lt;a href="Iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, the locals' response on seeing dogs nearby is often to pick up a few stones to throw at them. The dogs will fairly often retreat if they just see you bending over for ammo.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- If you are confronted by a dog when bicycling a good thing to do is to grab your bicycle water bottle and throw water to the dog. This causes the dog to back off. When dismounting away from the dog, your bicycle can be a useful barrier.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- If you are confronted by a dog when motorcycling, approach it slowly to upset its timing, then speed up to leave it behind.

</ul>
<h2>Protect</h2>
If you're unlucky enough to get attacked, there are a number of things you can do to minimize the damage.

<ul>
BULLET::::- If you have an object (bag, coat, umbrella, etc.), you can hold out in front of you, offer this to the dog as it attacks. Alternatively — if you have time — wrap some padding around your arm and use this. If the dog bites on this, keep hold of it: if you let go, the dog will realize that it's not part of you and go for something else.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Try using a pepper spray and spray it directly into the face. Repeat spraying until the dog goes away.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- If you get bitten, don't yank yourself away from the dog; its teeth are designed to stop things being ripped out of its mouth, Also, the animal's instincts will be to bite harder.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- If you have been bitten, see a doctor as soon as possible!

♡❤♡Aghaboe♡❤♡ is a village in &lt;a href="County%20Laois"&gt;County Laois&lt;/a&gt;. It is located on the R434 regional road in the rural hinterland west of the town of Abbeyleix.

<h2>Understand</h2>
The parish comprises the civil parishes of Bordwell and Kylermough, in their entirety; the town and Coolacurragh in the parish of Coolkerry; all of the civil parish of Aghaboe lying in Clarmallough; and the parish of Kyledellig, except for about 100 acres (0.40 km2).
In 1346 "The one eyed Diarmaid Mac Giollaphádraig ... aided by the Uí Céarbhail ... burned the town of Aghaboe and the cemetery and church and cruelly forsaking St. Canice, abbot, patron of the neighbourhood and found of the place, he, like a degenerate son to his father, burnt and completely destroyed with the crullest fire, the saint's shrine with his bones and relics." 1.
Previous to 1855, the portion of the civil parish situated in the Barony of Clandonnagh, included moreover, the portion of the civil parish of Aghaboe situated in the Barony of Clandonnagh which with the 100 acres (0.40 km2) above of Kyledellig, became in that year the new parish of Borris-in-Ossary.

Alternatively the distance from &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;b&gt; JSH &lt;/b&gt; ) near &lt;a href="Sitia"&gt;Sitia&lt;/a&gt; is about .

<h2>Get around</h2>

<h3>By bus</h3>
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.bus-service-crete-ktel.com/"&gt;Local bus service&lt;/a&gt; with modern air conditioned buses.

&lt;a href="Elounda"&gt;Elounda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kritsa"&gt;Kritsa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sitia"&gt;Sitia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Heraklion"&gt;Heraklion&lt;/a&gt; (and from there, &lt;a href="Knossos"&gt;Knossos&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="Malia"&gt;Malia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Hersonnisos"&gt;Hersonnisos&lt;/a&gt; are easily accessed with a regular bus service which is very good value.

<h3>By scooter</h3>
Scooters are readily available. Wearing of crash helmets is ♡❤compulsory.♡❤ Do not ruin your holiday by receiving a large fine.

<h3>By hired car</h3>
You will not normally need a 4 x 4 to negotiate the roads, most of which are sealed. Some places and rental properties are less accessible. Beware of damage to the underside of the hire car on rough tracks.

<h3>By taxi</h3>
Excellent value. Invariably will be a large, clean and air-conditioned Mercedes. Most drivers speak basic English and have none of the bad habits of many Med taxi drivers (loud local music, smoking en route etc.).

<h3>By quad</h3>
Not designed for use on road, these cause traffic congestion and impatience, leading to many accidents and occasional deaths. Think very carefully before hiring one and using it on the roads.

<h2>See</h2>
Recommended are the boat trips which are fascinating and amazing value (do not spend more than €10); they also usually include an ocean swim.

</ul>
<h2>Do</h2>

Go to Almyros beach, a long sandy beach with a cold water stream entering the sea at the southern end. Perfect for a cooling paddle if the heat gets too much. About a 20&amp;nbsp;minute walk from the town centre but worth every step. Alternatively, a taxi from the town centre costs about €8.

If it is windy, consider a pebble beach rather than a sand beach, of which there is no shortage.

<h2>Buy</h2>
Locally produced fruit and vegetables at the market on Wednesday morning. The tomatoes are superb.

Thyme honey. The bees here take the pollen from hyme and the subtle flavour is transferred to the honey.

<h2>Eat</h2>
There are a good selection of restaurants and tavernas in the town, ranging from the small and friendly "Grigoris" to the superb "Mediterraneo" on the harbour.

Meze restaurants worth visiting are "Barko" which provides a modern slant on traditional dishes and "Chyssofillis" on Kitroplatia. Just around the corner is "9 Muses", a modern restaurant /cafe bar which is popular with local residents. The recently opened "Piato" near Ammoudi beach is an excellent contemporary meze restaurant. Near the taxi rank by tourist information is "Embassy".

For more northern European tastes, "Obelix" is a Dutch operated restaurant near Ammoudi beach which serves large portions with a daily special.

"Puerto" is popular with the young locals and 25 March Street (25 Martiou) is busy at weekends with many of the local student population. Don't be misled by old tales about this street being the hub of the night life for tourists. It is entirely "Greek" and if you don't want to hear modern Greek music you will be in the wrong place.

The bars that have survived the change in tourist tastes over the last few years include "Aquarius", "Sorrento" and "Alexandros". The first two are "British" style tourist bars and the latter is a rooftop garden bar which has a small dance floor.

<h1>Agios Nikolaos (Chalkidiki)</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Agios Nikolaos♡❤♡ is a village of &lt;a href="Chalkidiki"&gt;Chalkidiki&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href="Sithonia"&gt;Sithonia&lt;/a&gt; peninsula with a permanent population of 2,500.

Agios Nikolaos is 110 km from &lt;a href="Thessaloniki"&gt;Thessaloniki&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="Sithonia%20peninsula"&gt;Sithonia peninsula&lt;/a&gt; begins. With more than thirty kilometers of beaches, with beautiful picturesque bays, clean beaches and very clean waters, it is something special. The community is surrounded from north to south by dense pine forest and towards the west by Siggitikos Gulf. 

The well-known products of the area are wine, tsipouro, oil, honey, and fish, but the jobs are heavily concentrated in the tourism industry.

<h1>Agonda</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Agonda♡❤♡ is a beach area in the southernmost &lt;a href="Canacona"&gt;Canacona&lt;/a&gt; taluka of the Indian state of &lt;a href="Goa"&gt;Goa&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Agonda is a great spot for sunbathing, relaxing and swimming, with still relatively few tourists.
This is a nice long pristine stretch of beach. Though the waters here might not be the most ideal place for swimming (you have better beaches with calm waters in Goa), Agonda is definitely a place for those who want to quit on a Monday morning. Most mobile connections do not work here (only Vodafone does), so that is an added bonus for those looking forward to a quiet and relaxed holiday. Or, if you do need to party sometimes, &lt;a href="Palolem"&gt;Palolem&lt;/a&gt; is just 15 minutes by motorbike (10&amp;nbsp;km) away - but Agonda is generally cheaper, quieter, hassle-free and has much less "touristic" feel.

Agonda Beach basically has one long road parallel to the beach line, most rooms and bungalows for rent are located either between them or on the opposite side of the road. In the centre of the beach, there is Agonda Church and a local school/college (funnily enough, called Agonda University) to the right of it. Another road goes up from the church, crosses the river shortly after and goes through the village to the junction with a main road from Chaudi and Palolem, which are both to the right. To the left, this bigger road crosses the village until the beach road joins it near the river mouth and northern end of the beach, then continues on in the direction of Cabo da Rama.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Dabolim airport is about a 90-minute drive away. Agonda by road is 15 minutes from the more famous, busy &lt;a href="Palolem"&gt;Palolem&lt;/a&gt; beach.

<h3>By train</h3>
Agonda is only a few kilometres from Canacona station, although main train services stop at Margao station, about an hour’s drive away.

<h3>By bus</h3>
Regular buses depart from the Canacona bus station for Agonda (about 20 minutes). Buses from &lt;a href="Chaudi"&gt;Chaudi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Margao"&gt;Margao&lt;/a&gt; are available a few times a day.
From Canacona station, it's about 1&amp;nbsp;km to the Canacona bus stand, where you can bus the 9&amp;nbsp;km to Agonda. The bus stand is a large building with a white, curved roof. It is visible from the balcony of the Canacona railway station. To get there, walk up the road away from the train station until you reach the main road. Turn right (there will be a railway bridge to your left), and walk for 300m, the building will be on your left. Buses start at 7:35am and run about every hour until 6pm-ish. As with any Indian bus stand, you'll have to ask the people around, although the buses heading in that direction do usually stop near the sign at the bus station that says Agonda.
Agonda buses leave to go back every 30 mins from the other side of the road to where you get dropped off. The last bus to Canacona leaves Agonda at 6:30pm. If you miss it, the locals can be persuaded to give you a motorbike ride back to the station for about ₹100.

The bus will drop you off at the northern end of the beach, on a junction near the church.
There are a few more buses on the main road, but this means 10-15 minutes walk from the beach centre. The price to Chaudi is ₹7 or ₹8. To Canacona, about ₹25.

<h3>By taxi</h3>
Taxis and auto rickshaws are a more comfortable and quicker alternative to the public bus.
Ask any rickshaw driver or taxi driver and they will take you there from Palolem, Patnem or Chaudi.

<h2>Get around</h2>

One or two autos usually stand near the church during the daytime. As always in India, bargain (the normal price to Chaudi or Palolem should be around ₹50, but many tourists end up paying ₹100 and more).

Motorbikes and scooters are offered for rent, both by house owners and by the auto guys near the church. A nearly-new Honda Activa or similar should cost ₹150-₹200 a day. (₹200 is a usual starting price, but during the peak period bargaining could be difficult), less if rented for more than a week or two.

<h2>See</h2>

Agonda's beach is very simple and natural. There are some sunbeds but when the tourist police or Canacona local government officials appear, any beach shades, sunbeds, chairs etc. which are outside the confines of the shacks disappear pronto and the beach looks even more gorgeous and makes you realise why you went there and not to some built up resort.

Agonda beach is famous as a Ridley turtle nesting site. These animals are endangered. Please keep the noise level and the lights down at night at the beach to give them a chance to nest. The Panchayat ( village administration) is very invested in not allowing Agonda to become another overcrowded Palolem. Anything you can do to minimize waste, safe water or electricity will be much appreciated since the village is struggling to avoid environmental degradation and preserve its beauty for the next generation. It is very quiet place, not suitable for the party crowd.

<h2>Do</h2>

A typical sun and sand holiday.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Local Fishermen take you on dolphin rides. Bargain hard and a boat can take up to people, costing ₹800.
BULLET::::- Hike on the hillocks.
BULLET::::- Ride through the countryside on the way to cabo de rama, cola beach with its beautiful river which is always warm.
BULLET::::- A meeting place for spiritually interested people. Here is Samdarshi's mediation Ashram in wintertime (Eden-Garden close to the northend) with Satsangs, and free Osho mediation techniques, dancing evenings.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Cola Beach♡❤♡ (or Khola Beach) is a remote, unspoilt beach for those seeking complete peace and relaxation, 10km north from Agonda. Go north past Agonda, up and down hills, through villages, past the big temple on your left to the place where the bus stops. About 25 meters after your exit is the only road sign for Cola beach. Your exit is a sand and stone road going through the dried out landscape, just follow the main track for a few km’s and you’ll find yourself looking down on Cola beach. It’s not all that easy to find this place, but it will be worth your effort. You park your bike or scooter where the road ends, and then there’s a 3-minute walk, down to the beach. Cola beach looks beautiful through the trees from the top of the path. The beach is actually three small bays, separated by large rocks. The middle beach covers a lagoon that stretches back into the jungle. When you walk down the stairs you’ll walk straight into the ‘Blue Lagoon’, the only option for eating and drinking on Cola beach.

</ul>
<h3>Yoga</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- There are a few yoga schools and yoga teacher training centers in Agonda.

</ul>
<h2>Buy</h2>
There are stores stocking basic supplies in Agonda, as well as internet, phone and currency conversion services. HDFC Bank ATM is located near the church. More shops, a Saturday market and several ATMs are a 20-minute drive away in the local town, Chaudi.

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡New Noble Kashmir Art♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Agonda&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;near the church&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;8:00AM-9:30PM&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Run by two young, very friendly Kashmiris, who sell wall hangings, papier-mâché figurines, silk/pashimna shawls and many other high-quality products from Kashmir. If you spend a bit more time in the shop, they can tell you all about how the things are produced and how their family is involved in the business.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Eat</h2>

There are no renowned eateries like the big beaches but you can order for most international cuisines. Not all places where you stay will have a restaurant. Nevertheless there are enough to survive upon. Dersey's on the southern end of Agonda beach is one of the restaurants open even during the low season, serving both Indian and local food. There's another (probably year-round) restaurant on the beach road closer to the northern end, but it seems to be overpriced with rates compared or even more than those on Palolem beach. During the high season, more places are opened, but still not too many.

If you do not afraid local food (and there's nothing dangerous in it, actually) and/or want to save money, Niki bar on the road to Chaudi (just where the road to Agonda Beach branches from it to the right) serves good fish thalis for a reasonable ₹30 in what seems to be a local eatery and an afternoon (as he closes his place around 5 PM) drinking point for a few locals. Foreigners are seen there surprisingly often for such a "local" place.

Some local shops also do have a few tables and prepare basic food (omelettes, fish &amp; veg thalis, tea, juice, etc.) during the high season, but their price tag is usually more "touristic" (less than in restaurants, however, that is ₹50-₹60 for a thali). One of them can be found just 50 m right from the church, at the end of the first building with small shops on the left side.

The food is slightly overpriced, but it's clean and tasty and the owners will let you sit there all day on a meal. The banana porridge is pretty good. They also have very nice and colorful (and nice inside) shacks they rent out.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;₹60-₹150&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Drink</h2>
Agonda is a relatively quiet village, and there are much fewer opportunities for a fun evening out there than in Palolem. But, as it is Goa, buying drinks is not a problem, at least before 9-10 PM. Restaurants offer beer at least; also, there is a wine shop around 100-150 m to the right from Agonda church and another one in Dersey's. Just opposite the church on the street leading away from the sea, there is a tiny and cheap local bar (small beer ₹30 / big ₹60, they have Old Monk, etc. also) which is open till the evening. Don't expect many people there, however; you can easily be the only customer even in the evening.

<h2>Sleep</h2>

Only basic accommodation options are available for stay in Agonda. Outside the main season which is from November to February, you have to arrange for a stay in a Goan family house. Off-season prices there, however, can be really low - for example, in October (when, while it's still humid a bit, most days are sunny) you can rent a room in a nice Portuguese-style villa from around ₹250 (peak high-season prices for the same could be around ₹600, or less in the wooden bungalows mostly built between the main street and the beach). While locals are mostly genuinely friendly and there's much less hassle from them than, say, in Palolem, some of them won't think twice before asking three or more times the normal price, especially if they see the person isn't used to the local prices. So, if you're asked much more than expected, bargain or better try another place.

Advance booking, however, is neither really needed (maybe except for a few peak days around New Year) nor saves any money (in fact, often you pay more).

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
Agonda is a fairly safe place. While you should retain your common sense, lock the door and windows when going out, and not to leave your valuables unattended, chances to have any problems in Agonda are very slim. Even sellers offering useless "souvenirs" on the beach are much less annoying and less frequent here than in Palolem or northern beaches.

<h2>Go next</h2>

Local bus station is in Chaudi. It is useful mainly for going to the south (&lt;a href="Karwar"&gt;Karwar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ankola"&gt;Ankola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Gokarna"&gt;Gokarna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mangalore"&gt;Mangalore&lt;/a&gt;), east (&lt;a href="Hampi"&gt;Hampi&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="Ankola"&gt;Ankola&lt;/a&gt;), or some more remote locations like &lt;a href="Bangalore"&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;. If you plan to visit &lt;a href="North%20Goa"&gt;North Goa&lt;/a&gt; or going somewhere further north - you should go straight to &lt;a href="Margao"&gt;Margao&lt;/a&gt;, as from Chaudi it will be your first major stop anyway.

Train station in Chaudi (Canacona) has only a few trains a day stopping on it. Much more trains are leaving or stopping on Margao (Madgaon) station. Check &lt;a href="http%3A//www.irctc.co.in"&gt;IRCTC&lt;/a&gt; web site for details and online ticket bookings.

The nearest (international) airport is at Dabolim, 65 km away. To get there by bus, you'll need to first to Margao, then to Vasco Da Gama or to the airport directly. There is possibly direct bus from Karwar to Vasco/airport also, which stops at Canacona - check in advance whether it's available.

Taxis are advertised in Agonda by some establishments (shops, etc.) on the beach road - mostly for longer trips such as to airport or Margao. Prepaid taxi from Margao (45 km), as of October 2009, costs ₹600, probably 800 or 900 from the airport (65 km) - so you should negotiate at least comparable, or cheaper price.

<h1>Agost</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Agost♡❤♡ (Valencian pronunciation: [aˈɣost]) is a small town in &lt;a href="Alicante%20%28province%29"&gt;Alicante (province)&lt;/a&gt;, located about 18 km from the provincial capital &lt;a href="Alicante"&gt;Alicante&lt;/a&gt;. For centuries the town was known for ceramics, a reputation which it maintains to the present day.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Agost was first settled by the Iberians, and later inhabited by the Moors, who built a now-ruined castle on the hilltop in the centre of town. After the Reconquista, the town belonged to the crown of Castile for a few years, before being incorporated into the Kingdom of Valencia in the late 13th century. Agost gained municipal autonomy at the end of the 17th century.

Due to the rich clay deposits located just outside the city, the town developed into a centre of pottery. Although many of the old workshops have now closed, eleven potteries still remain in town, six of them still producing traditional wares.

Because of its distance from the coast, the town has not been inundated by mass tourism and has retained its local identity. Today its primary economic activity is ceramics production and agriculture.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By bus</h3>
From &lt;a href="Alicante"&gt;Alicante&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//agostense.es/horarios/%3Ffrom%3DAlicante%26amp%3Bto%3DAgost%26amp%3Bperiod%3D-1"&gt;♡❤♡Autocares Agostense♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt; (tel. +34 965 280 657) runs three buses daily, departing at 09:00, 13:58 and 20:30, with the journey taking just half an hour.

♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ci.agoura-hills.ca.us/"&gt;Agoura Hills&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡Westlake Village♡❤♡ are cities in the &lt;a href="Ventura%20County"&gt;Ventura County&lt;/a&gt; region. Though they are both actually within the border of Los Angeles County, they share the Conejo Valley with &lt;a href="Thousand%20Oaks"&gt;Thousand Oaks&lt;/a&gt; and are separated from the &lt;a href="San%20Fernando%20Valley"&gt;San Fernando Valley&lt;/a&gt; by the Simi Hills and Santa Monica Mountains.

<h2>Get in</h2>

Take the 101 North; once you have passed the Lost Hills exit, you are in Agoura Hills. When you have passed Lindero Canyon exit, you are no longer in Agoura Hills.

Los Angeles public transportation has one line in. During the summer, a special bus funded by the City takes passengers to and from Malibu beach.

<h2>Get around</h2>
Best by automobile, as none of the sites are public transit accessible.

<h2>See</h2>
North of the 101 Freeway, Agoura Hills is a typically suburban bedroom community and of little interest to most travelers, however, south of the 101 lies the scenic &lt;a href="Santa%20Monica%20Mountains%20National%20Recreation%20Area"&gt;Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area&lt;/a&gt; where you will catch sight of breathtaking views.

From 1916 to 1983 the property transferred to owners who shared a common interest in preserving the landmark adobe home located in the beautiful foothills beneath Ladyface Mountain.

The Ranch contains several miles of hiking trails to explore as well as the Western Town set.

<h2>Do</h2>

There are free summer concerts in the park. In the 90s, Agoura Hills was known as a "mecca of music," launching music sensations Linkin Park and Hoobastank.

There are a number of places where you can hire horses to ride.

There are plenty of trails to explore. Chesebro Canyon has some of the best hiking trails in all of Los Angeles. Many begin in Agoura Hills and take you to &lt;a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Highway"&gt;Pacific Coast Highway&lt;/a&gt;. You can hike in the opposite direction and once you reach the top, you'll be at an sulfur spring. There is no shortage of biking trails either.

<h1>Agra</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//agra.nic.in"&gt;Agra&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is the city of the Taj Mahal, in the north &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;n state of &lt;a href="Uttar%20Pradesh"&gt;Uttar Pradesh&lt;/a&gt;, some 200&amp;nbsp;km from &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;.

Agra has three &lt;a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20List"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage&lt;/a&gt; sites, the ♡❤♡Taj Mahal♡❤♡ and the ♡❤♡Agra Fort♡❤♡ in the city and ♡❤♡Fatehpur Sikri♡❤♡ 40 km away. There are also many other buildings and tombs from Agra's days of glory as the capital of the &lt;a href="Mughal%20Empire"&gt;Mughal Empire&lt;/a&gt;.

Besides these three sites, the city has little else to recommend it. Pollution, especially smog and litter, is rampant and visitors are pestered by swarms of touts and hawkers at every monument, besides the inner Taj Mahal which, once you are in, is free of scams and touts. The sites are some of the wonders of the world and no trip to India is complete without at least one visit to the Taj. For the vast majority of visitors, a single day in Agra is more than enough.

<h2>Understand</h2>

While Agra's heyday was as the capital of the &lt;a href="Mughal%20Empire"&gt;Mughal Empire&lt;/a&gt; between 1526 and 1658, the city was founded much earlier. The earliest reference to Agra is in the ancient epic, the Mahabharata, while Ptolemy was the first person to call it by its modern name. The recorded history of Agra begins around the 11th century, and over the next 500 years, the city changed hands between various kings, both Hindu and Muslim.

In 1506, Sultan Sikandar Lodi, the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, moved his capital from Delhi to Agra. His son Ibrahim Lodi was the last ruler of the Lodi dynasty, as he was defeated in 1526 by Babur, the first Mughal ruler, in the battle of &lt;a href="Panipat"&gt;Panipat&lt;/a&gt;. Agra fell too, and became the capital of the Mughals, whose rule over Agra was uninterrupted except for a brief period between 1540 and 1556. In 1540, Sher Shah Shuri overthrew Humayun became the ruler of much of North India, including Agra. After Sher Shah Suri's death his descendants proved unequal to the task of ruling the kingdom, and Hemu, a Hindu general of Suri became the effective ruler who would later crown himself King Hemachandra Vikramaditya just as the kingdom was facing an assault from the reinvigorated Mughals. In 1556, Hemu would be defeated and killed in the second battle of Panipat, and the Mughals regained Agra.

Mughals were great builders. Babur built the ♡❤♡Aram Bagh♡❤♡ (garden of relaxation) modelled after the garden of paradise, where he was eventually buried after his death. His grandson Akbar refurbished the ♡❤♡Agra fort♡❤♡ and built the ♡❤♡Fatehpur Sikri♡❤♡, an entire city just on the outskirts of Agra. He also renamed Agra after himself, and the city was known as ♡❤♡Akbarabad♡❤♡ while it was in Mughal hands. Akbar's grandson Shah Jehan would give Agra its most famous monument, the ♡❤♡Taj Mahal♡❤♡, which is the mausoleum of his beloved wife, ♡❤♡Mumtaz Mahal♡❤♡. The Taj is constructed in white marble. It took 20 years to construct, and is now universally known as a monument to love. Legend has it that Shah Jehan wanted a replica of the Taj constructed in black marble that would be his final resting place. There is no support for this theory, but even if it were true, it would have been unlikely to be undertaken. His son Aurangzeb was austere and pious, and had no time or inclination for the ostentation of his forefathers, preferring to spend his money on wars in South India. In any case, even during Shah Jehan's reign, which was the period when the Mughal empire was at its height, the construction of the Taj put a strain on the resources of the empire and caused a mini-famine around Agra. Shah Jehan was eventually buried in the white Taj, next to his beloved Begum.

Shah Jehan, in addition to giving Agra its greatest claim to fame, was also responsible for beginning its decline, as he decided to shift his capital to Shahjehanabad, which is now known as Old Delhi, in 1658. Though Aurangzeb ordered a move back, this too was short lived, as he moved his headquarters down south to &lt;a href="Aurangabad"&gt;Aurangabad&lt;/a&gt; to be focus on his wars. Agra declined, and so did the Mughal Empire. The city was eventually captured by the Marathas, who renamed Agra. In 1803, it came under the British, who situated the Agra Presidency there, and when India gained independence, the city was incorporated into the state of Uttar Pradesh, and did not gain even the limited honour of being the state's capital, that distinction going to &lt;a href="Lucknow"&gt;Lucknow&lt;/a&gt;, further east. It is now a tourist town, known for the Taj and a couple of other monuments.

A novel based on the remarkable story behind the Taj Mahal's is ♡❤Beneath a Marble Sky♡❤ by John Shors. It is an international bestseller, and is being made into a film by Hollywood. Another historical novel is ♡❤The Taj♡❤ by Colin De Silva.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Agra is 200&amp;nbsp;km southeast from Delhi and is one of the points of the tourist's Golden Triangle of Agra-&lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Jaipur"&gt;Jaipur&lt;/a&gt;. Agra is also very well connected via rail and road with other nearby cities and tourist destinations and thus suitable for a day trip from Delhi or as a part of a larger itinerary.

<h3>By plane</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q1849321"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Agra's Kheria Airport♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;&lt;b&gt; AGR &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Service to is seasonal. The city is served by Air India Regional, which flies on the &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;-Agra-&lt;a href="Jaipur"&gt;Jaipur&lt;/a&gt; tourist triangle route. The flight time to either is less than an hour. Hiring a car may be a cheaper alternative.
</ul>
&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; 

<h3>By train</h3>
Agra is on the main train line between the &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Mumbai"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt; (Bombay) and &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Chennai"&gt;Chennai&lt;/a&gt; routes, and many trains connect Agra with these cities every day. Some east-bound trains from Delhi also travel via Agra, so direct connections to points in Eastern India (including &lt;a href="Kolkata"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt;) are also available. There are close to 20 trains to Delhi every day, and at least three or four to Mumbai and to Chennai. Agra and &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt; are notorious for their thick winter fog which reduces visibility to almost zero. In late December and early January (the fog season), because of the reduced visibility, all trains slow down and travel time goes up. The Bhopal Shatabdi, for example, may arrive in Agra well after 10AM, and might return to Delhi well after midnight. From a safety point of view, it is always preferable to travel by train during the winter.

At Agra station, you can hire "UP Tourism" conducted tours on air-conditioned luxury coaches. Also, organized tours are available from Delhi. ♡❤♡If you travel during the high season, you must book your tickets a few days to a few weeks in advance if you wish to make it a day trip♡❤♡, i.e. travelling early in the morning and coming back at a reasonable time at night.

Train tickets can be booked online through the Indian Railways website paying by debit or credit cards, although those issued by foreign banks are often declined. For more information how to book tickets online, visit the article "&lt;a href="Rail%20travel%20in%20India"&gt;Rail travel in India&lt;/a&gt;".

<h4>Stations</h4>
There are three stations in Agra:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Agra Cantt♡❤♡ (Station Code: AGC) is the main railway station and lies southwest of the Taj and Agra Fort, both of which are a short ride from the station by car, auto-rickshaw or cycle rickshaw. There is a prepaid taxi stand right outside that charges a flat rate to any hotel in the city. You may catch an auto-rickshaw, if you walk a short way from the station, but they may not speak English. The station has a food court that also sells cheap, hygienic takeaway snacks such as sandwiches and samosas.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Agra Fort station♡❤♡ (Station Code: AF) near Agra Fort, is infrequently serviced by the interstate express trains. The station serves trains to the east (&lt;a href="Kanpur"&gt;Kanpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Gorakhpur"&gt;Gorakhpur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kolkata"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt;), and some of these trains also stop at Agra Cantt.
</ul>
This is one of the historical railway stations of Agra because there was a spacious, octagonal Tripolia Chowk which existed between the Jama Masjid and the Delhi gate of the Agra Fort. This Tropolia was destroyed in order to create the Agra Fort Railway Station, which was also the first railway station of Agra and also one of the oldest in the country.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Raja Ki Mandi♡❤♡ (Station code: RKM) is a small station. Some of the trains which stop at Agra Cantt also stop. The station has a laid-back and lazy atmosphere, but springs into life at the arrival of Intercity trains and the Taj Expresses. It is situated in the middle of the city.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Agra City♡❤♡ is in the heart of Agra. A relic of the metre gauge era, this station is not particularly useful.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Idgah Railway Station♡❤♡ is the first station if you arrive in Agra from Jaipur.

</ul>
<h4>Lines</h4>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Delhi to Agra♡❤♡ — Close to 20 trains connect &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt; and Agra each day with journey times varying from 2-5 hr. The best options are the ♡❤Bhopal Shatabdi Express♡❤ (departs New Delhi at 6:15AM arriving Agra Cantt at 8:12AM; departs Agra Cantt at 8:30PM arriving New Delhi at 10:30PM, daily except Friday; meal and water included in air-con carriage) and the ♡❤Taj Express♡❤ (departs Delhi Hazrat Nizamuddin at 7:15AM arriving Agra Cantt at 10:07AM; departs Agra Cantt at 6:55PM arriving Delhi Hazrat Nizamuddin at 10PM, daily).
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Agra to Jaipur♡❤♡ - The journey to Jaipur (Station code: JP) takes around 4 hr by train no. 2988 which leaves Agra Fort Railway Station at 6:25PM and reaches Jaipur at around 10:20PM.
</ul>
Also train number 2965 from Agra Cantonment to Jaipur at 5:40PM. The train arrives at 10:15PM. ₹300 air-con carriage.

<ul>
BULLET::::- The ♡❤♡Luxury train♡❤♡ — ♡❤&lt;a href="Palace%20on%20Wheels"&gt;Palace on Wheels&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ stops at Agra on its 8-day round trip of tourist destinations in &lt;a href="Rajasthan"&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt; and Agra.

</ul>
<h3>By bus</h3>
There are several buses to Agra originating from &lt;a href="Jaipur"&gt;Jaipur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ajmer"&gt;Ajmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Lucknow"&gt;Lucknow&lt;/a&gt; etc.

<h4>From Delhi</h4>
The highway between Delhi and Agra has a toll, so most buses do not take it. Rather, they take the local roads, which makes the trip significantly longer than the express trains (4-5 hr). It is possible to make it by bus and minibus to Agra by the smaller roads, however you must ask around where the buses to Agra depart from, preferably from a trusted local or the staff at your hotel/hostel. Indian bus stations are, most of the time either large pavement areas situated under flyovers, very crowded and without no further indications of which bus goes where or stands of private bus companies, which will offer a more comfortable trip at a higher price. This option is for the ones who feel adventurous, as your journey can be halted by a sudden breakdown of the bus or a road closure due to a local protest or other form of gathering. Note that this is by far the cheapest way to get to Agra, as it should not cost more than ₹60 the normal "bus" and ₹200 for a more coach-type bus.

<h4>From Agra</h4>
There are three interstate bus stands:
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Idgah Bus Stand♡❤♡ is the primary bus stand for travelling towards Rajasthan/Madhya Pradesh, in the heart of the city, 8&amp;nbsp;km from the Taj.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡ISBT♡❤♡ at Transport Nagar, 12&amp;nbsp;km from the Taj, is an inter state bus terminal. Most of the buses pass through here, except for buses originating from Idgah Bus Stand and going towards Rajasthan.

</ul>
If you wish to travel with these buses which are government-run, ♡❤♡you must insist to your rickshaw driver that he gets you there♡❤♡. If you only ask for the buses to Delhi, he will probably take you to a private bus company, from which he gets a cut. It will be slightly more expensive for you and these buses tend to stop at random places and drop you at random places as well, as these buses are not direct.

<h3>By taxi</h3>
You can either book a taxi from hotel or directly book one outside the railway station. There is usually a government authorised taxi stand, however it may be hard to find and the locals present at the station (looking for gullible tourists) will not help you find it. ₹950/day for 8&amp;nbsp;hours. It maybe more costly to book through hotel as hotels do have their in the fares. It is better to negotiate with the driver directly or book trough some online car rental portal.

Cars are not allowed near the Taj Complex, but the rest of Agra is easily discovered by car.

<h3>By car</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡From &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡: Yamuna Expressway, connects the 200&amp;nbsp;km distance from Delhi to Agra. The drive is typically 2&amp;nbsp;hours. The expressway runs from the city of Greater Noida to Agra. The highway has a toll.
</ul>
NH2 Highway: The primary access to the highway is along Mathura Road in Delhi but, if coming from South Delhi or Delhi Airport, it is easier to take Aurobindo Marg (Mehrauli Road) and then work up to NH2 via Tughlakabad. While the highway is divided, it is important to keep an eye out for trucks, cars, and bullock carts heading the wrong way. It is possible to hire a car with a driver (a big car for five persons from/to the Delhi airport costs ₹3,500). But beware, if you need to get from Agra to the airport in order to catch a flight, ensure you have plenty of time for the trip, as traffic conditions may increase the drive time significantly. Also, it is wise to know your driver. There are situations when he may take over five hours to cover the distance, and you cannot force him to drive any faster than an autorickshaw (tuk-tuk).

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡From &lt;a href="Jaipur"&gt;Jaipur&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡: National Highway 11, a four-lane divided highway, connects Agra with &lt;a href="Jaipur"&gt;Jaipur&lt;/a&gt; via the bird sanctuary town of &lt;a href="Bharatpur"&gt;Bharatpur&lt;/a&gt;. The distance of around 255&amp;nbsp;km can be covered in around 4&amp;nbsp;hours.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡From &lt;a href="Gwalior"&gt;Gwalior&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡: A distance of around 120&amp;nbsp;km, takes around 1.5&amp;nbsp;hours on the National highway 3 (Agra- Mumbai Highway).
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡From &lt;a href="Lucknow"&gt;Lucknow&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="Kanpur"&gt;Kanpur&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡: NH2, the divided modern highway, continues on to Kanpur (285&amp;nbsp;km, 5&amp;nbsp;hours) and from there to points East ending in &lt;a href="Kolkata"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt;. From Kanpur, NH25 heads for the city of &lt;a href="Lucknow"&gt;Lucknow&lt;/a&gt; (90&amp;nbsp;km, 2&amp;nbsp;hours).
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡From &lt;a href="Lucknow"&gt;Lucknow&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡&lt;a href="Lucknow"&gt;:&lt;/a&gt; Agra-Lucknow Expressway, the longest expressway in India, connects the 302 km distance from the state capital, &lt;a href="Lucknow"&gt;Lucknow&lt;/a&gt; to Agra. The drive is very smooth and takes 3 hours. It is a tolled highway.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡From Greater Noida ♡❤♡: Perhaps the best route as it connects to Agra directly by the Yamuna Expressway, 165&amp;nbsp;km, which can be completed in 1.5 – 2&amp;nbsp;hours because it has less traffic. The road is very smooth.

</ul>
<h2>Get around</h2>
 
Tongas, electric buses and electric tempos are readily available, and the best way to get to the Taj, where no cars are allowed. Auto-rickshaws and cycle-♡❤rickshaws♡❤ are available every where, remember to agree on fares clearly in advance. Foreigners shoukd bargain everywhere and bargain hard. Generally things are available at 40% of the initially quoted fares. Tempos have been replaced by auto-rickshaws, which mainly run on CNG (Compressed Natural Gas).

UP State Road Transport Corporation operates some non-air conditioned and air-conditioned buses but those run only on specific routes. The best way to experience the city is to take a walk on the Mall Road (Sadar). The street is full of handicraft and leather goods shops. You will also find plenty of food items quite unique to the city.

As polluting vehicles are banned around Taj Mahal, one needs to use Tonga or electric auto while travelling in the range of Taj Mahal. Camels are also available. As a guide, an auto rickshaw from Agra Cantonement station to the Taj Mahal is about ₹80 (at least in off season); and a cycle rickshaw from the Taj Mahal to Agra Fort is ₹40. You can also walk between the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort, in about 30 minutes.

<h2>See</h2>

Agra's top two sights by far are the incomparable Taj Mahal and Agra Fort.

<h3>Prices</h3>
₹1,100 for foreigners for a ticket for the Taj Mahal and ₹650 for Agra Fort. (Oct 2018) The Taj Mahal entry fee includes disposable shoe covers necessary to enter the mausoleum, water bottle &amp; ride in a battery operated shuttle to and from parking area.

<h3>Official guides</h3>

Official guides are available for Agra for ₹1200 for a half day (including Taj Mahal &amp; Agra Fort). Ask at your agent for details. Any guide that charges less than that is probably an unlicensed tout. Most unlicensed touts have fake IDs and focus more on taking you shopping rather than on presenting accurate information.You can book a local Govt. approved guide by logging www.tajtourguide.com or online search. 

<h3>Audio guides</h3>
In April 2011 the Archaeological Survey of India introduced an official self-guided audio tour (₹105 in English &amp; foreign languages or ₹63 in Hindi &amp; Indian languages) which allows visitors to experience the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort at their own pace with authentic and accurate information. The official audio guide booth is near the monument ticket counters. Apps for self-guided tours are also available for iPhone and Android.

<h3>Taj Mahal</h3>

♡❤The Taj Mahal is closed every Friday♡❤

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q9141"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Taj Mahal♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;is an immense mausoleum of white marble, built between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife. Taj Mahal means ♡❤Crown Palace♡❤; one of the wife's names was Mumtaz Mahal, ♡❤Ornament of the Palace♡❤. The Taj is one of the most well preserved and architecturally beautiful tombs in the world, one of the masterpieces of Indo-Islamic architecture and one of the world's great heritage sites.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
The Taj Mahal has a life of its own that leaps out of marble once you understand that it is a monument of love. The Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore called it ♡❤a teardrop on the cheek of eternity♡❤, while the English poet, Sir Edwin Arnold, said it was ♡❤Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passions of an emperor's love wrought in living stones.♡❤

Although it is one of the most photographed edifices in the world and instantly recognisable, actually seeing it in person is awe-inspiring. Not everything is in the photos. The grounds of the complex include several other beautiful buildings, reflecting pools, and extensive ornamental gardens with flowering trees and bushes, and a small gift shop. The Taj framed by trees and reflected in a pool is amazing. Close up, large parts of the building are covered with inlaid stonework.

There is an apocryphal tale that Shah Jahan planned to build an exact copy out of black marble on the opposite side of the Yamuna river. His plans were foiled by his son, Aurangzeb, who murdered three of his elder brothers and then overthrew and imprisoned his father to acquire the throne. Shah Jahan is now buried alongside his wife in the Taj Mahal.

Because the Taj is white, your camera may underexpose your photos. Overexposure by 1 or 2 stops is recommended.

The Taj is open from 6AM-7:30PM every day ♡❤except Friday♡❤. Entry costs ₹250 for Indians and ₹1,100 for foreigners. Get there as early as possible to beat the crowds, and plan to visit the Taj at least two different times during the day (dusk and dawn are best) in order to experience the full effect of changing sunlight on the amazing building. Note that entry to the monument closes 30 minutes before sunset. It is also utterly stunning under a full moon.

To buy tickets, you can go to the south gate, but this gate is 1&amp;nbsp;km far away of the entrance and the counter open at 8AM. At the west and east gate, the counter open at 6AM. Alongside the ticket counter, you can also purchase a self-guided audio tour (allows two to a device) for ₹100 in English and foreign languages and ₹60 for Indian languages.

The Taj is located in the middle of the city. Expect a queue to get into the grounds. There are three gates: The western gate is the main gate where most tourists enter. A large number of people visit on weekends and public holidays and entry through the western gate may take hours. The southern and eastern gates are much less busy and should be tried on such days.

Once inside, expect long queues to enter the Mausoleum. There are two lines depending on the type of ticket that you've purchased. At the base of the monument, turn to your right for general (Indian) entry and turn to your left for high-value (foreigner) tickets. The general line can wrap around the building several times by the afternoon, whereas the foreigner line is typically empty. Helpful guards can direct you if you get lost.

Mosquito repellent is advisable in the warmer months. 

There are night viewing of Taj Mahal sessions on the nights of a full moon and the two days before and after (so five days in total). Exceptions are Fridays, the Muslim sabbath, and the month of Ramadan. Booking has to be made 24&amp;nbsp;hours in advance from the Archaeological Society of India office situated at 22, Mall Road, Agra. Tickets cost ₹510 for Indians and ₹750 for non-Indians. The hours for night viewing are 8:30PM-9PM and 9PM-9:30PM. A visitor must arrive 30 min prior to viewing hours for a security check at the Taj Mahal ticket kiosk at the East Gate. The night view is likely not worth spending the money as the visitors are kept far from the Taj Mahal (nearly 200 metres away) and there is not sufficient light for viewing or photography.

<h3>Agra Fort</h3>

As much a palace as a defensive structure, it is also constructed mainly from red sandstone, and much white marble in the palace section of the fort.

Alternatively, walk past the entrance and straight to the sandy banks of the river: the view of the Taj is every bit as lovely (perhaps more so, since the barbed wire fence surrounding the gardens will be behind you), although you may have to deal with aggressive touts. Don't forget to take a round trip by auto rickshaw.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;Entrance to the park is ₹100 for foreigners&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

Akbar started its construction himself but it was completed by his son Jehangir, who significantly modified the original plans which accounts for the somewhat cluttered architectural lines of the tomb.

It dates back to the time of Akbar (ruled 1556 - 1605). The earliest grave dates back to 1611 and is of an Armenian named Khwaja Mortenepus. The star attraction of the cemetery is the tomb of William Hessing (1740 - 1803), a Dutch commander of Agra Fort under Maharaja Daulat Rao Scindia. The red sandstone tomb was constructed by his wife and is designed along the lines of the Taj Mahal, but not an exact copy. It is often referred to as the Red or Baby Taj. The Ellisa Memorial, Tomb of General Perron's children and many of the other tombs are built in Islamic style. Also, many of the Armenian graves have epitaphs in Persian.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h2>Buy</h2>

Agra has many shops selling stone products, from jewellery to small boxes and plaques with inlay work resembling that on the Taj. The best of these are wonderful, and even the run-of-the-mill ones are rather pretty. Agra is also famous for its leather goods. Consider spending time in Sadar Bazaar for some shopping and cheap food.

Beware of being overcharged. Do not let ♡❤anyone♡❤ lead you to a shop, lest the price go up to cover their commission, typically 50%. Be very wary of the promises these people make. Bargain hard. Be prepared to walk away, you can nearly always get the same items in another shop or order items you liked during your visit over the Internet after you return. Expect to encounter petty and greedy shopowners who will resort to every lie in the book to make a sale (with initial markups of 1,000-10,000%).

There are many local markets: Sadar Bazar. a sophisticated market, Raja ki Mandi market, Sanjay Place for all the offices, Shah Market for electronics. All of these markets are situated along the M G Road. Hospital Road Market and Subhash Bazar for clothes situated near Agra Fort railway station. Rawatpara market is for spices. Besides these there are many branded shops along the M G Road.

Many wholesale marble products are available at Gokul Pura Market near Raja Mandi on M. G. Road which can be easily reached by auto rickshaw, the price of most items are nearly 25% in the retail market.

Be careful when buying jewels: lots of stones are fake and the price is comparatively high.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Don't leave cash or any valuables in the hotel room. Cross check all hotel, restaurant and lounge bills for errors.
BULLET::::- Never pay anyone for anything upfront, including taxi drivers.
BULLET::::- Beware of &lt;a href="pickpockets"&gt;pickpockets&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- If you decide to purchase anything, beware that most items are cheap replicas of original items and not likely to last long.The toys are really poorly put together so do not buy them!
BULLET::::- During the winter season, the weather of Agra is unpredictable and temperature may go as low as freezing; be well prepared.
BULLET::::- Some unscrupulous dealers of carpets use the classic 'bait and switch'. If you buy something, insist on carrying it yourself else what arrives in the post might not be what you bargained for. A carpet shop named 'Kanu carpets' is particularly infamous for this. It is prudent to stray clear of shady looking establishments.

This strong and massive fort was the summer resort of the rulers of Bharatpur and has many palaces and gardens.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Fatehpur Sikri♡❤♡ ghost city is a UNESCO world heritage site about 40 km from Agra. Built in the 16th century by the Emperor Akbar, the "City of Victory" was the capital of the Mughal Empire for a brief decade and was abandoned in 1586 due to inadequate local water supplies and proximity to the Rajputana areas in the North-West, which were increasingly in turmoil. It includes one of the largest mosques in India, the Jama Masjid. Full of well preserved palaces and courtyards, it is a must see for anyone visiting Agra. In order to get a full idea of this site it is better to take a guide (₹450 for 2h for its free entry part) or have a good printed guide. Entry to the site of the mosque (even to the yard) is only without wearing footwear. The vehicle parking is about a kilometre away and Agra Development Authority (ADA) runs some rickety non air conditioned buses to the site entrance, fare is ₹10 per person one way. Entry to the fort area where the palaces are located is ₹610 for foreigners.

<h1>Agritourism</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Agritourism♡❤♡ means travel organized around farming, small-scale food production or animal husbandry. Visiting a working farm or ranch for the purpose of enjoyment and education are key parts of this often rural experience. Farmer's markets, &lt;a href="wine%20tourism"&gt;wine tourism&lt;/a&gt;, cider houses and corn mazes all constitute examples of agritourism. Travelers who participate in this type of vacation frequently desire to see how food is grown and prepared or to learn how animals are raised.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Sometimes spelled, "agrotourism," ♡❤♡agritourism♡❤♡ is the idea of bringing urban residents to rural areas for leisure travel and spending.

In an increasingly mechanized world, many people have lost touch with how their food is produced, or the region where it originated. Agritourism offers tourists a chance to reconnect with the land, providing a "hands on experience" with local foods. Agritourism activities include picking fruits, tasting wine, tending bees, milking cows and other educational pursuits.

Agritourism immerses visitors in the heritage of a particular culture. Take the time to stop by a working farm or ranch, you will most likely discover people with an intimate knowledge of the history and traditions of their region. A traveler to &lt;a href="Agros"&gt;Agros&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt; who helps the villagers gather roses in May, will learn something about the area's history producing rose water. Horseback riding on a dude ranch in &lt;a href="Montana"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt; offers a glimpse into the lives of cowboys from the "Old West" of the &lt;a href="United%20States%20of%20America"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt;. A visit to a food museum such as the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.luberon-en-provence.com/infosa.html"&gt;Musee de la Boulangerie Rurale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Luberon"&gt;Luberon&lt;/a&gt; can teach about the history of rural breadmaking in the Provence region of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

For the most iconic agritourism areas, safeguarding the integrity of their products is nothing less than a source of national pride. In the &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;, Protected Designation of Origins (PDOs) look after the integrity of a wide variety of foods, such as &lt;a href="Champagne"&gt;Champagne&lt;/a&gt; wine in France, &lt;a href="Asiago"&gt;Asiago&lt;/a&gt; cheese in &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Melton%20Mowbray"&gt;Melton Mowbray&lt;/a&gt; meat pies in &lt;a href="England"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;. All these regions are eponymous with the foods they produce, while a tourism industry has sprung up around that particular food's production.

Like &lt;a href="ecotourism"&gt;ecotourism&lt;/a&gt;, agritourism focuses on travel that is low-impact and empowering to local communities, both socially and economically. Recognizing the need to diversify their farm products and supplement their agricultural incomes, many farmers consider agritourism as a viable option for the long-term sustainability of their farms. Agritourism can prop up an agricultural economy when local producers can no longer compete economically. The tourism takes place in a farm setting and is secondary to the primary agricultural operation.

<h2>Overnight stays</h2>
This can be as sophisticated as a &lt;a href="bed%20and%20breakfast"&gt;bed and breakfast&lt;/a&gt; stay at a winery or as rustic as &lt;a href="camping"&gt;camping&lt;/a&gt;. One common variation is a farm stay, where guests help feed the animals and harvest the crops.

<h3>Dude ranches</h3>

<h3>Farms</h3>

In &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, it's referred to as "schlaf im Stroh" in &lt;a href="German"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;, "aventure sur la paille" in &lt;a href="French"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt;, or "sleeping in the hay" in English. Spend the night on a farm and help out with domestic chores and demonstrations of native crafts. This could be an overnight stay in a rustic hayloft in &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, a remote cabin or outbuilding in &lt;a href="Austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;, or even a full-blown apartment and rooms for daily or weekly rent on a farm in France.

Agricultural shows are an important part of cultural life in small country towns, and popular event in larger towns and cities. Shows range from small events in small country towns usually lasting two days, through medium-sized events of three days, to large Royal Shows, which may run for up to two weeks and combine elements of an &lt;a href="amusement%20park"&gt;amusement park&lt;/a&gt; with those of an agricultural show. Although increasingly under pressure due to finances and insurance concerns, all main towns in the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; have a Show Society and in some areas, several towns and villages in the area all have an annual show. Larger shows often include live entertainment and fireworks in the main arena.

<h1>Aguascalientes</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Aguascalientes♡❤♡ is in the &lt;a href="Baj%C3%ADo"&gt;Bajío&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Aguascalientes means ♡❤hot water♡❤ in Spanish; the name comes from the abundance of hot springs in the area. Located in central Mexico, Aguascalientes borders the states of Zacatecas and Jalisco and is located about 537 km northwest of &lt;a href="Mexico%20City"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;. There are five traditional neighborhoods in Aguascalientes. Those neighborhoods are La Estacion, La Salud, El Encino, Guadalupe, and San Marcos(where the annual San Marcos Fair is held). Aguascalientes was founded in 1575. The city is very Spanish in nature and is known for its pottery, embroideries and woven goods. Aguascalientes, Mexico is the capital city of Aguascalientes state. Historically, the Spanish chose this city as an outpost to guard against the Chichimec Indians who once resided in the area. It was an outpost against the Indian tribes until 1857 when a state of republic was created under the same name as the state, Aguascalientes. From 1910 to 1920 the city was a major rail junction between Mexico City and the silver mines of Zacatecas.

Natives call Aguascalientes "the perforated city" or La Ciudad Perforada due to its intertwining passages, or catacombs beneath it that the pre-colonial Indians carved from rock. Their origin and reason is unknown and they are not open to the public.

It is ranked among the top three safest cities in Mexico, and one of the best in quality of life for its inhabitants.

<h3>Climate</h3>

&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Climate/style.css" /&gt;
The climate in Aguascalientes is warm and dry year-round. Rainfall season is from May until November, although rain is very seldom here. When it does rain it's fierce and brief in the late afternoon leaving the evenings cooled off and dry.

<h2>Drink</h2>
There are many nightclubs and bars in Aguascalientes. But don't head there early. Locals usually begin to show up at the bars around 11pm. They don't leave or even start dancing until 5am through 7am. So if you want to drink and party like a local do not head home early!

If you want to party visit Aguas during la Feria de San Marcos &lt;a href="http%3A//www.feriadesanmarcos.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The city transforms into the largest open-air cantina in Mexico, with an abundance of places selling cocktails (M$50) or 2L beers (also M$50). You are also able to buy beer in cans, bottles, 16 oz and 1L varieties. Usually drinking on the street in Mexico would be problomatic, However, during the Feria many enterprising people open public bathroom, all costing M$5.

Clubs and a casino also open specially for the Feria.

<h1>Aguas Calientes</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Aguas Calientes♡❤♡ (now officially ♡❤Machu Picchu Pueblo♡❤) is a small town at the bottom of the valley next to &lt;a href="Machu%20Picchu"&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt;, and the principal access point to the site. All visitors to Machu Picchu pass through Aguas Calientes, and unless you're on a daytrip from &lt;a href="Cusco"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt;, some versions of the &lt;a href="Inca%20Trail"&gt;Inca Trail&lt;/a&gt;, or you plan to spend a fortune and stay at the sole lodge at the Machu Picchu site, you will have to spend at least one night here.

The town is perched on the bank of the Urubamba river. Across the river are sheer cliffs, and a creek flows down from the jungle into the river, bisecting the town. Several small bridges cross the creek. Virtually all of the streets are pedestrian-only walking streets, making it very easy to get around.

<h2>Get in</h2>

There are no roads into Aguas Calientes. You must arrive by train or by foot.

<h3>By train</h3>

Two train companies serve Aguas Calientes. Try to book several days in advance if possible, especially in the high season. Tickets can be purchased online, or at travel agency and ticket offices in &lt;a href="Cusco"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt;. Upon leaving the train station you will enter a warren of market stalls. Stay straight to head to the stream running through town where you can get your bearings.

<h4>Peru Rail</h4>
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.perurail.com"&gt;Peru Rail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ has two stations: Ollanta and Poroy. There are several departures daily, varying greatly in price. Pay attention to the station when buying tickets online, as the website presents both stations in the same timetable. Tickets should be bought in advance either online or at the Peru Rail office on the Plaze de Armas in &lt;a href="Cusco"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt;. It is not possible to select your seats online, so if you have a preference, buy them at the station. Printed tickets are required, although they can be printed at the Poroy station at the ticketing office (and likely at Ollanta, although this has not been confirmed). The fares start at US$35 one way in the 'Backpackers' cars, which have decently comfortable seats and small snacks available for purchase. The 'Vistadome' cars are the mid-range cars, with nicer seats and included snacks. There is also a luxury option called 'Hiram Bingham', complete with gourmet meals and an observation carriage.

Poroy is a 20-min taxi ride from the &lt;a href="Cusco"&gt;Cusco&lt;/a&gt; Plaza de Armas and is the most convienent option for passengers departing from Cusco. However, in the rainy season Peru Rail only runs trains from Ollanta and ferries passengers via shuttle buses.

Ollanta is in &lt;a href="Ollantaytambo"&gt;Ollantaytambo&lt;/a&gt;, which is a small town 1hr 45min from Cusco. To get to Ollantaytambo, take a collectivo from Calle Pavitos in Cusco, S/15 (&lt;a href="Peru%23Money"&gt;soles&lt;/a&gt;) per person. They start early in the morning, around 03:00, and run every half hour. Look for a newish van with seatbelts. Ollantaytambo is a small town with ruins of its own, and one popular route is to take the bus, spend a night in Ollantaytambo, then take the train to Aguas Calientes the next morning. The scenic train journey through the &lt;a href="Sacred%20Valley%20of%20the%20Incas"&gt;Sacred Valley&lt;/a&gt; takes about 3hr 45min from Poroy and 1hr 45min from Ollanta.

<h4>Inca Rail</h4>
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//incarail.com/"&gt;Inca Rail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ also serves Aguas Calientes. Prices and service are similar to Peru Rail.
<h3>By car and foot/train</h3>

Several tour agencies offer a "Machu Picchu by car" tour for S/60-100 - an inexpensive way to get to Machu Picchu from Cusco. These start around 07:00 in the morning to go to Hidroelectrica on a 6-7 hour car ride up and down a very curvy mountain road with very spectacular views along the road. From there you walk to Aguas Calientes for 2½-3 hours. It is an easy, flat walk, you just have to follow the train tracks. It's also possible to catch a train at 14:50 for US$32 (Jul 2019). You'll spend the night in Agua Calientes and get up to Machu Picchu very early the next day, usually around 04:00. Minivans back to Cusco leave Hidroelectrica at around 14:30. This means leaving Machu Picchu at around 11:00. It's just enough time to visit the site for 3-4 hours, but not enough to climb Wayna Picchu or Montana.

If you want to have more time at Machu Picchu (recommended if you have the time), you can also organize the trip yourself: book the transport at a tour agency (S/70-80 for the round trip), book two nights in Aguas Calientes (there are plenty hotels and hostels to choose from), and buy your ticket for Machu Picchu in the Ministerio de Cultura in Cusco.

<h3>By foot</h3>

It is also possible to hike downstream along the railway tracks from Ollantaytambo or from the town at km 82, where the Inca trail starts. This is about a seven-hour hike (hiking ♡❤on♡❤ the train tracks is prohibited).

It's also possible to hike upstream along the train tracks from &lt;a href="Santa%20Teresa%20%28Peru%29"&gt;Santa Teresa&lt;/a&gt; (4 hours) or Hidroeléctrica (2 hours). You can take a minibus directly to Hidroeléctrica from Cusco for S/50 or make the journey by public transport. To reach Santa Teresa, take a bus towards &lt;a href="Quillabamba"&gt;Quillabamba&lt;/a&gt; from Cusco and get off at Santa Maria. The bus leaves Cusco at 08:00 (from the Santiago bus depot - S/20) and passes through Ollantaytambo, Urubumba and Santa Maria. It's a 7-hour journey from Cusco to Santa Maria. You can also take a minivan (♡❤colectivo♡❤) which leaves next to the buses (S/25-30 - 4 hours). At Santa Maria, take a connecting bus to Santa Teresa (S/6, 1½ hours) or a taxi (S/10, 1 hour). Walk 2 hours or catch a bus (S/5) to the hydro electric plant (♡❤planta hidroeléctrica♡❤). From there it's 2½-3 hours of walking to Aguas Calientes, and it's a easy walk, you just to follow the train tracks. It's also possible to catch a train for US$28 (May 2015) to Aguas Calientes, possibly much cheaper if you are Peruvian (leaves ♡❤hidroeléctrica♡❤ at 16:00 and for Peruvians it's S/10). As the tracks are still in use, be careful, especially when crossing bridges and in the tunnels.

There are also hiking paths coming from &lt;a href="Mollepata"&gt;Mollepata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cachora"&gt;Cachora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Huanicapa"&gt;Huanicapa&lt;/a&gt; for the extremely adventurous. You will want to get your hands on some topographical maps beforehand. ♡❤Hiking and Trekking around Cusco♡❤ is available for S/25-30 and has details on the routes you can take.

<h2>Get around</h2>
The town is compact and walkable, and there are no vehicles apart from the buses to Machu Picchu and a few work vehicles.

<h2>See</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡&lt;a href="Machu%20Picchu"&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;This is what most people come to see. The bus from the town Aguas Calientes up to &lt;a href="Machu%20Picchu"&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt; costs S/45 per person for a return trip, or US$12 one-way (Mar 2018). You can walk to the ruins for free, but it's steep uphill and takes about an hour and a half. The toilets at the top cost S/2 to use. You have to buy your ticket for entering the ruins at the Cultural Centre in Aguas Calientes (if you're not doing the whole tour from Cusco; tickets are available at the Peru Rail office there). This ticket costs S/152 per person (including entry to Huayna Picchu) and is now valid for only one day. The office will not sell same-day tickets after 14:30 and that the last entry into Machu Picchu is at 16:00, with visitors herded out by 17:00. The office will ask for your passport when buying tickets rather than a photocopy, though agents may be flexible. Aguas Calientes is overpriced and nasty, so if you can stay in Ollantaytambo and get the first train at 06:10, it's way better. You'll arrive about 08:00, still way before the large tour buses (10:00-14:00). Remember to take water and snacks with you as the snacks available at the ruins are insanely expensive. Bring water with you to Aguas Calientes, as the shops there charge about double. Best to bring a packed lunch from Cusco, if possible.
</ul>
 &lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;S/152&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt; 

<h2>Do</h2>

Aguas Calientes is in the cloud forest, and there are a several hikes in the jungle and along the river. The town also offers the usual activities for a tourist location, as well as the thermal baths that give the town its name.

Birdwatchers can find Torrent Ducks and White-Capped Dippers in the river, and Andean Cock-of-the-Rocks--the national bird of Peru--can be found in the jungle outside of town. Several books are available discussing the bird life near and around Machu Picchu and Aguas Calientes that also discuss birds that can be found in the cloud forest.

The baths can be found by walking up the hill in town. These are not bad, but the feel is much like a public pool and they can be crowded, since everyone wants to get into the hottest pools. You can rent towels or swimming trunks before you go in if need be.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;S/20; S/10 Peru Nationals&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

It is in the main plaza.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
Going downstream towards Santa Teresa, you can follow the train tracks or follow the road along the river. This road runs until it reaches a bridge that crosses the river where the road winds up to Machu Picchu. At this point you can turn right and cut up to the train tracks and continue to follow the river along the tracks. Walk on the tracks is prohibited and dangerous. In the downstream direction you can find:

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Putucusi♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;Putukusi&lt;/bdi&gt;) (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;13º 09' 26 S 72º 32' 10 W&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Quechua for “Happy Mountain”. Putucusi is on the same side of the river as Machu Picchu Pueblo. Follow the train tracks a very short distance away from town in the direction of Santa Teresa and Machu Picchu (downhill from town) you will shortly come across a trail on your right heading uphill. (If you come to a train tunnel, you've gone too far.) This trail leads to the summit, about 2370 m above sea level. It is the mountain adjacent to Machu Picchu. The trail is steep with quite a few near-vertical wooden ladders. The elevation gain is about 300 m from Machu Picchu Pueblo. The summit offers amazing views of Machu Picchu if it's a clear day. In March 2013 there was a sign at the start of the trail saying it is closed for rehabilitation, but the entry gate (a few hundred metres along the trail) is not locked and the trail is in good condition. Allow about one hour each way and make sure you'll be out before it gets dark. Wear long pants to avoid insect bites and take some water.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Butterfly House♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;It's near the camping ground; if you get to the bridge you've gone too far.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Ecological Centre♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Further along the tracks near the bridge to Machu Picchu you will reach an ecological centre with rainforest walks that will take about one hour of your time. You can reach this by following the road towards Machu Picchu as to avoid walking through the railway tunnel. There is a stair case leading up to the train tracks near the bridge to Machu Picchu.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Gardens of Mandor♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;If you continue further along the tracks towards Hidroeléctrica at 114.5 km you will reach the gardens and waterfall of Mandor, which is private property and requires foreigners to pay S/10 for entry. This is a nice walk with many orchids and some rainforest and trails to a waterfall.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
Going upstream towards Ollantaytambo;

Following the train tracks upstream from Machu Picchu Pueblo towards Ollantaytambo you will see some other ruins and a waterfall.

<h2>Buy</h2>

Prices on most things are relatively high, so if you're on a very tight budget, bring some snacks and water from Cusco. If you're planning to use a credit card for hotel or purchases, note that most places only accept Visa. However, prices on basics such as snacks and water are not much higher than Cusco and the Sacred Valley.

There is a big ♡❤♡market♡❤♡ along the road to &lt;a href="Machu%20Picchu"&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt;, and a big ♡❤♡handicraft market♡❤♡ in front of the railway station.

Some shops sell hand-painted t-shirts, which are far more expensive than other t-shirts in Peru but are a little more creative.

<h2>Eat</h2>

There are many restaurants catering to travelers. Prices can be expected to be somewhat higher due to the isolation of Aguas Calientes and the difficulty of importing supplies. Some travelers have reported incorrectly calculated bills and hidden charges on bills. One ploy to be aware of is for the bill to be 10-15% more than advertised due to "tax" and "servicio". This is fairly easy to avoid if you are aware of it - when the tout is inviting you into the restaurant, he or she will name a price. Agree to the price and say, "No tax, no servicio, no nada mas." When they bring the bill, you may have to remind them of this agreement, but there is usually no problem if it is agreed up front. The waiter may tell you he earns no wages, and the service charge is his only pay, but this is not true. Only ever pay what is advertised.

The town is full of pizza restaurants, which are a safe option.

There are also Chifa restaurants (Chinese food) and Peruvian restaurants serving set menus. These will usually run S/10-15, and depending on where you go will be something along the lines of ♡❤palta rellena♡❤ (stuffed avocado), soup, main course (generally trout, beef or chicken), tea, coffee, fruit juice, wine or pisco sour.

The smaller restaurants up the hill will often offer more food for half the price of the larger establishments, and the quality is usually the same.

There are two cafes outside the entrance to Machu Picchu that have decent cafe-style food and are surprisingly reasonable.

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Indio Feliz♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Avenida Pachacútec&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;A short walk up Pachacútec from the plaza.&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A nice French-run restaurant for those willing to spend a bit more than at the other places. Meals will cost about S/50 here plus drinks but the food is outstanding. There is also a S/77 prix fixe menu that provides three courses. The restaurant is owned by a Frenchman and his Peruvian wife, who are very friendly.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;S/50, menu S/77&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Drink</h2>
Many bars try to lure in customers with 4-for-1 happy hours lasting the whole evening. Beware that the price is fourfold of the normal prices in Cusco. These "four" cocktails are also each about the size of one normal-priced cocktail. It is often not a terrible deal, but it is not truly four-for-one.

Signs warn that it is not allowed to sell and/or consume alcoholic beverages after 23:00. However, it's not too hard to find a place to drink some beers after this time.

<h2>Sleep</h2>
There are many sleeping options in Aguas Calientes. There is one very expensive hotel right next to the &lt;a href="Machu%20Picchu"&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt; entrance.

In a very private location, only for registered guests, and has received several international awards. Aguas Calientes is a boring tourist town with a budget hostel, but crossing the bridge to the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Hotel makes you feel like you are entering Paradise. Consider getting a room with an outdoor shower, where the water flows Inca-style from a groove carved into a rock. The dining room in the hotel does pasta, done perfectly al dente.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;US$300-700 per night, all-inclusive&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

From there you can have a guide take you via wooden canoe, they are not dugouts. The canoes have motors, but the trip takes a few hours, the last of which is through very narrow swampland.

<h2>Get around</h2>

<h2>See</h2>

Aguateca has some of the best-preserved Mayan ruins in Guatemala. You will see stelae and temple ruins that may not be the largest or most imposing, but great care has been taken during excavation to preserve the area. Its location makes it half the fun--you are more likely to encounter archaeologists at work than tourists with cameras.

It is located in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Western%20Cape"&gt;Western Cape Province&lt;/a&gt;. It is not the most spectacular cape or the most popular with tourists, but as the Southern tip of Africa it still attracts a growing number of people each year.

The official location of the most southernly tip of the continent is 34°49'58" south and 20°00'12" east.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Agulhas National Park is located on the southernmost tip of &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; where the Atlantic and Indian oceans meet. The park form part of the ♡❤♡Cape Floral Kingdom♡❤♡ &lt;a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20List%23South%20Africa"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;.

Guests arriving outside the normal business hours need to phone the park on Tel: 028 435-6078 at least one day prior to arrival.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; 

<h3>History</h3>
The park was proclaimed in March 1999, but it will take a number of years in order to acquire and consolidate all the land that is to form the complete park.

<h3>Landscape</h3>

<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>
<h4>Birds</h4>

Damara Tern breeds at De Mond Nature Reserve and can be seen along the Struisbaai Boardwalk. Denham's Bustard, Blue Crane and Secretarybird are some of the larger, more visible species present, while Southern Tchagra, Large-billed Lark, Agulhas Clapper and Agulhas Long-billed Lark, Cloud Cisticola and Grey-backed Cisticola are common amongst the smaller species.

This park hosts a variety of habitat types and great biodiversity of birds. Large expanses of coastal fynbos allow birders access to species such as Cape Sugarbird, Southern Doubled-Collared Sunbird and Orange-breasted Sunbird, and the patches of renosterveld hosts vulnerable species such as Hottentot Buttonquail and Black Harrier.

The historical Springfield Saltpans is a yearly haven for hundreds of Lesser and Greater Flamingo, the rare Chestnut-banded Plover, thousands of Little Stint, Sanderling, Curlew Sandpiper, and some scarce species such as Eurasian Curlew and Red Knot. Along the Zoetendalsvlei and Nuwerjaarsrivier, waterbirds such as African Rail, African Purple Swamphen, Black Crake and an array of other waders occur frequently. Other raptors found in the area includes Lanner Falcon, Yellow-billed Kite, African Harrier-Hawk, African Marsh-Harrier, Martial Eagle, Booted Eagle, African Fish-Eagle, Steppe Buzzard, Jackal Buzzard and Forest Buzzard.

<h4>Mammals</h4>

Not many terrestrial mammals occur, but the Cape Grysbok is something to look out for in the coastal fynbos. In the ocean you can look out for Cape Fur Seals and a variety of whales, dolphins and porpoises. The Southern Right Whales come to the bays to breed from August to November.

<h4>Vegetation</h4>

The floral diversity includes some 2,000 species of indigenous plants including 100 that are endemic to the area and over 110 Red Data species. The Agulhas Plain is an important component of the Cape Floral Kingdom, the smallest and richest of the six plant kingdoms of the world.

Many different vegetation types occur in this area. One of them is the endemic Elim (laterite) fynbos, restricted to a few patches in the region, the smallest land surface of any vegetation type in SA.

<h1>Ahmedabad</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Ambox/styles.css" /&gt;
♡❤♡Ahmedabad♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡Amdavad♡❤♡ (also spelled ♡❤Ahmadabad♡❤) (&lt;a href="Gujarati%20phrasebook"&gt;Gujarati&lt;/a&gt;: અમદાવાદ, &lt;a href="Hindi%20phrasebook"&gt;Hindi&lt;/a&gt;: अहमदाबाद) is the fifth largest city in &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; with a population of 6.5 million. Although it is the commercial hub of one of the most prosperous states of India, &lt;a href="Gujarat"&gt;Gujarat&lt;/a&gt;, it's not the state capital, which is its twin city of &lt;a href="Gandhinagar"&gt;Gandhinagar&lt;/a&gt;, to the north.

Ahmedabad is a good example of materialistic attitude and spirituality of self-renunciation. One of the fastest growing city in India, Ahmedabad is a centre for information technology, education and industries. Bhadra Fort, Shaking Minarets and Tran Darwaja are the historical sites of the city. Kankaria Lake and Vastrapur Lake are places which let you feel the pleasure of nature. If you want to enjoy the colourful side of this part, then pay a visit during the major festivals of Ahmedabad: Uttarayan and Navratri are two most famous festivals that are celebrated with great zeal and gusto. The winter season is considered the best time to visit the city.

<h2>Districts</h2>
The classification below is according to Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). The West Zone and New West Zone are on the west side of the Sabarmati River. All other zones are on the east side.

<h2>Understand</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
The city was founded by King Karandev 1 in the 11th century and originally called "Karnavati". The Hindu kingdom of Karnavati retained its importance until 1411 when Sultan Ahmed Shah conquered Gujarat and the city was renamed Ahmedabad after him.

The city was built in an open and spacious plain to the east of the Sabarmati River. It included a smaller known fort as Bhadra Fort. The city wall had twelve gates. The city gradually expanded in every direction, with well laid out beautiful buildings, lakes and mosques on both sides of the river.

In 1753 the combined armies of Raghunath Rao and Damaji Gaekwad took the fort, ending Mughal rule in Ahmedabad. During the 64 years of rule by Gaekwad and Peshwa, the city became cleaner. In 1818 the British annexed Ahmedabad. During this period the municipality committee was founded and a railway link was established.
The British restricted themselves to the cantonment area and didn’t take much interest in the city. Nor did they get around to colonising Ahmedabad culturally; they didn't set up schools, churches and clubs all over the city as they did in other cities they integrated to their way of life.

Ahmedabad was a cradle of the non-violent movement for India's independence, being host to the Sabarmati ♡❤ashram♡❤ of Mahatma Gandhi. Ahmedabad poses a mixture of rich tradition and modern feel.

<h3>Today</h3>
The Gujarati community is known for its hospitality and for being shrewd businessmen. Ahmedabad is a big industrial city long reputed for its textile industry, and today more so for its chemical, petroleum, international trade &amp; IT industries. It is also known for its financial services industry, and as the modern hub of Jain Religion. The city has institutions such as the Indian Institute of Management - Ahmedabad, National Institute of Design, Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU), Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information &amp; Communication Technology, IHM, MICA, EDI, Nirma University, Swaminarayan Gurukul, CEPT (Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology) University and NIFT.

<h3>Climate</h3>
Summer starts by mid-March and lasts up to mid-June. The typical temperature on a hot, sunny day in May would be 34-44°C (93-111°F) It's advisable not to visit during thr summer. With the arrival of the monsoon by mid-June, the city becomes a fun place. You'll be able to enjoy the various monsoon specialities of the city like boiled or roasted corn dishes on road-side stalls or some special local dishes like. There are also some famous Hindu festivals like Rakshabandhan (or Rakhi) and Janmastam, the birth date of Lord Krishna, which fall during this season. You may sometimes end up in floods. Winter is the best season to visit the city when the typical temperature is 5-20°C (41-68°F).

<h3>By car</h3>

<h4>From South Gujarat/Maharashtra</h4>

Driving to Ahmedabad from Mumbai on the new highway (♡❤♡NH-8♡❤♡) takes around 8 hours (without any traffic jams) to do the 550 km. You'll pass Vapi, Valsad, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Surat"&gt;Surat&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, Bharuch, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Vadodara"&gt;Vadodara&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, Anand, and Nadiad on your way. Driving on the NH-8 is an energy sapper and no fun as there is a huge amount of truck traffic. Broken down trucks on the highway regularly cause traffic jams for hours on end. The journey from Vadodara to Ahmedabad can also be done via the dedicated express way (♡❤♡NE-1♡❤♡) which does not pass through any towns, rather than NH-8.

The expressway from Vadodara (♡❤♡♡❤South♡❤♡♡❤ Gujarat) to Ahmedabad ends at C.T.M. (&lt;a href="Ahmedabad/South%20Zone"&gt;South Zone&lt;/a&gt;).

<h5>Via East</h5>
Turning right at C.T.M. is the Narol - Naroda Road leading you to Naroda in North East Ahmedabad, while passing through the areas of Vastral, Odhav, Nikol, etc. on the right side of the road and the areas of Maninagar, Shastri Nagar, Hansol (Airport Area) on the left side of the road. For the northern areas of Sabarmati, Motera, Chandkheda, etc. turn right at Naroda Patiya Circle, where the Narol - Naroda Road ends, head straight on NH-8 and turn left at Ranasan Circle onto Ring Road. Turn left at Tapovan Circle, after a few km, Motera will be on the left side of the highway, Chandkheda on the right. The highway ends at Visat, from where turning left will lead you to Sabarmati.

<h5>Via West</h5>
Turning left at C.T.M. is the Narol - Sarkhej Road which passes through Nehrunagar, Narol, Vatwa, Ghodasar, etc. ending at a T-junction on Vasna Road (or Jawaharlal Nehru Road). From here turn left, pass through the areas of Juhapura, Makarba, etc. till a Y-junction arrives. The right arm will lead you to Sarkhej Cross Roads, from where you turn right onto the S G Highway. The left arm at the Y-junction will lead you via Sarkhej, at Santhal Circle, turn right onto the Ring Road.

Ring Road is preferable if your destination is far (near Northern Ahmedabad) otherwise use S G Highway. Also for Bopal, use only Ring Road.

The major entry points from S G Highway are the areas of Prahladnagar, Shilaj, Vastrapur, Satellite, Bodakdev, Thaltej, Sola, Ognaj, Gota, etc.

<h4>From Gandhinagar/North Gujarat/Rajasthan</h4>
<h5>Via North and East</h5>
You can enter Ahmedabad by passing through Gandhinagar. The inter - city highway starts at Indroda Circle (CH 0) (♡❤♡♡❤South♡❤♡♡❤ Gandhinagar), passing through Koba Circle and Tapovan Circle and ends at Visat (Northern &lt;a href="Ahmedabad/West%20Zone"&gt;West Zone&lt;/a&gt;), the junction to the suburbs of Sabarmati, Motera and Chandkheda. Rather than going to Visat, you can also choose to join Ring Road: From Koba Circle head on the road to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (SVP) International Airport, but turn left at Rajasthan Hospital Circle and you're on Ring Road. From here you can connect to the areas of ♡❤♡♡❤East♡❤♡♡❤ Ahmedabad such as Nikol, Odhav, Vastral, etc. Also the Southern areas of Ahmedabad, such as Ramol, CTM, Ahmedabad - Vadodara Expressway, Narol, Vatwa, etc. are accessible through Ring Road.

<h5>Via West</h5>
Another option is to bypass Gandhinagar using Mahatma Mandir Road, then turning right at Sargasan Circle onto S G Highway. You may stay on the S G Highway or turn right at SGVP Circle (also known as Vaishnodevi Circle) onto Ring Road. There are several entry points along the border of extreme Western Ahmedabad, such as Gota, Ognaj, Sola, Thaltej, Bodakdev, Satellite, Vastrapur, Shilaj, Bopal, Prahladnagar, Sarkhej (where S G Highway ends) and Juhapura. For getting to Bopal, use Ring Road rather than S G Highway. Also if you've to go to Southern Ahmedabad, choose Ring Road as it'll be a much faster option than S G Highway.

<h2>Get around</h2>

The services of AMTS and BRTS stop at ♡❤♡23:00♡❤♡, and resume at ♡❤♡06:00♡❤♡.
<h3>By AMTS city bus</h3>
The local city buses are run by &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q4696119"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;AMTS&lt;/bdi&gt;).&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; since 1947, forming a wide network covering almost all the points of Ahmedabad. Any destination in the city can be reached from anywhere in the city by AMTS.
To identify them and distinguish them from the state transport GSRTC buses or the private luxury buses here is the key: The older buses in this service are painted in ♡❤red and white♡❤ or in ♡❤red and yellow♡❤, whereas new bright red ones put up under ♡❤♡JnNURM♡❤♡ are having electronic display boards. You may easily ask around the people esp. those waiting at one of the AMTS stops about the route, time, etc. as the information displayed is in Gujarati. Also, Public Transit option on Google Maps will show you the nearest AMTS stop while searching directions from your location to the destination and it also gives information about the bus numbers, transfer points, etc. though timings might not be reliable. Also you may install an unofficial app named 'Ahmedabad AMTS Info', available on Google Play Store for Android devices, which guides you regarding travel routes, transfers, etc.

&lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡AMTS Central Bus Terminus♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;Lal Darwaja&lt;/bdi&gt;) (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;at Lal Darwaja in Central Zone&lt;/bdi&gt;).&lt;/bdi&gt; 

There are other terminals at Kalupur, Sarangpur, Old Vadaj (Juna Vadaj), Maninagar, Akhbarnagar (Nava Vadaj), Vasna and Naroda and the depots at Jamalpur, Memco (Naroda Patiya) and Memnagar. In total, AMTS has around 1200 stops with 210 routes.

It is mandatory to board the bus from the rear end door and alight from the front end one. The conductor on the bus will issue you a ticket according to your destination stop. Keep handy some notes of ₹ 10/20/50 denominations rather than the higher ones as the fares are very low (♡❤these buses are the cheapest means to travel in the city♡❤). A ♡❤pay - per - ride♡❤ fare will cost you a minimum fare of ₹ 3, while the maximum fare is only ♡❤♡₹ 25♡❤♡). You may also opt to buy a ♡❤Man Pasand♡❤ ticket worth ₹ 45 (available from the bus conductor) which entitles you to unlimited rides for a single day, though it is not preferable to purchase the ₹ 45 ticket as you can complete the journey of going around 4-5 places in just ₹ 30-35. As buses are the most common transport facility for many in the city they are often overcrowded.

During the journey you may request your co-passengers or the conductor to inform you when the destination arrives/is about to arrive so that you don't miss getting off at your stop and then have to take a reverse trip. Also keep moving towards the front end door as the bus will be crowded with people standing in the corridor between seats and it might be difficult to quickly rush to the door and get off, when your destination arrives (the bus won't halt at a stop more than 10-12 sec, unless it's the AMTS Central Terminus at Lal Darwaja or the last stop of the journey).

Routes can be found at &lt;a href="https%3A//sites.google.com/site/indiabus/amtsbus"&gt;♡❤♡AMTS bus routes♡❤♡ (♡❤English♡❤)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.amts.co.in/SitePage.aspx%3Fid%3D44"&gt;♡❤♡Route Network - AMTS♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.amts.co.in/files/amts_route_details.pdf"&gt;AMTS bus routes (♡❤Gujarati♡❤)&lt;/a&gt;

<h3>By BRTS city bus</h3>

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ahmedabadbrts.com"&gt;Ahmedabad BRTS&lt;/a&gt; (bus rapid transit system) has silver and blue-coloured buses running on dedicated corridors in the centre of the roads. BRTS does not cover the entire city, but wherever available it is the best way to commute as it is ♡❤♡remarkably faster♡❤♡ than other modes (as no other vehicle can ply on BRTS corridor) and all the stations are marked well, in both English and Hindi. One can also travel using a combination of BRTS, AMTS and/or auto rickshaw. The ticket systems of BRTS and AMTS are not integrated. The fares are only slightly higher than AMTS (min. fare ₹ 4, max. fare ₹ 36)
The BRTS stations are elevated shelters in the dedicated central corridor of the city roads, from where you can purchase your ticket. Keep the ticket with you until you get off at your destination, where you show the ticket to the checker and then leave the station on to the road. Buses are equipped with central automatic doors that open up automatically when the bus halts at a station. While the bus is about to arrive at a station, there are announcements with name of the station along with display on the electronic board inside the bus. Inside the stations, there are boards displaying real-time information about arrivals or upcoming buses, along with the routes and estimated time remaining for the arrivals. The name of the station will be printed in white letters on blue strips on the sides (horizontal) and on the roof of the station (vertical).

All BRTS buses and stations are wheelchair accessible ♡❤♡except♡❤♡ those of RTO Circle and Kalupur Railway Station, which are roadside shelters unlike the standard BRTS stations.

For information on all the BRTS stations, visit the above-linked website, which shows them according to the line, or install an unofficial &lt;a href="https%3A//play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Din.hammerapps.brts%26amp%3Bhl%3Den"&gt;Android app&lt;/a&gt;, which provides information such as travel options, routes, fare, time, station names, etc. (NThe Public Transit option on Google Maps ♡❤doesn't♡❤ show BRTS services, only the AMTS ones)

There are 12 BRTS lines and 126 stations, with more under construction. The current lines are:

<h3>By metro</h3>
The Gujurat Metro is probably the most convenient way to get around the few areas it serves. There is only an east-west line, which runs through the city and stops at some places of interest, including the dometic cricket stadium and Ahmedabad Junction railway station.

<h3>By auto rickshaw</h3>

These yellow and green three-wheeled noise machines, known as auto-rickshaws or simply rickshaws, are always cheaper than taxis, and much costlier than AMTS or BRTS when distance is longer than 3&amp;nbsp;km. They are not very comfortable and spacious. The drivers might ride very roughly, in which case you might request him to drive smoothly and slowly.

Shouting 'auto' or 'rickshaw' at a passing rickshaw should be enough to catch the drivers attention. In most cases, the drivers will be able to understand Hindi and maybe even a few words of English. They are normally quite helpful, but some will try to cheat tourists. As always, agree on a fare before getting in. Day and night fares are different. If you look an out-of-the-town person, you may end up getting overcharged. For example, he might insist on a fare based on meter and take you to your destination through a longer route. Having some understanding about the distances can be helpful.

<h3>By taxi</h3>
Since auto rickshaws are the dominant travel mode apart from BRTS and AMTS, there are few taxis in Ahmedabad. So you will hardly find a taxi on the roads to hail whenever needed, though you may either book a taxi from a hotel or directly book one outside the railway station. There is a government authorized taxi stand. ₹ 950 per day for 12 hours. It may be more costly to book through hotels, and it is better to negotiate with the driver directly. Online bookings are also possible at various websites.

<h2>Talk</h2>
The local language is &lt;a href="Gujarati%20phrasebook"&gt;Gujarati&lt;/a&gt;. Hindi is understood by almost everyone and English is prevalent amongst educated people. English is at least partially understood by most people in the tourist industry.

&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Ambox/styles.css" /&gt;
Ahmedabad has several floridly carved historic monuments including the Stepwell at Adalaj and the Rani Mosques (dedicated to Rani Sipri and Rani Rupmati). There are some museums and art galleries. Modern office buildings and malls dot the more recently developed areas.

<h2>Buy</h2>

Ahmedabad is known for its textile industries including traditional hand embroidered and tie-dyed clothes. If you buy from the roadside shops, be prepared to &lt;a href="haggle"&gt;haggle&lt;/a&gt;. It would not be advisable to try these without a local guide. The city's main market area is situated at Teen Darwaja, Dhalgarwad, Ratan Pole, Manek Chowk(old areas)near Lal Darwaja and newer markets such as CG Road and Sarkhej - Gandhinagar highway near Vastrapur &amp; Gurukul. It is generally a crowded area, and very crowded during festival seasons, although with a wide variety of clothes. The street side shops near Law Garden also offers good choices. Some shops such as Bandhej and Sanskruti offer these traditional items at fixed (and maybe overpriced) rates. But now the big shopping malls are offering almost all the things at a very cheap rate. Local sweet shops, where traditional Gujarati sweets will catch your attention: some the more famous are Bhogilal Mulchand Kandoi, Jai Hind and Ras Ranjan.

<h2>Eat</h2>
&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Ambox/styles.css" /&gt;

Ahmedabad is a gastronomic paradise, and there are many restaurants. Gujaratis are fond of eating and the food generally tends to be on the sweeter side. Gujaratis are mostly vegetarians hence most local dishes are vegetarian. However, with the recent advent of international and domestic food chains non-vegetarian food has become popular. Ahmedabad is famous for its ice-creams because of abundance of dairy products in the state and Gujaratis' penchant for sweets. Local specialities include Dhokla, Khandvi, Srikhand, Haandvo, Bhajiya amongst others.

There are lots of Gujarati dining halls where you can get unlimited "thali" meals for around ₹250. A thali consists of variety of concoctions including salads, appetizers, snacks, breads, pulses, vegetable curries and sweets.

If you have not stayed in India for long, select a food place which is famous and well organised (hotels, big restaurants). Otherwise, its fun to eat at one of the road side stalls, especially at the Khau Galli in Law Garden area and Khan Pan Bazaar in Manekchawk. Various stalls open in the evening until late at night. You may enjoy Paani - Puri (Gol Gappa), Indian Chat, Indian Sandwiches, North Indian, Indian-Chinese and some continental cuisines, amazingly at road-side stalls and for less than a ₹60 item. Recently, SG Road in the western part of city has transformed into an restaurant strip. It has over 100 restaurants in a five-mile stretch offering most varieties in all price ranges.

<h2>Drink</h2>
Gujarat is one of the few Indian states where alcohol is prohibited. But this applies only to Indians. If you have a non-Indian passport / green card holder/ PR status, you can get an alcohol permit valid for one month by going to a alcohol shop large hotel and purchasing one. Hotels that have alcohol shops include: Cama Hotel in Khanpur, Hotel Inder Residency, Opp. to Gujarat College, Comfort Inn President Hotel at CG Road among others open from 12 noon to 20:00 Monday to Saturday ph no. +91 79 26467575. Many local people will be able to direct you because they can purchase alcohol on a 'health' licence. If you are non-resident of Gujarat, then one can get alcohol permits issued at alcohol shops on showing proof of travel to Ahmedabad like (1) Air/Train/Bus ticket,(2) any Identity proof by Govt. with Photo, Address &amp; birthdate preferably driving licence and (3a) your Ahmedabad address proof such as Residence Address of Local friend/relatives electric/telephone bill/ driving licence or (3b) Proof of stay at hotel.

However, if you are staying longer you will need a non-resident permit. For that, you will need: a photocopy of passport including your entry stamps, a photocopy of visa, a photocopy of a local resident’s ID card (drivers licence will probably be easiest). As of January 2009, ₹1000 (although the person may ask for ₹50 extra as a bribe but should not be given). If you can get a local person to go with you, the entire experience will be a lot easier.

Directions
1 Get your copies notarized as ‘true’ copies. If you don’t have easy access to someone who can do this, the Prohibition and Excise Department will direct you to a nearby office. This will cost about ₹10 per copy.
2. Go to Prohibition and Excise Department which is just off the Ellis bridge on the Victoria garden side of old city .
3. Pick up the bank payment form, and get copies notarized if you haven’t already done this.
4. Fill in the name and local address for the permit holder
5. Get a rickshaw and go to the State Bank of India which is very near by. If a rickshaw is not available, the bank is in walking distance.
6. Pay ₹1050 (or the asked fee) at the State Bank of India
7. Get an ink stamp on form from bank
8. Take your copies, your payment slip and your forms back to the Prohibition and Excise Department.
9. The Department office will provide you with form F.L. /A-1. Fill out form and ask for more than the maximum allowed (ask for about 6 units) to ensure you get the maximum.
10. Pay ₹2 at the Department office. Receive two stamps which are to be stuck onto get form F.L. / A-1 form to show you have paid.

You will either be able to pick up the license immediately, or in a few days. Once you have your licence, you take it to a large hotel where they have a alcohol shop, and make your purchases.

Bootlegging is rampant, but it carries a risk as well. Decent brands of Indian whisky start around ₹200 as do rum, vodka and gin. Premium brands range from ₹600 to ₹1,800 for 12-year-old Scotch.

Beer is difficult to buy as is wine/vodka/gin/brandy/scotch/champagne/rum.

Booze is strictly a private affair and don't expect to order a drink at a restaurant, and there are no pubs or bars, and you will have to drink in your hotel room or at someone's home. If someone invites you to a party, there is a good chance you will be offered a drink there. Under a new amendment to the law prohibiting alcohol, you cannot be arrested or detained for consuming alcohol illegally unless you misbehave under influence or indulge in bootlegging. However, it is best to consume alcohol at your hotel room or at a very close friends place. Majority of the guests staying at a hotel consume it in their rooms and there is always an implied consent from the hotel who will serve you ice, soft drinks and glasses.

Many small shops sell lassi, a yogurt drink. Lassi choices include: sweet, salty, with almonds. Farki, Girish Cold Drinks and Krishna Dairy are some of the famous ones. Apart from this, Janta Ice Cream and Cold Drinks offers a delicious drink cold Chocolate Coco, a chocolate flavoured thick shake. Janta has its shops across Ahmedabad. There is also a very wide variety of fruit juices available. Most large places like Havmor are reputable and use good water, but you should exercise care when drinking at smaller places.

<h3>Budget</h3>

International code for India is +91

<h3>Buy pre-paid SIM</h3>
To buy a SIM card foreign nationals need to provide a photocopy of their passport, Indian visa page, a passport-sized photo and a proof of residence in India. As with much in India, the associated bureaucracy can be slow and frustrated. Activation of a SIM card can take a number of days.

The lake attracts a large variety of birds like plovers, sandpipers, stints, cormorants, grebes and openbill storks among others. The best season to visit the sanctuary is November to February.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Thol Bird Sanctuary♡❤♡ This sanctuary is about 30&amp;nbsp;km west of the city centre. Just as Nal Sarovar, this lake attracts a large variety of bird species. It has become more preferable for the amdavadis to take an early morning trip.

It will be best to rent a taxi for a morning as there is no public transport available here. November to March is the best time to visit.

One of the most well-designed and impregnable forts of India, the Ahmednagar Fort is under the control of the Indian military. The fort's defensive system comprises 24 citadels and a moat that is 30 m wide and 4-6 metres deep. There are two entrances to the fort, which can be reached only after one goes over the moat, through the suspension drawn bridges. After countless invasions, the Ahmednagar Fort has taken many blows and come out relatively unscathed. Control over the fort has changed hands many times, starting from the time of Mughal rule. It has been used as a royal prison a number of times. Famously, the entire Congress Working Committee was detained at the Ahmednagar Fort during the Quit India Movement of 1942. Some rooms in the fort have been converted into a museum. You can see the Leaders room, where Nehru and the other national leaders were imprisoned and where India's first prime minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, wrote his book, ♡❤The Discovery of India♡❤, while being detained.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

♡❤♡&lt;a href="https%3A//www.sanparks.org/conservation/transfrontier/Ai-Ais-Richtersveld.php"&gt;Ai-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ straddles the border between the &lt;a href="%C7%81Karas"&gt;ǁKaras&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Northern%20Cape"&gt;Northern Cape&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>

The immense ♡❤♡Ai-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park♡❤♡ was formed when the ♡❤♡Richtersveld National Park♡❤♡ in &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; was joined with the ♡❤♡|Ai-|Ais Hot Springs Game Park♡❤♡ in &lt;a href="Namibia"&gt;Namibia&lt;/a&gt;. It contains the &lt;a href="Fish%20River%20Canyon%20Park"&gt;Fish River Canyon Park&lt;/a&gt;. The South African part is inscribed on the &lt;a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20List"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage List&lt;/a&gt;.

The park is one of the few places where the Nama, a pastoral semi-nomadic tribe still survive. They speak the Nama language and move with their seasons and are known for living in beehive-shaped huts known as haru oms, made of reeds.

<h2>Do</h2>

<h2>Eat</h2>

Aichi is famous for its "miso(味噌) culture". Miso is one of Japan's traditional seasonings. (Usually Japanese eat miso as "miso soup". Of course people in Aichi eat miso soup, too.) People spread sweetened miso paste on fried pork, fried shrimp (it's not tempura), tofu and so on.

Other Aichi specialities worth a try are:
♡❤Tebasaki♡❤ - grilled chicken wings with a sweet, mildly spicy glaze and white sesame seeds. Eaten with the fingers, they are a popular and delicious izakaya delicacy.

♡❤Tenmusu♡❤ - a local variety of onigiri, filled with prawn tenpura and a fruity brown sauce.

♡❤Kishimen♡❤ - flat, ribbonlike wheat noodles, usually served cold with a dipping sauce, but sometimes hot in broth.

♡❤Aka-miso soup♡❤ - Red miso soup rather than the standard white miso you get everywhere else in Japan.

♡❤Miso katsu♡❤ - Fried pork cutlet (tonkatsu), but is topped with a miso based sauce.

<h1>Aihole</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

<h2>Understand</h2>

♡❤♡Aihole♡❤♡ is a village in &lt;a href="Karnataka"&gt;Karnataka&lt;/a&gt;. It is on the banks of Mallaprabha River. It is close to 122 km from &lt;a href="Hubli"&gt;Hubli&lt;/a&gt;, the Silicon Plateau of &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. Aihole was the first capital of the Chalukya Kings. It had a school of temple architecture where artisans used to learn the craft of temple building and sculpture. Consequently, Aihole has hundreds of temples in villages and fields nearby.

<h2>Get in</h2>
The nearest town to Aihole is Badami where one can find accommodation. Aihole can be reached by a 40 minute drive by road from Badami.
<h2>Get around</h2>
Aihole is a small place and once you reach here, all destinations can be explored by foot.

<h2>See</h2>
Bear in mind that this was a school of temple architecture, so you will see temples built in different styles. An artisan was taught to move progressively from simple to more complex forms of sculpture (as seen on pillars in the Durga Temple). Yellow sandstone is a relatively soft material and easy to carve on. Hence this was used as the material here.

Unlike most Indian temples, the names of the temples in Aihole do not reflect the deities placed inside. When the British stumbled upon these temples, they were inhabited by local villagers who were using these as shelter. So some of the names reflect the residents at the time, others describe their location, and so on.

<h1>Ailsa Craig</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Ailsa Craig♡❤♡ (Scottish Gaelic: ♡❤Creag Ealasaid♡❤) is an island in the Firth of Clyde off the coast of &lt;a href="Ayrshire"&gt;Ayrshire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. It is colloquially known as "Paddy's Milestone" as it is roughly marks the halfway point of the sea journey from &lt;a href="Belfast"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Glasgow"&gt;Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;. Ailsa Craig is a spectacular landmark, rising steeply out of the sea up to at its peak. It can be seen from all along the Ayrshire coast, as well as Kintyre and from &lt;a href="Northern%20Ireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, although it is only 3/4 of a mile long by 1/2 a mile wide.

<h2>Understand</h2>

From the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries, the island was quarried for its rare type of granite, known as "Ailsite" which was used to make curling stones. The floor of the Chapel of the Thistle in St Giles Cathedral, &lt;a href="Edinburgh"&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; is also made of this rock.

Ailsa Craig is now uninhabited, the lighthouse having been automated in 1990. The quarry is still operated from time to time, but there are no resident workers. The island is now a bird sanctuary managed by the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.rspb.org.uk/"&gt;Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. Huge numbers of gannets nest here and following a pioneering technique to eradicate the island's imported population of rats a growing number of puffins are choosing to return to the Craig from nearby Glunimore and Sheep Islands.
<h2>Get in</h2>

The only way to reach Ailsa Craig is by boat.

Although there is a ♡❤♡narrow gauge railway line♡❤♡ once used by the miners, there are no actual trains on the island, so the only way to get around is by walking.

<h2>See</h2>

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Wildlife spotting♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Especially the tens of thousands of seabirds that nest here in spring and early summer.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
<h2>Eat</h2>

Bring everything you want to eat with you, as there are no catering facilities on the island.

<h2>Drink</h2>

<h2>Sleep</h2>

Plans have been mooted to convert the former miners' cottages into luxury holiday accommodation, but this has been opposed by conservation groups, so there is no accommodation on the island.
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡&lt;a href="Girvan"&gt;Girvan&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Closest town with hotels and holiday cottage rental in surrounding area.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Stay safe</h2>

Boats that operate trips to the island are generally open, or only partly covered, so it's important to take warm, windproof, waterproof clothing, at any time of year. The island is surrounded by steep cliffs, so care should be exercised at all times.

<h1>Air courier</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
Travelling as an ♡❤♡air courier♡❤♡ was a way to get cheap air-fare by giving up most or all of your luggage allowance. You generally had to organize ahead of time, but sometimes, last-minute deals were available. As a means of delivering urgent parcels and freight, splitting the checked baggage allowance from a passenger ticket in this manner is in decline. A handful of air courier assignments still exist, but there are few bargains to be had.

Increasingly, parcel carriers are deploying their own cargo-only air fleets. As airlines improve their own cargo operations to shorten delivery time, the need for urgent packages to travel as checked passenger baggage is disappearing. Heightened security post-September 11, 2001 is also a factor in the decline of air courier travel.

<h2>How it worked</h2>
Courier companies are well paid for delivering things quickly. Frequently, time is very important with business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair. On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller firms there was a problem. If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs. The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked luggage. Airline regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.

Courier companies routinely booked one seat each way, every day on flights between two major business hubs, for example from New York to Hong Kong. These are always economy class, generally on major airlines, and usually a flight that departs in the evening. Of course, the airlines give them a very good price.

You can occupy that seat at a discount -- provided you accompany their stuff. A courier representative will meet you at the airport with your ticket, the shipment (which is checked in for you) and the shipping documents (which you carry). Another rep will meet you at the other end to take delivery. You just deliver the documents, and they do the rest. ♡❤♡In no case, do you have to help with carrying their luggage load.♡❤♡ 

Sometimes, someone will also meet you in the middle; e.g. on a Sydney-London courier flight, you stop in Tokyo, where you drop off the Sydney-Tokyo stuff and pick up Tokyo-London.

Discounts were often substantial, 20% and up, although this gap has narrowed with the increasing prevalence of discounted tickets from other sources. Once the company knew you as a regular and reliable courier, deals sometimes got even better. If someone cancelled and they were stuck, they occasionally offered a last-minute free flight. In other words, someone else paid dearly for your free trip!

A few years back, courier travel was possible within North America or Europe. That has been eliminated by air express companies such as FedEx and DHL which have their own planes or long-term contracts with the airlines. 

Nowadays, the few remaining courier flights are almost all intercontinental, and are diminishing in number for various reasons — tighter airside security, more business documents transmitted on-line instead of hand-carried, better efforts by airlines to co-operate efficiently with cargo firms. In rare instances, FedEx may still have a passenger hand-carry a courier package on a commercial flight as a premium service with &lt;a href="http%3A//customcritical.fedex.com/us/services/air-expedite/courier.shtml"&gt;end-to-end tracking&lt;/a&gt;, but this is becoming an uncommon, last-resort option as cargo-only flights are increasingly operated by parcel companies using their own aircraft.

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

Courier travel was not for everyone, as there are serious restrictions:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Destinations were limited to major business routes. If you didn't live near a major international airport, that was your problem. A few courier companies might have sold connecting tickets, but you'd have paid the difference and expected ♡❤long♡❤ layovers to avoid any chance of missing the main flight.
BULLET::::- Your luggage is severely limited. Some companies allowed one checked bag. With most, you flew with carry-on luggage only. Occasionally, one may have had a full luggage allowance on the return trip only. That meant buying new luggage or a large, sturdy box at the destination. Of course, this baggage was subject to customs duty when you arrive back home, so it wasn't a good idea to overdo it.
BULLET::::- You needed to book well in advance for popular routes or seasons.
BULLET::::- You paid the fare, or at least a deposit, at time of booking.
BULLET::::- Most courier tickets were for a round trip, usually with a stay between 7 and 30 days.
BULLET::::- If you cancelled close to your flight time, there would be no refund.
BULLET::::- Visas, if required, were your responsibility. However, countries which required a visa ♡❤solely♡❤ because you're a courier were few in number (if any).
BULLET::::- You needed to report to immigration and customs at your destination that you flew as a courier. There was nothing at all unusual about this, as they encountered it every day.
BULLET::::- The courier companies booked a daily flight with one airline, months in advance. You could not change anything &amp;mdash; airline, route or even flight.
BULLET::::- You may or may not be able to get reward miles for the trip.
BULLET::::- If you wanted to travel with a friend (both having courier fares), each needed to travel on a different day or for a different company.

</ul>
If you cannot live with these restrictions, see the &lt;a href="Air%20travel%20on%20a%20budget"&gt;Air travel on a budget&lt;/a&gt; article for other options, such as charter flights or airline consolidators. Fares will likely be a little higher, but there is more flexibility.

Booking through an agency was generally worth the small fee of joining the agency, as they are given most access to the flights. They may be able to offer flights that you could not find as a freelance courier.

<h2>Demise</h2>
Not very long ago, taking a position as a commercial airline courier was an attractive way to travel on a small allowance. You essentially were contacted to transport a parcel from one city to another and your carry-on baggage allocation was “rented.” You were then rewarded with a low fare for the trip. This type of agreement isn’t as prevalent anymore, due to the fact that companies don’t rely on couriers as much as they used to, because air shipping is faster than it ever was before.

These days, few companies can offer someone the chance to serve as a courier. Although in the 1970s one would pay a token passage as a courier, more recent courier passengers barely saved 15 to 50 % off the full ticket price. One can regularly find these types of ticket prices being sold to the general public by other means.

As individual routes disappear (either through airlines improving their cargo operations or courier companies flying their own cargo-only flights), many of the agencies which provided lists of available flights have gone off-line and many popular beaten-path destinations are no longer available. The few seats which remain available may be going to some rather out-of-the-way points as there are plenty of other means to get an urgent package from (for example) London to New York.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
If you prepay any money for participation as a commercial airline envoy, you are being given the run around. 

You need to be very careful about the legitimacy of the jobs you take. The last thing you want is to be caught transporting contraband (or worse) on a plane. A good way to avoid this is to use an agent (usually a representative of the service you are working for), who will take you through customs and clear the contents. Always check the reputation of the courier company before booking. None which are reliable and legitimate would ever try to ship anything hazardous or illegal.

If you do decide to become a courier, you won’t receive many options in where you can travel. You go to whatever location they need you to visit, whether it is the Middle East, North America or another location. You obtain a last minute permit for the trip and are oftentimes restricted as to the number of bags you are approved to have with you. Chances are, you will get better discounts by finding reasonably priced flights using other means.

<h1>Airlie Beach</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Airlie Beach♡❤♡ (or Airlie) is a town in Queensland, Australia and is the closest port from which to access the &lt;a href="Whitsunday%20islands"&gt;Whitsunday islands&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef"&gt;Great Barrier Reef&lt;/a&gt;. With around 25,000 residents, it is developed to cater for almost every kind of tourist and backpacker, and is the major hub for trips out to the Whitsunday islands and Outer &lt;a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef"&gt;Great Barrier Reef&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.abelpointmarina.com.au/"&gt;Abel point marina&lt;/a&gt; is the location for taking boats out to islands, and is a brisk 15-minute walk from Shute Harbour Road, Airlie's High Street, around a renovated seaside boardwalk.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Airlie beach used to be a backpacker haven but has now been discovered by Australians and has consequently become more commercialised. Still plenty of good cheap accommodation and an excellent stop off on the East Coast of Australia.

<h3>Orientation</h3>

The main strip of Airlie where most of the backpacker resorts and pubs are is usually known as Airlie Beach proper. Cannonvale is the section west of the strip to where the developments peter out. Beyond that is Cannonvalley and Strathdickie - more rural areas where the housing is more acreage style or farming land. Other suburbs in the area are Jubilee Pocket and Shute Harbour, where the ferries to the &lt;a href="Whitsunday%20Islands"&gt;Whitsunday Islands&lt;/a&gt; depart from.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By plane</h3>
Flying to Proserpine Airport, also known as Whitsunday Coast Airport, in &lt;a href="Proserpine"&gt;Proserpine&lt;/a&gt; is the easiest way to reach Airlie. The two main airlines flying to here are &lt;a href="http%3A//www.virginaustralia.com"&gt;Virgin Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.jetstar.com.au"&gt;Jetstar&lt;/a&gt;. It has upgraded facilities with full baggage collection, hire car and service desks and a small bistro area.

There is also &lt;a href="Hamilton%20Island"&gt;Hamilton Island&lt;/a&gt; airport which is just off Airlie Beach. Do your research though as you have to get off Hamilton Island and this could be expensive.

<h3>By train</h3>
There is a train station in Proserpine for those travelling up the East Coast.

<h3>By bus</h3>
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.greyhound.com.au/"&gt;Greyhound&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https%3A//www.premierms.com.au/"&gt;Premier&lt;/a&gt; coaches stop at Airlie on their trip between &lt;a href="Brisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Cairns"&gt;Cairns&lt;/a&gt;.

There are also tours that travel up the East Coast and visit Airlie Beach.

HitchHiking is rare but it can be efficient.

<h2>Get around</h2>
A number of buses serve the airport terminal, and drive to Airlie beach or other locations but all but one must be prebooked. The tickets cost a flat $15 per person one way and can be purchased in a queue at a clearly marked booth just inside the arrival gate. The bus driver mans the booth, and when everyone has got a ticket (about 30–40&amp;nbsp;minutes wait from arrival) the bus gets going. Another option is to take a taxi, for which there is also a booth inside the arrivals gate. However taxi rides seem to match the bus price, and cost $15 per person. Also, there may not be any taxis waiting. The ride to Airlie beach is smooth and takes about 40&amp;nbsp;minutes. The driver will ask where you are staying and take you to the door of the hostel or hotel in Airlie Beach.

<h2>See</h2>

<h2>Do</h2>

On Saturday morning there is a charming market along the waterfront, with a range of locally produced foods and souvenirs.

<h3>Swimming</h3>

Despite its name, Airlie Beach is not the best place for the beach. The few near Shute Harbour Rd are small and pretty, but the presence of jellyfish (there are signs up detailing different species near the beaches) means people do not swim in the water from around October to around May. There is a new man made beach Port of Airlie which has a larger beach than Airlie beach proper and it also has a shopping area and boat marina. A swim in the water requires a stinger suit - made from rash top type material. However more than making up for this, Airlie has a fantastic man made lagoon. This is around 200 m long and 50 m wide, landscaped with a bridge and grass to lie on surrounding. It is watched by lifeguards during the day and security at night, and because it is open to swim in at all times the lagoon makes relaxing in Airlie pure delight.

<h3>Day trips</h3>

Transfers to cruises and daytrips to the &lt;a href="Whitsunday%20Islands"&gt;Whitsunday Islands&lt;/a&gt; and Outer &lt;a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef"&gt;Great Barrier Reef&lt;/a&gt; are popular in Airlie. See the &lt;a href="Whitsunday%20Islands"&gt;Whitsunday Islands&lt;/a&gt; for information.

<h3>Hiking</h3>

Airlie Beach features several hiking trails of different length. One starts at the end of &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and leads in about 90 minutes up through the national park to a beautiful lookout over the harbor and the Whitsunday Islands.

<h2>Eat</h2>
Airlie has many varied restaurants, both budget and more expensive, and a range of takeaway places with specials catering to the backpacker market.

For those foodies out there, Deja Vu at Water's Edge Resort is beautiful and Capers at the Airlie Beach Hotel is always reliable. 

For those on a budget, Morocco's, Beaches or Magnums offer good pub-style meals, with some of the sailing trips offering meals there included as part of the trip cost.

<h2>Drink</h2>
Airlie has a great nightlife with bars concentrated on the main road.

<h1>Airline alliances</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
<h2>What is an airline alliance?</h2>
Airline alliances are formed when different airlines agree to substantially cooperate with each other. Advantages for customers include more destinations and more convenient connections, while the airlines benefit by feeding passengers to each other instead of to competitors. For travelers, the most obvious effect of airline alliances is codesharing whereby one airline will sell a seat on a flight with its own flight number, but the flight is performed by a different airline. (Note that not all airlines are part of an airline alliance, and not even all airlines within the same alliance do codeshares with each other.)

Although many airlines in an alliance have subsidiaries, the subsidiaries are often not members of the alliance which the parents are part of.

<h2>How does this apply to me?</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Airline alliances tend to coordinate their flights to ease connections, flying intercontinental flights to each other's hubs, adjusting schedules and grouping one alliance's flights at a single terminal at large airports. They code-share and interline with each other so that you can travel to many more destinations on a single ticket sold by your local airline.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- You can collect &lt;a href="frequent%20flyer%20programme"&gt;frequent flyer&lt;/a&gt; miles when flying on an alliance partner airline. This means for example that a passenger with Qantas can claim mileage when flying with another OneWorld airline such as British Airways.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Additionally, status levels that you have on one airline are generally recognized by other airlines in the same alliance. For example, a 'Morning Calm' status with Korean Air will automatically give you 'Elite' status when flying with another airline in the SkyTeam alliance. Thus, you can check in at the Business Class counter, get priority luggage tags, getting emergency exit row seats assigned to you and priority boarding of the aircraft.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Travelers can take advantage of a round-the-world ticket, a ticket with the ability to stop at a few countries around the world for a relatively lower price.

</ul>
<h2>Oneworld</h2>
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.oneworld.com"&gt;Oneworld&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is the smallest alliance counting by the number of airlines. The member airlines are spread evenly around the world, so it is a workable option when planning a long multi-point trip such as for a &lt;a href="round%20the%20world"&gt;round the world&lt;/a&gt; flight. It was the first alliance to introduce interlining e-tickets. 

<h3>Members</h3>
<h2>SkyTeam</h2>
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.skyteam.com"&gt;SkyTeam&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is the latest alliance to be formed. It has a particularly strong network in Europe. 

<h3>Members</h3>
<h2>Star Alliance</h2>
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.staralliance.com"&gt;Star Alliance&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is a global network of airlines, and the world's largest airline alliance. 

Cooperation includes seamless code share flights and baggage interlining and, as a new trend, an increased degree of co-location in airport terminals.

Members of any Star Alliance frequent traveler program (FT) can credit miles or points flown in many booking classes on any Star Alliance operated aircraft. 

"Gold" Star Alliance FT members get an extra 20&amp;nbsp;kg or "piece" of baggage; reciprocal access to most Star Alliance members' lounges; priority boarding and priority wait listing.

<h3>Members</h3>
<h2>Rail-air alliances</h2>
In some countries (especially those with extensive high speed rail networks) there are also cooperation agreements between airlines and railway operators, offering trains as a code-shared "flight" or other benefits to travelers. For more on the topic see &lt;a href="rail%20air%20alliances"&gt;rail air alliances&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Frequent flyer programs</h2>

You should choose your Frequent Flyer airline in an alliance carefully. Although you may think it is intuitive to join the airline you fly most, you should be aware that privileges offered are often different and frequent flyer points may be more generous under a different airline in the same alliance. 

By way of example, to reach Star Alliance ♡❤Gold♡❤ status (affording you priority wait listing and boarding, extra checked baggage allowance and use of lounges even when flying on any Star Alliance economy flight) requires only 20,000 miles in one year with Aegean Airlines' ♡❤Miles&amp;Bonus♡❤ program, but some other member program require 50,000 or even 100,000 miles in a year to be flown before awarding ♡❤Gold♡❤ status.

<doc id="407" url="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki?curid=407" title="Aitutaki">
<h1>Aitutaki</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.aitutakitourism.com"&gt;Aitutaki&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ (Aye-too-tah-ki) is an island in the &lt;a href="Southern%20Cook%20Islands"&gt;Southern Cook Islands&lt;/a&gt;, a 45 minute flight from the capital island of &lt;a href="Rarotonga"&gt;Rarotonga&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Aitutaki lagoon and its islands are breathtakingly beautiful. The classic picture postcard of small palm tree fringed tropical island, with shallow, warm turquoise waters, corals, tropical fish and blue skies is taken here. The lagoon is large, taking about an hour to cross in a boat. Tourism facilities are well developed, but are still low key enough not to intrude on the nature of the island.

<h3>Geography</h3>

The larger island is split into different villages, ♡❤♡Vaipae♡❤♡ &amp; ♡❤♡Tau'tu♡❤♡ are the largest and are located on the south east side of the island, ♡❤♡Arutanga♡❤♡ is often referred to as town and is on the south west side of the island. Arutanga has a center area for shopping, and the Telecom Office (also the Post Office), the Westpac Bank and the Bank of the Cook Islands are located here. Here you will also find the Blue Nun and Wharf. ♡❤♡Amuri♡❤♡ is a general term for the north end of the island which contains most of the tourist accommodations and less population. The other villages on the island are ♡❤♡Uriea♡❤♡, ♡❤♡Rearea♡❤♡, ♡❤♡Rama♡❤♡, ♡❤♡Vaipeka♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡Nikaupara♡❤♡.

There are several smaller island in the lagoon ♡❤♡Akaiami♡❤♡ is a small, elongated islet at the opposite end of the lagoon from Aitutaki's main island around 20 minutes across the lagoon from Aitutaki. Akaiami is remote, quiet, charming, unspoiled and surrounded by pristine turquoise lagoon and coral reef, and there is a small lodge there. ♡❤♡One Foot Island♡❤♡ is a popular stopping spot for lagoon cruises.

<h3>History</h3>

During WWII the island was host to American forces who outnumbered the local population of the island at the time. The Americans built the airstrips which are still in use today. The island was built to be the last point of defence in the Pacific, but Japanese advance was reversed and the island never saw action. Some descendants of the American troops stationed there remain on the island.

The lagoon was a stopover point for the TEAL (later to become Air New Zealand) flying boats, which operated to between &lt;a href="Tahiti"&gt;Tahiti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Fiji"&gt;Fiji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; until 1960. The remains of the wharf where visitors would disembark for a two hour stopover, often including a swim in lagoon is still in place today on the island of ♡❤Akaiami♡❤ in the lagoon. The rocks are slightly submerged.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By plane</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q4699354"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Aitutaki Airport♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;&lt;b&gt; AIT &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Is served by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.airraro.co.ck"&gt;Air Rarotonga&lt;/a&gt; with daily flights from &lt;a href="Rarotonga"&gt;Rarotonga&lt;/a&gt;. There are flights three to five times daily (except Sundays where two flights are operated) that take approximately 45 minutes. There is a small cafe at the airport, selling &lt;a href="Atiu"&gt;Atiu&lt;/a&gt; coffee and some other local produce. There is no ATM at the airport. Flights are around $200–$250 each way, and the morning flights there and the afternoon flights back are be reserved for people doing day or overnight trips. It is possible to do a day trip from &lt;a href="Rarotonga"&gt;Rarotonga&lt;/a&gt;, which includes flights, a bus tour of the island, a lagoon cruise, and lunch. Regular price is $499, but lookout for last minute specials down to $400.
</ul>
&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; 

<h2>Get around</h2>
Akaiami is a small, elongated islet at the opposite end of the lagoon from Aitutaki's main island. A boat ride of approximately 20 minutes communicates both island. As of September 2006, there was only one inhabitant to the island (Pare), whose family owns the island and runs a small lodge. Akaiami offers little in terms of entertainment, other than hiking, fishing, swimming and kayaking. Its remote location, far from tourists and technology, is the real asset of this small charming island. Akaiami is essentially a fairly remote, quiet, charming, unspoiled islet surrounded by a pristine turquoise lagoon and a coral reef.

<h3>By car/scooter</h3>

Car and Scooter (or Moped) hire are the main forms of transport on Aitutaki. This can easily be arranged through any of the rental companies (or better accommodations) on the island. Prices tend to be higher and quality a bit lower than on Rarotonga.

A driver's licence is $2.50 NZD and can be purchased at the police station in Arutanga (also known as town). You will need to present your foreign driver's licence to obtain this. You are not required to have a motorcycle licence on your licence from your home country to obtain a licence for scooters &amp; motorcycles in the Cook Islands; driving down to the police station is typically your practicum, although very rarely they do short tests. The licence is paper with no photo identification and lasts for a year. An Aitutaki driver's licence is cheaper, easier to get, and faster than getting a licence in Rarotonga and your Aitutaki licence will cover you for the whole Cook Islands. Licences in Rarotonga cost $20 with an additional amount for a practical test. There are sometimes lines in Rarotonga at the licence office so if you can avoid it, and you don't want a laminated photo id, the Aitutaki licence is the way to go.

Prices for cars can vary on which model chosen and which company used but typically $65 to $85 a day is usual with a refundable $40 petrol deposit. Cars typically tend to be automatics and are pretty reliable under the hood but will usually have some superficial damage.

Scooters are much more economical at $25 a day with a $10 petrol deposit. There is some competition with scooters so if you are not happy with yours you have other options. As with the cars, the scooters are typically in good condition and safe to drive, but will not be vespas or straight out of the box. Typically rentals are automatic, but ask and manuals should be available. Manual scooters can be in better condition because they are not rented as often.

<h3>By taxi</h3>

Taxis are expensive on Aitutaki. Rates are based on how far you are going, anywhere from $10 per person for short trips to $20 NZD per person, booking ahead is highly recommended and you can confirm your price then. There two taxi companies on the island (some restaurants &amp; bars will have their own vehicles for pickups) :

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Pacifica Taxi♡❤♡ - excellent service and reliable.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Tropicool Tours♡❤♡ - as the name suggests, does day tours around the island, transfers for Lagoon Cruises, and transfers for Cafe Tupuna. It is operated by Nane Herman who is a wonderful resource on island life and usually arrives with flowers for her guests, the only problem is that she can have limited availability for taxi services.

</ul>
<h2>See</h2>

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡One-Foot Island♡❤♡ is a must see with blue lagoons and white sandy beach. There is a post office (box), one of the most remote in the world. There are beaches for swimming, you can walk around the island. Best snorkelling seems to be around the island past the rock ledge, towards the reef.

</ul>
Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa located on its own private island Akitua which is directly on the fabled Aitutaki Lagoon offering the best views from the Flying Boat Beach Bar &amp; Grill. Day passes available for visitors not staying at the resort that allow access to water sports equipment, activities, beaches, bars, restaurant and Spa Polynesia. Romantic Candlelit dining with degustation menu in the evening on the beach.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Take an island, safari, &amp; walk about ♡❤♡tours♡❤♡
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Ministry of Marine Resources♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;Open weekdays only&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Learn about the sea life in the lagoon. See baby sea turtles and giant clams.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h3>Lagoon Tours</h3>

If the weather is nice, or even if it's not too bad, a lagoon cruise is near idyllic. Aitutaki's lagoon is supposed to rival Bora Bora in French Polynesia for beauty, and all of the lagoon operators are reputable and offer excellent trips. There is not a best operator on Aitutaki for Lagoon Cruises so look around and decide what kind of a cruise you are looking for - smaller more intimate cruises which stay away from One Foot Island during peak periods, or larger slower boats with entertainment and toilets on board. Unless it's a terrible day you can't go wrong.

For those that prefer to "do their own thing" another way to enjoy the Aitutaki Lagoon is to hire a kayak or outrigger canoe from the Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa and paddle out to the nearest islet "motu" a few hundred metres away and go as far as is comfortable exploring the uninhabited islands. Book a picnic lunch and find your own beach without another soul on it.

There is a small store for supplies in town, and two ATMs. The selection is very much what is available at the time, and is quite limited. Sea cargo can arrive in Aitutaki every 3 months, and supplies can be limited before resupply.

On Sundays there is only one store open, the Neibaa Store in Vaipae, and there is only one petrol station next to the airport.

<h2>Eat</h2>

<ul>
BULLET::::- Try the island's ♡❤♡Ike mata♡❤♡ (raw tuna) with coconut milk. It is delicious! And Poke a Cook Island Banana pudding which usually comes baked in the Earth oven or "Umu" Try not to eat snapper as they may give you ciguatera.

</ul>
Reservations for dinner are a good idea on Aiutaki, as periodically the more popular restaurants will book up during tourist peak periods.

The Flying Boat Beach Bar &amp; Grill at Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa has views of Aitutaki Lagoon and offers Pacific cuisine between 11AM and 9PM. The Bounty Brasserie offers casual dining and regular live entertainment.Candlelit dining with a degustation menu and private waiter under the stars is available for a limited number of couples each evening.

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Te Vaka Bar &amp; Grill♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;An excellent option for meals with possibly the largest menu on the island. Good quality and price, but sometimes the service is on "island time". Something travellers will likely experience, positively hopefully, anywhere in the outer islands. Te Vaka does have limited kitchen hours for meals, but the bar is also your best bet for any live sports, as they have a plasma TV hooked up to satellite. Friday nights are popular rugby nights for locals to cheer on the All Blacks. If you are Australian you can expect some good natured ribbing when any Wallaby match is on.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Cafe Tupuna♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +682 31678 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;Not open on Sundays&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Reservations are required. The food and service on the island is as good as you will find on the island and is on par with other a-la-carte dining experiences travellers will be used to.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Rapae Bay Restaurant♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;The Pacific Resort&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +682 31720 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;Open 7 days a week&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Reservations are required. The best food and service on the island and on a par with other a la carte dining experiences travellers will be used to.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

The following all serve decent quality food but it definitely leans more to a take away style menu, with hamburgers being a big staple.

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Samade's Bar♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Great BBQ on Sunday.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Puffy's♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;For the Best Fish and Chips on the Island.&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Koru Cafe♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Serves Espresso coffee and has WiFi internet.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Popoara's Boathouse♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;The Boathouse will hopefully be more on par with the Te Vaka Bar &amp; Grill once it is fully up and running, with more seafood on the menu. The best Ike mata on the island.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Tauono's Garden Café♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;Mon-Wed-Fri 12-14 for lunch and 3-5 for tea. There's also a fruit market open Mon-Wed-Fri 10-5.&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Serves delicious garden lunch and afternoon tea. All food is from their own local organic plantation and the surrounding sea. Sonja's cooking is a delight and something you must experience.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Drink</h2>

The Flying Boat Beach Bar &amp; Grill at The Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa offers the best views of the fabled Aitutaki Lagoon as it is located directly on the lagoon on the private island of "Akituta". Enjoy a tropical cocktail as the sun goes down.

Pacific or Islands Nights are also a good option to experience while you are in the Cook Islands. Islands nights usually involve either a buffet or a la carte menu and an island dancing show for a set price. Most island nights will also include a string band before the show as well. While Cook Island dancing is distinct in its own ways and definitely worth watching, it will be of a same vein as Tahitian shows for those more familiar with French Polynesia.

There is also nightlife, particularly on Friday's &amp; Saturdays. The popular venues change every once in a while but are not typically hard to find and will usually be wherever the Island night takes place.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Samade's Bar♡❤♡ tends to attract more tourists than locals. You will find locals genuinely friendly and open and it is an excellent experience. The only words of caution are that periodically fights can occur after closing among those who've had too much to drink. It can be village rivalry or personal but almost never involves tourists. Closing time is always 12AM.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Coconut Crusher Bar♡❤♡. A great feed, a great drink, and wonderful people

</ul>
<h2>Stay safe</h2>

It will be a challenge, if not virtually impossible, to get into trouble in Aitutaki.

Water is filtered but not UV treated, so you may want to drink bottled water whilst on the island. There is a communal water tank in town next to the market with safe water, and it has a tap from which you can fill up water bottles for free.

There are mosquitoes on the island, but there is no malaria. There are stone fish in the lagoon, so wear reef shoes when exploring the reef.

<h2>Connect</h2>
There are hotspots from Bluesky and Zenbu scattered throughout the island. Bluesky also has a small store that is combined with the post office in Arutanga where you can buy vouchers, or just buy them online when connecting.

<h1>Aix-en-Provence</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.aixenprovencetourism.com/en/"&gt;Aix-en-Provence&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is a city in &lt;a href="Provence"&gt;Provence&lt;/a&gt;, a region in the south of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Aix-en-Provence (usually simply called Aix) is a small, classically Provençal town, famous for being home to Cézanne; the addition of the TGV (high-speed train) station has brought lots of vacationers from the north, and Aix has turned into a shopping town with high variety and representation considering its small size. Three universities and several French-language schools for international students produce a very strong student presence.

Aix has always been a rich city. There is a high contrast between Marseille (only 30&amp;nbsp;km and half an hour away). Whereas Marseille is one the poorest French cities (but still a unique and not to be missed town), Aix is perhaps one of the richest. People seeking for budget or popular places should continue to Marseille. Still, Aix has a lot to offer. It is a quiet, clean and comfortable city. The city center is mostly pedestrian and, though it is quite small (you can cross the center in 15 minutes by foot), offers long hours of nice walks. As in all Provençal towns, the city center consists of narrow streets, lined with interesting buildings from 17th century hotels to paved plazas.

</ul>
<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By train</h3>
Aix has both a TGV and a regular station and is well connected both to the &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="Marseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt; line and (via Marseille) to the &lt;a href="Genoa"&gt;Genoa&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="Nice"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="Barcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; line. The same shuttle that runs from the airport to Aix also services the Aix TGV station.
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Gare d'Aix-en-Provence♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;regular train station&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Place Gustave Desplaces&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h3>By bus</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Gare Routière♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;bus station&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +33 891 024 025 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;There is an express coach from Marseille (St Charles station) to Aix which takes 30–40 minutes. There are also regular shuttles to the TGV station and the airport.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Nice"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Buses from Care Routière Vauban in Nice (via Nice airport) go daily at 06:10 (not Sundays and holidays), 07:35, 09:25 (not Sundays and holidays), 12:00, and 17:15. They take about 3 hr 30 min and cost &lt;abbr title=" €30 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€30&lt;/abbr&gt; . See http://zou.maregionsud.fr .

</ul>
<h3>By plane</h3>
Fly into &lt;a href="Marseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Nice"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt;. Marseille is nearer (just south), but budget airlines such as EasyJet prefer Nice. There is a navette (shuttle bus) that can take you from the airport to the bus station near the center of town.

<h3>By car</h3>
If you come from anywhere up north you will most likely use the A7 motorway (♡❤Route du Soleil♡❤) that runs from &lt;a href="Lyon"&gt;Lyon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Marseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt; (whether you come from &lt;a href="Switzerland"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; or from the &lt;a href="UK"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="Paris"&gt;Paris&lt;/a&gt;). At exit 27, take A8 (♡❤La Provencale♡❤) to Aix. From &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;, you'll take A9 (♡❤La Languedocienne♡❤), then turn onto A54 through the city of &lt;a href="Arles"&gt;Arles&lt;/a&gt; (you might consider stopping there), then turn onto A7 and A8 respectively, as described above. From Italy, just take A8 passing &lt;a href="Nice"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt; and all the posh &lt;a href="C%C3%B4te%20d%27Azur"&gt;Côte d'Azur&lt;/a&gt; resorts.

Avoiding toll roads can be slow but highly pleasurable, many of the ♡❤routes nationales♡❤ offer wonderful scenery that motorways can't deliver (save maybe some parts of the A8 east of Nice).

Parking in Aix can be quite difficult. There is at least one free car park but allow plenty of time to find a space (and the spaces can be quite tight to get into!).

<h2>Get around</h2>
Aix is a fairly small city and can be easily navigated by foot. The bus system is also very efficient and has numerous stops within the city as well as connecting Aix with nearby villages, towns, and Marseille. The city bus also runs to Carrefour Les Milles, a large shopping center. Discounted tickets for frequent bus users can be purchased at the main bus station, as well as bus schedules. The ticket office also sells discounted multi-pack tickets for the bus from Aix to Marseille and the new TGV station (located between the two cities).

<h2>See</h2>

Aix is famous for its fountains. The largest and the most popular one is on the Cours Mirabeau, the main avenue through town, as well as a moss-covered fountain which draws its water from a hot spring.

Along with searching out the dozens of fountains sprawled around the city, Aix is known for its architecture. The varied and often intricate doors are a key feature, as well as the bell towers. The bell towers throughout Aix-en-Provence, and Provence more generally, are made of wrought iron. This allows the strong winds of the Mistral to flow straight through them, since solid stone would be destroyed by the force of the winds.

The city market runs multiple days a week, but the largest and most colorful is the Saturday market which includes a flower market at the Place de l'Hotel de Ville and the main food market is at Place Richelme.

It has also become known as the home of Cézanne's later works. You can see his atelier with some of the original objects he painted into his still lives. The Bibémus Quarries allow you to see Mt. St. Victoire, the mountains he captured in many of his paintings. You can also visit the Manor of Jas de Bouffan which houses many of his masterpieces. To see all three, you need at least two days in Aix.

Among the main landmarks in the town are:

<h2>Do</h2>
Aix is a fairly quiet town, but if you really want to there can be many things to do. At the &lt;a href="%23Understand"&gt;♡❤tourist office♡❤&lt;/a&gt; you can learn about the more modern activities include bowling, billiards, pubs, etc.

Another option is to hire a bicycle (for about &lt;abbr title=" €10 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€10&lt;/abbr&gt; for five hours) and ride around Aix. This is a very good way to see the town that is outside the center. You can find many interesting places and buildings that you wouldn't have seen other wise. Be careful though when riding in the center of the town, since it is very crowded most of the time.

There is also a bus that leaves off the ♡❤Fontaine de la Rotonde♡❤ for &lt;a href="https%3A//booking.aixenprovencetourism.com/nature-hiking-in-sainte-victoire-2h30.html"&gt;♡❤Sainte-Victoire Mountain♡❤&lt;/a&gt; and you get there in ten minutes. Pack a lunch and put comfortable shoes on to do a nature walk or to climb the mountain. At the top there is a monastery where you can stay over night, make sure to bring fire wood.

<h2>Learn</h2>
One of the campuses of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.univ-amu.fr/"&gt;♡❤Aix-Marseille University♡❤&lt;/a&gt; is located in the town.

<h2>Buy</h2>

Aix has many major fashion boutiques, as well as a plethora of small clothing stores, perfumeries, and touristy souvenir shops. They are complemented by a few open-air markets in large squares, offering home made and grown goods and cafes.

For everyday items, look for various convenience stores, e.g., Monoprix (even on the Cours Mirabeau) with clothing/sundries at street level and a decent selection of groceries, bottled beverages, etc. on the level below.

<h2>Eat</h2>

Aix has an incredible number of restaurants compared to its small size. Most of them are gathered in a small area in the old city, between Place des Cardeurs and the Rotonde (Cours Mirabeau). Restaurants and bars on the Cours Mirabeau tend to be more expensive though, while some might be considered tourist traps, others are among the best places to eat in the city.

♡❤Emile Bec♡❤, which has five locations in Aix-en-Provence, is an excellent bakery.

You can also try ♡❤Calissons♡❤, a specialty of the region consisting of a smooth, pale yellow, homogeneous paste of candied fruit (especially melons and oranges) and ground almonds topped with a thin layer of royal icing. Calissons have a texture not unlike that of marzipan, but with a fruitier, distinctly melon-like flavor. Calissons are often almond-shaped and are typically about two inches in length.

</ul>
If you really want to eat like a local and save a couple of euros, a great place to eat is the many corner restaurants that offer Doner Kebabs. For four euros you get a "sandwich," wrapped in a gallette or pita, that includes lettuce, tomatoes, onion, meat, French fries and be sure to ask for sauce blanche. This is very delicious and cheap. There are many restaurants that do their Kebabs differently so be sure to try a few!

Aix en Provence is home to the Erasmus students' food of choice. Pizza capri located at the top of the Cours Mirabeau is perhaps the best pizza you will ever eat. (I would like to contest this bit about Pizza capri. Firstly, it simply isn't that good. Secondly, the fact that EVERY single person I've met in Aix tells me that Pizza Capri is the best leads me to believe that the Corsican Mafia, which owns Pizza Capris, has paid off the city to promote this place because (I jest). Pizza Capri is simply well located and cheap. It's not bad but it's nothing to visit the city for so don't buy the hype and you'll enjoy it more.)

In combination with patisseries and bakeries, convenience stores (noted under "Buy" above) also offer good opportunities for economical self-catering, even for day visitors.

<h2>Drink</h2>

Like restaurants there are plenty of bars, pubs, night-clubs, etc... in Aix.
A nice and relatively cheap place to have a drink is the ♡❤♡Bar de La Mairie♡❤♡ on Place de la Mairie.

For those who would like to meet with the local student population, the bar ♡❤♡Le Brigand♡❤♡ might be a good choice. The prices are reasonable, and the ambiance is convivial : most of the regular customers are either tourists, or students. But be sure not to arrive too late, for the place may quickly be overcrowded, and you may have to drink your pint outside, without any chair or table!

<h2>Stay safe</h2>

Aix is a safe city to visit, but crime does occur there. As with all French cities, tourists in Aix should be especially conscious of the risk of pickpockets and theft. Be aware of your surroundings. Do not leave valuables within view in parked cars. Exercise increased caution at night, and use the taxis that leave from the Rotonde fountain if you are returning to the outlying neighborhoods late in the evening. Avoid public parks after dark.

<h1>Aizawl</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Aizawl♡❤♡ is the capital and largest city of the state of &lt;a href="Mizoram"&gt;Mizoram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the centre of all important government offices, the state assembly house and the civil secretariat. Aizawl is the largest city, as well as the capital of the state of Mizoram in India. The city is located north of the Tropic of Cancer in the northern part of Mizoram and is situated on a ridge 1132 metres (3715 ft) above sea level, with the Tlawng river valley to its west and the Tuirial river valley to its east. In the summer the temperature ranges from 20-30 degrees Celsius, and in the winter 11-21 degrees Celsius.

<h2>Understand</h2>

This 112-year-old citadel-like city, with its timber houses is set on a ridge at approximately an altitude of 4000 ft above sea level. The city is spread over several mountain ridges with most houses built on 60%+ inclines. Aizawl is a religious and cultural center of the Mizos. Aizawl lies just north of Tropic of cancer. 

With a population of approximately 300,000, it has cloudless blue skies, dewy mornings and sunlit days. These help to ensure the enjoyment of unforgettable holiday pleasures practically all year round. Even the monsoon months are pleasant and gentle.

<h2>Get in</h2>

Buses, Sumos or aircraft provide access.

Buses run between all the capital cities in the North East states, &lt;a href="Guwahati"&gt;Guwahati&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Shillong"&gt;Shillong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Silchar"&gt;Silchar&lt;/a&gt; being the main routes. &lt;a href="http%3A//transport.mizoram.gov.in/page/bus.html"&gt;Mizoram State Transport&lt;/a&gt; lists services throughout the state and to &lt;a href="Silchar"&gt;Silchar&lt;/a&gt; but their schedule is always subject to change. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.networkbus.in/Default.aspx"&gt;Network Travels&lt;/a&gt; has luxury buses from &lt;a href="Guwahati"&gt;Guwahati&lt;/a&gt;. The new bus terminal is located in the suburb of Thuampui area. There is frequent city bus service from the centre but may take up to one hour. Taxis cost ₹200 and up.

Sumos are ten-seat SUV's and provide intra- and inter-state transportation. They depart from various parts of the city, depending on the destination; the Guwahati-Silchar route starts at the Zarkawt area.

Air India flies between Lengpui Airport and &lt;a href="Kolkata"&gt;Kolkata&lt;/a&gt; and Guwahati.

<h2>Get around</h2>

Aizawl is centred around a mountain ridge which means the roads run more or less parallel to the mountain side. This means if you need to go vertically up or down it will be faster to take a foot path than to go by road. The mountainous landscape also means that the cost of driving a relatively short horizontal distance can be quite expensive and this is reflected in bus and taxi rates.

There are numerous buses routes that connect the various localities and most will run through the town centre (Dawrpui - North to South and Civil Hospital South to North). Bus fares vary and best is to ask the conductor though a relatively short trip of 1 km cost around ₹5 (Jan 2012). One thing to note is that there are no buses that run between the airport and the city.

There are nearly 5000 taxis licensed to ply the roads in Aizawl and are readily available. Rates are extremely high compared to the rest of India. Though there are official published rates, no taxi runs by these rates. The main contention from taxi drivers is that 1 km uphill costs more to run than downhill and with inclines being frequently 30% or more. A relatively short distance of 1 km will cost you around ₹50. A taxi to or from the airport will cost you around ₹800 (July 2012) to/from the central areas of Aizawl. However, the price is liable to go up if petrol prices rise or if a landslide blocks the main road (requiring a longer alternate route).

There is a taxi firm called Sure Taxis that offers a service to find, negotiate rates on your behalf and dispatch taxis to your location and they don't charge anything to you. They also offer rental cars (comes with a driver) such as Altos, Boleros and Scorpios. Their numbers are: 0389 232 2833 &amp; 0389 232 1494

BULLET::::- The main shopping centres in Aizawl are Bara Bazar, Millennium Centre and Solomon's cave.

For handicraft, Zohanco in Zarkawt has shawls, puan, bags and furnishing materials. For bamboo works such as baskets and khumbeu the finely mizo woven bamboo cap, these are available at MKVI, Sales Emporium, Zarkawt. However, the prices may not be very different from Mumbai or Delhi.

<h2>Drink</h2>
The alcohol ban in Mizoram was lifted recently, but there are no bars of any description. Licensed wine called Zawlaidi is available for purchase in various departmental stores, though. 

Neither has the cafe culture really caught on yet, so there are very few places to have a casual non-alcoholic drink.Locally produced and govt. 

There are two cafes, both part of a Zote Bakery outlet. One is in Dawrpui near the church and another in Electric Veng. Don't expect a wide range of drinks: It's either milky tea or milky coffee out of a Nescafe machine.

<h2>Go next</h2>

<ul>
BULLET::::- Pick a picnic basket and head out for ♡❤♡Tamdil (Tam Lake)♡❤♡. This natural lake is reputed for its fish and prawns and is an 85 km drive from Aizawl. The drive gives you an excellent opportunity to see some of the prettiest areas of Mizoram. Go for boat rides (if they are not closed because the boats are in bad shape) relax by the tranquil waters, and, if you can, take a drive into the nearby jungles, which are home to an assortment of fascinating flora and fauna. You can also stay here overnight. The resort village of Saituai is just 10 km away.
BULLET::::- Surrounded by a vast stretch of thick bamboo forests close to Thenzawl hill station is Mizoram's highest ♡❤♡waterfall Vantawng♡❤♡ (750 ft high). Located 152 km from Aizawl, this popular water body is worth a visit. You can even stay overnight as it has a cafeteria and a cottage for hire.
BULLET::::- Drive along the fertile plains of &lt;a href="Champhai"&gt;Champhai&lt;/a&gt;, about 200 km from Aizawl, to enjoy the stunning vista of emerald rice fields bordered by the smoky hills of Myanmar. Champai has the biggest stretch of plains in Mizoram, which are used for rice cultivation. The road from Aizwal to Champai is not very good in some places and it takes about 8 hours one way by a shared SUMO. A privately hired car may take about 6-7 hrs; a top speed of only 40 km per hour is possible. But the raw and yet scenic beauty one enjoys along the winding, turning road which goes through thick forests, makes this a memorable experience.
BULLET::::- One of the finest encounters with Mizoram's splendid vistas is ♡❤♡Phawngpui♡❤♡, its highest peak, extremely popular with trekkers and adventure enthusiasts. The Blue Mountain, as it is often referred to, is 300 km from Aizawl and close to the Myanmar border. Fragrant herbs and rare species of orchids and rhododendrons are found here.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Saiha♡❤♡ is an angler's paradise on the Chhimtuipui, Mizoram's biggest river, 378 km from Aizawl.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Dampa♡❤♡ is a tiger reserve located in West Phaileng district and is 127 km from Aizawl. It is better to book the government lodge well in advance. You need a permit from the forest officer staying in West Phaileng to enter the Dampa forest. This can also be obtained from forest department in Aizawl. You should be careful while visiting the forest on a rainy day as it is infested with leeches. This Sanctuary has different types of birds and animals, like tigers and elephants.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Reiek♡❤♡- This is a very nice place near Aizawl and is a must-see. If you hire a full taxi (Maruti 800/ Alto), it would cost you about ₹1300-₹1400. A hired non AC small car (you never need an AC car in Mizoram!) like Wagon R, Indica, Santro etc., will cost you approximately ₹1800/-.
</ul>
Reiek has a model Mizo village. Entry ticket is ₹20/- for adults and ₹10/- for children. Ask the ticket clerk for someone to show you around, otherwise you won't understand the exhibits––there is no extra charge for such a guide. In December, especially at Christmas time, this place is full of festivities with live music shows atop the mountain, and there is a small stage built especially for the festivities.

<h1>Aizuwakamatsu</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//samurai-city.jp/en/"&gt;Aizuwakamatsu&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ (会津若松) is the main city in the Aizu region of &lt;a href="Fukushima%20%28prefecture%29"&gt;Fukushima Prefecture&lt;/a&gt;, in the north of &lt;a href="Honshu"&gt;Honshū&lt;/a&gt; island, the largest of &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. With a population of 120,000, Aizuwakamatsu has a rich warrior history, stretching back 1,000 years. Although the city is most known for the Byakkotai, a group of twenty 16- and 17-year-olds who committed suicide during the Boshin Civil War. Today, sake and laquerware are the two main industries in Aizuwakamatsu. The Aizu region has spectacular natural scenery. Most visitors also make a journey to Mt. Bandai and Inawashiro for skiing, fishing and onsen.

<h2>Get in</h2>

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Aizuwakamatsu Castle♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;Tsuruga Castle&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A castle was built here in 1593, but the current building is a concrete replica. During the end of the Edo Period, the Aizu soldiers were defeated after one month of fighting to defeat the castle. The new government (Meiji Period) destroyed the castle in 1874. In accordance with its original design, the castle was built again in 1965 - it is considered to symbolize the samurai culture of Aizuwakamatsu. The castle contains five stories, which serve as a local history museum. Each floor focuses on a theme - Buddhist memorabilia, antique lacquerware and pottery, the Boshin Civil War and the Byakkotai. The fifth floor serves as an observation platform from where you can enjoy a splendid view of the entire Aizu valley. Near the entrance to the castle grounds is a souvenir shop selling a variety of goods from the Aizu region, and in the spring, the castle grounds are filled with &lt;a href="Japan%27s%20Top%20100%20Cherry%20Blossoms%20Spots"&gt;cherry blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The castle lookout is a good place to envisage exile: &lt;a href="w%3AShiba%20Goro"&gt;w:Shiba Goro&lt;/a&gt; writer of Remembering Aizu left this place of his dreams with the other exiles of the Aizu culture who were made scapegoats for the resistance to the Meiji restoration. Amazon Books has had extensive extracts for free from Remembering Aizu if you want a sample.

When they saw the Tsuruga Castle burning, they thought it had fallen to the enemy, and committed suicide. Their graves are on Mt. Iimoriyama where incense is always burnt on their behalf. Visitors can walk up the many steps to see the graves, or take the escalator for ¥250. There are two Byakkotai memorial museums, including the usual tourist shops.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

♡❤♡Akabeko♡❤♡ - In the local Aizu dialect, "Akabeko" literally means "red cow". Akabeko has become the symbol of the Aizu region due to two local legends. First, during the construction of the Enzo-ji temple, red cows worked tirelessly to help move wood. Second, children who possessed a wooden toy Akabeko survived a plague that killed thousands of children. Wooden Akabekos similar to those featured in the latter legend can be bought. The most common design features a "bobbing" head mechanism where the head of the cow bobs. A large Akabeko can be found outside Aizuwakamatsu train station.

Therefore, Agemanju means deep-frying Japanese style bun stuffed. It is a traditional sweet in Aizuwakamatsu and it is sweet and soft, but it has high calories because of frying. It is especially popular among children and older people. There are a lot of shops which sell Agemanju about ¥100.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h1>Ajaccio</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Ajaccio♡❤♡ (&lt;a href="Corsican%20phrasebook"&gt;Corsican&lt;/a&gt;: ♡❤Aiacciu♡❤) is the capital of the &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; Mediterranean island of &lt;a href="Corsica"&gt;Corsica&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
This is a sun-kissed tourist town with frequent visits by cruise ships. It has a boardwalk along its attractive coastline, but its sky-high prices may detract occasionally from its wonderful weather.

Although the coastline of Ajaccio and its natural harbor was almost certainly visited many times in antiquity, the development of a proper city did not happen until the late 1400s when the Genoese built a citadel that still stands to this day and serves as a military installation for the French army.

After most of Corsica was conquered by the French in the 1700s, Ajaccio remained a Genoese territory until the late 1760s.

Napoleon Bonaparte (Napoleone di Buonaparte) was born in Ajaccio in 1769 just after the city became the capital of Corsica. Although from mostly Italian-Corsican heritage, Napoleon rose through the ranks of the French military to become the leader of France and subsequently Emperor. For a time he also ruled most of Europe.

Ajaccio was one of the last cities to become French in Europe, but it was the first French city to be liberated in 1943 following the fall of the Third Republic in 1940.

Most of Air Corsica/Air France flights depart from &lt;a href="Paris-Orly"&gt;Paris-Orly&lt;/a&gt;, Nice and Marseilles airports throughout the year. Many more French cities are served during the summer season (April–October). Flights can be surprisingly expensive, and often, taking the ferry makes more economic sense, especially when you figure in the cost of taking a car on the ferry versus renting a car once in Corsica. EasyJet, Volotea and XL airways offer direct flights to the city from Paris, other French and European cities. In addition, companies such as Airlinair, Jetairfly, Norwegian and Transavia operates flights from French and European cities during the summer season (April-October).
</ul>
&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; 

<h3>By ferry</h3>
There are direct ferry routes from Ajaccio to &lt;a href="Marseille"&gt;Marseille&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nice"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Toulon"&gt;Toulon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Ciutadella"&gt;Ciutadella&lt;/a&gt;.

Summer seasons are generally busy, and thus it is advisable to book in advance.

<h3>By train</h3>

A single railway line connects Ajaccio with &lt;a href="Bastia"&gt;Bastia&lt;/a&gt; (3½ hours and around &lt;abbr title=" €22 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€22&lt;/abbr&gt; ) on the island's east coast via &lt;a href="Corte"&gt;Corte&lt;/a&gt;. The main railway station, &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q1772418"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Gare d'Ajaccio♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;about north from the city centre.&lt;/bdi&gt;).&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; 

<h3>By bus</h3>
There are frequent &lt;a href="http%3A//www.corsicabus.org/busAjaccio/index.html"&gt;bus routes&lt;/a&gt; to various destinations in Corsica. Most leave from the bus station directly adjacent to the main cruise ship and ferry terminal at Quai L'Herminier. Many city bus lines stop in front of the bus station, and it is easily walkable from the main train station.

<h1>Ajlun</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Ajlun♡❤♡ (also ♡❤Ajloun♡❤) is a city in &lt;a href="Northern%20Jordan"&gt;Northern Jordan&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Ajlun is famous for its castle. The archaeological site is popular for tourists. The surrounding hills are cooler and have more trees than elsewhere in Jordan, making it a pleasant area to spend a day or two.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Buses from &lt;a href="Amman"&gt;Amman&lt;/a&gt; leave from Tabarbour (Mahata Shamal) Bus Station to Ajlun whenever they are full. Your best bet is early in the morning, around 08:00 as they become more scarce as the day progresses.

<h2>Get around</h2>
Ajlun is not a very big town, the bus will drop you off in the center and in order to get to the castle, which is clearly visible from the town perched on a hill, you can either walk the 3 km or take a taxi there. If you plan to travel to Jerash afterward, consider hiring the taxi driver for the full day, or at least make arrangements for the taxi to wait for you or pick you up at a designated time to transport you back to the Aljun bus station. Make sure you set a price in advance.

The castle is located on the top of a mountain just outside the small city of Ajlun. The castle is an interesting maze of passages and levels, and offers a wonderful view of the surrounding area, northwestern Jordan, and off into Galilee.The castle was built in 1184-1885 AD and was one of the few fortresses built to protect the country against Crusader attacks from both the west and the north. It also controlled the area around it, including another of its major objectives, to control the iron mines in the area. The castle is one of the best preserved and most complete examples of medieval Arab-Islamic military architecture.Ajloun Castle dominated the three main routes leading to the Jordan valley and protected the trade and commercial routes between Jordan and Syria, it became an important link in the defensive chain against the Crusaders, who, unsuccessfully spend decades trying to capture the castle and the nearby village.From the top of the castle, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the Jordan Valley and the highlands of north Jordan. Excavations have recently identified a church that was built on the castle site in the earlier Byzantine period, while restoration and conservation works have made all areas of the castle accessible and safe for visitors. It is recommended to bring binoculars, also, the scenery is promised to be beautiful and as much a part of the reason to visit Ajlun Castle as the castle itself!&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;3&amp;nbsp;JD&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h1>Ajman</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Ajman♡❤♡ (&lt;a href="Arabic%20phrasebook"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt;: عجمان ♡❤Ajmān♡❤) is the smallest of the emirates and a city of &lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;. 

<h2>Understand</h2>
Ajman is the smallest of the seven emirates and is centrally located on the western coast of the United Arab Emirates. The Emirate lies on the Gulf coast where its beach extends for 16&amp;nbsp;km, and the total area of Ajman is 259 km³. Its population estimate is about 230 thousand as the year of 2004. The area of the Emirate of Ajman is about 460&amp;nbsp;km. while the total area including the regional waters is about 600&amp;nbsp;km. Ajman City is the capital of the Emirate and lies down at a small creek of 16&amp;nbsp;km. length to the North East of Sharjah.

The ruling family of Ajman is the AL Nuaimi tribe.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Ajman enjoys being located in the middle of the Emirates as a whole. The emirate borders Sharjah and is only 10&amp;nbsp;km away from Dubai in the south and Umm Al Quwain in the north. Many roads lead to and from Ajman from both &lt;a href="Sharjah"&gt;Sharjah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Umm%20al%20Quwain"&gt;Umm al Quwain&lt;/a&gt;.including Emirates Road. Ajman is near to the ports of neighboring Emirates. It is near the international airports of both Sharjah and Dubai. Ajman is planning to build an international airport in the area of Manama. To get to Ajman you can take a taxi from any airport to ajman city, or other wise rent a car and drive there through Emirates Highway. Taxis go to &lt;a href="Sharjah"&gt;Sharjah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;, and also to &lt;a href="Ra%27s%20al%20Khaymah"&gt;Ra's al Khaymah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Umm%20al%20Quwain"&gt;Umm al Quwain&lt;/a&gt;. If you are planning to stay there and use it as base to visit Dubai expect traffic jams at rush hours.

<h2>Get around</h2>

<h3>By taxi</h3>
Taxis are really easy to find and are convenient for getting around in Ajman. Of course taxis can also be used to get to other emirates too. Look for the unmetered Ajman taxi as they offer cheaper prices than the official metered ones, e.g. 10 dirhams to Sharja, 40 dirhams to Dubai (best during the peak times.)

Look out for shared taxis that wait for 4 people to come and take the taxi, where you pay 10 dirhams to Dubai when 4 people are sharing the taxi. These are "unofficial" taxis, located in the Somali area of Ajman.

<h3>By tour bus</h3>
Guided tour buses can be found at top hotels where can arrange a tour to Ajman and main attractions in it.
save your work after visiting, otherwise everything will be recovered and given a chance to be eaten by thambaia

Alcohol is allowed in Ajman and is available easily at hotels and restaurants.

Tap water is considered ok but it has a slightly salted taste. The obvious reason is that desalination plants are used to provide tap water. More to the point, you can safely use it to brush your teeth and prepare tea.

Bottled water is also available in any store around town.

<h1>Ajmer</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Ajmer♡❤♡ is located in &lt;a href="Rajasthan"&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/a&gt;, in western &lt;a href="India"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. It is more popular as a gateway to &lt;a href="Pushkar"&gt;Pushkar&lt;/a&gt; and is connected by Road with &lt;a href="Jaipur"&gt;Jaipur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Delhi"&gt;Delhi&lt;/a&gt;.

This city also has an important Islamic pilgrimage site. The shrine of the Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti is in Ajmer.

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>By train</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- From Delhi - the Delhi-Ahmedabad Mail is a decent overnight train (slow, but it gives you more time to sleep) while the Ajmer Shatabdi Express is the fastest way to get there. There are passenger trains (second unreserved only—definitely an "experience") in the morning and evening to Jaipur and train links down to Ahmedabad. The city is also connected to Udaipur, of which Intercity Express would be a better option.
BULLET::::- From Kolkata - The Sealdah station and the Kolkata(Chitpur) station are well connected to Ajmer Junction. Trains like Ananya express(Sealdah), Sealdah-Ajmer Daily Express and Kolkata(Chitpur)-Ajmer express are trains for Ajmer.

</ul>
<h3>By bus</h3>
Jaipur is 1.5–3&amp;nbsp;hours by road (depending on the type of bus you take)(the Jaipur-Ajmer expressway also known as national highway 8 is a 6 lane road and is fantastic to drive on). Jodhpur is 4–5&amp;nbsp;hours in the opposite direction.

<h3>By taxi</h3>
Various tour operators and travel agencies offer chauffeured car-taxi services; these are charged on a per km, per day basis. You can plan to take one to arrive into the city or take one for sightseeing in and around the city. If you want a decent car for the tour you can hire one from the stand in front of Zilla Parishad Bhawan (district's management headquarters); if you are good at bargaining, it's the best option.

There are also many car rental services which provide chauffeur-driven cars to Ajmer.

<h2>Get around</h2>
Ajmer is a very limited market place, once you get your bearings. Dargah Bazaar is about 15&amp;nbsp;minutes walk from railway station, and Ana Sagar ("lake" - which has marble pavilions in a garden and is a wonderful place to sit, especially on hot days) is about 30 minutes' walk. There are some wonderful back-alleys—just wander down small side streets from Dargah bazaar and you'll see some wonderful old architecture and murals before you stumble back across the main street.

Other than on foot, cycle rickshaws, autorickshaws (who are intent on taking you to Pushkar) and horse-drawn tongas are available for hire (the latter on selected routes only). There are also tempos and mini buses which run between bus stand and railway station and covering most over town - fare was ₹5/person in 2009.

<h1>Akajima</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Akajima♡❤♡ (阿嘉島), also written and pronounced ♡❤Akashima♡❤, is an island belonging to the group of &lt;a href="Kerama%20Islands"&gt;Kerama Islands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Okinawa"&gt;Okinawa&lt;/a&gt; Prefecture, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;. The island is commonly referred to as ♡❤♡Aka♡❤♡ and is popular with tourists from Okinawa and mainland Japan.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Kerama Airport on the neighboring uninhabited island of Fukaji would be easily accessible, but as of 2009 has no scheduled services.

The usual approach is thus to take the high speed ferry from &lt;a href="Naha"&gt;Naha&lt;/a&gt; city on &lt;a href="Okinawa%20Island"&gt;Okinawa Island&lt;/a&gt;. The journey takes about 1 hour and usually makes a stop at the larger &lt;a href="Zamami"&gt;Zamami&lt;/a&gt; island before stopping at Aka Port. There is a cheaper ferry but you will get less time to enjoy the island. Return ferries to Naha usually depart around 17:00 and costs about &amp;yen;3,000.

<h2>Get around</h2>
Aka can easily be explored on foot, bicycle or kayak. The heat can make moving about difficult but there are plenty of opportunities to jump in the sea and cool off.

The islands of Geruma (慶留間), population 81, and Fukaji (外地島), population zero plus the airport, are connected to Akajima by bridge.

<h2>See</h2>
Venture around the island to discover remote beaches. There are 3 observation towers on Aka where you can take photographs of Aka's unspoilt beauty. When leaving Aka Port the locals like to wave goodbye and perform acrobatic dives into the sea. Watch out for the giant Okinawan tree spiders if you take the beaten paths down to the sea. There are also deer that swim between the islands.

<h2>Do</h2>
Snorkel, scuba dive or kayak from any beach and you will soon encounter a rich variety of tropical sea life.

<h2>Buy</h2>
Buy snorkeling equipment before you arrive. Other than food and drink there is not much to buy on Aka.

<h2>Eat</h2>
There is a shack style restaurant near Aka Port but amenities on the island are basic. The locals are extremely friendly and will soon point you in the right direction. If staying at a local guest house you can often eat with your hosts.

<h2>Drink</h2>
There are plenty of drink vending machines on Aka and you can usually get a cold glass of Orion (Okinawan beer) at any place that sells food.

<h2>Sleep</h2>
There are some guest houses and rooms to hire on Aka but no large hotels. Camping on beaches is strictly forbidden, although it's quite acceptable to drink and eat on the beaches until sunrise. You might want to befriend a local Okinawan to help you source accommodation.

<h2>Connect</h2>

<h2>Go next</h2>
After a day on Aka you will not want to leave, but the neighbouring islands within the Kerama Islands group are all worth a visit.

<doc id="429" url="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki?curid=429" title="Akan National Park">
<h1>Akan National Park</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Akan National Park♡❤♡ (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;阿寒公立公園&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤Akan-kokuritsu-kōen♡❤) is a large national park in the eastern part of the &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;ese island of &lt;a href="Hokkaido"&gt;Hokkaido&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>

The park's attractions are its three sparkling clear mountain lakes, the eponymous ♡❤♡Lake Akan♡❤♡ (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;阿寒湖&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤Akan-ko♡❤) to the west, ♡❤♡Lake Mashū♡❤♡ (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;摩周湖&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤Mashū-ko♡❤) to the east and ♡❤♡Lake Kussharo♡❤♡ (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;屈斜路湖&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤Kussharo-ko♡❤) between them. The largest settlement nearby is ♡❤♡Teshikaga♡❤♡ (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;弟子屈&lt;/span&gt; ), to the south of Lakes Kussharo and Mashu.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By plane</h3>
The nearest airports are in &lt;a href="Kushiro"&gt;Kushiro&lt;/a&gt;, an hour and a half to the south, &lt;a href="Nakashibetsu"&gt;Nakashibetsu&lt;/a&gt;, an hour to the east, and &lt;a href="Memanbetsu"&gt;Memanbetsu&lt;/a&gt;, an hour and a half to the north.

<h3>By train</h3>
The ♡❤♡JR Senmō Line♡❤♡ (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;釧網本線&lt;/span&gt; ) runs north-south across the park on its way from &lt;a href="Abashiri"&gt;Abashiri&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Kushiro"&gt;Kushiro&lt;/a&gt;, stopping at Kawayu and Teshikaga (Mashu station).
There are around 4 trains daily to Abashiri (2 hours, &amp;yen;1600) and 6-7 to Kushiro (1:40, &amp;yen;1790).

<h3>By bus</h3>
There are 4 buses daily between Akan and &lt;a href="Kushiro"&gt;Kushiro&lt;/a&gt; station. Infrequent buses connect the lakes to each other and the train station at &lt;a href="Bihoro"&gt;Bihoro&lt;/a&gt;. In season (May-October) bus service is available to Lake Onnetto, serving the Meakan and Akan Fuji trail-heads.

<h2>Get around</h2>
Buses are infrequent and cover only the main routes. A rental car will come in very handy here.

A 2days pass is available at hotels, convenience store and train stations. It gets you around the area with Eco-friendly buses (run on bio diesel fuel) and it's also valid on the JR Senmo line between JR Mashu and JR Kawayuonsen.

A deep volcanic caldera lake, the lookout points are suspended high on cliffs above, and the bonzai-esque appearance of the gnarled trees nearby are a testament to the strong winds that seem to blow incessantly. Often blanketed with a thin layer of fog. Starkly beautiful and worth a visit.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;Parking at &amp;num; &amp;yen;410, parking at #2 free&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

What makes the bumpy trip worthwhile is that the water in the pond is a truly unearthly shade of transparent sapphire blue.

Wakoto♡❤♡ (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;和琴山&lt;/span&gt; ♡❤Wakoto-san♡❤, 266m), jutting out from the southern shore, still bubbles, hisses (and stinks) with geothermal activity. An easy trail runs around the island. Good swimming in the summertime.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
BULLET::::- There are many excellent hikes in the region.
<ul>
BULLET::::- In summertime at the Akan Kohan ski ground (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;阿寒湖畔スキー場&lt;/span&gt; ), there are two interesting short hikes, one 550m, the other 2.2km. The shorter one takes you to a ski slope with an excellent view of Lake Akan, its islands and the surrounding forest. The longer one starts off climbing about 900m up a ski slope before delving into the surrounding forest and taking you past a hot water creek (47 degrees), and several ♡❤bokke♡❤ (&lt;span lang="ain" xml:lang="ain"&gt;ボッケ&lt;/span&gt; ), an Ainu word referring to hot mud caused by volcanism.
BULLET::::- Another hike from the Kawayu Onsen Visitor's Centre to Iwo-san (2.4km) is a very flat and easy but extremely interesting one starting off in luxuriant forest on a moss path before petering out into desert-like scrub as you approach the poisonous vapours of Iwo-san.
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Mt. Meakan♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;雌阿寒岳&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;) (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The most convenient trailhead is next to Nonoka Onsen.&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Mt. Meakan makes for a nice day hike. There are several courses, and this is the simplest. Park your car at the trailhead 50m SW of Nonoka Onsen. The trail starts 50m NE of Nonoka Onsen. The trail goes up and around the back side of the volcanic mountain. On a clear day, there are good views of a pond inside the crater, but this can be covered by steam or clouds. From near the top, a side trail leads to Akan Fuji (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;阿寒富士&lt;/span&gt; ). The loop continues downhill to Onneto (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;オンネトー&lt;/span&gt; ), where you can walk along the road or around the lake to get back to the parking lot. This 8km hike takes 5 hours at a casual speed.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Buy</h2>
On the shore of Lake Akan, the small village of ♡❤♡Ainu Kotan♡❤♡ is home to one of the largest concentrations of Ainu artisans in Hokkaido. There are numerous galleries and studios selling textiles, paintings and carved works for the well-heeled.

<h1>Akaroa</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Akaroa♡❤♡ is a charming harbourside town on the eastern side of Akaroa harbour, in southern &lt;a href="Banks%20Peninsula"&gt;Banks Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="Canterbury%20%28New%20Zealand%29"&gt;Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="New%20Zealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. Its early settlers were French and British. It was the only French settlement in New Zealand. Aspects of its French heritage remain, such as names of streets and businesses.

"Akaroa" is Maori for "Long Harbour". The village is snuggled into a wide bay on the eastern side of the rugged harbour, with Onuku Marae a little further south. The permanent population of around 700 in this historic village swells significantly over summer. Akaroa's harbour is home to an array of wildlife, most notably the rare Hector's dolphin. Cruises and dolphin swimming are popular attractions.

<h2>Get in</h2>

Akaroa is a tender port for cruise ships anchored in the harbour. Tenders bring passengers to the shallow-water main wharf in the centre of town. The small town can be easily walked and explored in several hours. To get to the centre of town, walk north on Beach Rd with the French Bay waters on your left for about 10 minutes to get to Rue Balguerie.

Akaroa is the base port for excursions to Christchurch (the port of &lt;a href="Lyttelton"&gt;Lyttelton&lt;/a&gt; has been closed to cruise ships since being badly damaged in the 2011 earthquake). Christchurch city is 1.5 hours drive away. Shuttle services: Akaroa Shuttle (white and red) and French Connection (CityLine) buses to Christchurch leave from the main wharf.

&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Akashi♡❤♡ (&lt;span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"&gt;明石&lt;/span&gt; ) is a city in &lt;a href="Hyogo"&gt;Hyogo&lt;/a&gt; prefecture, &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, to the west of &lt;a href="Kobe"&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Despite its name, the ♡❤♡Akashi-Kaikyō Bridge♡❤♡ (明石海峡大橋) is not in Akashi. This longest suspension bridge in the world connects &lt;a href="Awaji%20Island"&gt;Awaji Island&lt;/a&gt; to Honshu via the city of &lt;a href="Kobe"&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Akashi is on the JR Sanyō Main Line between &lt;a href="Kobe"&gt;Kobe&lt;/a&gt; (15 min from Sannomiya) and &lt;a href="Himeji"&gt;Himeji&lt;/a&gt; (25 min).

To the south is the Sanyo Akashi Station, run by the private company Sanyo Electric Railway. It is on the Sanyo Electric Railway Main Line which connect Himeji to Kobe and runs parallel to the JR line.

The Shinkansen passes through Akashi at Nishi-Akashi (西明石) station. The ♡❤Kodama♡❤, ♡❤Hikari♡❤, and some eastbound ♡❤Nozomi♡❤ trains stop here.

&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Akçakoca♡❤♡ is a small town in the &lt;a href="Western%20Karadeniz"&gt;Western Karadeniz&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Get in</h2>
♡❤♡Buses♡❤♡ from &lt;a href="Istanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Zonguldak"&gt;Zonguldak&lt;/a&gt; call at town's ♡❤otogar♡❤ (bus station). ♡❤Otogar♡❤ is about 2 km east of town centre but your bus company provides free shuttle minibuses that will take you to downtown. Bus ride takes about three and a half hours from Istanbul.

The town is connected to main Turkish ♡❤♡highway♡❤♡ system by a quite winding road to &lt;a href="D%C3%BCzce"&gt;Düzce&lt;/a&gt;, where it joins the motorway ♡❤♡O-4/E80♡❤♡ and highway ♡❤♡D100♡❤♡, both of which connect &lt;a href="Istanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Ankara"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt;, two largest cities of Turkey. From both Istanbul and Ankara, it takes more or less around 3 hours to get to Düzce, which is a further half hour away from Akçakoca.

<h2>Get around</h2>
A public bus line connects downtown (♡❤çarşı♡❤) to the bus station (♡❤otogar♡❤) with a de-tour through the old town.

However beautiful and peaceful the place nowadays may be, there is a tragic love story behind the name of the place, which literally translates "Hasan was drowned": Hasan, a young farmer from the lowland village of Zeytinli, fell in love with Emine, a sturdy maiden from the nomadic tribes of the mountain. As a marriage between a sedentary farmer and a nomad was frowned upon, there was no way for Emine to move into Hasan's village, and as such Hasan would have to move to the upland pastures. Emine's family set a condition for Hasan to fulfill, so that he could prove that he would be hardy enough to overcome an austere mountain lifestyle: He had to carry 50 kg of pure salt over the mountains to Emine's tribe. Having failed the objection by knocking down at the halfway, Hasan committed a suicide in one of the ponds in what is now Hasanboğuldu. Emine, upon hearing the death of her lover, has also committed a suicide as well, by hanging herself on one of the plane trees next to the pond.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

♡❤♡Akeanon♡❤♡ (also ♡❤♡Aklanon♡❤♡) is a language spoken in the &lt;a href="Philippines"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, mainly in northern parts of &lt;a href="Panay"&gt;Panay&lt;/a&gt;.

Aklanon is unique among Philippine languages since it possesses the digraph ea ("l" pronounced with rolling "r" sound). According to legend, the digraph originated from the first ruler of &lt;a href="Aklan"&gt;Aklan&lt;/a&gt;, Datu Bangkaya, who had a short tongue and therefore could not pronounce the "l" sound.

Akeanon tongue-twisters:

<h1>Akershus</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Akershus♡❤♡ is a county in &lt;a href="East%20Norway"&gt;East Norway&lt;/a&gt;, west and east of the capital, &lt;a href="Oslo"&gt;Oslo&lt;/a&gt;. Oslo and Akershus make up one contiguous metropolitan area with 25 % of Norway's population and the visitor can regard it as one city. &lt;a href="Oslo%20Airport%2C%20Gardermoen"&gt;Oslo Airport&lt;/a&gt; sits at Gardermoen on the flatlands near &lt;a href="Jessheim"&gt;Jessheim&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to Oslo Airport, Akershus hosts major Norway's major roads (E6, E18, E16) as well as all railway lines to/from Oslo.

<h2>Regions</h2>
Akershus is historically divided into the traditional districts of &lt;a href="Follo"&gt;Follo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Romerike"&gt;Romerike&lt;/a&gt;, which make up most of the county, with the exception of the enclave west of Oslo, consisting of Asker and Bærum, which was created after Aker municipality was transferred to Oslo in 1948.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Oslo and Akershus make up one contiguous metropolitan area and the visitor can regard it as one city. Large parts of Akershus are effectively suburbs for Oslo and also home to an important industrial and business districts. Only the eastern and northern agricultural districts of Akershus are clearly not part of the metropolis. Oslo airport sits at Gardermoen on the flatlands near Jessheim. The two counties combined are home to about 25 % of Norway's population. Oslo and Akershus has a joint governor.

Akershus landscape is relatively flat or gentle hills. Norway's largest rivers flows through and the county is home to a couple of major lakes and countless smaller lakes. There is also some rugged, low altitude terrain in Bærum and in Østmarka (east Oslo forrest).

<h2>Get around</h2>
Rental cars and taxis are often available, but are rather expensive in Norway in general. The public transportation system is relatively good with buses going between the major cities and stopping at bus stops marked with a sign (blue with a white bus on it, rectangular) and/or an open air booth with the place name written above with white lettering. Public transport is reasonably inexpensive though costs can build up if you buy tickets every time you get on, day/week/month/season passes can be purchased at the major stops. At the central bus station in any town, cashiers will speak English. For local buses, see http://ruter.no

<h2>Drink</h2>
Norway has high water quality and tap water is completely safe. If you still want bottled water, most stores carry several brands of non-artificially treated water.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>

Most areas in Akershus are more or less crime free, and you should not be afraid to walk around alone day or night, though you should always take precationary measures and follow your common sense when in a new country. Signs and maps are usually in Norwegian, but do not be afraid to ask for directions; the vast majority of Norwegians speak enough English to help out a lost tourist.

<h1>Akhaltsikhe</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Akhaltsikhe♡❤♡ (&lt;a href="Georgian%20phrasebook"&gt;Georgian&lt;/a&gt;: ახალციხე, "New Fortress") is a small city of about 50,000 and the capital of &lt;a href="Samtskhe-Javakheti"&gt;Samtskhe-Javakheti&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>

The city has been around for at least 800 years, and was the seat of the House of Akhaltsikhe, dukes of Samtskhe, for several centuries. In 1576 the Ottomans took the city; they built most of the old buildings a tourist can see here. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 Russians captured the city. Until the 20th century Akhaltsikhe was mostly Armenian, but today around 27% are Armenians and the rest are Georgians. There is some language tension between city inhabitants.

It's a rather sleepy town, but its Old City and Old Turkish baths are worth a visit, and it's a great base for exploring the surrounding areas, including Sapara Monastery in the immediate vicinity and &lt;a href="Vardzia"&gt;Vardzia&lt;/a&gt; to the south with Khertvisi and Tmogvi Fortresses along the way.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By marshrutka</h3>
All marshrutkas from major Georgian cities stop at &lt;a href="Borjomi"&gt;Borjomi&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href="Khashuri"&gt;Khashuri&lt;/a&gt; bus station. Hence, if you missed you ride, it's not terribly difficult to catch a marshrutka going between Akhaltsikhe and Khashuri before dinner time.

From specific destinations:
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Tbilisi"&gt;Tbilisi&lt;/a&gt; (Didube bus station): 08:00–19:00 hourly (10 lari)
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Kutaisi"&gt;Kutaisi&lt;/a&gt;: 08:20, 13:00 (12 lari)
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Batumi"&gt;Batumi&lt;/a&gt; (old bus station near Batumi train station): 08:30,~10:30 (20 lari, 5½-6 hr)
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Borjomi"&gt;Borjomi&lt;/a&gt;: several daily (3 lari)
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Vardzia"&gt;Vardzia&lt;/a&gt;: ~09:00?, 13:00, 15:00 (5 lari)

</ul>
There are few direct marshrutkas from/to &lt;a href="Yerevan"&gt;Yerevan&lt;/a&gt;, ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Armenia"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, or several connections from Armenia when making a stopover in &lt;a href="Akhalkalaki"&gt;Akhalkalaki&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a daily connection from &lt;a href="Gyumri"&gt;Gyumri&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at 10:00 (3.5 hr, 4,000 dram).

<h3>By thumb</h3>
The direct road from &lt;a href="Batumi"&gt;Batumi&lt;/a&gt; to Akhaltsikhe is not served by marshrutkas, probably due its bad state and the mountain pass. Nevertheless, you should be able to catch a (4WD) ride on that road. But it will be bumpy and probably still take at least 4 hr.

<h3>By car</h3>
The principal route to Akhaltsikhe runs from Georgia's main East-West highway (E60) at the spur in &lt;a href="Khashuri"&gt;Khashuri&lt;/a&gt; leading to &lt;a href="Borjomi"&gt;Borjomi&lt;/a&gt;.

There's also a route from Batumi via Gorzerdzi pass (4WD needed, closed in winter, scenic views).

<h2>Get around</h2>
Most of the centre can be explored on foot. However, the highway between Borjomi and Vardzia is about 2 km east of the centre and 2.5-3 km east of the castle.

Until the twentieth century, the monastery had been perfectly preserved, as its hidden location saved it from Ottoman discovery throughout the empire's three-century long control of southwestern Georgia. Alas, the Soviets found it, and abused it in the usual soulless fashion, albeit not to the same extent as many other Georgian Orthodox establishments&amp;mdash;the frescoed walls were not whitewashed, and remain in good condition (especially following a recent restoration). During a visit, make sure to climb up the nearby slopes towards a rocky outcropping to get lovely views over the monastery and the valleys in the distance. Also make sure not to use flash photography in the churches, unless you want to see some seriously angry monks. If you can make yourself understood, you can overnight in the monastery's chambers.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

The outcrop was used as a fortress from the second century BC, and was reputedly destroyed by Alexander the Great. The "modern" fortress, however, was built around the thirteenth-fourteenth centuries, and saw fighting during the Ottoman invasion (and subsequent occupation) in the sixteenth century. The walls on the far side drop down a sheer cliff to the Mtkvari far below, so if you fancy a bout of vertigo, pull yourself up and look straight down.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;5 lari&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h3>Inside Georgia</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Vardzia"&gt;Vardzia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; the cliff-side cave monastery, a former city, is the biggest reason to visit Akhaltsikhe, and the region more generally. A round trip by taxi from Akhaltsikhe might cost about 50-60 lari (or marshrutka 5 lari one way).
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Akhalkalaki"&gt;Akhalkalaki&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; the center of Armenian culture in Georgia is nearby to the southwest, easily accessible via marshrutka from Akhaltsikhe.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Borjomi"&gt;Borjomi&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; every Soviet traveller’s favourite Georgian retreat, for its parks, Romanov palace, and internationally renowned natural mineral water.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Khashuri"&gt;Khashuri&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; an interesting small town with an abundance of hammocks.

</ul>
<h3>Outside Georgia</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Armenia"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; There are two marshrutkas to &lt;a href="Yerevan"&gt;Yerevan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Armenia"&gt;Armenia&lt;/a&gt;, at 04:00 and 07:00 (35 lari). If you miss them, go to &lt;a href="Akhalkalaki"&gt;Akhalkalaki&lt;/a&gt;, from where marshrutkas leave to Yerevan almost every hour.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; You can buy bus tickets to Turkey from the central bus station. Ticket to Posof (city on the Turkish side) is US$10 and leaves at 14:30 (could not be confirm in May 2019). There's a bus to &lt;a href="Kars"&gt;Kars&lt;/a&gt; with Kars Vipturizm 4449188. It goes Wednesday and Sunday at 13:00 and costs 70 TL (or 35 lari) (May 2019). Hitching to &lt;a href="Kars"&gt;Kars&lt;/a&gt; is also a very easy option and can be done in far less than a day. From the central bus station, ask for the road to the Turkish border (♡❤Turetskoĭ granitsy♡❤) and start flagging cars about 1 km from the bus station down the road. The road will pass through the small town of Vale. You are able to walk across the border.

<doc id="445" url="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki?curid=445" title="Akita">
<h1>Akita</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Akita♡❤♡ (秋田) is the capital of &lt;a href="Akita%20%28prefecture%29"&gt;Akita prefecture&lt;/a&gt; in the northern &lt;a href="Tohoku"&gt;Tohoku&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Honshu"&gt;Honshu&lt;/a&gt; island.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Akita is the largest city in the prefecture, and as such is the hub for transportation, sports, and shopping. Its longitude is about the middle of the prefecture, and so is reachable from both the north and south.

<h3>Climate</h3>

&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Climate/style.css" /&gt;

In Akita, late June to late July is the rainy season. The spring and summer before and after that tend to have fairly moderate amounts of rain, and are good for outdoor activities. In November, it is common for some cold weather thunder storms to occur—this is said to mark the end of fall and the beginning of ♡❤hatahata♡❤ (a local fish) season. In the winter, Akita sees some snow, though certainly inland areas get more.

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>By plane</h3>
Akita has an airport, with domestic flights coming in from such places as &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nagoya"&gt;Nagoya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Osaka"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Sapporo"&gt;Sapporo&lt;/a&gt;. Buses connect the airport with Akita Station (秋田駅) -- a ride costs ¥980 and takes 40&amp;nbsp;minutes.

<h3>By train</h3>
Akita can be reached by Shinkansen (bullet train) along the Akita Shinkansen Line (秋田新幹線). ♡❤Komachi♡❤ (こまち) trains are available from either Tokyo or Ueno stations in Tokyo and make stops at Omiya, &lt;a href="Sendai"&gt;Sendai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Morioka"&gt;Morioka&lt;/a&gt; before slowing down to travel to Shizukuishi, Tazawako, &lt;a href="Kakunodate"&gt;Kakunodate&lt;/a&gt;, Omagari (where it changes direction), and finally Akita over conventional rail lines. The trip takes just under four hours and costs about 10,000 yen in a standard class car.

When the Akita Shinkansen runs on conventional lines it slows down to regular train speeds and it will stop several times to allow other trains to pass. This will be a bit of a disappointing shock after zooming through northern Japan at top speeds as far as Morioka. In return, the views from the slowed down of the interior of Tohoku are beautiful.

Beware that the Komachi trains are coupled to &lt;a href="Aomori"&gt;Aomori&lt;/a&gt;-bound Hayate trains, which split at Morioka, but as all seats are reserved the chance of getting in the wrong car is minimal at best. For foreign tourists traveling from Tokyo, the better deal is to purchase a ♡❤♡JR East Rail Pass♡❤♡ or the national ♡❤♡Japan Rail Pass♡❤♡.

The ♡❤Nihonkai♡❤ (日本海、Japanese for 'Sea of Japan') overnight train from &lt;a href="Osaka"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Kyoto"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt; stops in Akita before terminating in &lt;a href="Aomori"&gt;Aomori&lt;/a&gt;. The ♡❤Akebono♡❤ (あけぼの、Japanese for 'daybreak') overnight sleeper train from Tokyo's &lt;a href="Tokyo/Ueno"&gt;Ueno&lt;/a&gt; stations also stops at Akita. Both the Nihonkai and the Akebono are now only seasonal trains. If you get an opportunity these are great transport options. Overnight trains in Japan, once very common, have been in decline for years now and may not be around for much longer. Catch it while you can!

<h3>By bus</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- JR Bus operates the ♡❤Dream Akita-Yokohama♡❤ overnight bus to Akita from the bus terminal at &lt;a href="Yokohama"&gt;Yokohama&lt;/a&gt; Station (9 3/4&amp;nbsp;hours, ¥9,500) and from &lt;a href="Tokyo"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; Station (8 3/4&amp;nbsp;hours, ¥9,100).
BULLET::::- Odakyu and Akita Chuo Kotsu run the ♡❤Flora♡❤ overnight bus from &lt;a href="Tokyo/Shinjuku"&gt;Shinjuku&lt;/a&gt; (8&amp;nbsp;hours, ¥9,450).
BULLET::::- The ♡❤Senshuu♡❤ daytime bus runs from &lt;a href="Sendai"&gt;Sendai&lt;/a&gt; with multiple departures (3 1/2&amp;nbsp;hours, ¥4,000).

Two ferries go to &lt;a href="Hokkaido"&gt;Hokkaido&lt;/a&gt; -- one to &lt;a href="Otaru"&gt;Otaru&lt;/a&gt;, and the other to &lt;a href="Tomakomai"&gt;Tomakomai&lt;/a&gt;. Both of those towns are relatively close to &lt;a href="Sapporo"&gt;Sapporo&lt;/a&gt;. To the south the ferries go to &lt;a href="Niigata"&gt;Niigata&lt;/a&gt;, and also to &lt;a href="Tsuruga"&gt;Tsuruga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Maizuru"&gt;Maizuru&lt;/a&gt; (which are roughly near &lt;a href="Kyoto"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;). Reservations can be made in English by email. For Golden Week and busy times, ferries fill up weeks or months in advance. These ferries accommodate passengers with or without vehicles, though the ferry terminals may be inconveniently located for passengers on foot.
</ul>
&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; 

<h2>Get around</h2>
You can get around by bus, taxi, car, or bike. Many bus routes start in front of Akita Station. In the winter, there can be snow and ice, so drivers should decrease their speed.

On the 2nd level of the JR Akita train station is a Tourist Information office. From there you can organize free bicycles.

The park hosts a replica of a watchtower of ♡❤♡Kubota Castle♡❤♡, the original having been constructed in 733AD. For a small admission fee, the lower floors of the castle contain a small museum, and the upper floor provides a panoramic view of the city.

<h2>Eat</h2>

The most well-known Akita dish is ♡❤♡kiritanpo♡❤♡. Kiritanpo is essentially a tube made of rice, generally formed around a disposable chopstick. It is often roasted, sometimes after being smothered in miso paste. It is also eaten in ♡❤♡kiritanpo nabe♡❤♡, a stew of sliced kiritanpo, vegetables, and chicken or fish, most commonly eaten during the winter. Of course, there are many non-local styles of food available in Akita City, including a wide variety of ramen and Indian restaurants.

An onsen is a real hot spring with the water heated by the earth itself, rather than a heater. The mind boggles to think about how they get it up to the roof, but it's magic in winter as you sit in the hot water with snow falling on you.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;8000 yen&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

Right in the centre of town, connected to the station and on the upper floors of one of Akita's tallest buildings giving guests a nice view from the rooms. Toyoko Inns are, in general, very uniform affairs. They're basic, cheap and clean and you get a free, basic Japanese breakfast in the mornings. They also have an English booking site, which is nice, though don't expect the staff to speak English.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;5000 - 6000 yen&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Stay safe</h2>
There are bears in Akita. You won't find one trundling along Chuo Odori outside Akita Station, but visitors who are in Akita to enjoy its semi-rural outskirts such as Akita Onsen or the Our Lady of Akita Convent should familiarise themselves with bear safety. You will see signs scattered around warning of bear danger but if you cannot read Japanese they won't be much good to you. It's always best to assume that bears may be in the area, including in the colder months.

The Asian black bear is a retiring kind of beast. It's unlikely to bother you if you don't bother it and for that reason its best to avoid startling a bear, so make noise as you walk and keep a look out. Having said that, it could easily maul you to death so caution is advised. See &lt;a href="Dangerous%20animals"&gt;Dangerous animals&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<h2>Understand</h2>

Akita is the original home of the ♡❤♡Akita dog♡❤♡ (♡❤Akita inu♡❤), the famously loyal dog of &lt;a href="Tokyo/Shibuya"&gt;Hachiko&lt;/a&gt; fame. In 2010, the prefecture's population was just over 1 million people.

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>By plane</h3>

<h3>By train</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The ♡❤♡Akita Shinkansen♡❤♡ provides hourly service from Tokyo station to Akita station. Trains are all-reserved and are known as ♡❤Komachi♡❤ (こまち) trains. The trains only stop at Ueno, Omiya, &lt;a href="Sendai"&gt;Sendai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Morioka"&gt;Morioka&lt;/a&gt; before slowing down to travel to Shizukuishi, Tazawako, &lt;a href="Kakunodate"&gt;Kakunodate&lt;/a&gt;, Omagari, and finally Akita over conventional rail lines. Trains also reverse direction once at Omagari, the stop before Akita. Komachi trains from Tokyo reach Akita in four hours and cost ¥16,800 each way. Beware that the Komachi trains are coupled to &lt;a href="Aomori"&gt;Aomori&lt;/a&gt;-bound Hayate trains, which split at Morioka, but as all seats are reserved the chance of getting in the wrong car is minimal at best. For foreign tourists traveling from Tokyo, the better deal is to purchase a ♡❤♡JR East Rail Pass♡❤♡ or the national ♡❤♡Japan Rail Pass♡❤♡.
BULLET::::- The ♡❤Akebono♡❤ overnight sleeper train from Tokyo's &lt;a href="Tokyo/Ueno"&gt;Ueno&lt;/a&gt; station, and the ♡❤Nihonkai♡❤ from &lt;a href="Osaka"&gt;Osaka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Kyoto"&gt;Kyoto&lt;/a&gt;, stop in Akita before terminating in &lt;a href="Aomori"&gt;Aomori&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<h3>By bus</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- JR Tohoku Bus operate a long distance bus ♡❤♡Dream Akita/Yokohama Express♡❤♡ from Tokyo and Yokohama. It leaves daily from Tokyo station southern Yaesu exit at 9:50PM (8:55PM from Yokohama station east bus terminal), and arrive Akita station at 6:35AM the following day. ¥9,100 single (¥9,500 from Yokohama).

</ul>
<h2>Get around</h2>

<h2>Talk</h2>
Few people speak English in Akita. If you don't speak Japanese well, factor this into consideration when planning.

The dialect of Japanese spoken in Akita is called ♡❤Akita-ben♡❤. While the accent isn't particularly strong in most of the area, in rural areas it can be very heavily used and consequently incomprehensible even to native Japanese speakers.

<h2>See</h2>

<h2>Do</h2>

<h2>Eat</h2>
Akita's weather and clean water are said to be ideal for growing rice, and the local ♡❤komachi♡❤ variety is prized throughout the country.

Perhaps the most well-known Akita dish is ♡❤kiritanpo♡❤. Kiritanpo is essentially a tube made of rice, generally formed around a disposable chopstick. It is often roasted, sometimes after being smothered in miso paste. It is also eaten in ♡❤kiritanpo nabe♡❤, a stew of sliced kiritanpo, vegetables, and chicken or fish, most commonly eaten during the winter.

Though consumed throughout Japan, Akita's &lt;a href="Oga"&gt;Oga Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; is known for ♡❤inago♡❤, a sweet teriyaki-like dish made of grasshoppers cooked in sake, soy sauce, and sugar.

In late winter, ♡❤hata hata♡❤, or sailfin sunfish is popular, usually cooked in a stew. It has a strong flavor, and females with intact egg pouches are most prized.

<h2>Drink</h2>
Akita's famed komachi rice is used to brew many different varieties of sake, some of which are popular throughout Japan. Many of Akita's towns have a local sake brewery, some of which offer tours.

On the outskirts of &lt;a href="Kakunodate"&gt;Kakunodate&lt;/a&gt; is the Tazawako Brewery. This microbrewery brews a handful of craft beers, and contains a restaurant with all the brewery's beers on tap.
