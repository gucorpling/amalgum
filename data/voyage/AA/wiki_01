<h1>Abu Dhabi</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.abudhabitourism.ae/"&gt;Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is the federal capital and the seat of the three branches of government of the &lt;a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;. It is the largest city of the &lt;a href="Abu%20Dhabi%20%28emirate%29"&gt;Emirate of Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt;. 

The city is essentially a collection of islands connected together and features colossal monuments, elegant museums, green boulevards, high-rise buildings, international luxury hotel chains and opulent shopping malls.

<h2>Understand</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
Abu Dhabi is the capital and seat of the government of the United Arab Emirates, hence it is the go-to destination for any major political event or ministerial headquarters. The city was not intended to be the capital of the UAE. The capital of the UAE was supposed to be a planned city between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and was to be called 'Al Karama' (which means dignity in Arabic) as stated in the first version of the constitution. However, considering the earlier stage of the union was a volatile time, with multiple issues and various ordeals occurring, Abu Dhabi was made the temporary capital as it was the home of the UAE founding father Sheikh Zayed. Later stage, Abu Dhabi was declared to be the permanent capital of the UAE by the agreement of the rest of the seven UAE founding fathers. The capital and the seat of the three branches of the government was set to be in the Abu Dhabi Capital District, while the rest of the city would continue to be a city catered to the native population and residents. Abu Dhabi is also the headquarters of the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces, with an enormous walled city outside of Abu Dhabi called Sheikh Zayed Military City hosting the defensive headquarters of the military. As a result, it is a common sight to see Emiratis in military fatigue around the city. Non-Emiratis are strictly forbidden from entering any military building except with prior authorization.

<h3>People</h3>

Many international companies, diplomatic outposts, and embassies are based in Abu Dhabi. The city has a population of approximately 1.5 million residents, while the native population forms the minority with approximately only 420,000 UAE nationals in the entire emirate. In a bid to attract foreign investors and urban planners, the city followed in Dubai's footsteps by forming tax-free zones, loosened Islamic laws, and increased real estate sales to expatriates. As a diplomatic center of the government, various monuments and museums were built. The most recognizable icon is the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque which is a common visiting site for tourists and diplomats. The mosque allows non-Muslims to enter and explore the Islamic architecture of the mosque. Various monuments honoring Emirati achievements also exist, with the most commonly recognized the Oasis of Dignity (called Wahat Al Karama locally). The large monument faces the mosque and has the names of fallen Emirati soldiers inscribed in the memorial.

<h3>Diplomacy</h3>
In order to build the international status of the city as a diplomacy center, the UAE government formed very close relationship with other governments; most recognizably France and the United States. As a result, a lot of American-based companies and personnel are based in the city. The American embassy is the largest embassy in Abu Dhabi and almost recognizable as a landmark with its triangular design, as well as Abu Dhabi airport is one of the few airports which allows pre-clearance immigration to the United States; allowing travelers to enter the US as domestic US travelers.

The official language of Abu Dhabi and the rest of the UAE is Arabic, however English is the ♡❤de facto lingua franca♡❤, and almost everyone speaks it. All signs are bilingual in Arabic and English and the city's atmosphere is very friendly to visitors. Occasionally, foreign head of states visit Abu Dhabi, so seeing roads lined with flags of various countries is a common sight. Seeing F-16 fighter jets flying over the skies of Abu Dhabi is also a common sight, as a major UAE-US airbase (Al Dhafrah airbase) is near the city and sometimes jets escort foreign dignitaries traveling to the UAE. The city's vibe changes depending on which foreign head of state visits it. The city was decorated with Chinese flags and the red color when the Chinese president visited, while the city was garnished with yellow and white when Pope Francis visited. The UAE flag is almost always everywhere, decorated with the red-white-black-green colors decorating the streets, buildings, tunnels, and skyscrapers.

<h3>Entertainment</h3>
The city has also been expanding its entertainment industry vastly, creating massive projects such as Formula 1 track, the Ferrari World theme park, and Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi. There are several museums, such as the Louvre Abu Dhabi, Guggenheim museum (under construction), and the UAE's national museum - Zayed Museum (under construction).

The city is also a frequent host of Judo competitions by the International Judo Federation, Formula One races, and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) championships. The city also hosts the finals of the UAE football Pro-League as well as Asian Federation Cup games in Sheikh Zayed Sports Stadium.

<h3>Climate</h3>

&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Climate/style.css" /&gt;

The city has an arid climate, with very hot temperatures in the summer. Annual precipitation totals .

<h3>Orientation</h3>

Most of Abu Dhabi is on a wedged-shaped island connect by two bridges to the mainland, and two other bridges to other islands which also eventually connect to the mainland.

Street addresses in Abu Dhabi are simultaneously very logical and hopelessly confusing. Many roads have traditional names, like "Airport Rd", which may not correspond to the official names, like "Maktoum St", and the city is divided into traditional districts like "Khalidiyya". However, the city has been split up into numbered "zones" and "sectors", with all roads in each sector numbered, First St, Second St, etc., and the vast majority of street signs only refer to these. The system of main streets is straight forward enough once you realize that the odd numbered streets run across the island and the even numbers run along it. So First St is in fact the Corniche, and the odd numbers continue out of town to 31st St which is near the new Khalifa Park. Airport Rd is Second St and the even numbers continue to the east through to 10th St by Abu Dhabi Mall. On the west side of Airport Rd, the numbers go from 22nd Street to 32nd St by the new Bateem Marina. Alas, confusion is caused by the local streets, which are on green signs (main streets are on blue signs) and are also called First, Second, etc. Most locals opt to ignore the system entirely, and the best way to give instructions is thus navigating by landmarks, if taking a taxi, odds are you will get to "behind the Hilton Baynunah" much faster than "Fifth Street, Sector 2". Thankfully, GPS and Google Maps have made life much easier. Using ride-share apps or even telling the name where you want to go to a taxi driver will let them immediately know where exactly you want to be dropped.

<h4>Abu Dhabi International Airport</h4>

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q643562"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Abu Dhabi International Airport♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;&lt;b&gt; AUH &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;The UAE's second busiest airport (after Dubai) and the home base of Abu Dhabi's flag carrier &lt;a href="http%3A//www.etihadairways.com/"&gt;Etihad Airways&lt;/a&gt;. Etihad Airways has been expanding rapidly and now flies from many locations from Australia to Europe and the United States.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
The airport is separated into Terminal 1 (the original terminal), Terminal 3 (a new terminal mostly dedicated to Etihad Airways), and a smaller Terminal 2.

Terminal 1 provides a slightly dingy appearance and a spectacularly bizarre blue-lime tiled mushroom canopy that awaits you at the gates.

Terminal 2 has no aerobridges, relying on buses to take passengers to and from their planes.

Terminal 3 is much newer and has improved shopping and gate access. All flights from terminal 3 are Etihad, but not all Etihad flights leave from Terminal 3. In particular, flights to and from the US use the older terminal.

A fourth major terminal is expected to open in 2019.

<ul>
BULLET::::- Al Ghazal taxis travel to the city at a flat rate of 75 dirham and take around 40 minutes.
BULLET::::- Metered taxis are now allowed to pick up passengers at the airport. A trip into Abu Dhabi city center will cost 60-70 dirham. Metered taxis can also bring passengers to the airport. The taxi stand is at the end of a long walkway from the main terminal. Passengers must turn left when leaving the arrivals area and travel through a long passageway to the curb area, where a covered platform next to the taxi stand is provided. Expect long lines at the taxi stand during the evening and late night hours.
BULLET::::- Public bus route A1 also heads to the city every 30–45 minutes 24 hours a day, and costs 3 dirham. This leaves from outside T3: Go to the lower level and spot the Etihad busses right in front of you. 10 metres on the right is a sign saying "Bus Stop". The Etihad bus and the public bus use the same bus stops, the public bus will just stop as the very first one of the line. Be warned, that airport information may say that there is no public bus, and to take a taxi. The bus used to depart from the upper level but due to traffic it was changed to the lower level. The terminus in the city is Al Ittihad Square bus station, next to the British Embassy.
BULLET::::- If you are flying on Etihad or some partner airlines, complimentary shuttle buses are provided at regular intervals to &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Al%20Ain"&gt;Al Ain&lt;/a&gt; (you should book these at least 24 hours in advance through &lt;a href="https%3A//www.etihad.com/en/plan-and-book/book-etihad-express/"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;). These depart from the main car park at the front of the airport, by the car hire offices: follow the Etihad Shuttle signs. In Dubai, you can also check in at the Etihad Travel Centre, that is close to Noor Bank station.
BULLET::::- Ethiad first and business class passengers can avail complimetary Mercedes chaffuer service under similar conditions as the bus fron &lt;a href="https%3A//www.etihad.com/en/plan-and-book/book-chauffeur/"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; to/from anywhere in the UAE.

</ul>
<h4>Dubai International Airport</h4>
A viable alternative is to fly to Dubai International Airport (&lt;b&gt; DXB &lt;/b&gt; ) in the neighbouring emirate of &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; and continue onward by bus or by taxi.

♡❤♡To/from Dubai airport:♡❤♡
<ul>
BULLET::::- A metered Dubai airport taxi direct to the Abu Dhabi city centre will cost about 300 dirham.
BULLET::::- To get a bus, you will have to go to one of several bus stations in Dubai to catch the Emirates Express to Abu Dhabi. See &lt;a href="%23By%20bus"&gt;By bus&lt;/a&gt; section below.

</ul>
<h3>By road</h3>
The five-laned E11 highway between &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; and Abu Dhabi is the country's heaviest-traveled route, and the 130-km journey can be covered in about 1 hour and 20 minutes. While there is a national speed limit of 120 km/h, you can speed up to 140 km/h without triggering speed cameras. This speed is wildly exceeded by some drivers. Stay out of the leftmost lane and drive carefully, especially at night. E11 is the longest highway in the Emirates.

If you rent a car in Abu Dhabi, chances are that the car will warn you if go above 120 km/h. Depending on the vehicle, it might just be a flashing light or an accompanying, continuous, shrill beep. If you get annoyed by this, you might not want to exceed 120 km/h.

To travel directly into Abu Dhabi from Dubai on E11, keep to your left at Al Shahama and follow the E10 highway, which passes Yas Island (exit at the E12 highway) and Al Raha Beach on the way to the Sheikh Zayed Bridge into Abu Dhabi. This bridge connects directly to Salam Street (8th Street), a wide megahighway along the northern shore of Abu Dhabi Island. As an alternative to the Zayed Bridge, there are ramps off E10 that connect to the Maqta Bridge, which leads to 2nd Street (Airport Road) and to 4th Street (East Road or Muroor Road). During off-peak periods, these routes run fairly quickly into the city.

<h3>Parking</h3>

Parking within the city is monitored by Mawaqif, which also supply the parking meters. Parking meters have displays in English and Arabic. The minimum fee is usually 2-4 dirham.

Finding a parking in main island of Abu Dhabi is a disaster. Parking spaces are extremely limited and most are parking designated for specific institutions. You are more likely to save time if you Uber or take a taxi to your destination instead of driving as finding a parking can take you hours. If you end up finding a parking, you'll have to walk a long way to reach your destination. Most people who own cars but live in mainland Abu Dhabi deliberately use taxis to get around due to the parking shortage. On the brighter side, shopping malls usually have free of charge underground parking with lots of parking spaces. Some close to door parking spaces are designated for electric or hybrid cars only as an incentive to drive electric cars.

Parking areas in Abu Dhabi are clearly marked; yellow and grey for no parking, blue and black for standard fare, and blue and white for premium fare.

<h3>By bus</h3>
You can get into Abu Dhabi from the other Emirates of Dubai, Sharjah, etc., by bus. The ♡❤Emirates Express♡❤ between Abu Dhabi and &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; is operated jointly by the Abu Dhabi and Dubai municipalities. The 130-km route takes around two hours. The buses operated by Dubai's RTA are luxury buses that charge 25 dirham for the onward journey to Abu Dhabi and 25 dirham for the return journey. The Abu Dhabi transport buses charge 15 dirham each way. The first bus departs from the Abu Dhabi main bus terminal on the corner of Hazza bin Zayed the First (11th) St and East (4th) Rd at 05:30 and the last leaves at 23:30; they leave at 30-minute intervals, or if the bus gets full sooner. From Dubai, the buses leave from 05:30, and run until 23:30, from the Al Ghubaiba station in Bur Dubai (opposite Carrefour Shopping). For bus times, see the timetable &lt;a href="http%3A//www.rta.ae/wpsv5/links/buses/timetable/E102Both.pdf"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published on the Government of Dubai's website.

If you hold an Emirates flight ticket and arrive to or depart from Dubai airport, the airline offers a complimentary extension of your trip to/from Abu Dhabi. Buses depart from Dubai airport Terminal 3 and arrive to Emirates Abu Dhabi office located in Al Sawari Tower. Contact Emirates customer service for booking &lt;a href="http%3A//www.emirates.com/english/plan_book/to_and_from_airport/free_shuttle_service_dubai.aspx"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>By taxi</h3>
Taxis are widely available everywhere. You can flag down any metered taxi on the street in Dubai or any other place in the UAE and ask to go to Abu Dhabi. Ride-share applications such as Uber are also available. The cost between Dubai and Abu Dhabi is about 250 dirham. From Abu Dhabi, taxis cost about 200 dirham to Dubai, depending on which side of Dubai you'll be getting off.

<h2>Get around</h2>
 

Abu Dhabi offers buses and plenty of taxis to get around. Since the most of the city is located in Abu Dhabi island, traffic is a common occurrence. 

<h3>By taxi</h3>
Taxis are a good way to get around if you don't have a car. Abu Dhabi's taxis are relatively cheap. The main taxis are silver with yellow signs on the top. Flag fall costs 5 dirham, 5.50 dirham at night (22:00 to 06:00) (2017). You can flag one down from anywhere in Abu Dhabi. Alternatively, you can book a taxi in Abu Dhabi by calling 600535353, for a 4-dirham booking fee. Taxis will charge you 1.82 dirham per kilometer (2.93 dirham per mile), and 50 fils for every minute of waiting.

Taxis are monitored using GPS and are not allowed to give above certain speeds. These change depending on where the taxi is.

Newer-looking black cabs also go around town sometimes. These are airport taxis, which you can get on at Abu Dhabi airport and get off anywhere in the city for 60-100 dirham. You can recognise them with their coloured signs on the top, displaying text in English and Arabic.

You are not expected to tip taxi drivers, but gratuity will be extremely appreciated.

<h3>By bus</h3>
The main bus station in Abu Dhabi is on Hazaa Bin Zayed Road. You can get buses here going to the different points within the city as well as inter-city buses. The bus stand also serves as a taxi stand, for inter-emirate taxis. The inter-city buses and airport buses are easy to locate at the bus terminal, and well signposted. The route services depart from various stops in the vicinity, and not all enter the bus terminal proper. There is no directional signage or and no maps.

The fare system is simple: 2 dirham for a single ride, 4 dirham for a day pass, 30 dirham for a week pass, or 40 dirham for a one-month ♡❤Hafilat♡❤ pass. Tickets can only be loaded on disposable or reusable smart cards. No cash is accepted by the drivers. The dark bluish green buses are air-conditioned but not wheelchair accessible. Passengers can board and alight at the designated stops along the route. These locations can be identified by the temporary Department of Transport bus stop poles. Bus stops that do not have the DoT bus stop sign may not be served as not all bus stops along the route are used.

Hafilat smart cards can be purchased from ticket machines which can be found at the main bus station and in the Abu Dhabi Mall area. Machines are unremarkable and hard to spot, thus ask locals.

</ul>
The older bus service, operated by the Abu Dhabi Municipality, operates bus routes within city and to the other emirates. The routes within the city are very few. The buses are modern and air-conditioned. The services are as punctual as possible and operate more or less around the clock and charge 2 dirham for travel within the capital. The front few seats are reserved for women, men should move towards the back of the bus.

<h3>By car</h3>
If you do decide to take the plunge and rent a car, beware that the street numbering system is unusual and it can take weeks to get used to it. U-turns are allowed at almost every intersection. When the left lane signal turns green, you simply have to swing a U-turn and come back. Whatever other flaws drivers here may have, they do ♡❤not♡❤ run red lights. There are cameras at many intersections, fines are high (about 550 dirham), and residents who are not citizens can be deported for reckless driving or running too many red lights. When the light starts flashing, that taxi in front of you ♡❤will♡❤ jam on the brakes, and you should, too. When the light turns green, however, expect someone behind you to honk at you immediately to get you moving. Almost all roads are monitored by remote radars, and you will get a hefty fine by mail for violating the speed limit without anyone stopping you or telling you you've been driving fast. The speed limit on speed signs is exactly the limit on which the radar will catch you. (There is no margin If you exceed the limit as in Dubai and other emirates, you will be fined if you exceed the written sign limit.)

Outside Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi license plates have a reputation for reckless drivers due to the large sized traffic lanes in Abu Dhabi, causing Abu Dhabi drivers to drive poorly when they move to smaller lanes in other emirates. Tempered drivers are common. They can pull out in front of you, change lanes at random, and text while driving. On the other hand, the ban on drunk driving is very strictly enforced.

The E11 Abu Dhabi to Dubai road is considered the most dangerous road in the UAE. Large number of people travel back and forth between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and a large number of them don't always pay attention on the road. The road broke the record for the largest traffic accident in UAE history. Its not uncommon to see drivers reading newspapers, or watching a movie across this segment of highway. Despite excellent roads, and a traffic signal system, vehicle accidents remain the largest cause of deaths in the UAE.

<h3>On foot</h3>
While walking in Abu Dhabi is not a problem for locals, tourists from colder climates will suffer from the heat and sun. The temperatures can exceed 45°C in the summer.

While staying inside or using a vehicle is a good idea, if you have to walk, try to do it night, when it is cooler. Plus, there won't be a sun to give you sunburn. If you have to go during the day, wear plenty of SPF 50 sunblock, wear a hat and light clothing and try to keep in the shade as much as possible.

<h3>By bicycle</h3>

There is a separated cycleway that runs almost the entire length of the Corniche, as well as around Yas Island, and other parts.

Abu Dhabi offers a lot of historical and cultural sights but it certainly isn’t lacking in modern attractions.

The public bus stop is 100 m ♡❤before♡❤ the mosque and after that is no stop for the next 5 km. The Mosque Centre offers several free tours of the mosque every day. Times vary on a daily basis, so check their website. As it is a place for worshippers, dress conservatively. In particular, women must cover their head and ankles (if they're wearing sandals). Appropriate black dress is available at the mosque. You will avoid the queue for the clothing if you wear shoes, a long dress or trousers, and take a scarf to cover your head/hair. Clothing is also available for men, but will likely be unnecessary. Even when taking photos outside the mosque, women who are inappropriately dressed will be challenged by security.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;free&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

Reem Island is progressing well, with many skyscrapers being built on the island to facilitate its growing population. The Reem Island skyline has impressive number of tall buildings. However, the north side of the island is still quite sparse. Despite this, there are many facilities available and Reem Island is a good place to live.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Swimming♡❤♡ Nearly all hotels and private clubs in Abu Dhabi offer swimming facilities, usually in the form of private beaches. You can pay for a day's use, or for a year's. Another, notably cheaper, option is The Club, an organization geared towards expatriates.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Lessons♡❤♡ Some hotels also offer dance lessons, aerobics classes, and other physical entertainment.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Desert safari♡❤♡ trips are a tourist but fun experience. They must be booked ahead, but can often be booked as late as the day before, most hotel receptionists can arrange this for you. Trips start late afternoon and end at night. You will be collected from your hotel and driven to the desert in a 4x4 vehicle. Most packages include a bone-rattling drive over the dunes, a short camel ride, a mediocre Arabic buffet and a belly dancer. The belly dancer is normally only included if there are enough of you in your party so enquire at the time of booking. Another option would be renting/buying a 4x4 and joining the many growing 4x4 clubs in the UAE. Most popular off them is the Abu Dhabi 4x4 offroad club &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ad4x4.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; AKA AD4x4 that offers a free learning experience for all newcomers. The club consists of all nationalities and is active with over 2,000 members and schedule trips weekly to suit all levels of driving skills.

<h2>Buy</h2>
Abu Dhabi is a compulsive shopper's dream. There are several malls, most of which have the same stores as other malls. Besides establishments aimed at locals, malls also include popular foreign chain stores, as well as designer places. Many visitors will be surprised at the female fashion dichotomy - while local custom calls for women to be covered in public, most stores sell short skirts and halter tops alongside the more sedate floor-length skirts and high-necked shirts.

The droll fashion stores may grip you for maybe several seconds, but then the obvious lack of things to do kicks in. However, the food court is popular, alongside New York Fries, Chili's, a Dunkin' Donuts, and Baskin Robbins. Downstairs there is an extortionate Krispy Kreme and Starbucks, and a what looks to be an Indian/Arabian cuisine restaurant, which seems good but looks to be unpopular.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

It contains a growing number of good shops, including a supermarket, three restaurant, serveral fast food restaurants on the first floor, a café, a kids play area, a nail salon, a bookstore and more. Despite, this, it is placed in a area that isn't usually busy, and is not very popular.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
There are also many small, independent stores around the city. On the bottom floor of one building, a person can purchase fancy chocolates, computer parts, antiques and clothing. It is better to purchase things such as carpets, art, native jewellery and antiques at the independent or souk-like places than at the malls, as the price will be lower and the shopkeepers more willing to haggle.

Bargaining is a big part of shopping in the Emirates, but be prudent. Don't bargain at Marks and Spencer or Hang Ten. Save your discounting skills for independent shops dealing in antiques and the like.

Shopping in most places can be frustrating, as the assistants will follow you around the store. This is partly due to their concept of what constitutes good service, and partly because there is a shoplifting problem. Most will not be intrusive, but some employees can be very pushy and overly obsequious. Smile and thank them often, and you're more likely to be left alone after a bit.

In carpet stores - or anywhere that sells tapestries, Indian antiques, and the like don't feel too pressured to buy, and don't be shocked if they start unrolling beautiful rug after beautiful rug at your feet. You are under no obligation to buy, no matter how much time they spend with you. However, the pressure will be very steady, and shyer shoppers may want to travel in packs for comfort's sake.

Grocery stores such as Spinney's, Carrefour and the Abu Dhabi Cooperative Society are inexpensive and usually stocked with Western goods. Examine all products before purchasing. Visitors wishing to purchase pork products will likely have to enter a separate room to do so, as no nationals are permitted in these sections of the grocery stores.

Prices in Abu Dhabi tend to be very competitive. In January 2018, the UAE introduced a Value Added Tax of 5% on most products aside from basic food items. 

General discount season - end of the year and midyear. These are the time where you can get some branded items with a very low price, maybe last season's stock.

<h2>Eat</h2>

Although Abu Dhabi hosts a wide range of palates and ethnicities, there is not much variety when it comes to cuisine. Indian food is relatively cheap, and there are a few Chinese chain restaurants with reasonable prices. Hotel restaurants are usually the most expensive. The city is home to all manner of fast food like McDonald's and Hardees, but there is little call for most people to eat at those places.

The fun thing about Abu Dhabi is that most places, from tiny falafel kiosks to grand hotel restaurants to Burger King, deliver anywhere in the city. Delivery is quick and reliable, and usually doesn't cost extra. All food is certified halal.

Vegetarians will find the city's selection of meals very satisfying. Vegetable and bean-heavy native dishes, the array of splendid pure vegetarian Indian cuisine, and the ready availability of fresh salads make eating in Abu Dhabi a stress-free experience. Strict vegans may have a little difficulty communicating their precise demands, but most places offer vegan dishes and are always willing to accommodate a paying customer. The best choice for pure vegans is one of many Indian vegetarian restaurants like Evergreen, Sangeetha in the Tourist Club area.

Check the Islamic calendar to determine whether you will be visiting during the month of Ramadan. Since Muslims fast during daylight hours, restaurants are, by law, closed during the day. It is also against the law to eat or drink anything, even water, in public. Tourists (and non-Muslim residents) have been arrested and given fines for violating this law. Large hotels generally have one restaurant open during the day to serve meals to non-Muslims. During the evening, however, it's quite a different story, as the festive atmosphere of ♡❤iftar♡❤ (breaking the fast) begins and residents gather for lavish, Thanksgiving-like meals. As long as you don't mind tiding yourself over in private, the evening meals are magnificent.

<h3>Splurge</h3>

<h2>Drink</h2>
Only restaurants located in hotels are allowed to serve alcohol. Therefore, all nightlife is associated with hotels. The drinking age is 21, but most places don't care. Unlike some other Middle Eastern nations, the bars in Abu Dhabi will be able to accommodate most drink orders.

Technically, you are supposed to purchase a permit to buy alcohol for private storage, although Spinney's and other liquor stores usually take proof, such as passport of driver's licence, that you aren't a local Muslim.

The club is often very loud and very dark with little more than lasers lighting the room. It's not a place to go if you expect to talk at all, at least not on a weekend night. Collared shirts are required for men, and sneakers usually do not pass the bouncers either. It is not uncommon to have to pay an entry fee. There are free drinks for the ladies on Wednesday nights, so expect it to be crowded.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡PJ's♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in the Royal Meridien Hotel&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 800 101 101 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;Sa-W 12:00-02:00; Th-F 12:00-03:00&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A 'traditional' Irish Pub , boasting brunch buffets and a long happy hour. The majority of the guests are usually British, American or Australian. There is something entertaining going on every day of the week, from 'Quiz Night' to 'Ladies Night'. If you want to start drinking early, this is the place to go. No one will bat an eye if you order beer with brunch, and you will probably find yourself staying for more than one round. The music earlier in the day is a mix of oldies and rock with faster-tempo songs for the late night crowd. This is also a great place to come to watch sports, as the quiet daytime atmosphere and televisions throughout ensure a pleasant experience. The outdoor seating near the hotel's pool is also a great asset on cooler days.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Trader Vic's♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Beach Rotana 10th Street&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in The Beach Rotana Hotel (connected to The Abu Dhabi Mall)&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 697-9011 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;18:00-01:30&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A famous cocktail bar/restaurant. The flattering lighting, interesting menu, and soft but fun island music make this a great place for a date or hanging out with people you actually want to talk to. The cocktail menu is pages long, and ordering a complicated fruity concoction is a must. The drinks may be a little on the expensive side at times, but the atmosphere is great. Try ordering one of their two- or four-person drinks, which come in a giant fishbow. They are a lot of fun if you do not mind sharing.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡49ers♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A steakhouse/bar. It is often quoted as "more of a meat market than a steakhouse" because of its reputation for prostitution. It is uncomfortable and the men in the bar will probably assume you are for sale. The Novotel Hotel and the Sands Hotel are also notorious for their nightclubs that men frequent when looking to purchase a date for the night.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Heroes♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A friendly sports grill/bar. It'sts in the Crowne Hotel's basement, and offers reasonable meals, and fair drink prices. The bar is often full of men and women watching sports on television. Later at night they have a DJ and a live band that play softer rock songs. It is a pleasant place to hang out with friends, though the lack of windows or ventilation can make it stuffy and smoke-filled quickly.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Mardi Gras♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in The Capital Hotel&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;12:00-03:30&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A small restaurant/bar. Its ambiance reminds one of a spa. The service is good, the drinks are reasonable, and the food is tasty. The band often leaves much to be desired, and the DJ is worse.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡The Yacht Club♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud Street&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;at the Intercontinental Hotel&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 666 6888 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;Su-Tu 17:00-01:00; W-Th 17:00-03:00; F 12:00-02:30&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A gorgeous view of the sunset over the marina if you sit outside. Inside has a very modern, minimalistic feel. The cocktails are delicious, but expensive.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡'Left Bank♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;at the Souk at the Shangrila Hotel (between the two bridges)&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;Sa-Tu 10:30-02:00; W-F 10:30-03:00&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A popular and lively spot. It serves a wide range of interesting cocktails as well as nicely prepared and presented meals. They are still new so they are trying a little harder right now, and the service tends to be pretty good. Worth the 15 to 20-minute trip out of the city centre.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Rabbit Hutch♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;The dedicated British Embassy Rabbit Hutch is a nice pub with music, a pool and a small play area for children. Although you have to know someone on the inside to get into this rather exclusive pub, the British friends and the refreshing pool is definitely worth it. They do all sorts of drinks, but don't ask for a martini, on the rocks, shaken not stirred.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Lebinese Flower♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;downtown Abu Dhabi&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 6446667 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Great food and nice atmosphere.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h2>Sleep</h2>

Hotels in Abu Dhabi used to be half the price of those in Dubai but no longer, with many hotels charging above 500 dirham per night. However, all are well-tended and host to first class restaurants, pools and other high-end hotel facilities.

<h3>Mid-range</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Grand Continental Flamingo♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;near Hamdan St and Khalifa Bin Zayed St&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 6262200 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;This is the hotel the taxis cannot find. A 2-story atrium, quiet setting, rooms with bidet, bath and over-bath shower and wide screen TVs all contribute to a pleasant stay. Only the dimness of the lighting and the overdone carpets in the room lets it down. The bath towels are also a bit small.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;200 dirham&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Novotel Centre Hotel Abu Dhabi♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;Novotel&lt;/bdi&gt;) (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Hamdan Street &amp; Airport Road&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 6333555 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Adequate rooms but inadequate and expensive breakfast in a tower block. Reception is cramped and lacks style. The lifts (elevators) are very slow. You pay for internet access. Only the cheerful staff and, if relevant to you, the central location redeem the place. The Chinese restaurant is said to be good, too.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Park Inn Abu Dhabi Yas Island♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Golf Plaza, Yas Island&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 656 22 22 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Clean rooms, excellent service and friendly staff. The restaurant is a great option for dinner.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;550 dirham&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Aloft♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Atop the National Exhibition Centre&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Trendy hotel with cool dark colors, attractive young hotel desk clerks, relatively small rooms (beds are comfortable though), good restaurant and lobby bar, fantastic outdoor lounge on the roof, and half-empty disco next door. Great if there's a convention, but it's walkable to nothing else. Car or taxi is needed to get just about anywhere. Maybe when the nearby residential/commercial development is ready in a few years, it might be more desirable. 4-star with few amenities (you bring your own bags to the room), but there is still a definite sense of style.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;US$90-200&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Crowne Plaza♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Hamdan Street&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2-6166166 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;span class="note"&gt;Check-in: &lt;bdi class="listing-checkin"&gt;14:00&lt;/bdi&gt;, check-out: &lt;bdi class="listing-checkout"&gt;12:00&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Luxury hotel for a little less money than the Hilton or both of Les Meridiens. Best Asian and Italian restaurants in the city are on the ground level. Service can be a little slow, bed is comfortable. There is a rooftop bar upstairs which seems always empty. Maybe more a 4½-star hotel, not a 5-star. You can sometimes get a "car" instead of taxi to take you places, for not much more than the taxi.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;US$100-400&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h3>Splurge</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Beach Rotana Hotel and Towers♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;Beach Rotana&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Tourist Club Area&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 6979000 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Marble everywhere sums it up. The club rooms are worth it if you are having to pay full rates for the classic rooms in the main older hotel. They are not much bigger but the use of the Club Lounge is valuable if you are going to be in the hotel a lot and the TV arrangements are more modern, the view wide. It now looks over the hectic construction on the new artificial islands across the creek.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Eastern Mangroves Hotel &amp; Spa♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Located along a 1.2 kilometer stretch of Abu Dhabi’s protected Eastern Mangroves District&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 656 1000 &lt;/bdi&gt; , &lt;abbr title="email" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;✉&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;span class="email listing-email"&gt; easternmangroves@anantara.com &lt;/span&gt; . &lt;span class="note"&gt;Check-out: &lt;bdi class="listing-checkout"&gt;Late check-out until 18:00 (subject to availability)&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;222 rooms and suites, infinity swimming pool, meeting and event facilities, wedding facilities.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;Prices from US$136&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Emirates Palace♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Corniche East&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 690 9000 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Built at an estimated cost of US$3 billion, this was by many accounts the world's most expensive hotel to build, with oodles of gold and marble plating every available surface. The scale of everything is gargantuan &amp;mdash; you need directions just to find your way from the gate to the lobby. The hotel feels like it's straight out of Las Vegas, minus the slot machines. To visit the Palace, you will need a reservation for a restaurant or bar of the hotel.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;Rates start at 970 dirham&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Hilton Abu Dhabi♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Corniche East&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 6811900 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;One of the older hotels in Abu Dhabi, but kept in good shape and recently renovated. Huge ♡❤Hiltonia♡❤ beach/pool/spa complex across the street (free for guests), small gym in hotel itself. "Plus" rooms face the sea but are otherwise identical to normal ones. Located a fair distance from the city center, which is both good (no construction noise) and bad (virtually nothing within walking distance). There are shuttle services to the Marina Mall and the city center offered.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;US$150&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡InterContinental Abu Dhabi♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;One of the long-time prestige hotels. Expensive but occasional Internet deals on the hotel independent booking websites are worth it if you are willing to pay upfront online. The lobby is huge and recently renovated. Rooms seem a little 1980s with their decor (way too many mirrors) but beds are comfortable and the views are nice. Gym and fine (but expensive) restaurants. Abu Dhabi locals frequent the hotel piano lounge and the Brazilian restaurant. It is somewhat remote from the centre of town but the setting and amenities are worth it.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;US$150-400&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Le Meridien Abu Dhabi♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Tourist Club Area&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 6446666 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Tell the taxi driver "Lee Meridien" and he will not confuse it with Royal Meridien. Best amenity is the Meridien Village, an outdoor garden filled with restaurants and pubs, and on Thursday nights during the cooler months, a hangout for literally thousands of expats.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Le Royal Meridien♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Sheikh Khalifa Street&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 6742020 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Beautiful views of the gulf and Corniche, comfortable beds, lots of restaurants and bars (very pricey). Service is very good, but things like bringing a welcoming fruit plate to your room (formerly common in 5 star hotels) are extras now. Rotating restaurant at top, and a somewhat hidden nightclub on the 4th floor for dealings on the dark side. Sometimes can get real good deals on internet booking sites (as low as US$139/night), but generally expect to pay over US$200/night even during quiet season, and over US$500 when they have defense contractor exhibitions and such. Internet is US$24/day which is ridiculous. However, if you use the wireless network in the lobby, there is no charge. They hold US$135/day against your credit card if you want to put meals or other amenities toward your room charges, so make sure you have a good credit line available if you are staying here more than a few days.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;US$150-400/night&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Radisson Blu Abu Dhabi♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Yas Plaza, Yas Island&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 6562000 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Overlooks the golf course and F1 Circuit. It has 397 rooms comprising suites and business class. All day dining restaurant, Italian restaurant, Persian restaurant, lobby bar, and pool bar.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡The Yas Hotel♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Yas Island&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +971 2 6560000 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Set half on land and half on water, overlooking the marina, and positioned on the Yas Marina Circuit, which plays host the annual Formula One Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, this hotel is distinctive. The exterior's gridshell can be seen for miles around and mimics the throw of a local fishing net. Fourteen restaurants and lounges.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Stay safe</h2>
Abu Dhabi has been ranked as the safest city in the world 3 years in a row by 2019 by the largest crowd-sourced global database Numbeo. The city is extremely safe, however it never hurts to practice common sense. Some people may try to scam you through telephone messages or automated voice calls telling you that you won the lottery, that you're in a legal trouble for violating a law, or that a Sheikh has decided to give you free money, or something of that sort. 

Taxi drivers are monitored and they're very safe. Rarely, crime does occur but is quickly dealt with by the federal police as the city is the headquarters of the Ministry of Interior. Law enforcement officers. police patrols, and police horse units are a common sight in the city.

<h2>Cope</h2>

<h3>Embassies</h3>
Being the national capital, Abu Dhabi hosts a large number of embassies. A majority of them are clustered in the Embassies District (Al Safarat) south of the Al Bateen Executive Airport and in the adjacent Al Ma'ared Area, west of Rabdan St and south of Shk Rashid bin Saeed Rd (Road #18); and the adjacent Capital Centre south of Al Karamah St surrounding the Exhibition Centre. There are others further northwest in Al Danah, Al Markaziyah and in other parts of the city as well. If corresponding by mail/post use their PO box address as mail is only delivered to a PO Box with no post codes. If delivering to a street address with DHL, FedEx, UPS or another private courier be sure to include recipient's phone number so that the delivery driver can call for directions or clarification on the address. Some or most countries maintain an additional consulate in &lt;a href="Dubai%23Consulates"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; and only offer consular services from their Dubai consulate or from both locations. Check website links or call before going or sending any correspondences:

<h2>Understand</h2>
Abu Dhabi is the largest of the seven emirates and the capital of the UAE. It occupies an area of . Its long coastline, the shallow waters of the Southern Gulf, extending from the base of the Qatar Peninsula in the west to the border of the emirate of Dubai on the north east, was once the world's best waters for pearling. When the pearling industry declined, oil discovery in the offshore oilfields of the Southern Gulf revived the economy of Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi was also the first emirate to export oil from the Umm Shaif offshore field in 1962. On the land, it stretches south to the oases of Liwa where some of the world's largest sand dunes can be found and east to the ancient oasis of Al Ain. This makes Abu Dhabi the largest as well as the most populated of all the emirates.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Both &lt;a href="Abu%20Dhabi"&gt;Abu Dhabi&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt; AUH &lt;/b&gt; ) and &lt;a href="Al%20Ain"&gt;Al Ain&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt; AAN &lt;/b&gt; ) have international airports, although Abu Dhabi's is by far the larger and better-connected of the two. Coming in via neighboring &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt; is also a viable option: it's from Dubai to Abu Dhabi city and to Al Ain.

<h2>Get around</h2>

&lt;a href="Taxi"&gt;Taxi&lt;/a&gt;s are the preferred method of travel. They are cheap and have been replaced with a national service. fares start from approx USD1.50 and can take you from one side of the city to the other for less than USD10.

<h2>See</h2>

<h2>Do</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Desert Safari♡❤♡ trips are an exhilarating experience. You must book ahead, but this can often be done as late as the day before, by your hotel receptionist. The whole event normally starts late afternoon. You will be collected directly from your hotel. The trips vary slightly but normally you arrive back to your hotel in the evening around 22:00. Most packages include an exhilarating drive over the dunes by an experienced driver in a 4x4 vehicle, a short camel ride, delicious Arabic buffet and Belly Dancer. Note that the belly dancer is normally included only if there are enough of you in your party so enquire at the time of booking.

Non-Muslims are permitted to bring up to 4 litres of alcohol into Abu Dhabi. Alcohol is also available in hotel bars, but bringing any of it home requires a liquor license.

The biblical story was the impetus to constructing a church at this site. A church was first constructed at this site during the Byzantine period, which was later on destroyed in 614 during the Persian conquest of the region. The church was established in 1924 together with a women monastery on the remains of the Byzantine period church. Since the 1980s music festivals have been held occasionally at the church.

<h1>Abuja</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Abuja♡❤♡ is the capital of &lt;a href="Nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;. Since most Nigerian government agencies are now headquartered in Abuja and most other countries' embassies have been relocated from Lagos to Abuja, it is a surprisingly expensive city.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Abuja is very beautiful. One of few purpose-built cities in the world planned and built from scratch, it has an excellent road network, a beautiful rolling terrain and modern Nigerian architecture. However, power is often erratic.

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>By plane</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q525030"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ABV &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;International flights to Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport are offered by several airlines, notably, Lufthansa, KLM, and British Airways. If arriving from the US, Delta Air Lines has a direct flight from New York JFK. Many visitors fly through connecting flights from Lagos.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
While the industry is being overhauled and aviation safety is being upgraded, only few local airlines are reliable: AeroContractors, Arik Air and Chanchangi. Arik Air has embarked on an ambitious programme to add several new jetliners, including the new Boeing 787 dreamliner, to its fleet.

From the airport, you are best advised to take the official Green Cab. Board the cab with only people you know. Uber operates here as well.

The light rail line, when change opened in July 2018, connects the airport to the city centre at the Abuja Metro station.

<h3>By bus</h3>

You can travel to Abuja by bus from major cities like Lagos, Benin, Kano and Port Harcourt. Reliable services include: ABC Transport (with air conditioned luxurious bus rides), Ekene Dili Chukwu, Chisco Transport (CTN) and Young Shall Grow. The preferred bus service would be ABC transport.

Take only day trip buses from Lagos or Kano. A few buses have been attacked by robbers. If you're unfamiliar with the country, do not take a bus without an escort. Buses allow you to appreciate the terrain, the towns and cities and the subtle changes in these and culture as you drive towards the capital either from the South or the North.

<h3>By train</h3>

&lt;a href="http%3A//nrc.gov.ng/"&gt;♡❤♡Nigeria Railway Corporation♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt; has completed an inter-city line between Abuja and &lt;a href="Kaduna"&gt;Kaduna&lt;/a&gt;, where you can connect with the rest of the Nigerian rail system. Trains arrive and depart from &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which is about 15 km west of the city centre. As of 2018, there are four daily departures in each direction.

<h2>Get around</h2>
 

Car or taxi is the main mode of getting around Abuja: public transport is limited. However, the Abuja Light Rail started operations in July 2018, helping with transport woes especially between the city, rail station and the airport. However, this means it only relieves congestion on the west side of the city.

Abuja has a few strict driving laws that are enforced. Seat belts are required of the driver and front seat passenger. The vehicle can be impounded and not released until the fine is paid. Drivers don't typically observe lanes within the city, and often attempt to squeeze in what might seem to be dangerously close to your vehicle. In some cases they may drive on the sidewalks. Traffic accidents are frequent, so drive defensively. Occasionally, drivers from other parts of the country that are unfamiliar with the driving culture in the city try to beat traffic lights. If you're driving, keep an eye out for other motorists, especially at intersections, who may try to beat the traffic lights. Occasionally, traffic lights stop working during outages and road marshals are deployed to critical intersections.

<h3>Budget</h3>

Food prices in Abuja are high, especially for Western food. There are, however, many good restaurants in Abuja that are arguably worth the money.

Drinks are available all over Abuja and are very overpriced. Average US$20 for some mixed drinks, US$5-9 for a local beer. Buy beer from the Market and you will save a lot of money. The major hotels have bars and restaurants - watch out for the call girls, if you ignore them, they get really offended. If you are not interested, just say so and have a short conversation, then they will leave you alone.

</ul>
<h2>Stay safe</h2>
Abuja tends to be a sharp contrast against the background of the rest of Nigeria. While car hijackings and armed robbery are high in Lagos, and kidnapping of foreign oil workers is prevalent in the Niger delta, Abuja in sharp contrast, is one of the safest metropolitan cities on the continent.

General security measures like elsewhere in the world should be observed. Like anywhere else in the world, it's always a good idea to have company when exploring unfamiliar places. If you're driving, observe simple measures like keeping your car door locked when parked to avoid opportunistic crime. Armed robbery at gun point is the most prevalent form of crime. A calm disposition and full cooperation with robbers is the best line of action in the unlikely event that you are the victim of a robbery.

Robbers tend to become violent when victims try to pull tricks. Contact your embassy in Abuja and the police if you are robbed. Occasional pick pockets target mobile phones and wallets as well. Do not carry large amounts of cash. Usually, US$250 cash (or ₦30,000) would more than suffice for impulsive purchases and other daily costs.

When moving in Abuja, as a foreign visitor, you are best advised to use the official Green Cabs. There's a remote chance that privately operated unofficial cabs could be traps. Cab fares would be around ₦500 for trips within the city. Cab rides to the airport are significantly higher. Negotiate a fare before you enter a cab.

There have been many reports of fraudulent use of credit card details almost immediately after people have used their cards to pay hotel deposits, even in the very top hotels.

<h1>Abu Simbel</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Abu Simbel♡❤♡ (♡❤also spelled:♡❤ ...Sinbil, ...Sembel; ♡❤Arabic:♡❤ ابو سمبل) in &lt;a href="Upper%20Egypt"&gt;Upper Egypt&lt;/a&gt; was saved from the rising waters of Lake Nasser, growing behind the Aswan Dam, in a massive archaeological rescue plan sponsored by &lt;a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20List"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s. The complex of temples dedicated to the Pharaoh Ramsis II "the Great" remain an evocative and unforgettable destination.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Abu Simbel is a village lying 280 km south of Aswan and 40 km north of the Sudanese border. It is a very small settlement with very little to attract visitors other than its great temples for which it is famous. Few tourists linger for more than a few hours, although there are 5 hotels to attract visitors to stay the night.

The temples at Abu Simbel used to be located further down the hillside, facing the Nile in the same relative positions, but due to the rising waters of Lake Nasser, the original locations are underwater. In the 1960s, each temple was carefully sawed into numbered stone cubes, moved uphill, and reassembled before the water rose.

The Great Temple of Ramses II was reassembled fronting a fake mountain, built like a domed basketball court, where the stone cubes occupy a section under the dome; from outside, the fake mountain looks like solid rock.

Archaeologists have concluded that the immense sizes of the statues in the Great Temple were intended to scare potential enemies approaching Egypt's southern region, as they travelled down the Nile from out of Africa.

<h3>Climate</h3>

&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Climate/style.css" /&gt;

Summers are extremely hot at days, while winters are warm at days and mild at nights. Rainfall is almost non-existent. The best time to visit is from November till February.

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>By plane</h3>

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q774216"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Abu Simbel Airport♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ABS &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;&lt;a href="http%3A//www.egyptair.com.eg"&gt;EgyptAir&lt;/a&gt; offers frequent flights to Abu Simbel from &lt;a href="Aswan"&gt;Aswan&lt;/a&gt; (up to four flights daily).
</ul>
&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; 

<h3>By bus</h3>
Foreign travellers can get to Abu Simbel by coach or minibus (tour) from &lt;a href="Aswan"&gt;Aswan&lt;/a&gt;, travelling in convoys. There is at least one daily convoy each way, taking 3 hours. Seats can be arranged at your hotel or through the &lt;a href="Aswan"&gt;Aswan&lt;/a&gt; tourist office. The cost for a return trip is LE150-350, depending on the season and your negotiation skills. It seems there are not many companies offering this tour, so the only price difference will be due to varying hotel commission. Nevertheless, inquire at several hotels, like Kaylany, Marhaba and Tiba (LE185 as of Nov 2018). The trip price does not include entrance fees, but may include travel to additional sights in Aswan such as the High Dam or unfinished obelisk, but only if agreed before. Also make sure you have at least two hours (by agreement with the booking office) in Abu Simbel and refer to this tour agreement in case the driver is not willing to stick to this. They will not leave without you, promised! (Also because of security concerns and rules.) Be prepared to be asked for a tip by the driver at the end, even though he just cashed LE200 for this simple bus ride and the driver's behaviour was not really accommodating nor did he deliver any additional service like a stop at the high dam.

Sit on the left hand side of the bus, and you will see the sunrise in the morning (if awake) and be in the shade on the way back.

There are also two public buses from Aswan (3 hours each way). One leaves at 4AM and the second one at 11AM. All convoy buses need to leave for their return journey to Aswan by 4PM latest.

<h3>By car</h3>
Abu Simbel is generally not accessible to foreigners travelling by their own car, because of police security concerns. Travellers are only able to access Abu Simbel by bus from Aswan. Or they can rent a car with driver via a local agency, which is the most comfortable way.

However, you might get around these concerns and travel with you own car or taxi by telling the police you are working in Egypt&amp;mdash;mostly they will not be able to identify that from your passport due to the lack of knowledge of the Roman letters. You would however prefer to travel with the car convoy all tourist mini-buses go with, starting at around 5AM from &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash;just take the road towards Abu Simbel and after having left Aswan you will encounter the checkpoint with waiting mini-buses and a more throughout police questioning.

<h3>By boat</h3>
It is possible to travel by cruise ship from &lt;a href="Aswan"&gt;Aswan&lt;/a&gt; through Lake Nasser to Abu Simbel.

<h2>Get around</h2>

The town of Abu Simbel is small enough to navigate on foot.

Dedicated to Ramses II and gods Ra, Amun, and Ptah. Features 4 statues of Ramses, each higher than 20 m. Its axis was positioned by the ancient Egyptian architects in such a way that twice a year, on February and October 22, the rays of the sun would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculpture on the back wall, except for the statue of Ptah, the god connected with the Underworld, who always remained in the dark. These dates are allegedly the king's birthday and coronation day respectively, but there is no evidence to support this, though it is quite logical to assume that these dates had some relation to a great event, such as the jubilee celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the pharaoh's rule. This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Ramses II could take his place next to Amun Ra and Ra-Horakhty. Due to the displacement of the temple, it is widely believed that this event now occurs one day later than it used to. Also, look for a "Kilroy was here" on the lower legs of one of the 4 giant statues of Ramesses II, along with other graffiti, used to be considered fashionable.Guards do check for photo permits, especially in the main temple.Be sure to follow the pathway inside the fake mountain dome, to see how the mountain was constructed.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;LE215, students LE113.5, photo permit LE300 (tripod LE20)&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Do</h2>
Read more about the temples before arriving: time at Abu Simbel will likely be limited, with little time to read about the stone carvings inside the temples. Beyond the temples themselves, the detailed description of sawing and moving the stone cubes is also an interesting story to read.

As with the pyramids at &lt;a href="Giza"&gt;Giza&lt;/a&gt;, reading about them, before arriving, in no way diminishes the impact of seeing them firsthand. The reconstructed temples at Abu Simbel appear entirely real, not like a simulated building at some theme parks; however, do go inside the dome of the Great Temple to appreciate that it is a fake mountain.

Early morning boat tours of Lake Nasser or to see the sunrise on the monuments can be arranged through Eskaleh Nubian Lodge.

<h2>Eat</h2>
Visitors might need to bring their own snacks and beverages, due to the length of the journey and the limited time at Abu Simbel. There are many cafes along the main road. Prices are high due to the number of tourists.

</ul>
<h2>Sleep</h2>

Many people do Abu Simbel as a day trip and fall asleep on the ride to/from Abu Simbel due to its early time. A reason to stay overnight is to see the Sound &amp; Light show or see the temples away from the crowds. Expect to pay more in Abu Simbel due to its isolated location than equivalent hotels in Cairo.

</ul>
<h2>Cope</h2>
In Abu Simbel, it feels at least ♡❤♡10 degrees colder♡❤♡ than in Aswan due to lake Nasser and the wind coming from it. Thus, bring some warm cloths and scarf, and especially in winter wear something that can deal with around 5-10 °C and strong wind.

<h1>Abusir</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Abusir♡❤♡ (also spelt ♡❤Abu Sir♡❤) is the name given to an &lt;a href="Egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;ian archaeological locality on the desert plateau (and its neighbouring village in the valley) 10&amp;nbsp;km (7&amp;nbsp;miles) south of &lt;a href="Giza"&gt;Giza&lt;/a&gt; and 8 km north of &lt;a href="Saqqara"&gt;Saqqara&lt;/a&gt;. Situated 35&amp;nbsp;km south of the Egyptian capital &lt;a href="Cairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, Abusir is the site of a compact pyramid field, with pyramids and funerary temples dating mainly from the 5th Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. It is somewhat "off the beaten track" for most visitors and therefore ideal for exploration with far less hassle and company than will be experienced at Giza, or even Saqqara.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Just one, relatively small segment of the extensive "pyramid field" that extends from north of Giza to below Saqqara, the locality of Abusir took its turn as the focus of the prestigious western burial rites operating out of the then-capital of &lt;a href="Memphis%20%28Egypt%29"&gt;Memphis&lt;/a&gt; as an elite cemetery (or necropolis) during the Old Kingdom 5th Dynasty. Neighbouring Giza had by then "filled up" with the massive pyramids and other monuments of the 4th Dynasty, leading the 5th Dynasty pharaohs to seek sites elsewhere for their own funerary monuments. Although two 5th Dynasty pharaohs (Unas and Userkaf) did build their pyramids further south at Saqqara, adjacent to the 3rd Dynasty Step Pyramid of Djoser, most of the Dynasty's rulers concentrated their efforts at Abusir (for their pyramids and associated funerary temples) and elsewhere (for their so-called "sun-temples").

<h2>Get in</h2>
Abusir is not served by any viable means of public transport, the site lying some distance from the village and the main road that leads south to Saqqara. The only practible means of visiting Abusir are by car, by hired taxi (perhaps in association with a visit to Saqqara or Giza) or as part of an organised tour group.

<h2>See</h2>

The ♡❤♡Abusir necropolis♡❤♡ is open daily 8am-4pm. Admission LE80 (as of Dec 2018). 14 pyramids were constructed at Abusir - of these, four were those of pharaohs, three of royal women and one unfinished. Some are better preserved than others, from those surviving, but all in a far more ruined state - and certainly built to more modest dimensions - than those found at Giza:

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q131820"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Pyramid of Sahure♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;The northernmost pyramid at Abusir and located closest to the entrance to the site, the Pyramid of Sahure (pronounced "Sa-who-ray") - the second ruler of the 5th Dynasty - was also the first constructed at Abusir. Completing its profile as the most completely preserved pyramid at the locality, the Pyramid of Sahure once measured... Numerous blocks carved in beautiful deep relief were revealed here when the French archaeologist Borchardt excavated between 1902-1908. On the eastern side of the pyramid, the attached mortuary temple is reasonably well-preserved, retaining numerous granite pillars and large blocks with Sahure's cartouche still clearly visible. It is possible to access the pyramid's interior: from the entrance, a 75&amp;nbsp;m long walk down a corridor leads to the burial chamber, entered by crawling through a narrow portal and 2&amp;nbsp;m long passage.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q1751693"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Pyramid of Niuserre♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Easily the most ruinous of the 'complete' pyramids at Abusir, the Pyramid of Niuserre originally measured ...

<h1>Abydos</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Abydos♡❤♡ is an important archaeological site in &lt;a href="Middle%20Egypt"&gt;Middle Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of temples, sites and ancient cemeteries close to the town of ♡❤al-Balyana♡❤, 90&amp;nbsp;km (56&amp;nbsp;miles) north of &lt;a href="Luxor"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>By train</h3>

Most travellers arrive at Abydos by train north from &lt;a href="Luxor"&gt;Luxor&lt;/a&gt;, alighting at the station for the town of ♡❤al-Balyana♡❤. The fare is approximately &lt;a href="Egypt%23Money"&gt;LE&lt;/a&gt; 52, first class. From the station, either the tourist police or a police-escorted taxi will take you to the site of the Ramesside temples. Depending on local conditions and police levels of business, you should be able to get ♡❤at least♡❤ a couple of hours visiting the site.

At al-Balyana, there should be some police at the station. If not, ignore any touts, exit the station to the south and you will almost immediately come to the east-west road that heads out to Abydos. Start heading west along this road and you will soon come to the police checkpoint, they used to be where the road forms a bridge over the canal, and had a small blue wooden sentry box and some barriers. They will either take you to the main temple of Seti I, or arrange a taxi for you. It's usually a private taxi, but sometimes a share. As always, have small denomination notes to the pay the fare as drivers always have "no change". It's not necessary to spend money getting a private taxi to wait. When you leave the temple the police on site will find a vehicle for you to get back down to town, just so you aren't their problem anymore. 

Back at the station the police will usually (not always) wait with you and see you on the train. Note that if a 3rd class train comes first (as it often does late afternoon), they will often put you on that one. It's not the most clean or comfortable experience (no air con, no guaranteed seats, sometimes not even any lighting), but the travel time isn't much different to the nicer trains. All in all, the journey is more hassle than an organised tour, but the freedom you get to spend several hours on site and explore on your own, in peace and in your own time, makes it well worth while.

<h3>By road</h3>

You can go by taxi in the police-escorted convoy to Abydos in one day, usually including &lt;a href="Dendera"&gt;Dendera&lt;/a&gt; as a stop-off point. A trip in a private car arranged through your hotels could cost around US$90 for two or three passengers (Oct 2018). You can likely get a better price by talking to taxi drivers directly. Make sure you agree on how much time you will spend at each temple - 90 min each is an minimum, though if you want to spend longer (especially at Abydos), then taking the train and just doing Abydos will give you much more time on site, and will work out much cheaper, though dealing with the local police is a hassle. 

Also available are minibus tours from agents in Luxor, usually with a local guide of variable quality. These also travel with the escorted convoy, and can be a reasonable deal for a small group if you haggle, especially in off-season. Expect to pay around LE 300 - 400 per person, dependent on size of your group, time of year and your haggling skills. The major UK, US and European holiday companies also offer escorted tours, but these can be expensive.

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡The Temple of Seti I♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;The father of Ramses the Great ruled from 1294–1279 BC. His temple features magnificent reliefs, among them a long carved list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties, the sole source to dates and names of many of the kings of the Seventh and Eighth Dynasties, thus valued greatly for that reason: the Abydos Kings List. The raised reliefs in the temple are some of the finest quality in all Egypt, incredibly beautiful and detailed. Although the lighting in the interior of the temple can be somewhat gloomy in places, the reliefs still stand out as exceptional. The reliefs on the outer portions of the temple were completed during the reign of Ramses II, and are of a much lower quality than those further inside the complex. (Ramses moved the best craftsmen to work on his own temples after his father's death). The Kings List, or Pharaohs List is somewhat selective, omitting for example Akhenaten (the heretic king), Hatshepsut (a female pharaoh), and the reigns of the kings during the Hyskos occupation. If you are interested in ancient Egyptian history and art, this temple is as much a must-see as &lt;a href="Abu%20Simbel"&gt;Abu Simbel&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="Luxor/East%20Bank%23See"&gt;Karnak temple&lt;/a&gt;.

The outside of the temple was decorated with scenes of the Battle of Kadesh.

This area was first excavated by Émile Amélineau in the 1890s and more systematically by Flinders Petrie between 1899-1901. The German Archaeological Institute has been excavating here since the 1970s.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

It was discovered by Flinders Petrie and Margaret Murray, who were excavating the site in 1902–3. The name "Osireion" was invented by Petrie, who interpreted it as a symbolic tomb of Osiris.

<h1>Aït-Benhaddou</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Aït-Benhaddou♡❤♡ is a city in &lt;a href="Morocco"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Aït-Benhaddou is a traditional mud brick city on the edge of the High Atlas Mountains. It is on the &lt;a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20List"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage List&lt;/a&gt; and has featured in many films, mostly as a replacement for Jerusalem.

It has appeared in more than 10 movies, including ♡❤Lawrence of Arabia♡❤ and ♡❤Gladiator♡❤.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Aït Benhaddou is accessible from &lt;a href="Ouarzazate"&gt;Ouarzazate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Marrakesh"&gt;Marrakesh&lt;/a&gt;. From Marrakesh it will be a full day trip and the best advice is to organize a private tour if you do not have much time. Overnighting in Aït Benhaddou is recommendable as you get to see the Ksar in different lighting conditions. It looks very different in the morning when sun rises or when the sun is just setting.

<h3>By bus</h3>
Most buses do not ply direct to Aït Benhaddou but can drop you off at the turn off about 7 km away from where you will have to find a lift. Or you get dropped of a little earlier at Tadoula, from where you can walk through the desert for about 5 km.

<h3>By taxi</h3>
A grand taxi seat from Ouarzazate costs 15 dirham. From or to the junction at the highway, it is 9 dirham.

Or you arrange a private hire of a taxi for the trip. At daytime, grand taxis are always waiting at the crossing.

<h3>By car</h3>
Aït Benhaddou is 9 km off the main Tizi n Tichka road, which links Ouarzazate to Marrakech. Coming from Ouarzazate, turn to the right after about 18 km from the town. It's quite a scenic drive to Aït Benhaddou. On the way into town there is a slight turn to the right, which is a popular spot for great views over the town and the Kasbah.

<h2>Get around</h2>
Once inside the Ksar you can only walk or climb. There are two main entrances into the Ksar. One can be reached by new bridge. To reach the second, it is necessary to cross the river using the stepping stones (in dry season the river is completely dry).

<h2>See</h2>
The town itself is the main attraction, with mud buildings climbing up the side of the hill.

<h2>Buy</h2>
There are several shops within the town that sell souvenirs from all over the Sahara, particularly prevalent are Models of the Ksar and wooden artifacts from the Dogon people in Mali.
There is a very friendly carpet shop in the newer part of town near the post office.

Many touristy restaurants and cafés cater for the exhausted folks.

♡❤♡Añasco♡❤♡ is a city in the &lt;a href="Porta%20del%20Sol"&gt;Porta del Sol&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Puerto%20Rico"&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. Old town Añasco offers typical Puerto Rican hangout places with its large central square or plaza and well preserved churches.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Añasco holds an important place in Puerto Rican history, as it was here that the Spanish Conquistadores were proven to be mortals. A group of rebel Taino natives attacked and drowned a Spanish conquistador named SALCEDO, thus debunking the myth that the Spanish were gods. A bronze fountain in the main square depicts this act of bravery and defiance of colonial Spanish rule.

Today, Añasco is known for its Hojaldre cake (filled with brandy and spices) and the Chipe clam.

Añasco Beach has a Balneario or public beach facility, located on beautiful Tres Hermanos Beach. It completes the chain of surfing beaches in Northwestern Puerto Rico.

Añasco is located on a perfect spot in the west side of the lsland, closed by many tourist attractions and marvelous places to see. It serves as a strategic location for visitors to enjoy the many beauties that Puerto Rico offers.

<h2>Get in</h2>
From Aguadilla take I-PR-2 South. Take Exit 
<h2>Get around</h2>
Añasco is served by Interstate PR-2; which connects Añasco with &lt;a href="Aguadilla"&gt;Aguadilla&lt;/a&gt; to the north and Mayaguez to the south.

<h1>Acadiana</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Acadiana♡❤♡ is a region of &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, in the south and south west of the state. It is sometimes called "Cajun Country", noted for its distinctive culture. This is the birthplace of Cajun cuisine, Cajun music, and Zydeco music.

<h2>Subregions</h2>

From west to east, Acadiana can be broken into five distinct and unique regions, where Cajun and Creole peoples adapted unique aspects from their environment.

</ul>
<h2>Understand</h2>

Acadiana or "Cajun Country" spreads over the prairies and bayous of SW Louisiana.

Acadiana is a reference to the large population of &lt;a href="Acadia"&gt;Acadia&lt;/a&gt;ns, descendants of French speakers expelled from &lt;a href="Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; by the British. These Louisiana Acadians are known as ♡❤♡Cajuns♡❤♡ an English corruption of ♡❤Acadiens♡❤.

While the Cajuns are the dominant population of the region, since early in its history the region has also included Native Americans, Germans, Spanish, French Creoles, and Creoles of Color, all of whom made their contribution to creating Acadiana. Many more people have contributed more recently to the vibrant region with its unique culture, dialects, and food.

While locals were long proud of their traditions, in the early 20th century Cajuns were often looked down on. A fortunate change came about in the last third of the 20th century, when a new widespread appreciation of Cajun culture developed, especially for its music and food.

<h2>Talk</h2>

Acadiana is home to the majority of Louisiana's Francophones. The vast majority of people in Acadiana can speak English, though some older ♡❤Cadiens♡❤ in rural areas may only speak French. While most can speak English, many Cajuns are bilingual, and around 30% of Acadiana residents can speak French (as opposed to 7% in Louisiana). Visitors from other English- or French-speaking regions may struggle with stronger local accents.

The local English accent incorporates many basic French words and unique pronunciations.

The dialect of French spoken by the Francophones of Acadiana is essentially the same as the one spoken in &lt;a href="New%20Brunswick"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; and other Acadian areas of &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. Communication in French between Cajuns and residents of &lt;a href="France"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; usually requires some effort.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Use a major airport in Baton Rouge or New Orleans to get to the area. Travel by personal vehicle or rental car. If you are in New Orleans, there are tour buses and limo services that can bring you to the area.

<h2>Get around</h2>
If you want to travel at your own pace, you should bring your own vehicle or rental car. Tour bus companies are great, but you sign up for a specific itinerary.

<h2>See</h2>
Along Louisiana's &lt;a href="Mississippi%20River"&gt;Mississippi River&lt;/a&gt;, between &lt;a href="New%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Baton%20Rouge"&gt;Baton Rouge&lt;/a&gt;, is a historic region known locally as the Louisiana River Region. Found along both banks of the Mississippi are a number of historic plantations, dating back to the 1800s. Some of these are open to the public, ranging from non-profit educational facilities to commercial tourist attractions with major amenities. Pre-Civil War, there were hundreds of wealthy plantations along this trail, growing mostly sugar cane. Most are gone today, but locals have worked diligently to keep the remaining plantations viable and open to the public for visitation.

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Houmas House Plantation♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;40136 Highway 942, Darrow&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;9AM-8PM, closed Christmas Day and New Year's Day&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A historic plantation established in the 1700s that operates as a museum and inn.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡San Francisco Plantation♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;2646 Hwy. 44 (River Road), Garyville&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;"The Most Opulent Plantation in the South". A national historic landmark that is open for tours.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Whitney Plantation♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;5099 Louisiana Highway 18, Wallace LA 70049&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +1 225 265-3300 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;M W-Sa 9:30AM - 4:30PM; closed Sundays and major holidays&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Whitney Plantation is the only plantation museum (and perhaps the only museum in North America) with a focus on slavery. Originally known as “Habitation Haydel”, this sugar cane plantation intertwined the lives of German immigrant owners and African-American slaves. Part museum, part art gallery, part living history, visitors report that the Whitney engaged them with a painful but central part of American history, and left them changed. The main house is on the National Register of Historic Places. Tours, hourly from 10AM to 3PM, are included with admission.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;$22; $15 for students, seniors, active military, and locals; children under 12 free with adult admission&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Do</h2>
Listen -- and dance to -- some Cajun and Zydeco music. There are dance halls and clubs in cities and towns, and some scattered in more remote locations people drive for miles to get to. A few of the more noted ones are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Fred's Lounge, Mamou
BULLET::::- Prejeans, just north of Lafayette
BULLET::::- Randol's, Lafayette
BULLET::::- Slim's Y-Ki-Ki, Opelousas
BULLET::::- Whiskey River Landing, Henderson, near Breaux Bridge

</ul>
Acadiana hosts a number of festivals. Some major ones are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- Crawfish Festival, May in Breaux Bridge
BULLET::::- Festivals Acadiens et Créoles, September or October in Lafayette
BULLET::::- Festival International de Louisiane in late April, Lafayette
BULLET::::- Frog Festival, November in Rayne
BULLET::::- Zydeco Festival, August in Opelousas
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Wildlife Gardens♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;5306 North Black Bayou Drive, Gibson&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;30 acres of preserved swamp, where you can walk around a nature trail on shady paths. Apart from the natural wildlife there are ostriches, bobcats, nutria and alligators on display in cages and paddocks and peacocks roam the grounds. Bed and breakfast accommodation is available in four small 'trapper's cabins', adjacent to a small swamp. Each has its own front porch overlooking the water and ideal for gator watching. Staying overnight is a unique experience that kids will love.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Eat</h2>

Real Cajun food! Acadiana is the birthplace of Cajun food. Much of what is labeled "Cajun" elsewhere (including other parts of Louisiana!) has little to do with the delicious real thing.

Not to be confused with the Creole style of cooking native to &lt;a href="New%20Orleans"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/a&gt;, Cajun food is more provincial and less glamorous that its counterpart to the east. Equally rich to Creole food, Cajun dishes are often spicier as well. Cajun food also does not rely on the Tomato to the same degree as Creole food, and in foods common in both cuisines, the Cajun version is often a brown color compared to the Crole's red version. Some of the more notable Cajun food that visitors should sample in Acadiana are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Boudin♡❤♡: (pronounced "Boo Dan") A spicy sausage that descends from the 'boudin blanc' of French cuisine, it consists of a sausage casing filled with a mixture of rice, pork, liver, green onion, and other bits. First-timers should be sure to inquire as to the level of spiciness, since some varieties can pack a lot of heat. Boudin filling can also be rolled into balls, breaded, and then deep fried to create boudin balls. Ask a local where to get the best boudin, they are often fiercely loyal to that of their favorite butcher shop or restaurant. While pork is usual, crawfish or shrimp boudin is sometimes seen.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Cracklin':♡❤♡ The Cajun version of pork rinds, they are ofter heartier and much spicier than other varieties. Most trips to get boudin aren't complete without an accompanying small grease-soaked brown bag of cracklins for the trip home.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Crawfish:♡❤♡ Whatever you do, don't call them "crayfish." Crawfish are a local delicacy to Louisiana, and in particular for Acadiana. The neighboring town of Breaux Bridge proclaims itself the "Crawfish Capital of the World," and residents of the region eagerly await the return of crawfish season every year. Crawfish is served in a variety of ways in Cajun cooking. Étouffée is a dish consisting of the meat of the crustacean smothered in butter, onions, peppers, and spices, and finally served over white rice. Fried crawfish is also another popular option. Perhaps the most popular method of cooking is a crawfish boil, which like the clam bakes of more northernly destinations, is part meal, part communal celebration. Large quantities of live crawfish are boiled in heavily-seasoned water, along with potatoes, corn, and onions (also meant to be eaten later). The finished product is then often poured out on a large table for everyone to grab a seat and dig in. Locals have different techniques for peeling the hard shells, and they are eager to teach any newcomer their particular method. Some say the "fat" sucked out of the head is the best part, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Gumbo:♡❤♡ While gumbo can be sampled in New Orleans and other destinations, residents of Acadiana often insist their regional version of the thick stew-like dish is the true version. Some noticeable differences include darker roux and the lack of tomatoes (which are seen in New Orleans gumbo due to the history of Italian immigration in the city). Two main varieties of Cajun gumbo include seafood (often with shrimp, crab, oysters, and sometimes crawfish) and chicken and andouille sausage (a slightly different version with duck replacing the chicken is lesser known but equally delicious).
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Jambalaya:♡❤♡ An easy way to think of this oddly-named dish is basically Cajun paella. It always consists of rice, vegetables, spices, and some kind of meat. Types of meat often include chicken, sausage, shrimp, or tasso (a smoked, cured, and spiced cut of pork).
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Rice &amp; gravy:♡❤♡ A staple crop of South Louisiana (the town of Crowley calls itself the "Rice Capital of the World"), rice is more important to Cajun cooking than probably any other European-derived American cuisine. It is served with étouffée and gumbo, mixed with spices and liver to make "dirty rice,"and paired with red beans and sausage for a famous Louisiana dish. In the case of rice and gravy, the white rice (most often long grain), serves as a starch addition to braised or smothered meat with gravy. Most often made with pork cutlets, the gravy is made with meat drippings, onions, peppers, and spices. Rice-based dishes trace their roots to a time when the Cajun people of Louisiana often needed to stretch what little meat and vegetables they had into a full meal. Today rice and gravy dishes are more of a comfort food, but they can be bought as "plate lunches" as various small eateries and even the corner grocery store or deli.

</ul>
In addition to these several true Cajun dishes, there are many other items which are unique to Acadiana and can be found, at least in an authentic form, no where else in the world, as well as beloved Southern dishes such as fried chicken and frog legs.

<h2>Drink</h2>
Many enjoy a cold beer with Cajun food or music. Lafayette's Parish Brewing Company concentrates on quality small batch brews, including the popular Canebrake wheat beer brewed with local sugarcane. The Bayou Teche Beer company in Arnaudville sells multiple varieties brewed at the Mississippi brewery Lazy Magnolia. Also popular in Acadiana is Abita Beer, from &lt;a href="Abita%20Springs"&gt;Abita Springs&lt;/a&gt; in Acadiana's neighbor to the east, the &lt;a href="Florida%20Parishes"&gt;Florida Parishes&lt;/a&gt;. As in all of Louisiana, whiskey is also popular.

While famous for its drive-through daiquiri shops, Louisiana does have an open container law - please wait until you've reached your destination to crack open that frozen deliciousness. When you tour a plantation, depending on the plantation's own rules, visitors over age 21 may purchase an alcoholic beverage and drink it while taking a tour, walking the grounds, etc. This is also true for some swamp tours and golf outings.

<h1>Acadia National Park</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.nps.gov/acad/"&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is the only &lt;a href="United%20States%20National%20Parks"&gt;United States National Park&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="New%20England"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt;. It is on the coast of the &lt;a href="Down%20East"&gt;Down East&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Maine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;, near the town of &lt;a href="Bar%20Harbor"&gt;Bar Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Acadia NP encompasses more than , 30,300 of which are on &lt;a href="Mount%20Desert%20Island"&gt;Mount Desert Island&lt;/a&gt;. 2,728 acres of the park lie on Isle au Haut and 2,266 more on the &lt;a href="Winter%20Harbor"&gt;Schoodic Peninsula in Winter Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.

Acadia is one of the smaller national parks in the country, yet it attracts nearly 3 million visitors per year. It is important that those who do visit and explore this wonderful park follow some basic guidelines in order to keep the park as clean, natural, and undisturbed as possible. Please review the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="leave-no-trace%20camping"&gt;Leave No Trace&lt;/a&gt; principles♡❤♡ if you're planning a trip, and remember them while you are having a great vacation. Help keep Acadia the way it should be.

<h3>History</h3>

It was designated as ♡❤♡Sieur de Monts National Monument♡❤♡ in 1916 by presidential proclamation. Congress renamed the park ♡❤♡Lafayette National Park♡❤♡ in 1919. Congress again enacted a name change in 1929 to the name we now use, ♡❤♡Acadia National Park♡❤♡. It was the first NP established east of the Mississippi River.

In October 1947, Acadia and some adjacent lands were ravaged by fire.

<h3>Landscape</h3>
A quick look at any topographical map of &lt;a href="Mount%20Desert%20Island"&gt;Mount Desert Island&lt;/a&gt; will indicate the powerful and lasting effects of the last ice age on the island and the current landscape of ♡❤♡Acadia♡❤♡. As the last glacier receded over 18,000 years ago it left behind the elongated mountains and lakes we see today. The moving ice was also the culprit behind the "bald" summits of most of the park's hilltops, scraping off vegetation and leaving the beautiful pink granite underneath.

<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>

More than 273 bird species have been identified in the park, including bald eagles, peregrine falcons, blue jays, finches, and chickadees (the &lt;a href="Maine"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; state bird). Mammal species include deer, squirrels, foxes, rabbits, porcupines and bats. Other species include garter snakes, the American bullfrog, and the North American red-bellied salamander.

<h3>Climate</h3>

&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Climate/style.css" /&gt;

Acadia's weather is largely a product of latitude and marine influences. On a daily and annual basis, Mount Desert Island temperatures are more moderate than those of inland Maine. The Maine coastal climate has been ranked second only to the Pacific Northwest in annual precipitation. This moisture occurs in every form at Acadia. Ice storms are regular in winter and early spring, and rain is frequent in every month. Fog is common during June, July, and August.

♡❤♡Spring♡❤♡ can be foggy with temperatures ranging between and . Wear light-colored clothing, long sleeve shirts, and long pants for protection. Annual rainfall is .

♡❤♡Summer♡❤♡ daytime temperatures range from to . Evenings are cooler. Dressing in layers is advisable for any boating or hiking activities. Ocean water temperatures range from to . Lake water temperatures range from to .

♡❤♡Fall♡❤♡ temperatures can range from low 70s during the day to freezing during the night. Come prepared for all types of weather, from sun to fog, from downpours to flurries. Fall foliage often peaks during the first couple of weeks in October. Weather conditions over the summer, such as drought, may alter the time that the leaves peak.

In the ♡❤♡winter♡❤♡, due to Acadia's coastal location, snow and weather conditions change rapidly. Temperatures vary from mid-30s to below zero. The park averages of snow annually. For the latest in weather information, call the local weather phone line at +1 207-667-8910 or call the park at +1 207-288-3338.

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>Land activities</h3>

There is an extensive network of carriage roads throughout Acadia National Park, which are closed to automobiles and are excellent places to ♡❤♡ride your bicycle♡❤♡. The carriage roads are mostly paved with crushed stone and, therefore, are best navigated on a mountain or hybrid bicycle. Another option for cyclists is the ~20 mile (32 km) long Park Loop Road, which encircles much of the eastern portion of the park. The road is open to automobiles, but is a one-way, two-lane road for much of its length. The Park Loop Road appears to have been re-paved in 2008, making for a very smooth, pleasant ride. Bikes can be rented in Bar Harbor.

Acadia has the best ♡❤♡day hiking♡❤♡ in the Eastern U.S. Walking the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/hiking.htm"&gt;miles of trails&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best ways to experience the park. Immerse yourself in the flora and fauna of the island on a number of different hikes of various environment, length, and difficulty. These trails are stunning, with high ocean views, accessible tree lines, steep precipices, stone bridges, etc.

Acadia is a great place to ♡❤♡birdwatch♡❤♡, with many species calling the park home including bald eagles, peregrine falcons, great blue herons, cranes, ducks, geese, chickadees, woodpeckers, owls, orioles and blue jays can be seen in the park. For an extensive checklist and more info on birdwatching opportunities in Acadia, see the &lt;a href="https%3A//www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/birdwatching.htm"&gt;NPS's birdwatching page&lt;/a&gt;.

The park is one of the darkest spots on the East Coast and on a clear night ♡❤♡stargazers♡❤♡ can see the Milky Way in all of its glory. Drive into the park after dark, find a safe place to stop along one of the park roads or parking lots where you're not crowded in by trees or lights, get out and look up. You will not be disappointed.

<h3>Water activities</h3>

The last glacier of 18,000 years ago carved out the incredible and beautiful terrain of the park, leaving behind some of the cleanest lakes and ponds in the country. ♡❤♡Sea kayaking♡❤♡ tours and boat rental services are offered from numerous establishments in &lt;a href="Bar%20Harbor"&gt;Bar Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and allow access to &lt;a href="Mount%20Desert%20Island"&gt;Mount Desert Island&lt;/a&gt; and other destinations.

♡❤♡Fishing♡❤♡ is allowed in the park in accordance with the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nps.gov/acad/planyourvisit/fishing.htm"&gt;park regulations&lt;/a&gt;. While ocean fishing is open to all, fishing in freshwater lakes and ponds requires a Maine state fishing license. Licenses are required for residents aged 16 and up and non-residents 12 and up, and can be purchased at town offices and a few local shops.

Some ponds and lakes are used for drinking water and do not allow swimming; check park office for list of approved swimming locations.

<h2>Drink</h2>

<h2>Sleep</h2>

<h3>Lodging</h3>

There are no hotels within the park borders, but the nearby town of &lt;a href="Bar%20Harbor"&gt;Bar Harbor&lt;/a&gt; has numerous options.

No hook-ups or utilities. Showers available nearby (fee).&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;$20 drive in, $14 walk-in tent&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Duck Harbor Campground♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +1 207-288-3338 (reservations) &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Duck Harbor Campground is on Isle au Haut, a rugged island off the coast of Stonington, Maine. Remote and inaccessible to automobiles, Isle au Haut is linked to the mainland by mailboat. Five primitive sites are available at Duck Harbor from May 15 to October 15 by advance reservation, and stays are limited to 3-5 days depending on the season. You must have a reservation to camp. Camping is permitted in designated sites only, and party size is limited to six persons per site. Facilities include five lean-to shelters, three-sided with roof and floor. Dimensions are 8' tall, 8' deep, and 12.5' wide. Use of tents is limited to what can fit inside the shelters. There is also a composting toilet and hand pump for water that is 1,600 feet from shelters. Reservations are recommended well in advance, but are not accepted before April 1st. Access to Isle au Haut is via limited passenger ferry service; Confirm boat schedule with &lt;a href="http%3A//www.isleauhaut.com/"&gt;Isle au Haut Ferry Company&lt;/a&gt; (207) 367-6516, before reserving a campsite. Campers should be prepared to hike five miles to reach camp from Town Landing, if the ferry is not scheduled to continue on to Duck Harbor on date of arrival.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;A $25 special use permit fee must accompany each reservation request form regardless of how many nights you wish to camp. There is no additional camping fee&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h3>Backcountry</h3>

Backcountry camping is not permitted (and strongly discouraged due to the fragile ecosystem) in Acadia National Park.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- It is unsafe to venture out onto ♡❤♡Maine's coastal waters♡❤♡ without having the necessary equipment and experience. This is true of kayaking, canoeing, sailing or any other kind of boating. The water is cold and hypothermia can set in in a short amount of time. Dense fog often rolls in very quickly as well as the occasional storm.

</ul>
If you are determined to go out on your own, it would be foolish and could result in serious fines from the Coast Guard or a Marine Patrol officer to do so without ♡❤every single passenger:♡❤ 
<ul>
BULLET::::- wearing a PFD ♡❤♡and/or♡❤♡
BULLET::::- having a compass and knowing how to use it ♡❤♡and/or♡❤♡
BULLET::::- understanding how to navigate safely around other boats and water hazards

</ul>
There are numerous companies on &lt;a href="Mount%20Desert%20Island"&gt;Mount Desert Island&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere that offer guided sea kayak, sailing, and power boat tours.

<h1>Acadian Coast</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡The Acadian Coast♡❤♡ (French: ♡❤la Côte Acadienne♡❤) covers the eastern coast of &lt;a href="New%20Brunswick"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt;.

The Acadian Coast extends eastward from Campbellton/Pointe-à-la-Croix along the south shore of the Baie de Chaleurs, a warm bay which continues past Caraquet. This region has a strong francophone heritage, in sharp contrast to the United Empire Loyalist roots of more southern New Brunswick communities such as Fredericton.

<h2>Cities</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — a mining, fishing and forestry centre with access to some beautiful wilderness areas

<h2>Understand</h2>
Much of what is now &lt;a href="New%20Brunswick"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt; was once &lt;a href="Acadia"&gt;Acadia&lt;/a&gt;, a French-speaking colony in North America which was defeated by the English in the 1750s. Great Britain demanded Acadia pledge allegiance; the Acadians refused out of fear they would be forced to attack the &lt;a href="Qu%C3%A9bec"&gt;Nouvelle France&lt;/a&gt; colony on behalf of the English and claimed neutrality. The English retaliated with mass deportations, known as ♡❤le grand dérangement de 1755♡❤. Some Acadians settled as far afield as &lt;a href="Louisiana"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, some returned to France. A few, displaced from points in southern New Brunswick such as ♡❤Fort Beauséjour♡❤, fled north to establish the clandestine precursors of what is now Caraquet in 1757.

The people of the Acadian Coast region speak French as their first language, however many Acadians (particularly those south of the Miramichi Bay and Bathurst, Gloucester County regions) can speak fluent English.

<h1>Acapulco</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Acapulco♡❤♡ is ♡❤the♡❤ original &lt;a href="Mexico"&gt;Mexican&lt;/a&gt; resort town. Still, it remains a major destination and a worthwhile trip and is the number two Mexican spring break destination among U.S. college students.

<h2>Get in</h2>

Many buses go from major cities (e.g. Mexico City) to Acapulco. Most buses are safe, fast and comfortable and usually not very expensive. Some bus lines offer student discounts. The Estrella de Oro bus line offers nonstop trips from Mexico City with service more like First Class on an airline: roomy seats, ride attendants, snacks and drinks, and free movies (♡❤The Lake House♡❤ and ♡❤Superman Returns♡❤ on a recent trip). A regular Estrella de Oro (double-decker) one-way ride is M$395 (&lt;a href="Mexico%23Currency"&gt;pesos&lt;/a&gt;) (about US$20), while upgraded VIP bus service is M$520. VIP service includes a marble lounge inside the regular Acapulco bus terminal with TVs, drinks, and newspapers. Depending on the bus, the ride takes 5 to 5 1/2&amp;nbsp;hours in comfort. Be warned: they search you and pat you down for weapons before leaving.

There is a modern four-lane highway from Mexico City to Acapulco (Autopista del Sol). It is somewhat expensive, but will take you there in 3 1/2 hours, approximately, if you don't stop on the way. The Autopista is not continuous; there is a break in two sections where the road is rougher, so a car with good tires is a must. However, before you decide to drive to Acapulco, remember that traffic and parking in the city are difficult.

Travelers by bus or car should note the cautions in "Stay safe" below.

Juan N. Alvarez International Airport (ACA) &lt;a href="http%3A//www.oma.aero/es/aeropuertos/acapulco/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is well connected domestically and internationally. Flights from Mexico City to Acapulco take approximately 35&amp;nbsp;minutes and ground transportation from the airport to the major tourist area of La Costera takes more or less the same time. Round-trip fares depending on the season and class, range from USD$23 to USD$50.

<h2>Get around</h2>

♡❤♡Taxis♡❤♡ are everywhere in Acapulco. Since they are unmetered, make sure that you agree on a fare before entering. Always negotiate; they can smell tourist money a mile away. The old Volkswagen beetle cabs are cheaper than newer air-conditioned cars. Shared Cabs (usually white with yellow) run between major destinations and are very convenient. They usually display their destination in large letters and charge a flat fee of M$12, irrespective of distance. You should not have to pay more than M$50 per cab ride within the Costera area but fares can reach as much as M$120 for rides from La Costera to La Quebrada, Princess Hotel (Revolcadero Beach) and the airport. Alternatively most hotels can arrange for taxi transportation for a fixed fare (usually inflated). Prices will usually be about 50% more expensive than for a taxi hailed on the street.

There are several public transportation options: Yellow cabs are 12 pesos per person; buses are M$8 for non-air-conditioned, M$9.50 for air-conditioned, and M$10 (after buying a card for M$10) for AcaBus, a new system started in January 2017. Because of the sheer amount of taxis here, when one is dining out it is often worthwhile for them to offer a round trip and simply wait around while you have your meal, and they will not charge extra.

♡❤♡Buses♡❤♡ are worth experiencing even if you don´t want to travel on them. Destinations are printed on the front window of each bus. There is no need to be at one of the regular bus stops in order to get on, except for AcaBus. Just wave your arm or look at the driver. He will stop and encourage you to get in. In fact, drivers will stop and try to get you to ride with them if you are even walking in the same direction that they are driving in. The bus system in Acapulco has been fully privatised - each bus is privately owned. This means they can decorate them however they want. Pink buses cruise around blaring out traditional Mexican music, racing against ones decked out in UV lights pulsing out club music into the night air. The complete lack of suspension makes for an unforgettable ride.

♡❤♡Private autos♡❤♡ It is generally unwise to try to drive yourself around Acapulco. Traffic is heavy and drivers aggressive, parking is scarce, streets do not run in a neat grid, and even change names unexpectedly. Most, if not all streets lack signs indicating their name. In addition, foreign tourists driving rental cars can become targets of the Acapulco police officers, who will accept payment (~M$400) for violations in person at the time of pullover, without providing a receipt or proof of violation or clearing of the violation.

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡La Quebrada Cliff Divers♡❤♡ - No visit to Acapulco is complete without watching the cliff divers perform their impressive jumps into the shallow stream of water of dangerous tides that forms in the bottom part of La Quebrada. They have been doing it since 1934. You can see the dives from a small platform by the cliff for a small entrance fee, or eat at the La Perla restaurant which offers a good view of the divers. Showtime at 1PM, 7:30PM, 8:30PM and 9:30PM.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Zócalo♡❤♡ - Zócalo, Acapulco's town square, lies on the western side of La Costera. It's cool, shady and peaceful during the daytime. There are two fountains and many mature, multi-trunked trees that are a sight in themselves. The Zócalo tends to expose more local culture than other, more tourist-centric, areas. Zócalo contains Acapulco's cathedral, as well as many restaurants ranging in size from sidewalk bistros and tiny street-corner kitchens. Many of the smaller restaurants will provide full dinners for as little as M$35. The Zócalo at night is worth experiencing. Between 8:00 and 11PM the place is flooded with locals &amp; chilangoes. Clowns entertain the crowd for tips. One is dressed as some sort of aztec warrior/statue thing. He is silver from head to toe.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Pie de la Cuesta♡❤♡ - Pie de la Cuesta is a quiet strip of land roughly 6&amp;nbsp;miles northwest of Acapulco, bordered on one side by the Pacific Ocean and on the other by a freshwater lake (Laguna de Cuyoca) on the other. The lagoon is extremely tranquil, but tourists are advised not to enter the Pacific Ocean at Pie de la Cuesta, because the surf is very dangerous. One can reach Pie de la Cuesta via bus. If you are on the Bay Side along the Costera, between Escudero and Diego Mendoza, look for the bus that says Pie de la Cuesta PLAYA LUCES. These go up that narrow strip of land. You can also take one that says San Isidro and that will let you off in the Zócalo in Pie de la Cuesta, but you have to walk a couple blocks to the strip and about a half kilometer up to the lagoon.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Puerto Marqués♡❤♡ - Located at a smaller bay just east of Acapulco, Puerto Marqués sees much less tourist traffic than Acapulco. One side of the bay is completely covered by adjacent beach-side restaurants offering very reasonably priced food and beer. The restaurant owners (as well as most other locals) are very friendly to tourists and some will offer discounts or a free round of beer to groups. Tourists and locals alike munch on shrimp enchiladas, sip negra modelos, wade in the waters, and enjoy the breathtaking sunsets. Fewer locals speak English in Puerto Marqués than in Acapulco, so it is recommended that visitors speak some rudimentary Spanish. One can reach Puerto Marqués via bus.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Isla de la Roqueta♡❤♡ - Isla de la Roqueta has a beautiful beach with shallow areas for families to play. You can get there by water taxi (around US$3.50) or the glass-bottom harbour tour boat (around US$7) from Caleta Beach. The harbour tour provides many sightseeing opportunities as well as seeing the yachts and homes of the rich and famous. As well, you can experience the cliff-divers’ show at La Quebrada, the submarine Virgin of Guadalupe, and see a diver with the tour swim under the boat with food to attract fish. If you don’t pack food while on your tour, there is a great opportunity to have lunch by way of a boat restaurant that comes alongside the boat and prepares your order. Just be prepared to wait depending on the number of people on the tour with you. Once on Isla de la Roquet there are numerous well-maintained trails, a lighthouse and beautiful snorkeling spots - but they can be rough (if this doesn’t suit you, your best bet would be to go to the Camino Real for snorkeling). And the bonus, you can take as much time as you want as the tour company’s boats dock throughout the day.

</ul>
<h3>Beaches</h3>

Most beaches are in the bay area fronting the main boulevard "La Costera". This bay area is what made Acapulco famous and its beauty and majesty have not faded over the years. Some of the most popular beaches inside the Bay and lining the Costera are Hornos, the traditional "afternoon beach", Papagayo, Tamarindos, and Icacos. Condesa beach at the east end of the bay is gay friendly. Caleta/Caletilla beaches and Langosta Beach are on the open ocean, and usually a bit cleaner. Most hotels in Acapulco are found along the Costera, and prices generally go down as you move west toward the Zócalo and old Acapulco.

Another open water beach, more suitable for surfing, lies in front of the Fairmont Acapulco Princess and Fairmont Pierre Marqués Hotels. Playa Revolcadero is east of Acapulco, closer to the airport. The wave action is much higher than inside the bay or at Caleta/Caletilla, which are protected by La Roqueta island. Transportation from La Costera takes about 35&amp;nbsp;minutes through a winding and scenic road.

Don't miss Barra Vieja, approximately 20 minutes past the airport coming from the Costera (M$500–$800 for a cab all day).

<h2>Do</h2>

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡CICI♡❤♡ - a water park right by the main beach. Especially nice for kids. Entrance is M$100 and it features many different pools and slides, a Skycoaster (a mix between a swing and a bungee jump) and a dolphinarium. Dolphin shows are on offer, and so is one hour swims with the dolphins - a lifetime memory for US$120.

</ul>
There are several more attractions, including golf courses, night clubs and post-Hispanic fortifications. Nightlife in Acapulco is pretty much fun, and many places are suited for tourism including "El Alebrije", "Disco Beach" and "Palladium", this last having an awe-inspiring sight of the whole bay of Acapulco.

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Señor Frog's♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Señor Frog's is a party place; outside you will see signs that read "Drunk Crossing"; from that you can infer what this place is like.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Kookaburra♡❤♡ - Also good food with a great view of the city.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡La Perla♡❤♡ - La Perla's claim to fame is that it provides a wonderful view of the cliff divers. A buffet breakfast is M$110 and includes Mexican breakfast specialties such as chilaquiles (fried tortilla pieces with scrambled eggs,cheese,chicken and salsa), sopas, and chicharones (pork rinds), with yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit, tropical juices, Mexican pastellitas (little coffee cakes) and seasonal treats such as a whole roasted piglet. Before the divers' show, you stand a good chance of a getting a serenade from a wandering trio of mariachis. (Tipping recommended, and they also take requests.)
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡100% Natural♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A Mexican chain of restaurants in many locations throughout the city, including the beach. They specialize in traditional Mexican food prepared with a healthy slant and different sorts of tropical and nutritional juice blends. A hearty, tasty breakfast ranges between M$35 and 70, not including a juice drink. Very clean, with prompt service.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡El Nopalito♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;calle la paz&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;zocalo&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +52 744 188 9711 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A traditional Mexican family restaurant, the most authentic one downtown, this is the real deal, real Mexican taste. They specialize in traditional Mexican food and some South American dishes that have been introduced to Mexico during the years. Everything is prepared with food obtained from local food providers instead of supermarkets, which makes eating there an economical support to fair trade.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;M$35 a meal, handmade tortillas and fruit water included (as of Jan 2013)&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Drink</h2>
In the past few years Acapulco has become a preferred destination for spring breakers, with tens of thousands of students descending upon this resort town to drink away the sorrows of midterms in a multitude of bars and clubs. The fancier places may have long queues outside and will probably not let you in if you wear shorts and/or sneakers.
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡El Alebrije♡❤♡ claims to be the largest night club in Latin America, capable of holding over 5,000 people. The crowd is fairly young, around 18-25. Foam party on Fridays. Cover is M$400 for men and M$350 for women with a free open bar until 5 AM. Be prepared to tip if you plan on drinking heavily. If arriving by car, you can park in the Walmart 24&amp;nbsp;hour carpark just up the road and save on the valet parking charges.
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Palladium♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Is the other super club in Acapulco. It is in Las Brisas, perched on top of a cliff overlooking Acapulco. The large panoramic glass wall which forms one side of the dancefloor is very impressive. Prices are about the same as in Alebrije, drinks included in the cover charge. Tipping is also a good idea at Palladium; one group saw non-tippers wait 20&amp;nbsp;minutes for service and tippers serviced immediately.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Mandara♡❤♡ It's a smaller version of Palladium, owned by the same people, but instead of electronic you get hip-hop and reggaetón.
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Baby'O♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Is one of Acapulco's perennial favorites. Baby'O is by far the most luxurious (and expensive) club in Acapulco and is favored especially by the 18 to 35 set of Mexico City's upper-class. Here, you will be able to revel in luxury. Expect to pay at least a M$600 cover charge and M$80-150 for a drink.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Classico del Mar♡❤♡ is relatively new. It quickly became the favorite for locals and chilangos. It's not as expensive as Baby'O but it doesn't have open bar as Alebrije, Palladium or Mandara. The most interesting part about this club is that it has 3 levels: Level 1 looks like a regular club with a lot of mirrors, a colored-lights dance floor, and theater boxes. Level 2 has a small bar and the restrooms. Level 3 is a Deck with huge screens on the walls, tables separated by curtains, and a cliff view. The floor, tables, bar, everything is made of wood and the place is not enclosed, so if it rains they won't let you up. If you decide to go there, be sure to ask for a table here; its the best part of the club but, it might get a little hot.

</ul>
♡❤La Costera♡❤, Acapulco's main street along the coast, is full of bars and clubs:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Ibiza♡❤♡ is a lounge club on the beach which is very pleasant and often frequented by locals. It plays mainly electronic music.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Disco Beach♡❤♡ is very popular with foreign visitors and locals. Its main attraction is a dance floor fronting the Condesa beach (the main beach).
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Barbarroja♡❤♡ is a bar/club in the shape of an old pirate ship that caters mainly to the 30 and over crowd. Also conveniently located by the Condesa beach.

Friendly managers as of 2005. Inexpensive, with excellent showers and plenty of hammocks, internet access and a small bar. Outside of Acapulco proper, but that means it's near a quiet beach; a cab ride into the disco zone is about M$10.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡La Mision♡❤♡, clean room, clean sheets, painted brick, and cold showers. The rooms range from one bed to three. 2 blocks outside Zócalo. The staff does not speak English. A basic breakfast may be purchased from the kitchen, though there is a multitude of small restaurants nearby. Depending on the time you stay, you may be able to negotiate M$200 per person per night (regardless of the number of rooms occupied).
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Hotel Vital♡❤♡, the rooms are very clean and come with AC, cable, and their own bathrooms with hot water. There is wireless internet in the lobby and a covered pool off the side of the lobby. There is also a kitchen, but there are plenty of restaurants in the area. The hotel is less than a five minute walk from the beach, right across from the bungee jump. The managers are friendly, but do not speak English. M$150 for a room with one queen sized bed. If you find a friendly taxi driver who speaks some English he can probably help you out. It can be difficult to find because it's on a minor street. The address is Calle Piedra Picuda No. 50 Fracc. Condessa (♡❤frente al bungy♡❤).

<h3>Splurge</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Fairmont Acapulco Princess♡❤♡, A very large property spread across hundreds of acres of landscaped gardens and golf course with more than 1,000 hotel rooms in three towers. It is built like an Aztec Pyramid and has excellent views of the beach. Like any Fairmont hotel, it is expensive - but well worth the money. It is about half a mile away from the main road linking the Airport to the La Costera. If you walk down to the main road - you will find a McDonald's and a Wal-Mart Supercenter - very effective in negating the steep food prices in Princess.
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Grand Hotel Acapulco♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Av.

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Las Brisas♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A complex of ´Casitas´ at the top of a hill overlooking the bay. A private beach club helps avoid the masses (and the rubbish floating in the water). The only issue is that it is a long way out of town - it´s not possible to walk anywhere. Taxi drivers are aware that the resort is expensive and therefore massively overcharge customers who go there, but Las Brisas also rents their iconic pink jeeps to guests.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Las Torres Gemelas♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Costera Miguel Aleman 93&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +52 744 474 99 95 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Condominium/hotel complex translating to "The Twin Towers" in the middle of hotel district. Constructed in 1975 and renovated in 2002, offers a kitchenette in every room. The hotel gets some pretty rough reviews around the hotel review sites.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Las Torres Gemelas Private Suites♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Costera Miguel Aleman 93&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +52 744 481 25 16 &lt;/bdi&gt; , &lt;abbr title="email" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;✉&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;span class="email listing-email"&gt; reservations@ltgps.com &lt;/span&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A new boutique suite hotel privately owned and independent from Las Torres Gemelas although located in the same twin towers. All suites are luxury suites with complete kitchen, US &amp; Canadian satellite HDTV, flat screen HDTV's, surround sound systems, free high speed internet and all new modern furnishings.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Stay safe</h2>
 

For an average tourist, a more common danger comes from local police. Bribery and extortion can be encountered at every step. For example, if you are driving a nice clean car (doesn't matter if it's a rental) you can expect with high probability to be stopped and blamed for driving through red lights (even if the traffic lights were turned off), not using mirrors, using traffic lanes wrongly or other minor infractions.

<h2>Cope</h2>

BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Ixtapan%20de%20la%20Sal"&gt;Ixtapan de la Sal&lt;/a&gt; is about an hour past Taxco on the way to Toluca. It boasts a perfect climate and thermal waters. There are modern water parks, spas, and a variety of folk health services. Caution as above.

<h1>Accra</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.ama.gov.gh/"&gt;Accra&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is the capital city of &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Accra has a population of 2,291,352 (in 2012). The local language is Ga but Twi (pron. 'ch-wee'), Ewe (pron. ayvay) Hausa, and English are also widely spoken. Accra has rich western looking buildings and dusty shanty towns.

<h3>History</h3>

Founded in the 17th century by the Ga people, Accra became the capital of the British Gold Coast in 1877. Following Ghana's independence in 1957, Accra became the capital of the newly independent state.

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>By plane</h3>
&lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;b&gt; ACC &lt;/b&gt; ) is a major hub, with international connections from North America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, along with internal connections to Kumasi, Tamale and Takoradi, and regional connections to virtually every West African country.

From the United States, Delta Air Lines operates four times weekly flights directly from &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York-JFK&lt;/a&gt;. From there, it is possible to connect to all major North, South, and Latin American cities, and the Caribbean. South African Airways also operates a service from Washington-Dulles, which continues on to Johannesburg.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.arikair.com/"&gt;Arik Air&lt;/a&gt; is a very cheap way to reach Accra from various locations in Africa. Emirates and Turkish Airlines also both operate into Accra, from their respective hubs in Dubai and Istanbul.

British Airways operates a daily service to London Heathrow. KLM also operates a daily service to Amsterdam, and from there can connect to almost all European destinations. TAP Portugal has a direct service to Lisbon, Lufthansa runs a daily service to and from Frankfurt, Brussels Airlines operates a service to Brussels most days of the week and Meridiana has regular services to Milan.

<h4>Transport from the airport</h4>

There is an official taxi stand. Make sure you find it, if you want a regulated fare. Otherwise, expect to be taken for a ♡❤very♡❤ expensive ride. On the upside, though, the expensive/illegal car touts usually put you in a nicer car with a professional driver, and you get to skip any potential taxi confusion—you decide! Better yet, walk out to the main road and get a taxi for a the real price.

<h3>By train</h3>

Although rehabilitation of the rail network is a priority of the government there's just one line operating. Regional commuter trains ply the route from the nearby industrial city of &lt;a href="Tema"&gt;Tema&lt;/a&gt;, of limited interest to the tourist, several times a day. &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is on Kwame Nkrumah Ave.

<h2>Get around</h2>
 
<h3>SUV or car with driver</h3>

Accra's best attractions are scattered across a relatively wide area, so if you can afford the modest prices the best thing to do is hire a car and driver to take you around. Travel companies offer drivers who double as well-informed guides, which helps as interpretive exhibits and brochures (if you can find them) leave much to be desired.

If you need an SUV or a sedan there are plenty of affordable options because even the best drivers earn only about US$15 a day in Accra. You can book directly from Avis and local rental companies at the larger hotels, such as the Golden Tulip, La Palm, or La Badi Beach. Cars are available on short notice but if you want a van or SUV it is best to book ahead. Rates for car and driver are about US$9 an hour. For a US$75 you can book a 10 hour day, but fuel is extra. Rates increase if you leave metro Accra, which is fair because poor roads add to the wear and tear on the vehicle. Toyota Land Cruisers are a popular choice and are widely available.

<h3>On foot</h3>

Though the city is fairly spread out, Accra is relatively safe to walk around during the day (and night, in many areas). Watch out for open sewers, automobiles, (even in the city) when walking the streets.

<h3>By taxi</h3>
To flag a taxi wave your arm with your finger pointed down to the ground. On a busy street you will have many taxis driving past trying to offer you their service by honking at you. There are very few Ghanaian cabs with meters. You must negotiate how much you are willing to pay before you start the trip. It is generally 3 cedis within the centre of town and 5-7 cedis to the airport or Accra Mall from the center. A rough mileage rate would be 1.5 cedis per mile. Try to ask someone local how much a trip to a certain location usually costs. Also make sure to haggle hard as most taxi drivers will often try to charge three times (or more) the going rate to foreigners. Relax, and don't show urgency. If the first taxi won't come down on his price, wait for another as they are plentiful. Do have an idea of your route: taxi drivers navigate by landmarks, e.g. traffic circles, traffic lights, petrol stations - not street names - and make sure you have a local simcard in your phone so you can ring someone at your destination and pass the phone to the taxi driver.

Taxis do not have to be so private, though, and it's exceedingly rare for Ghanaians to hire one privately (although they will assume that foreigners want a private one). The rate is in theory one fourth of a private ride, but, again, foreigners taking a private ride tend to get taken for a little extra. It's more confusing, to be sure, but chances are they are going in the direction they are already headed, and you can just ask if they're going towards a major landmark, especially a market.

The problem with taxis, aside from the constant honking at foreigners, is that they ♡❤♡don't know their way around♡❤♡ Accra. No really, they won't have any idea where you want to go. They can't figure out maps either. The landmarks used by locals and cab drivers in no way align with those that are relevant to outsiders. Even worse, the cab drivers usually live kind of far outside the city center, and usually aren't even familiar with basic neighborhood names or the biggest attractions like Independence Square! Some useful landmarks that they will know are the major markets, Osu Castle, the Stadium, the financial center (Cedi Tower), the major traffic circles along Ring Rd, and major street names, from which you can try and direct them to where you want to go. Now, if you don't already know your way around, it's tough.

<h3>Metered taxi</h3>

There are some taxis with meters in them. These are generally more expensive, but you can be a little more sure about how much they will cost.

<h3>Tro Tro</h3>

TroTros are usually very crowded and dilapidated minivans ad minibuses that act as the city's public transit system. TroTros travel along a well known routes in the city, and stop at various points along the way (some stops have signs, others don't). As a TroTro approaches a stop, a "mate" (the driver's assistant) will usually yell out the side of the window where the TroTro is going. Many people die in trotro accidents every year, however typically those that die in trotro accidents die on highways in rural areas. Accidents causing death in Accra are relatively rare, in part due to traffic congestion.

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡National Museum♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Closed for renovation as of Dec 2018. Highly worthwhile, the National Museum offers visitors a look at Ghanaian history and culture from prehistory to the present. Cultural exhibits include clothing, thrones, carvings, paintings, pottery, and a variety of instruments and tools used in various rituals. Each of these is accompanied by descriptions of their significance and meaning, so you can learn a lot if you take the time to read them! Historical exhibits feature some of the most influential and important parts of Ghana's history, particularly the slave trade. There is also a fascinating exhibit of the history of the Ghanaian currency.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;The park was created to honor Kwame Nkrumah, who led Ghana to its independence from Great Britain and became the nation's first president. Voted as Africa's "Man of the Millennium", he is a highly important figure of the 20th century. In the park you can see a monument dedicated to him, as well as his mausoleum, where he is buried.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

DuBois was a famous American author and Civil Rights activist who moved to Ghana near the end of his life feeling his efforts to create equality were all in vain and that America would never accept black people. Although the Centre itself is a research library, historical sites and monuments are scattered about amidst the learning centers. The most interesting of them being House Number 22, which is where W.E.B. DuBois resided when he moved to Ghana, and his grave.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

They are used for funerals in the region and are part of many public or private collections of contemporary art around the world.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Osu Castle♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Built by the Danes in the 17th century for Sweden, it has changed hands under many rulers before the Danes were finally able to stake claim to the area and the castle. Before it was claimed by Denmark, it was used for trading precious metals, but once the Danes took power, it became a place to store slaves prior to shipping them. Later it became the headquarters of the Danish Gold Coast. Since that time, it has been used as a government building and when Ghana gained independence in 1957, it became the Presidential House. It remains the seat of government today, although there is controversy because of its ties to the slave trade. Visitors are able to go to the castle however, armed guards stand outside and they typically ♡❤♡don't allow photos to be taken♡❤♡. Rules about pictures change sporadically, but it's best (safest) not to try.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Labadi Beach♡❤♡ - One of the most popular beaches in Accra for tourists. Located between two of Accra's most expensive hotels—La Palm and La Badi Beach—this short stretch of the Atlantic Coast features several makeshift cafe-restaurants, lots of souvenir vendors, and if you are lucky (i.e. on good weather weekends) an amazing cast of characters who will entertain you with drumming, dancing, pony rides, and acrobatic performances. Some people actually go for a swim, but there's plenty to do on-shore. Don't miss it. (Warning: this is a prime-time venue, one highly "not recommended" after dark.) The beach is 'officially' accessible only from an entrance at La By-pass (Labadi Road) for a fee of 5 cedis. If you are a guest at La Palm or Labadi Beach Hotel you can access the beach for free through the back gate. Non-hotel guests can enjoy the facilities - pool, fitness, sauna - for 10 cedis a day at La Palm Royal Beach Hotel.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Jamestown♡❤♡ - Jamestown is the oldest part of Accra and remains an active fishing center. It is similar in many ways to &lt;a href="Zanzibar"&gt;Zanzibar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Stone%20Town"&gt;Stone Town&lt;/a&gt;, though it has not yet been restored, so it is not typically highlighted on tourist itineraries. Despite this, for many visitors, it is one of the most memorable sights in the city. Jamestown is a short distance west from Independence Square; from the busy street the only real sights are the lighthouse, a prison building housed inside an old colonial fort, and the old Customs House. From the lighthouse there is a road which takes you to the otherwise hidden delight: one of the largest working fishing harbors in Ghana. Go early in the morning and see dozens of small boats bring in the day's catch. It's best to find a friendly local guide so you don't miss the hidden alleys, old stone houses, and fantastic cliff-top harbor vistas.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡University of Ghana♡❤♡ - Ghana's largest university is in Legon and is accessible by Tro-Tros to Madina. It's a very charming and quiet place with old trees, a botanical garden (although you should be aware there have been reports of muggings and violent crime taking place in the gardens) and many small buildings surrounded by green grass. The Cafeterias are open to anybody and serve typical Ghanaian dishes.

Jerry Rawlings, who gets credit for the hotel's best feature, an authentic, Ghananian-inspired design theme. Somewhat sterile with a great location on the beach. 5 restaurants producing good food only in the hotel's flagship outdoor 'African Village' which is a charming breezy and architecturally distinctive venue. Sunday brunch is good, but dinner or drinks any night work equally well. Avoid the main dining room, room service, or Bali Hai, Equator, or other 'international' offerings. The pool is nice and there is WiFi. You'll appreciate the attentive staff, who make up for the indifferent management, awful food, and generally run-down facilities.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;From US$140&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

And the hotel's dining room offers impeccable food for breakfast lunch or dinner. The sleeping rooms are clean, airy, and well-furnished, complete with in-room broadband, and flat-screen cableTV.

African atmosphere, but with a buttoned-down Dutch efficiency. Downstairs lobby bar, pool-side dining, live music, and gallery of local artists. Business centre provides WiFi with Skype-capable bandwidth. The food is mostly just OK; unimaginative, but hygienically prepared. The rooms are small, a bit smelly, and very much in need of new carpets. The Chalets are the place to be if you decide to stay in this hotel, but they are generally held for those booking two weeks or more at a time. If you like to play tennis, the courts here will suit you just fine, provided you've bought your whites.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;€126&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

The lobby is all dark wood, leather sofa, campaign furniture and ceiling fans. Queen Elizabeth II slept here; and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. More recent guests include quite a few airline flight crews, and far-too many US government/military contractors who spend long hours at the bar each night boring other guests with their "thoughts" about Africa which are predictably a bit naïve, if not downright creepy. The pool and gardens are nice, the Western-style buffet is excellent, and the rooms are small but well-appointed, most with balconies. Best feature: it is on the beach at La Badi, so there is always something happening just footsteps away. It is a long drive from the centre of town or the airport. Unless you are in Ghana for a vacation, this isn't the best location.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;From US$180&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

The rooms are very large and very comfortable, the grounds are lovely and they include a swimming pool and fitness center, and the food is also reliably good. It is located a little farther afield than other similar hotels, but it is worth the extra 5 min drive to save on the price. Accra Mall is 3 min away by car, and there is a taxi stand immediately outside the hotel.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;US$220&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h3>Embassies and High Commissions</h3>
Being the national capital, Accra hosts several embassies and high commissions. A majority of them are clustered in Cantonments, North Ridge and in the Airport Residential Area (west of the airport) neighborhoods. They can be located elsewhere too. Other countries maintain (non-resident) diplomatic representation to Ghana through their embassy in Abduja or Lagos in Nigeria; Dakar, Abidjan, and/or elsewhere in Africa:

<h1>Accrington</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.visitlancashire.com/explore/accrington"&gt;Accrington&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is a town in East &lt;a href="Lancashire"&gt;Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; - the name probably means "acorns" from the oak woods that once carpeted these valleys. It grew during the industrial revolution, when the streams racing down from the Pennines powered its textile mills. It has a population of 70,000, many being Bangladeshis who came to work the mills in the 1950s. The town also produced Accrington Brick or ♡❤NORI♡❤ ("Iron" backwards), an exceptionally hard and acid-resistant brick, valuable for lining furnaces, chimneys and the like. The brickworks closed in 2008, were re-opened to political fanfare in 2015, and quietly closed again in 2016. The northern suburb of Ewbank gave its name to the carpet-sweeper manufacturer.

The town's main visitor attraction is the Tiffany glass collection in its art gallery, and the stark natural beauty of the Pennine moors all around. It's also notorious for its football team Accrington Stanley, which until 2019 was unfairly regarded as a joke and byword for failure. But not any more. 

The small towns of ♡❤♡Baxenden♡❤♡, ♡❤♡Oswaldtwistle♡❤♡ (say ♡❤ozzle-twizzle♡❤) and ♡❤♡Clayton-le-Moors♡❤♡ are nearby, and &lt;a href="Blackburn"&gt;Blackburn&lt;/a&gt; is five miles west.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Lots of towns have had football (soccer) teams that collapsed. But this place is unique, at least in Britain, in the way the collapse of Accrington Stanley hung like a pall over the name of the town for decades, in spite of the team's resurgence. 

One reason is that they collapsed in the 1960s, in an era when that was difficult to accomplish. Players' wages and transfer fees were low, bank credit was available at low interest rates, and the Inland Revenue were not as diligent in pursuing outstanding tax as they are today. Above all, England's Football League was a closed shop. There was promotion and relegation between its four divisions, but seldom between its fourth division and the minor leagues below. Instead, the bottom clubs had to "apply for re-election", the electorate being the other League clubs, who would reckon "there but for the grace of God go we, so let's put another credit in the favour bank." So long as your club manager and chairman got on passably well with their opposites, and glad-handed them with boardroom whisky when their team visited, you should secure enough votes to see off any bid from an up-and-coming minor league team. "Why vote against a fixture we enjoy playing, and usually win?"

From 1960 Accrington Stanley were near bankrupt, and fell like a stone through the League placings. By March 1962 their debts were unsustainable, they simply couldn't afford to put on games, and they had to resign from the League. This was during the 61/62 season so it was a traumatic disorderly exit, with all their results being expunged. In the following seasons they played in the Lancashire Combination Leagues, there was a flicker of sporting and financial revival, but then they dissolved in 1966. 

An entirely separate, new Accrington Stanley was formed in 1968, and for the next 30 years plodded away in the minor leagues. From 1989 to 1995 they were the butt of a TV advert by the Milk Marketing Board. One young football fan has been warned that if he doesn't drink milk, he'll only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley. His friend asks "Accrington Stanley, who are they?" and the first replies "Exactly." Town and club took a perverse pride in this recognition, but it didn't move the narrative on. By this stage clubs were folding all over Europe - in Britain Glasgow Rangers was the highest profile example. But then Glasgow had other attractions for the visitor, and other stories to tell.

In 2002 the club suddenly came into money from a transfer fee and began a steady rise up the rankings. In 2006 they were promoted back into League Two, equivalent to the old Fourth. (Oxford United, who'd replaced them in the League in 1962, were now the team cast out as "The Stanley" bounced back in.) In 2018 they were promoted to League One. So far, so middling good; it wouldn't entirely banish the jokes. But in Jan 2019 in the FA Cup Third Round they pulled off a shock, beating Ipswich Town from the Championship (the tier above), and watched by a young Korean who'd travelled 5500 miles to support them. They progressed to the Fourth Round to lose narrowly to Derby County, another Championship team. The town of Accrington needs to develop other industries and attractions besides its football - but now, when it is remembered for that, it will be for the right reasons.

One of the most striking items is a glass mosaic exhibition piece, designed by Briggs himself and entitled "Sulphur Crested Cockatoos". The gallery also tells the story of the ♡❤♡Accrington Pals♡❤♡, a locally-recruited band of servicemen - more correctly the 11th East Lancs Regiment, composed of four 250-strong companies from Accrington, Burnley, Blackburn and Chorley. They first saw action on 1 July 1916, at the "Big Push" on the Somme. Half an hour later 235 were dead and 350 were injured.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;Free&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.aceh.net/"&gt;Aceh&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ (pronounced "ah-chey", various spellings include ♡❤Acheh♡❤, ♡❤Atjeh♡❤ and ♡❤Achin♡❤) is a province and special territory (♡❤daerah istimewa♡❤) of &lt;a href="Indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;, in the northwestern part of the island of &lt;a href="Sumatra"&gt;Sumatra&lt;/a&gt;. It has a population of 4.2 million.

Its major towns include: &lt;a href="Banda%20Aceh"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt; (Aceh's capital), &lt;a href="Lhokseumawe"&gt;Lhokseumawe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Meulaboh"&gt;Meulaboh&lt;/a&gt;, Sigli, and Calang. The island of &lt;a href="Sabang%20%28Indonesia%29"&gt;Sabang&lt;/a&gt; (an hour's ferry ride from &lt;a href="Banda%20Aceh"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;), considered a diver's and snorkeler's paradise, belongs to the province.

</ul>
<h2>Understand</h2>
The province of Aceh is in the northwest of Sumatra, with an area of approximately 57,365 km, or 12.26% of the size of the island. It includes 119 islands, 73 major rivers and 2 lakes. Aceh is surrounded by the Straits of Malacca in the north, North Sumatra Province in the east and the Indian Ocean in the south and the west. The capital of Aceh is &lt;a href="Banda%20Aceh"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;.

Aceh was long known for its desire for political independence from Indonesia. For many years, travel in this part of Indonesia was restricted by the government, due to a long war between the Indonesian Army and an Acehnese separatist guerrilla force known as the Free Aceh Movement (♡❤Gerakan Aceh Merdeka♡❤ or GAM in short). 

On 26 December 2004, the coastal areas were devastated by a huge earthquake triggering a ♡❤tsunami♡❤, which is estimated to have killed over 160,000 people in Aceh, completely devastated coastal infrastructure (including the capital city of &lt;a href="Banda%20Aceh"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;), and made over 500,000 people homeless. However, the devastation in the wake of the tsunami led the Indonesian government and the GAM to declare a ceasefire in order to provide aid to the victims, setting the stage for peace talks to take place.

A peace agreement was signed in Helsinki on 15 August 2005 between the Indonesian government and GAM, in which the GAM agreed to give up their struggle for independence in exchange for more autonomy being given to the provincial government in managing its internal affairs, including the right to enact sharia law. Since then, the Indonesian government, in cooperation with the European Union, has been working with the local militia to disarm the former guerrilla fighters, with great success. After the tsunami, the UN and numerous international aid agencies moved in, in a quest to reconstruct the area.

The largest portion of Leuser National Park is in Aceh Province, and provides habitat for many endangered species, including the Sumatran Tiger and forest Rhinoceros.

Aceh's shariah laws are stricter than in any other part of &lt;a href="Southeast%20Asia"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="Brunei%20Darussalam"&gt;Brunei Darussalam&lt;/a&gt;, and even stricter than in &lt;a href="Dubai"&gt;Dubai&lt;/a&gt;, where non-Muslims are allowed to sunbathe in a bikini on the beach. In 2014, some ulemas spray painted the legs of women who wore tight jeans and trousers, because they felt that the sharia police were ineffective. So far no sharia laws have been enforced upon tourists, and non-Muslims are exempted from having to follow sharia laws, but to avoid unpleasantness for both parties, women should be modest in their clothing and behaviour. Conservative dress is expected, and this means no leggings, semi-stretch jeans, shorts, tight or translucent oblong or t-shirts, but headscarves are not required for non-Muslims. One-piece conservative swimsuits, but not bikinis, are acceptable at some hotel swimming pools.

Although Aceh uses sharia law, some regencies such as Gayo Lues Regency do not fully support this. They are mostly Muslims, but don't want sharia to be implemented too hard. Some other regencies want to separate from Aceh, but the central government has not given any response to their requests. However, visitors should operate on the basis that Aceh is under sharia law, especially in the northern and eastern coastal regencies. On Friday, some vendors totally close or are open until 11:30 and either open again at 14:30 or stay closed until Saturday morning. Fishermen do not go to the sea and people don't swim on the beach on Friday, so if you want to swim on Friday, make sure beforehand that you won't cause offense.

Backpacking into the back country in Aceh is safe from landmines because the GAM used only pipe-bombs. The areas around Banda Aceh and along east coast are relatively ready for tourists, but along the west coast of Aceh, which has more beautiful scenery, there are fewer facilities for tourists. However, backpackers can use their own tents on the beach as they wish.

<h2>Talk</h2>
&lt;a href="Bahasa%20Indonesia"&gt;Bahasa Indonesia&lt;/a&gt; is spoken but sometimes you will hear ♡❤Bahasa Aceh♡❤ (Acehnese), ♡❤Bahasa Gayo♡❤ (Gayonese), and other more minor languages.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By plane</h3>

The main airport of Aceh is Sultan Iskandar Muda International Airport (&lt;b&gt; BTJ &lt;/b&gt; ) near &lt;a href="Banda%20Aceh"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;. There are international flights from &lt;a href="Kuala%20Lumpur%20International%20Airport"&gt;Kuala Lumpur International Airport&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.airasia.com"&gt;AirAsia&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href="Penang"&gt;Penang&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fireflyz.com.my"&gt;Firefly&lt;/a&gt;. Domestically, there are frequent flights from &lt;a href="Jakarta"&gt;Jakarta&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Soekarno-Hatta%20International%20Airport"&gt;Soekarno-Hatta International Airport&lt;/a&gt; by Garuda Indonesia and Lion Air, and from Jakarta's Halim Airport by Batik Air. Other domestic destinations include &lt;a href="Medan"&gt;Medan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bengkulu"&gt;Bengkulu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Batam"&gt;Batam&lt;/a&gt;.

Thereare various smaller airports across the province, with most of them only having scheduled flights from &lt;a href="Medan"&gt;Medan&lt;/a&gt;, operated by Garuda Indonesia and/or Wings Air.

<h3>By bus</h3>
The road from &lt;a href="Medan"&gt;Medan&lt;/a&gt; to Banda Aceh are now reasonable. Especially the express night buses from Medan 10 hours, Rp200,000 are a good deal. Non-express day and night buses are cheaper (Rp150,000) and take longer - 12-14 hours.

<h3>By boat</h3>
The ferry from Penang has stopped running. Instead, take the ferry to Medan and continue from there.

<h2>Get around</h2>
There is no need for travel permits anymore in Aceh. Taxis, rental cars and motor taxis are available in Banda Aceh.

<h2>Sleep</h2>
There are many hotels and also other types of accommodation available in Banda Aceh and the surrounding area. There are many cheap guest houses in the popular local beachside areas of Lhoknga and Lampuuk, there are a range of very affordable guest houses which cater mostly to international tourists, particularly surfers and adventurers.

<h2>See</h2>
Aceh is rich in events, attractions and unique cultures that will fascinate anyone. Aceh is also rich in natural beauty, waves and sea gardens which are suitable for diving. However, some of the most beautiful Aceh tourism and historical sites and beaches were damaged by the massive earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.

Highlights: the Baiturrahman Great Mosque, Aceh State Museum, the Graves of Sultan Iskandar Muda and of Teungku Syiah Kuala, Salahuddin Graveyard in Bitay (Turkey village), Ujong Batee and Lampuuk Beaches, Tjut Nyak Dien Museum, Rubiah Sea Garden, Simpang Balik Hot Water Pool, Linge Isaq Hunting Area, Leuser National Park, Cakra Donya Bell, remains of the Samudra Pasai Kingdom and Teungku Chik Di Tiro Heros Cemetery.

<h3>Itineraries</h3>
Nature and outdoor lovers who arrive in &lt;a href="Medan"&gt;Medan&lt;/a&gt; can travel from &lt;a href="Medan"&gt;Medan&lt;/a&gt; to the jungle resort of &lt;a href="Bukit%20Lawang"&gt;Bukit Lawang&lt;/a&gt; and from there, go to the more remote Tangkahan. From Tangkahan, you can travel to the mysterious Danau Laut Tawar near Takengon were you can hike and climb some spectacular volcanoes. From Takengon you can travel to Banda Aceh. There you can visit some great beaches and go mountain biking and hiking. Banda Aceh is also the place to get a ferry to Sabang or Pulau Weh where you can dive and snorkel.

<h2>Do</h2>
There is fantastic diving on &lt;a href="Pulau%20Weh"&gt;Pulau Weh&lt;/a&gt; (called "Sabang" by the locals, the name of the city on the island). If you're certified, expect to pay €25 for your first dive, €20 for every dive afterward.

Aceh is also great for hiking and mountain biking and bicycling.

Surfing is great at Lhok'nga beach where you can also rent boards and do surfing courses. Also in nearby Lampuuk (3 km NE of Lhok'nga) a variety of beachside and mountain recreational attractions and activities is developing very rapidly. There are many restaurants and fresh seafood stalls. Some of the restaurants provide very affordable accommodation, some with panoramic views of the mountains, beaches and seaside area.

<h2>Eat</h2>
Arab, Persian, and Indian traders influenced food in Aceh although flavours have changed to a point where they are no longer similar to their original form. Amongst these are curry dishes known as ♡❤♡kare♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡gulai♡❤♡, which are rich, coconut-based dishes traditionally made with beef, goat, fish or poultry, but now also made with tofu, vegetables, and jackfruit. Popular Acehnese food includes ♡❤♡roti cane♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡mie Aceh♡❤♡.

New restaurants and seafood stalls are popping up all the time in the local Lhoknga and Lampuuk seaside areas of Banda Aceh as the local economy develops.

2 or 3 days before fasting month to 2 or 3 days after fasting month, you will still find difficulty in getting food in day time, and visit in this time is discouraged.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
The insurgency may be over, but Aceh remains a somewhat unsettled place, with a rate of violent crime &amp;mdash; partly political, partly not &amp;mdash; exceeding most of the rest of the archipelago. In 2009, a German Red Cross worker was shot in broad daylight in &lt;a href="Banda%20Aceh"&gt;Banda Aceh&lt;/a&gt;. In 2014, situation is relatively safe, no more foreign tourists as a target, except some rare pure criminal.

Aceh adopted a strict version of the Shariah law, which prohibits, among other things, drinking, homosexuality, intimate contact outside marriage, gambling, adultery, and wearing revealing clothes in public spaces (including public beaches). Since 2016, such laws have being applied both to Muslims and non-Muslims. For foreign tourists, the consequence of breaking the Shariah law would probably not go beyond a verbal reprimand, although harsher punishments, including jail time and caning, are possible.

<h2>Go next</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- To the south: take a flight from Banda Aceh to Medan, if you are in a rush. You can also use the bus, but there are no special views along the trip. From Medan, you can spend one day in Brastagi or you can spare more time, if you want one day to hike to or climb Sibayak Mountain and one day more to hike to or climb Sinabung Mountain. Neither of these mountains is too difficult to hike, if you are fit, but you need a guide to avoid getting lost. Spare two days in &lt;a href="Lake%20Toba"&gt;Lake Toba&lt;/a&gt;, even if you are not going anywhere around the lake.

<h1>Achiltibuie</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Achiltibuie♡❤♡ is a community straggling along the west coast of &lt;a href="Ross%20and%20Cromarty"&gt;Ross and Cromarty&lt;/a&gt;, north of Ullapool in the &lt;a href="Scottish%20Highlands"&gt;Scottish Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. As well as Achiltibuie itself, the name (which in Gaelic means "field of the yellow-haired boy") applies to all the coast between Achduart and Reiff, taking in the hamlets of Polglass, Polbain and Altandhu.

<h2>Get in</h2>

Follow A835 north from Ullapool or south from Ledmore (the junction with A837) to the turn-off at Drumrunie; then take the narrow single-track lane west. There's no through road along the coast from Ullapool, though the historic "postman's path" came this way via Ardmair and you can hike the ten miles. You can also drive south from Lochinver along a twisty, hilly, narrow but scenic and well-tarmacked lane. 

KSM Bus 811 runs from Ullapool to Achiltibuie, twice M-F and once on Saturday, taking 80 mins.

BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the area centred around Loch Sionasgaig and Knockan Crag, a National Nature Reserve and SSSI. It's part of the &lt;a href="North%20West%20Highlands%20Geopark"&gt;North West Highlands Geopark&lt;/a&gt; and contains the Moine Thrust, which puzzled 19th C geologists because much older rocks lay over relatively younger. It's a product of plate tectonics, which had shifted the older rocks 40 miles west.
BULLET::::- Boat trips run to &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; , a mile offshore, from &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by Polglass. Trips also run from Ullapool.

BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the Table Mountain of this area, a six-mile ridge of Torridonian sandstone weathered into striking shapes. The summit is 743 m / 2438 feet, very prominent as it rears up from sea level. The simplest approach is to drive to the road's end at Culnacraig and ascend from the southwest. It can also be climbed from the car park at Bleughasary from the southeast. Trying to traverse the ridge, to ascend one way and descend the other, is much harder than it looks, with bogs, fast streams and scrambles; allow at least four hours.

<h1>Achterhoek</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
The ♡❤♡Achterhoek♡❤♡ is a region in the east of &lt;a href="Gelderland"&gt;Gelderland&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="the%20Netherlands"&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;). The region is filled with untouched nature and a combination of farmland and astonishing landscapes. The Achterhoek is an area well-fitted for vacations by bike.

<h2>Understand</h2>
<h3>History</h3>

As the Achterhoek never was a part of the &lt;a href="Roman%20Empire"&gt;Roman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, it, until Christianization around the year 800, was a region inhabited by Germanic tribes. The Achterhoek at this time was not a region of its own. The west of the region belonged to the &lt;a href="Utrecht%20%28province%29"&gt;Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Utrecht&lt;/a&gt; and the east to the &lt;a href="M%C3%BCnster"&gt;Roman Catholic Diocese of Münster&lt;/a&gt;. The region would only come to exist as the &lt;a href="Zutphen"&gt;Zutphen&lt;/a&gt; Country during Medieval times. The country encompassed many castles, many of which stand to this day, mostly owned by the royal families of &lt;a href="Bronkhorst"&gt;Bronkhorst&lt;/a&gt; and Van Heeckeren, which fought several succession wars against each other. Until the 19th century the Achterhoek would be a feudal system.

Due to the region's location at the border, it has been invaded several times - mostly by German entities during the &lt;a href="w%3AGuelders%20Wars"&gt;Guelders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Thirty%20Years%20War"&gt;Eighty Years War&lt;/a&gt;. Battles were mostly fought around the &lt;a href="%27s-Heerenberg"&gt;Bergh Castle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Keppel"&gt;Keppel Castle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the cities of &lt;a href="Bredevoort"&gt;Bredevoort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Groenlo"&gt;Groenlo&lt;/a&gt;. The latter of which re-enacts the 1627 Battle of Grolle bi-annually.

During industrialisation, a large part of the Achterhoek was still feudal. Many of the lands were still rough, existing of forests and sand flats. Industrialisation only had an effect on the cities along the Oude IJssel river and in the far east. Due to the ground here containing bog iron, a hype for metallurgy hit &lt;a href="Doetinchem"&gt;Doetinchem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oude%20IJsselstreek"&gt;Ulft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Keppel"&gt;Keppel&lt;/a&gt;. Dutch brands here are ATAG, DRU and Pelgrim. In the east of the Achterhoek, textile industries were booming. &lt;a href="Aalten"&gt;Aalten&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Neede"&gt;Neede&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Winterswijk"&gt;Winterswijk&lt;/a&gt; all took part until the end of the &lt;a href="Second%20World%20War"&gt;Second World War&lt;/a&gt;, when, due to competition from low-wage countries, the industry was no longer beneficial. During the time that it existed, the textile industry made large invests in the region. Especially Winterswijkse magnate Jan Willink funded many railroads that spanned throughout the region. This helped the textile industry survive in the rather remote east. Of these railroads, only the lines between &lt;a href="Arnhem"&gt;Arnhem&lt;/a&gt; and Winterswijk and Winterswijk and Zutphen remain. Additionally, a &lt;a href="heritage%20railroads"&gt;heritage railroad&lt;/a&gt;, formerly spanning between Doetinchem and &lt;a href="Hengelo"&gt;Hengelo (Overijssel)&lt;/a&gt; remains in function between &lt;a href="Haaksbergen"&gt;Haaksbergen&lt;/a&gt; and Boekelo, both located just across the provincial border in &lt;a href="Overijssel"&gt;Overijssel&lt;/a&gt;. These lines not only improved industry in the region, it did the same for tourism as well.

Since the start of the 21st century, many disappointing results made many companies end. The native pilsner brand ♡❤Grosch♡❤, for one, had to leave the region to keep making a profit. Replacing it is a brand new wine industry, which nets betweek 20,000 and 40,000 bottles annually, depending on the season.

<h3>Geography</h3>

The Achterhoek is compared to the Netherlands as a whole, rather thinly populated. Aside from the largely urbanised regions of &lt;a href="Doetinchem"&gt;Doetinchem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Winterswijk"&gt;Winterswijk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Zutphen"&gt;Zutphen&lt;/a&gt;, large cities are nowhere to be found. 

Some of the rough landscapes the region had during roman times are still around. Sand flats still exist near Doetinchem, and large forests are to be found in &lt;a href="Montferland"&gt;Montferland&lt;/a&gt;. Due to its both flat and slanted terrain, the region makes for a great cycling region for any sort of cyclist. All in all, the Achterhoek features large amounts of bocage. Highlights are the &lt;a href="Lochem"&gt;Lochemse Berg&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="Ruurlo"&gt;Ruurlo Woods&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="Doetinchem"&gt;Slangenburg&lt;/a&gt;. Some peatlands still exist near the German border.

Many castles are spread throughout the region with &lt;a href="Vorden"&gt;Vorden&lt;/a&gt; having a grand total of eight. 

<h3>Traditions</h3>
Though the culture is considered to be a dying culture, parts of the Achterhoek still have traditions to their name. These include ♡❤dauwtrappen♡❤ on Ascension Day (getting up ♡❤very♡❤ early to go cycling), ♡❤carbidschieten♡❤ (filling a milk churn with carbide, putting a ball in the churn's opening and igniting it) and the consuption of &lt;a href="w%3AKrumkake"&gt;Krumkake&lt;/a&gt; during new years. During Easter, many bonfires (♡❤Paasvuur♡❤) will be lit, and at the completion of buildings, the occasional maypole may be planted. Furthermore, local 'sports' include ♡❤spiekerboksehangen♡❤, hanging a pair of jeans above a body of water, and testing can keep himself from falling in the water the longest. Typical to the east is ♡❤noaberschap♡❤, literally translated the helping of neighbours, but in reality it comes down to general kindness.

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>From Amsterdam/Schiphol</h3>

To get to ♡❤♡Zutphen♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡Winterswijk♡❤♡, take the Intercity train to Apeldoorn and change in Apeldoorn to the small diesel train connection Zutphen and Apeldoorn in 20 minutes. It leaves from Apeldoorn at --:10 and --:40, a few minutes after the Intercity from Amsterdam arrived. It usually departs from the opposite side of the platform. Alternatively, you can reach Zutphen via Arnhem by changing there, but it will take about 10 to 15 minutes longer; it doesn't cost more (i.e., with a ticket to or from Zutphen you can choose between the Apeldoorn and Arnhem routes). See the article on &lt;a href="Zutphen"&gt;Zutphen&lt;/a&gt; for more extensive information. For ♡❤♡Winterswijk♡❤♡, trains leave at --:07 and --:37, and depending on the route taken (Amsterdam-Apeldoorn-Zutphen) or (Amsterdam-Arnhem-Zutphen) will take between 135 and 153 minutes.

To get to ♡❤♡Doetinchem♡❤♡, take the Intercity to Nijmegen and change trains in Arnhem. The train to Doetinchem and Winterswijk leaves 2 minutes after the arrival of the Intercity from Amsterdam, at --:04 and --:34, usually from platform 9. These trains take 34 minutes to Doetinchem and 68 minutes to Winterswijk, during the morning and afternoon rush there are 2 more to Doetinchem, at --:15, and --:45. For Winterswijk it's better to travel through Zutphen instead of Arnhem when coming from Amsterdam. To Doetinchem this should take 102 minutes, but it's likely to take 30 minutes longer because there's only a 2 minute change in Arnhem, which one is likely to miss.

Not all cities can be reached by train. The ones you can reach are: 
Doetinchem, Zutphen, Winterswijk, Lochem, Vorden, Ruurlo and Aalten

<h3>From Germany</h3>

To get to eith of the cities above, head to Oberhausen (GER) first, whether that is by train or by car. When travelling by car, use the A3 in the direction of Arnhem, Utrecht or Amsterdam. To get to ♡❤♡Doetinchem♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡Zutphen♡❤♡ from here, leave the A3 the moment you cross the border. This should be Exit 30 - Beek. Join the N812 heading for Beek. At the end of the N812 you join the N335 heading for Didam. You then rejoin the highway (A18) in the direction of Doetinchem. 
When travelling to ♡❤♡Zutphen♡❤♡, take the route above, and leave the highway at Exit 3 - Doetinchem. Use the N316/N317 in the direction of Doetinchem. To not get stuck in traffic too much, use the N317 (Liemersweg) after crossing the rail line, and head right onto the Energieweg at the following traffic lights. Having crossed the river Oude IJssel, head left at the end of the Energieweg, onto the Keppelseweg, heading for Zutphen. Follow this road until you reach the roundabout after Langerak. There you take the first exit onto the N314. Having reached Hummelo, head left on the roundabout, and head in the direction of Zutphen from there. From here on the road will go directly to Zutphen.

<h2>Get around</h2>
The Achterhoek can be travelled by train, but having train stations servicing between &lt;a href="Arnhem"&gt;Arnhem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Winterswijk"&gt;Winterswijk&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="Zevenaar"&gt;Zevenaar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Doetinchem"&gt;Doetinchem&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="Zutphen"&gt;Zutphen&lt;/a&gt; and Winterswijk via &lt;a href="Vorden"&gt;Vorden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Oost%20Gelre"&gt;Lievelde&lt;/a&gt;, using busses to get from A to B may be recommended. Busses are mostly serviced by &lt;a href="https%3A//www.arriva.nl/gelderland.htm%3Fregioid%3D98879"&gt;Arriva&lt;/a&gt;, whereas trains are serviced by &lt;a href="https%3A//www.breng.nl/"&gt;Breng&lt;/a&gt; as well. For planning your travel via public transport in general, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.9292.nl"&gt;9292&lt;/a&gt; can be recommended. Additionally, you could arrange a rental car or bike to get from A to B, as cycleways are well-maintained and of high quality. 

<h2>See</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The Achterhoek is filled with ♡❤♡Castles♡❤♡. &lt;a href="Vorden"&gt;Vorden&lt;/a&gt; alone has seven of them. Though not all of these castles can be visited, many of them are open to the public for a not too large entry fee. Must-sees include ♡❤Kasteel Huis Bergh♡❤ (♡❤Bergh Castle♡❤), located in &lt;a href="Liemers"&gt;'s-Heerenberg&lt;/a&gt; and ♡❤Kasteel Keppel♡❤ (♡❤Keppel Castle♡❤) in &lt;a href="Keppel"&gt;Laag Keppel&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Museums♡❤♡ in the Achterhoek are mostly local, city museums. They often only display things that are of interest to locals wanting to know more about their city. Visiting these isn't a must, they may appeal to you. Moreover, the cities of &lt;a href="Doetinchem"&gt;Doetinchem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Winterswijk"&gt;Winterswijk&lt;/a&gt; have the ♡❤Openbaar Vervoer Museum♡❤ and ♡❤GOLS Museum♡❤, both of which highlight the role of public transport, especially trains and trams, for the region.
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="Oost%20Gelre"&gt;Oost Gelre&lt;/a&gt; has several large ♡❤♡events♡❤♡ to its name, amongst which are ♡❤De Zwarte Cross♡❤, which is held annually. It is the largest motocross event of Europe featuring not only motorised vehicles, but live music as well. Aside from that, Lichtenvoorde houses one of the largest flower parades of the Netherlands, if not Europe, called ♡❤Bloemencorso Lichtenvoorde♡❤. It too is held annually.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Beautiful landscapes♡❤♡ are rather common in the Achterhoek, due to its semi-rural character. Terrains are flatter in the northwest of the region, and more slanted in the &lt;a href="Montferland"&gt;Montferland&lt;/a&gt; area in the south. The rivers going through the area have meandered a lot over time and have been straightened out over time. Their branches, now mostly lakes, as well as the rivers themselves too give beautiful photos. The Oude IJssel river around &lt;a href="Keppel"&gt;Keppel&lt;/a&gt; for one is beautiful during summer.

</ul>
<h2>Do</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The Achterhoek is fit for ♡❤♡hiking♡❤♡. Especially the well-forested area of &lt;a href="Monferland"&gt;Monferland&lt;/a&gt; is great for a long walk during summer of fall. The &lt;a href="Pieterpad"&gt;Pieterpad&lt;/a&gt; passes through the area as well. Every year a four-day hiking event is held somewhere in the month of May (for 2017; 24-27 May). The ♡❤&lt;a href="http%3A//www.aw4d.nl"&gt;Achterhoekse Wandelvierdaagse&lt;/a&gt;♡❤ usualy takes place in and around &lt;a href="Doetinchem"&gt;Doetinchem&lt;/a&gt;. Its routes are available &lt;a href="http%3A//www.aw4d.nl/routes.asp"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; - though only in Dutch, if you'd rather walk alone.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Cycling%20in%20the%20Achterhoek"&gt;Cycling&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is the most common mode of transport amongst the Dutch, and the same goes for Achterhoekers. Routes are very varying, with the aforementioned Montferland area having off-road routes with terrain that's varying in height. The further from the German border you are, the more flat the terrain is. You can easily go from one town or city to another within half a day, so a vactaion by bike is a perfect option.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Recreational waters♡❤♡ are a popular getaway for locals. Many former sand mining operations have been flooded by man to create lakes and many of them have been transformed to recreational lakes. The &lt;a href="Liemers"&gt;Liemers&lt;/a&gt; alone has three of these. Another one can been found just south of &lt;a href="Zutphen"&gt;Zutphen&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Canoeing♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡Kayaking♡❤♡ can't be done on many rivers due to them being used for transport by fright ships. The Oude IJssel river, however, is perfectly fit for this activity. Routes start in Doetinchem or somewhat more upstream near Terborg, and end in &lt;a href="Doesburg"&gt;Doesburg&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<h2>Talk</h2>

All of the Achterhoek speaks Dutch, in more rural areas people may speak the local dialect, &lt;a href="Low_German_phrasebook"&gt;Achterhooks&lt;/a&gt;, which is part of Low German. Within the cities many people will be able to speak to you in English, especially the younger generations. Aside from English, many people will be able to understand German.

<h2>Eat</h2>

<ul>
BULLET::::- The Achterhoek does not have many local products to its name, but the city of &lt;a href="Doesburg"&gt;Doesburg&lt;/a&gt; does have its own ♡❤♡mustard♡❤♡, which, if you like mustard, you should definitely try.

</ul>
<h2>Drink</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The beer brand ♡❤♡Grolsch♡❤♡ (English: ♡❤from Grol♡❤) founded in &lt;a href="Groenlo"&gt;Groenlo&lt;/a&gt; and based in &lt;a href="Enschede"&gt;Enschede&lt;/a&gt;, just outside the Achterhoek, supplies pilsner in the entire country. Trips to the brewery are interesting, but to drink their beer can be fun as well.

</ul>
<h2>Go next</h2>
If the Achterhoek is one of the first regions of the Netherlands you visit, then you can easily go further north in the direction of &lt;a href="Twente"&gt;Twente&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Overijssel"&gt;Overijssel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Drenthe"&gt;Drenthe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Groningen"&gt;Groningen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Friesland"&gt;Friesland&lt;/a&gt;.
You could also head south in the direction of &lt;a href="North%20Brabant"&gt;North Brabant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Limburg"&gt;Limburg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Zeeland"&gt;Zeeland&lt;/a&gt;.
If you're more into citytrips, then head west in the direction of the Randstad, to the provinces of &lt;a href="Noord%20Holland"&gt;North-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Zuid-Holland"&gt;South-Holland&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Utrecht"&gt;Utrecht&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Do</h2>

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Beaches♡❤♡. The beaches of Orzán and Riazor (situated on the Western side of the peninsula) provide a nice sandy beach within the city itself. However, if you are used to swimming in the Mediterranean, you might find the water slightly cold.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡♡❤Paseo Marítimo♡❤♡♡❤. The seafront promenade that surrounds the peninsula provides an opportunity for nice strolls. Starting by the ♡❤La Marina♡❤, you can proceed on to the ♡❤Castelo de San Antón♡❤, the ♡❤Dique de Abrigo♡❤, towards the ♡❤Torre de Hércules♡❤, ♡❤Casa de los Peces♡❤, ♡❤Casa del Hombre♡❤, ♡❤Orzán♡❤ and ♡❤Riazor♡❤ beaches, ♡❤Millennium♡❤ monument, and proceed towards the area known as ♡❤O Portiño♡❤, on the flanks of ♡❤Monte de San Pedro♡❤. This last bit of the promenade is outside the main city.

</ul>
<h2>Buy</h2>

<h2>Eat</h2>
You will find a huge selection of typical Spanish cafeterias. Most restaurants offer sea food dishes of good quality.

You will also find a good number of hamburgueserias, a few Italian restaurants/pizzerias and at least one typical Mexican restaurant.

Prices are similar to the rest of Spain.

<h2>Drink</h2>

The local beer is called Estrella Galicia.

<h1>Across Australia by train</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤See &lt;a href="Rail%20travel%20in%20Australia"&gt;Rail travel in Australia&lt;/a&gt; for general information about travelling by train in Australia♡❤

&lt;a href="Australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; can be crossed by two great railway journeys, ♡❤♡♡❤The Ghan♡❤♡♡❤, which crosses north to south straight through the heart of Australia, from &lt;a href="Darwin"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Adelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;, and the ♡❤♡♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤♡♡❤, which crosses east to west, from &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Perth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
♡❤The Indian Pacific she goes rollin' down the track. Five thousand miles to travel before she's there and back.♡❤ 

<h3>Take your time</h3>
These are not high-speed transcontinental trains. They are laid-back kind of trains that know how to take their time and enjoy the scenery. The trains are privately run by ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.greatsouthernrail.com.au"&gt;Great Southern Rail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡. The current iteration of both routes was not built for passenger traffic, but rather to serve the very lucrative freight business.

<h3>History of the Ghan</h3>
♡❤The Ghan♡❤ is named after the Afghan cameleers that transported goods to Australia's remote centre prior to the construction of the railway. The sand and heat made the trip entirely unsuited to horses. The cameleers overwhelmingly weren't from Afghanistan, they were just known as Afghans in the Australian vernacular.

The construction of the original Ghan from Adelaide started in 1878, with &lt;a href="Oodnadatta"&gt;Oodnadatta&lt;/a&gt; reached in 1891 and, after a thirty-year break, &lt;a href="Alice%20Springs"&gt;Alice Springs&lt;/a&gt; in 1926. A separate but unconnected track from &lt;a href="Darwin"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Katherine"&gt;Katherine&lt;/a&gt; in the north was also completed in the same year.

Unfortunately, the original Ghan was twisty, narrow-gauge and built straight through many valleys prone to flash floods that washed away tracks and bridges. A decision was thus made to rebuild nearly all of the line in standard gauge, over 100&amp;nbsp;km to the west. The new line to Alice Springs opened in 1980, and the remaining 1420&amp;nbsp;km section across the continent to Darwin opened in 2004.

<h3>History of the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤</h3>
A single train journey from Sydney to Perth (linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans) became possible with the completion of the standard gauge railway in 1969 when the last standard gauge link was completed between &lt;a href="Broken%20Hill"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Peterborough%20%28South%20Australia%29"&gt;Peterborough&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to this, travelling across Australia by train between Perth and Sydney was a relay of trains. At certain times in history there were four changes of railway gauge, at Broken Hill, Peterborough, &lt;a href="Port%20Pirie"&gt;Port Pirie&lt;/a&gt;, and Kalgoorlie. The great mining town of Broken Hill was linked by the narrow-gauge railways to Port Pirie (north of Adelaide) before it was linked with Sydney. You can see some of this history in the Sulphide Street Railway museum in Broken Hill, at Steamtown in Peterborough, and at the museum in the old station at Port Pirie. The railway line in Port Pirie ran right down the main street of the town. In the 1930s, the transcontinental trip was over five days, with changes of trains through Albury, Melbourne, Adelaide, Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie.

The breaks of gauge were due to the states each having their own gauge, and the Commonwealth completing the missing link between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie in standard gauge (the same as New South Wales).

Some towns along the line enjoyed several services a day during their heyday. The full Sydney to Perth service ran three times a week. Today, however, the irony is that railway buffs can see more of the rail history of the line and the towns along it travelling by car than by train. You can spend a good half day exploring the history of Peterborough and of Port Pirie, but the train may not be along to pick you up for another week. The motorail gives you the option of driving one way, and catching the train back.

<h2>Prepare</h2>
 
&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Ambox/styles.css" /&gt;

Any way you look at it, ♡❤The Ghan♡❤ and the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤ are ♡❤♡expensive♡❤♡. The standard "Red Service" Daynighter reclining seat is $716 from Darwin to Adelaide, although the price is cut in half if you book a prepaid, non-refundable, non-changeable "Rail Saver" fare or use a child, backpacker or YHA fare. A "Red Service" twin share sleeper cabin is $1312/800 standard/concession per person, with no Rail Saver available. Don't expect luxury: the trains used are refurbished 1970s-vintage American models.

If you fork out $1973/1357, you can upgrade to "Gold Service", which has single cabins (shared shower), twin cabins (shower en suite) and includes all meals in the dedicated restaurant car. Add another $1000 on top, and you can get a double-sized "Platinum Service" cabin.

If you have a car in Australia, the value proposition can improve slightly, if you take your car with you. On the premium fare there are often deals available to take a car for $99 extra, which you can then offset against the price of renting a car at your destination, or if you drive one way, the prospect of the 3000&amp;nbsp;km drive home.

You can also leverage some value out of taken stops at the destinations along the way, with &lt;a href="Alice%20Springs"&gt;Alice Springs&lt;/a&gt; being the perfect stopping point on the Ghan, and &lt;a href="Broken%20Hill"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Adelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; both being good options on the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤. There aren't too many other options, though, with small towns, infrequent service and inconvenient arrival times making the other towns a hassle to stop at.

<h2>Get in</h2>
&lt;a href="Darwin"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; can be reached by plane from all major Australian cities and a few international destinations like &lt;a href="Singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, but does not have any other train services.

&lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Perth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Adelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; are well-connected by air, each with services to all other Australian capital cities and international destinations. There are public train services up and down the east coast connecting the nearby country towns to Sydney. There is a public train once a week to &lt;a href="Broken%20Hill"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt;, which you can catch from Sydney, and then join the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤ there. Similarly, Perth is also served by trains connecting it to nearby country towns near the west coast, and also has a service to &lt;a href="Kalgoorlie"&gt;Kalgoorlie&lt;/a&gt; where you can join the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤. These trips costs considerably less than the privately run ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤ on the same routes. Adelaide's railway network is limited to some suburban rail services, and does not have any services to the country towns.

<h2>The Ghan</h2>
This itinerary assumes you start from Darwin and head south, but it's also possible in the opposite direction. The Ghan takes 54 hours to travel 2,979 kilometres.

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — ♡❤From Darwin♡❤ (0&amp;nbsp;km), there is a departure every ♡❤♡Wednesday♡❤♡ (10AM) throughout the year, and an additional service on ♡❤♡Saturdays♡❤♡ (9AM) between June September. The three-day, two-night journey takes around 50&amp;nbsp;hours from end to end. The station is a fair way from central Darwin, about 20&amp;nbsp;minutes drive. The railway's primary purpose is freight, and the line goes straight to the port at East Arm, without passing through any built-up areas. Dedicated buses connect between the Darwin Transit Centre in Mitchell St and the rail station for an additional fee. Taxis are possible, but expensive. There is no scheduled bus.

</ul>
♡❤From Adelaide♡❤ (2979&amp;nbsp;km), departures are on ♡❤♡Sunday♡❤♡ 12:20PM throughout the year and ♡❤♡Wednesdays♡❤♡ at the same time between June and August.

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (312&amp;nbsp;km) — ♡❤The Ghan♡❤ stops here for around five hours, with an optional guided "Whistle Stop Tour" available. The old railway from Darwin to Katherine stopped in central Katherine, and you can visit the site of the railway station. You can walk the old high level railway bridge across the Katherine river following the old alignment. However, it is around 10&amp;nbsp;km from the old station to the new one, so if you want to see Katherine, the tour may be your best option.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (945&amp;nbsp;km) — ♡❤The Ghan♡❤ isn't the way to see Tennant Creek. The train passes through in the early hours of the morning. The attractions of Tennant Creek require a car, and you aren't going to hire one here. There really isn't much of an experience to be had in town. If you are desperate enough to get off here, the local accommodation providers know the timetables, and you can see if you can arrange to be picked up from the station. Don't consider walking. Tennant Creek isn't the kind of place you want to be trying to find your way to your accommodation late at night.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (1420&amp;nbsp;km) — &lt;a href="Alice%20Springs"&gt;Alice Springs&lt;/a&gt; is the former northern terminus of ♡❤The Ghan♡❤ and the largest town by far en route. The train stops here for around four hours, long enough for a quick peek around town. The station is on the edge of the CBD, a couple of blocks walk to the Todd mall. Many people opt to break their journey here for a few days and visit &lt;a href="Uluru"&gt;Uluru&lt;/a&gt;, about 400&amp;nbsp;km away, but there is plenty to do for a few days in Alice and surrounds even if you don't venture to the Rock. Alice Springs has all the services to make it possible.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Is a roadhouse in the desert.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Chandler is a tiny settlement where ♡❤The Ghan♡❤ intersects the &lt;a href="Stuart%20Highway"&gt;Stuart Highway&lt;/a&gt;. Marla is a purpose built highway service centre with nothing else there except the highway, train line and the station. The highlight of any visit there is to see ♡❤The Ghan♡❤ when it passes through, and the desert stretching off into the distance, if you are actually on ♡❤The Ghan♡❤ looking at the desert stretching off into the distance, best to stay on board. If you do decide to get off, the motel, service station, and associated facilities are just across the road from the station.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — By prior arrangement only, ♡❤The Ghan♡❤ can stop at Manguri, 42&amp;nbsp;km away from the town of &lt;a href="Coober%20Pedy"&gt;Coober Pedy&lt;/a&gt;. You ♡❤must♡❤ have pre-arranged a pickup from here, since the location is very remote. The roads to Coober Pedy are dirt, and can be effected by the weather. If you can't demonstrate an arranged pickup is there, you may not be allowed to disembark.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — At the former mining town of Tarcoola, the Ghan merges with the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤ line coming in from &lt;a href="Perth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt; to the west. There are no shops, no accommodation, and if that doesn't seal the deal, the pub has closed. If you want to change between ♡❤The Ghan♡❤ and the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤, don't do it here. Port Augusta or Adelaide are your two options.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Markets itself as a "seriously outback town". Small town with just a pub. The train can stop here with prior arrangement, and the station is just across the road from the town. The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.kingoonyahotel.com.au"&gt;Kingoonya Waterhole Hotel&lt;/a&gt; is just a couple of minutes walk from the station and accommodation is available.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Pimba is located at the turnoff to Woomera on the Stuart Highway. It is around 6&amp;nbsp;km from Pimba to the formerly closed township of Woomera that supported the rocket and missile test range. As well as the missile park and its two museums, Woomera has a school, theatre, military-run hospital, swimming pool, gym and a hotel, together with a bowling alley, bank, post office, radio station and an IGA supermarket. You'll need to arrange a lift into town from the station.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Railway buffs may wish to get off here and ride the ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.prr.org.au/cms/index.php"&gt;Pichi Richi Railway&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ 78&amp;nbsp;km to &lt;a href="Quorn"&gt;Quorn&lt;/a&gt;, running along the original Ghan track and using original Ghan equipment. Departures are limited, especially outside the winter season. The town itself has all the facilities you need to break your journey.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The station is in the suburbs, around 5&amp;nbsp;km from the town centre. The old station in the centre of the town is closed and is a museum, including many items of railway heritage. Again, Port Pirie is a major town, with enough facilities to break your journey if you wish. You can get a taxi into town from the station.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (2979&amp;nbsp;km) — The end of the line &amp;mdash; unless you switch onto the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤ and continue onward to &lt;a href="Perth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Broken%20Hill"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<h2>The Indian Pacific</h2>

This route connects the Perth on the Indian Ocean with Sydney on the Pacific Ocean. The 4,352 km trip takes about three days and is distance-wise by far the longest in the Southern Hemisphere and one of the longest domestic rail journeys in the world. It's notable for the 478 km long section across the &lt;a href="Nullarbor"&gt;Nullarbor&lt;/a&gt; Plain, which is the longest straight railway stretch in the world.

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Either the destination of the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤ journey, or the point of departure, Perth is a useful terminus. The train ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤ departs from the East Perth terminal, just two stations away from the Perth CBD. The city caters for all levels of travellers, with budget backpackers well catered for in Northbridge, the suburb immediately north of the city railway station - to the hotels in the CBD which cater for the high spenders.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — An alternative to the long distance train ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤, the local Prospector rail service runs a daytime service daily between Kalgoorlie and Perth, making it simple to get off here and resume your journey by train any day you wish. The Kalgoorlie railway station itself is easy walking distance to the centre of town and accommodation.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Also known as the "Crossroads of Australia", this is not only a meeting place of the Indian Pacific and the Ghan, but as described above also the Pichi Richi railway.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The capital of South Australia has many attractions and facilities, and is the gateway to many more. The Keswick station has been renamed the ♡❤[Adelaide Parklands Terminal https://www.greatsouthernrail.com.au/fares-and-timetables/stations-and-terminals/adelaide-parklands-terminal]♡❤, on account of it being on the outside of the Adelaide city greenbelt. There is no suburban rail service from Adelaide Parklands Terminal to Adelaide City Terminal, the bus is a 15 minute walk from Adelaide Parklands Terminal. Taxi to the city is expensive, around $20, or you can call Uber. There are no real facilities or attractions in the station vicinity. The station itself is very basic, its only purpose to serve the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤ and ♡❤Ghan♡❤ trains that arrive a couple of times week. You can get your car off here, and transfer between the two transcontinental services.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The town of &lt;a href="Peterborough%20%28South%20Australia%29"&gt;Peterborough&lt;/a&gt; is a railway town. In Australia's rail era, Peterborough was at the crossroads of Australia, situated as it was at the intersection of the east-west railway linking &lt;a href="Port%20Pirie"&gt;Port Pirie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Broken%20Hill"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt;, and the north-south line linking Adelaide to Alice Springs via &lt;a href="Quorn"&gt;Quorn&lt;/a&gt;. Peterborough once had all three railway gauges running through its railway yard. The town is still railway themed, and the triple gauge turntable is now at the centre of the Steamtown Heritage Rail Centre. The ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤ is now the only train the town sees, and if you like absorbing railway history, then it is certainly possible to break your journey here (the train passing through just before midnight on the westward run, and around lunchtime on the eastward). The station is in the centre of town, and adjacent to the railway museum.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — Broken Hill is an ideal place to break your trip. Tours are offered here in the couple of hours that the train is at the station, with the coaches pulling up at the station at the same time as the train. If you choose not to take the coach tour, the railway station is right in the centre of town, and you can easily walk and spend time browsing the windows of a few galleries, returning to the station for the sunset. Broken Hill is worth a few days if you have them to spare, unfortunately you can't take your car off the motor rail here.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — About 450 km west of Sydney, the town of Parkes hosts an important radio telescope and an Elvis festival every January.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — The orange-coloured Sydney Central station is located just south of the Central Business District, and is actually smaller than you might expect. In addition to being the eastern terminus for the Indian Pacific, it is one of the main nodes in the city's public transport system. Things to see at the station itself include the flags of Australian states and territories hanging from the ceiling and the small exhibition of Australian railway history. If you've just arrived by train, exit the main entrance, and walk straight on for half an hour or so and you'll see the Opera House on your right-hand side and Harbour Bridge on your left.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
As it is a long journey, and there are few chances of people just wandering in onto the train like in other countries, it is nevertheless wise to secure your room or items.

<h2>Go next</h2>

<h3>On a connecting train</h3>
♡❤The Overland♡❤ (which is also a Great Southern Rail train) operates between Adelaide and &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the ♡❤Indian Pacific♡❤ or ♡❤The Ghan♡❤, ♡❤The Overland♡❤ is a day trip and takes 10 hours.

Sydney and Perth are both served by country rail services that connect to various country towns. Country rail services from Sydney are operated by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nswtrainlink.info/"&gt;NSW TrainLink&lt;/a&gt;, while those from Perth are operated by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.transwa.wa.gov.au/"&gt;TransWA&lt;/a&gt;. NSW TrainLink also operates the ♡❤Melbourne XPT♡❤ from Sydney to &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="Canberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the ♡❤Brisbane XPT♡❤ from Sydney to &lt;a href="Brisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;. From Brisbane, the &lt;a href="Gold%20Coast"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; is easily accessible on the suburban network of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.queenslandrail.com.au/"&gt;Queensland Rail&lt;/a&gt;, which also operates the long distance ♡❤Spirit of Queensland♡❤ all the way to &lt;a href="Cairns"&gt;Cairns&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>And see what you missed</h3>
Australia's pioneers had a grand vision for the railways, to cover a continent, and there are many places where this grand history can be seen. If you are catching the train one way, and travelling by car the other way, you can catch up with some of the interesting railway history you may have missed.

The &lt;a href="Oodnadatta%20Track"&gt;Oodnadatta Track&lt;/a&gt; basically follows the original alignment of the Ghan before it was moved. There are sections of track still in place, and you can walk on large sections of the alignment from the road. The &lt;a href="Oodnadatta"&gt;Oodnadatta&lt;/a&gt; station looks largely unchanged from when it saw its last train service 40 years ago.

<h1>Across Canada by train</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
While most Canadians choose to travel between major cities by airplane, there still exists today a continuous series of connecting train services from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and a trans-continental journey on the passenger trains of Canada remains one of the greatest railway journeys in the world.

<h2>Understand</h2>

&lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; is the second largest country on earth, yet with a population of just 32,780,000, it has just the thirty-sixth largest population. The sheer size of the country, which spans 9,984,670 km² (3,854,085 sq mi) and six time zones means that vast areas are either sparsely populated or completely uninhabited. This itinerary explains how to book, travel and experience the scheduled passenger rail services that exist between:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Halifax%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Nova%20Scotia"&gt;Nova Scotia&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Montr%C3%A9al"&gt;Montréal&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Ottawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Toronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt; (Ontario)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Winnipeg"&gt;Winnipeg&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Manitoba"&gt;Manitoba&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Saskatoon"&gt;Saskatoon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Saskatchewan"&gt;Saskatchewan&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Edmonton"&gt;Edmonton&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="Alberta"&gt;Alberta&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤♡

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Vancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="British%20Columbia"&gt;British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;)♡❤♡

</ul>
This itinerary covers 6,351km (3,946 miles), crosses eight Canadian provinces and passes through some of &lt;a href="North%20America"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;'s most vibrant and exciting cities. Whether experienced from the comfort of a private sleeping compartment or in the sociable and affordable seated coaches, it is a once-in-a-lifetime trip that demonstrates Canada's social and geographic diversity, from sea to shining sea.

There are many other passenger rail services in Canada. Information on all other rail services in Canada can be found on &lt;a href="Rail%20travel%20in%20Canada"&gt;Rail travel in Canada&lt;/a&gt; page.

<h2>Prepare</h2>

<h3>Find time</h3>
Canada does not have any high-speed railway lines, and much of the infrastructure was built before World War II. In modern times, Canada's railways are primarily used for freight traffic, with passenger services generally given lower priority. The train services listed here are thus not high speed services, but rather are laid back services that primarily cater to tourists with ample time on their hands to enjoy the scenery.

<h3>Whom to travel with</h3>

A handful of private luxury train operators offer exclusive rail tours; however most passenger rail services in Canada are provided by ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/"&gt;VIA Rail Canada&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, the state-owned Crown Corporation that provides national passenger rail services. ♡❤♡This itinerary uses only the services of VIA Rail Canada♡❤♡.

<h3>Which direction to travel in</h3>

Travelling from one side of Canada to another by train is the perfect framework for an exciting and varied holiday. Travelling both ways is not: the vast landscape of the country will become infinitely less interesting if you have to turn round and go back again.

Decide whether to start your trip in the west (Vancouver) or in the east (Halifax). Check the timetables of the trains you'll be riding on to see how this affects the arrival times in towns and cities you want to stop off in. Many travellers express a preference in going from east to west, since this follows the direction that European settlers populated the country and rewards you after the seemingly endless prairies with the breathtaking &lt;a href="Rocky%20Mountains%20%28Canada%29"&gt;Rocky Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but the decision of which way to travel is yours.

Additional side trips by train to other destinations are possible at various points along the transcontinental route. See the &lt;a href="Rail%20travel%20in%20Canada"&gt;Rail travel in Canada&lt;/a&gt; page for more information on these other routes.

<h3>When to go</h3>

Canada's train services run throughout the year, although in some cases with reduced frequencies and shorter trains in the low season. Low season (October&amp;ndash;April) fares are lower than in the high season (May&amp;ndash;September) although when travelling during the winter months you should remember that shorter daylight hours will significantly affect your sightseeing opportunities from the train. Be aware that while summer can be warm and pleasant, winter temperatures in central and eastern Canada plunge well below freezing - sometimes to as low as -30 degrees Celsius or below. A winter train trip can be fun, but you may find it hard to leave the nice warm train when you arrive at intermediate stations.

For many independent passengers, spring and autumn are the most convenient times to travel, when the climate is comfortable and when low-season fares are available at either end of the high season booking period.

<h3>How to book</h3>

♡❤♡VIA Rail Canada♡❤♡ has an excellent &lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that provides travel information and online ticket sales in several languages. Within North America, you can contact VIA Rail Canada by telephoning 1-888-VIA-RAIL.

<h3>Tickets and rail passes</h3>

Fares in the low season (♡❤♡16 October to 31 May♡❤♡) are less expensive than those in the high season (♡❤♡1 June to 15 October♡❤♡). Advance booking is recommended for all tickets and passes.

<h4>'Comfort' (coach/economy) class</h4>

'Comfort' class gives you a comfortable reclining seat in an open coach with either one or two seats either side of the aisle. An amenity pack, pillow and blanket are provided, and it is reasonably easy to sleep comfortably during the night. Older passengers or those who might experience discomfort sleeping in a reclining seat may prefer to travel in sleeper class (see below).

<h4>Sleeper classes: Halifax to Montréal</h4>

VIA Rail Canada offer two different classes of sleeper accommodation on the Ocean between Halifax and Montréal throughout the year, with an enhanced sleeper class called 'Easterly Class' during the high season. All services are now operated by modern 'Renaissance' trains, which have replaced the older 'stainless steel' trains used elsewhere in Canada. 

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/classes/en_serv_visi_renai_ocdo.html"&gt;Double bedrooms&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ have two berths and an en-suite washroom with toilet, handbasin, mirror and power outlet. They are lockable from inside and outside, and can also accommodate a child when two adults are in the two berths.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/classes/en_serv_visi_renai_delu.html"&gt;Deluxe double bedrooms&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ are the same as double bedrooms, but with an en-suite shower.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Easterly class♡❤♡ is offered on the Ocean during the high season from early May to the end of October, and is marketed as an enhanced class based on the deluxe double bedroom. Presentations affording cultural and historical insights of the region through which the train passes are offered, and passengers have exclusive access to the lounges and panoramic section of the luxurious Park car. Easterly class tickets include meals in the restaurant car.

</ul>
<h4>Sleeper classes: Montréal to Toronto</h4>

Overnight sleeper services between Montréal and Toronto have been discontinued. You should travel by day, spending at least one night in Toronto or Montréal before boarding your next train.

<h4>Sleeper classes: Toronto to Vancouver</h4>

&lt;a href="The%20Canadian"&gt;The Canadian&lt;/a&gt; is VIA Rail Canada's flagship service, and offers the widest choice of sleeper accommodation on the network. All trains are operated by heavily refurbished 1950s 'stainless steel' trains. All sleeper tickets are marketed as ♡❤♡Silver and Blue class♡❤♡ and access to the luxurious Park Car at the end of the train and include all meals in the restaurant car.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/classes/en_serv_visi_cosu.html"&gt;Berths&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ are wide facing banquette seats that convert into cosy bunks at night. A curtain that can be fastened shut separates you from the corridor, and toilets and a shower are near-by. Upper and lower berths priced differently, since upper berths are accessed by a small ladder, and require a certain nimbleness.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/classes/en_serv_visi_chin.html"&gt;Single Bedrooms&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ are one step up from a berth. A wide seat folds down at night to form a bed in a private room, with one either side of the corridor. A sliding door closes off the bedroom from the corridor, and there is a private basin and toilet in the room (the toilet is easily covered and does not detract from the room).
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/classes/en_serv_visi_ocdo.html"&gt;Double bedrooms&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ have two beds arranged one above each other at right angles to the side of the train. Each bedroom features two armchairs, a small closet, fan, electrical outlet, private washroom, sink and mirror. The door locks from the inside and there is a shower down the corridor.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/classes/en_serv_visi_octr.html"&gt;Triple bedrooms&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ are like double bedrooms, but with an additional lower bunk and slightly more room.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/classes/en_serv_clas_tour_tram.html"&gt;Romance by rail&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is a special package normally taken by honeymooning couples for travel between Toronto and Jasper or Jasper and Vancouver. Two double bedrooms have had their upper bunks and the wall between removed to create a double width room with a double bed.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/rockies-and-pacific/toronto-vancouver-canadian/classes-and-trains-cars%23prestige"&gt;Prestige Sleeper Class&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡

</ul>
<h3>What to bring</h3>

♡❤♡Sleeper passengers♡❤♡ should

<ul>
BULLET::::- pack one or two lightweight bags with all the clothes, toiletries and personal items (including valuables) for their on board cabin
BULLET::::- pack items and clothing not required during the journey into separate luggage for the baggage car. It is not possible to gain access to the baggage car between your originating and destination stations.

</ul>
Unlike on board the services of &lt;a href="Amtrak"&gt;Amtrak&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; ♡❤♡Comfort Class (coach) passengers♡❤♡ on VIA Rail Canada are provided with an amenity kit to make passing the night in coach a cinch. This includes a pillow, blanket, toothbrush, toothpaste, eye mask and ear plugs. However you might like to supplement this with:

<ul>
BULLET::::- at least one additional inflatable pillow
BULLET::::- lightweight soft clothes to change into for sleeping
BULLET::::- your own ear plugs (the better quality the easier it will be to sleep)
BULLET::::- a small toiletry bag with your personal items
BULLET::::- wet wipes for easy hygiene
BULLET::::- bottled water (this can be refilled on the train)
BULLET::::- snacks, sandwiches etc. (although these are on sale on board)

</ul>
Again, luggage that has been checked into the baggage car cannot be accessed during the journey, so pack a smaller bag with everything you'll need during the trip.

<h2>Get in</h2>

Depending on which side of the country that you start your transcontinental train trip in, see either the &lt;a href="Halifax%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29"&gt;Halifax (Nova Scotia)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Vancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; pages for information on getting in.

<h2>Overview of route and trains</h2>

♡❤♡This itinerary presents a journey that travels from east to west♡❤♡, however it is quite possible and equally enjoyable to make the journey in the opposite direction. The three trains that make up the basic coast-to-coast route are:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/trains/en_trai_atla_hamo.html"&gt;The Ocean&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ from Halifax to Montréal
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/trains/en_trai_queb_moto.html"&gt;The Corridor&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ from Montréal to Toronto
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/trains/en_trai_toja.html"&gt;The Canadian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ from Toronto to Vancouver

</ul>
The train times that follow were retrieved on 2 June 2010. Check the VIA Rail Canada &lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for updates before making travel arrangements.

<h3>The Ocean</h3>

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/en/trains/atlantic-canada/montreal-halifax-ocean"&gt;The Ocean&lt;/a&gt; departs Halifax every day except Tuesday at 1:48pm. The train travels overnight to Montréal, arriving at 09.05am the following morning. In the other direction, the Ocean departs Montréal every night except Tuesday at 6.30pm, arriving in Halifax 5.10pm the following afternoon.

Three days a week the Chaleur (Montréal - &lt;a href="Gasp%C3%A9"&gt;Gaspé&lt;/a&gt; train) is coupled to the Ocean and shares locomotives the for part of the trip between Montréal and &lt;a href="Matap%C3%A9dia"&gt;Matapédia&lt;/a&gt;.

Both east and west bound trains are scheduled to operate over the most scenic parts of the route during the day time, so you will travel through most of Québec along the south shore of the Saint Lawrence river by night. Bear in mind the late night departure or early morning arrival if you want to leave the Ocean at &lt;a href="Charny"&gt;Charny&lt;/a&gt; for the bus transfer to &lt;a href="Quebec%20City"&gt;Quebec City&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the most scenic part of the route is east of &lt;a href="Matap%C3%A9dia"&gt;Matapédia&lt;/a&gt;, where the train splits or joins three times a week with the Chaleur train to &lt;a href="Gasp%C3%A9"&gt;Gaspé&lt;/a&gt;. The line immediately east of Matapédia enters the province of &lt;a href="New%20Brunswick"&gt;New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; and then follows the south shore of the Baie de Chaleurs, offering splendid views across the water to the receding coastline of the &lt;a href="Gasp%C3%A9%20Peninsula"&gt;Gaspé Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Heading west, this is in the late evening; heading east, this is in the early morning, and makes for a spectacular distraction to breakfast in the restaurant car.

<h3>The Corridor</h3>

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/en/trains/ontario-and-quebec"&gt;The Corridor&lt;/a&gt; is the broad name given to the collection of intercity routes that connect Montréal, Ottawa, &lt;a href="Brockville"&gt;Brockville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kingston%20%28Ontario%29"&gt;Kingston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Belleville%20%28Ontario%29"&gt;Belleville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Oshawa"&gt;Oshawa&lt;/a&gt;, Toronto and other destinations in southern Ontario. There are multiple daily departures on modern trains that carry ♡❤Economy♡❤ class and ♡❤Business♡❤ class. There are no more overnight or sleeper services. Ottawa is served by direct trains from both Montréal and Toronto, but is not on the route of most of the direct services between the two cities.

The landscapes of southern Quebec and Ontario don't make for a particularly scenic route, but the route is the fastest in Canada and offers a rapid cross section through some of the country's most important industrial manufacturing cities. You'll catch glimpses of Lake Ontario just as you approach / leave Toronto.

<h3>&lt;a href="The%20Canadian"&gt;The Canadian&lt;/a&gt;</h3>
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/en/trains/rockies-and-pacific/toronto-vancouver-canadian"&gt;The Canadian&lt;/a&gt; departs Toronto at 9:45AM on Wednesdays and Sundays, arriving in Vancouver 4 days later at 8AM. It leaves Vancouver at 3PM on Mondays and Fridays, arriving in Toronto 4 days later at 2:30PM. (Schedule as of 29 Apr 2019.)

The twice-weekly departures of the Canadian are likely to be the most important factor to consider when planning your coast to coast trip. 

Many travellers will agree that the Canadian's primary selling point (the vast distance that it covers; 4,466 km or 2,775 miles) can also be its weakness. The train takes more than a day to cross from Toronto to the border with Manitoba, largely covering the distance through a repetitive scenery of lakes and forests. While exceptionally beautiful, this landscape can quickly become boring, so it's a good part of the journey in which to get to know your fellow travellers. Note that the Canadian can on advance notice be stopped at any point along its route between &lt;a href="Sudbury%20%28Ontario%29"&gt;Sudbury&lt;/a&gt; and Winnipeg, whether its at an actual station, named halt, milepost or simply a given number of kilometres from the last city. Canoes, bikes and other equipment can be carried in the luggage car, allowing you to take advantage of northern Ontario's vast landscape for outdoor activities.

Almost immediately after leaving Ontario, the Canadian enters the prairies and will not leave them until the Rocky Mountains emerge a full twenty four hours later. European travellers in particular might find this part of the trip to be the least beautiful, but possibly the most symbolic part of the trip. The sheer scale of Canada becomes undeniable as the train picks up speed over dead straight stretches of track that cross the bread basket of the country. Small communities and the occasional farm flash past, but it could well be the enormous skies that catch your eye the most.

Travelling across Canada by train from east to west makes the most sense when you first catch sight of the Rocky Mountains. After two days crossing the largely flat and forgettable landscapes of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, the scale and grandeur of the mountains is incredible to behold. The schedule of the east- and westbound Canadian are designed to ensure that you get the best possible daylight hours for viewing the mountains between Edmonton and &lt;a href="Kamloops"&gt;Kamloops&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Itineraries</h2>

Coast to coast, it is possible to make the journey from Halifax to Vancouver on board just three different trains, and in as little as five days travelling. Here are four recommended itineraries, based on the length of time travelling.

Check the VIA Rail Canada &lt;a href="http%3A//www.viarail.ca/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for schedules before making travel arrangements.

<h3>Five days</h3>

Few travellers choose to do this journey straight through, not only because it can be quite hard work in coach class, but because it misses out on the opportunity to experience so many different and exciting cities. However, seasoned travellers who already know Canada well and who have limited vacation time (or just a hankering to ride the train) may relish the sound of this near-non-stop trip.

<h3>Seven days</h3>

It's possible to combine the basic coast to coast itinerary with one extended layover. Again, this itinerary is probably better suited to those who have already visited Canada before, so the choice of which city to stop off in is largely up to you. Any stop on the route of the Canadian between Toronto and Vancouver would necessitate a stop of at least two, if not three days, because of the frequency of service of the Canadian. This applies in both directions.

Therefore, a seven day itinerary would probably be best expanded on the five day itinerary above by adding extra days in ♡❤♡just one♡❤♡ of the following cities:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Halifax%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29"&gt;Halifax (Nova Scotia)&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Montr%C3%A9al"&gt;Montréal&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Toronto"&gt;Toronto&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Vancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡

</ul>
You can find out more about each one on their respective travel pages. All four offer excellent public transit systems and compact downtown cores that can easily be explored on foot. With just two days, you would be well advised to research ahead, and be realistic about what you expect to see and do in the time that you have.

<h3>Fourteen days</h3>

With two full weeks, the possibilities of the Canrailpass open up, and you can reasonably make two or three stops en route. A two-week itinerary is probably the shortest that a first-time visitor to Canada can reasonably manage. The shorter itineraries suggested above are for the serious train fans, since after one or two days on board, you are likely to want a break off the train. ♡❤♡Remember♡❤♡ the Canrailpass is valid for seven or ten days of travel in any sixty day period. Days when you are not on board a train don't count towards your final total, but that if you depart a city at 8PM one day and arrive at 8AM the next day, you will have used two travelling days.

There are several options. You can consider a stop in any of the following major cities:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Halifax (Nova Scotia)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Montréal (Quebec)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Ottawa (Ontario)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Toronto (Ontario)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Winnipeg (Manitoba)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Saskatoon (Saskatchewan)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Edmonton (Alberta)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Jasper (Alberta)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Vancouver (British Columbia)♡❤♡

</ul>
For example, for travellers who want to see more the big cities:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day one♡❤♡ in Halifax (all day)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day two♡❤♡ in Halifax (a.m.); dep. Halifax (midday)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day three♡❤♡ arr. Montréal (a.m.); in Montréal (p.m.)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day four♡❤♡ in Montréal (all day)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day five♡❤♡ in Montréal (a.m.); dep. Montréal / arrive Ottawa (p.m.)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day six♡❤♡ in Ottawa (a.m.); depart Ottawa / arrive Toronto (p.m.)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day seven♡❤♡ in Toronto (all day)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day eight♡❤♡ in Toronto (all day)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day nine♡❤♡ dep. Toronto (a.m.); on board the Canadian
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day ten♡❤♡ on board the Canadian
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day eleven♡❤♡ on board the Canadian
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day twelve♡❤♡ arr. Vancouver (a.m.); in Vancouver (p.m.)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day thirteen♡❤♡ in Vancouver (all day)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day fourteen♡❤♡ in Vancouver (all day)

</ul>
Or, for travellers who want to see more of Canada's west:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day one♡❤♡ in Halifax (a.m.); dep. Halifax (midday)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day two♡❤♡ arr. Montréal (a.m.); breakfast in Montréal; depart Montréal / arrive Toronto (p.m.)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day three♡❤♡ dep. Toronto (a.m.); on board the Canadian
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day four♡❤♡ on board the Canadian; arrive Winnipeg (p.m.)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day five♡❤♡ in Winnipeg (all day)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day six♡❤♡ in Winnipeg (all day)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day seven♡❤♡ in Winnipeg (a.m.) dep. Winnipeg (p.m.)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day eight♡❤♡ on board the Canadian; arrive Jasper (p.m.)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day nine♡❤♡ in Jasper (all day)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day ten♡❤♡ in Jasper (all day)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day eleven♡❤♡ in Jasper (a.m.); dep. Jasper (p.m.)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day twelve♡❤♡ arr. Vancouver (a.m.); in Vancouver
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day thirteen♡❤♡ in Vancouver (all day)
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Day fourteen♡❤♡ in Vancouver (all day)

</ul>
As before, it is recommended to decide what interests you the most and which cities you would like to see, remembering that if you alight from the Canadian (between Toronto and Vancouver) at any stop, you will have to spend two, if not three days there until the next train comes through. An exception to this is possible in Jasper, where you have the choice of two alternative connections to &lt;a href="Prince%20Rupert"&gt;Prince Rupert&lt;/a&gt; with Via and to Vancouver with &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡The Rocky Mountaineer♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt; 

Travellers who want to visit the western and prairie cities of Canada as part of this two week itinerary may find themselves choosing between:

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Winnipeg (Manitoba)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Saskatoon (Saskatchewan)♡❤♡
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Edmonton (Alberta)♡❤♡

</ul>
It is recommended to carefully research your choice, and to consider when and where you will be arriving. Both the east- and west-bound Canadian trains call at Edmonton and Winnipeg during the daytime, but both services arrive at and depart from Saskatoon in the very early hours when you'll be dependent on a taxi and a hostel or hotel that will let you check in during the middle of the night. The Saskatoon rail station is approximately 8 km (5 miles) from downtown. Similarly, the Edmonton station is approximately 6 km from downtown with no public transit between the two. The Winnipeg station is located almost in the heart of downtown.

<h3>One month</h3>

The basic fourteen-day itineraries above can easily be expanded with longer stopovers in the cities and destinations that interest you the most while still only using a twelve-day Canrailpass. You might find it helpful, however, to purchase some extra days. Up to three extra days are available on a Canrailpass (see price information above), allowing you more freedom in planning connections.

With a whole month to spend, you could easily consider riding some of the other trains operated by VIA Rail Canada, such as the Chaleur to ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Gasp%C3%A9"&gt;Gaspé&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ (although eastbound to westbound and westbound to eastbound connections with the Ocean at Matapédia are inconvenient). ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Quebec%20City"&gt;Quebec City&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is another excellent destination for rail travellers, and it's close to the route of the &lt;a href="Ocean"&gt;Ocean&lt;/a&gt; between Montréal and Halifax with transfers available. The basic day required for sightseeing in the nation's capital ♡❤♡Ottawa♡❤♡ could easily be extended to two or three allowing time to see the city's impressive museums. Further west, any three of the cities of ♡❤♡Winnipeg♡❤♡, ♡❤♡Saskatoon♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡Edmonton♡❤♡ make great bases from which to explore the vast prairies, although you're likely to need to hire a car if you want to cover any real ground. During the summer months they're also essential stops on the festival tour, as each city puts on their own lively ♡❤♡Fringe Festival♡❤♡. If you want to get off the beaten track (and are prepared to do some serious pre-trip planning) take a detour from Winnipeg on board the government subsidised Hudson Bay train to &lt;a href="Churchill"&gt;Churchill&lt;/a&gt;, the world capital of polar bears, beluga whales, and various other transient arctic critters. Beware though: the Hudson Bay runs over tracks that are bedded on the permafrost, so it's a more than 40-hour crawl to the far north and the Hudson Bay.

And if you're passing through the Rocky Mountains during the winter months, it would be foolish not to spend anything from a couple of days to a week in Jasper on the slopes.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>

Rail travel in Canada is incredibly safe. The only precautions to take relate to personal belongings and valuables. While it is almost always safe to leave your possessions at your seat while you go to the restaurant or observation car, don't advertise valuable and easily stolen items such as personal music players or computers. To be really safe, check your luggage into the baggage car. Theft from luggage while it is in the care of VIA Rail is unheard of, and you'll be reunited with your bags when you reach your destination.

<h2>Go next</h2>

Depending on which side of the country that you start your transcontinental train trip in, see either the &lt;a href="Halifax%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29"&gt;Halifax (Nova Scotia)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Vancouver"&gt;Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; pages for information on getting out.

<h1>Acton (Ontario)</h1>
♡❤♡Acton♡❤♡ is a community of about 9,500 people (2016) in the Town of Halton Hills in &lt;a href="Halton%20%28Ontario%29"&gt;Halton Region&lt;/a&gt;. It sits above the Niagara Escarpment, and the &lt;a href="Bruce%20Trail"&gt;Bruce Trail&lt;/a&gt; passes to the south and east of the community, with the Guelph Trail branching off and passing south of town.

<h2>Understand</h2>
From 1842 until 1986, the town was a major centre for the tanning and leather goods industry. In the early years, it was often referred to as "Leathertown".

<h3>History</h3>

In 1825, the area now known as Acton was settled by the Rev. Ezra, Rev. Zenas, and Rufus Adams. These men were Methodist preachers who took a sabbatical and began farming here on a branch of the Credit River. A fourth brother, Eliphalet, also settled here later. In the 1840s, the community had a grist mill and tannery. The community was named Danville when settler Wheeler Green opened a dry-goods store in 1828. It was later called Adamsville, after the three original settlers.

In 1856 the Grand Trunk Railway arrived and helped spur growth in the area, especially along Mill Street. By 1869, Acton had businesses that included woodworking mills, tanneries, glove makers and carriage works. Acton's principal trade was in grain, lumber, cordwood, leather and hops. In 1883, postmaster Robert Swan named the village Acton after the area of Acton, London in England.

Significance of the leather industry
Tanning has been an important industry in Acton since 1842, when the first tannery was established by Abraham Nelles, as the area was attractive to the leather industry because of the large numbers of hemlock spruce trees. These provided the tannin required for a firm, high quality leather of a reddish colour.

The Beardmore family purchased it in 1865 and ran it for over 50 years. At one time, it was the largest tanner in Canada. The Beardmores also opened tanneries in other parts of southern Ontario. By 1889, their main tanneries in Acton covered 100,000 m². They also built a large brick warehouse that year beside the railway tracks. Hides arrived by rail and were taken for processing by horse-drawn wagons and then shipped by rail to customers.

In 1969, the business was sold to Frank Heller and Company, who consolidated it into one large building in 1980. The business was closed at times because of bankruptcy and other reasons, but is now in operation. Other specialty tanners and leather products manufacturers were also established in the town.

<h1>Actun Tunichil Muknal</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Actun Tunichil Muknal♡❤♡ (often abbreviated as the ♡❤♡ATM♡❤♡) is a cave formation in the &lt;a href="Cayo"&gt;Cayo&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Belize"&gt;Belize&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
The Actun Tunichil Muknal (literally translated as "Cave of the Stone Sepulcher") is a relatively recent discovery and can be considered to be more of an eco-tourist destination rather than a traditional caving experience. Guides take great pains to stress the importance of Actun Tunichil Muknal as both a natural formation and a site of historical interest. 

<h3>History</h3>
The cave was discovered in 1992, and was featured on the National Geographic Explorer film, ♡❤Journey Through the Underworld♡❤. Actun Tunichil Muknal represents one of the most well-preserved examples of pre-classical Mayan culture (around 700 - 900 AD), featuring skeletal remains of human sacrifices and scores of Mayan pottery and other ceremonial objects. Since then, the cave has been completely mapped and explored, covering about 5.3 km (3.3 miles).

The cave was opened to the public in 2000, and the artifacts within are in the same position as they were when the cave was explored by researchers. These skeletal remains and Mayan objects are properly demarcated by archeologists and the Belize Tourism Board to prevent damage unwittingly caused by tourists.

<h3>Landscape</h3>

<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>

<h3>Climate</h3>

<h2>Get in</h2>
Although the cave is relatively close to &lt;a href="San%20Ignacio%20%28Belize%29"&gt;San Ignacio&lt;/a&gt;, the only road leading out of the town to the site is a bumpy and rural road that crosses a part of the Mopan River. In any case, a guide is required in order to have access to the caves, so taking a package tour with one of the licensed tour companies in San Ignacio would be the best option. Reputable tour companies offering the Actun Tunichil Muknal tour include: Katun Ahaw Tours &lt;a href="http%3A//belizeculturetours.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Mayatour &lt;a href="http%3A//www.mayatour.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pacz Tours &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pacztours.net/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https%3A//www.kawiiltours.com/"&gt;KaWiil Tours&lt;/a&gt;, each only several steps from the others in the heart of San Ignacio. There are also US tour operators who tour the ATM cave. These companies work with local, licensed guides: Adventure Life &lt;a href="http%3A//www.adventure-life.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Intrepid &lt;a href="http%3A//www.intrepidtravel.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Wildland Adventures. During Belize's wet season (late June-August), the cave may be flooded and unavailable to travellers. 

The cave is located in the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve. To reach the cave, requires an easy 45-minute hike into the jungle. The entrance to the cave is shaped like an hour glass and is flooded with water. Travelers need to be prepared to get wet, and remain relatively wet to damp during their time in the cave. The cave system consists of a series of chambers, ending at "The Cathedral" where sacrificial ceremonies once took place. Here 14 skeletal remains have been found, and numerous examples of ancient Mayan pottery remain. It takes roughly 1 1/2 to 2 hours to reach "The Cathedral," so travellers should be prepared to be in the cave for 4 to 6 hours. Quick-dry clothing is recommended, as most guides will insist on shorts and a shirt, as a sign of respect. This is a very sacred site. Sandals are not allowed in ATM for safety reasons. Travelers must remove their shoes, and must wear socks while in "The Cathedral" to protect the site from oils on the skin. Guides typically carry a dry pack; however, personal items such as cameras are no longer permitted in the cave due to damage caused by a tourist dropping a digital camera on one of the artifacts. In some locations, the only source of light is from helmets (required for entrance) and/or flashlights. Guides should supply these items.

<h2>Buy</h2>
There is no gift store associated with this attraction.

<h2>Eat</h2>
As there are no dining establishments within the preserve; most tours will include a packed lunch, and recommend that you bring along a water bottle and snacks.

<h3>Lodging</h3>

<h3>Camping</h3>

<h3>Backcountry</h3>

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
As with any cave tour, the best way to remain safe is to comply with guide instructions and to keep with your group, refraining from exploring areas by yourself. As you get deeper into the cave, there is no natural light, and many areas require traversal through chest-high areas of water, as well as short rock formations to climb to get to the main chambers. At no point should you separate from your guide/group.

Additionally, because preserving the pristine nature of the cave - both its natural formations and its Mayan artefacts - is so important, following guide directions closely is a must. Help to retain the undisturbed nature of Actun Tunichil Muknal by complying with guide instructions on acceptable behaviour when exploring the cave. Planning is underway to create more clearly delineated paths in order to avoid inadvertent damage to the cave.

<h1>Ada (Ghana)</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Ada♡❤♡ refers to an area in the Dangme East District that is located in the eastern part of the Greater Accra Region in the southeast of &lt;a href="Ghana"&gt;Ghana&lt;/a&gt;. It is comprised principally of the "towns" of Ada Foah, Big Ada, and Ada Kasseh. Ada Foah, which is also the district capital, is located at the beach and river estuary, and naturally is where most visitors spend their time. 

<h2>Understand</h2>
The district's coconut palm fringed coastline is 45 kilometers long and provides a living to many people that are employed in fishing and fish processing. However, this coastline is constantly being eroded by the strong tidal waves that are washing away or threatening several villages that are located close to the beach. In order to solve this problem, the construction of a sea defense wall is under way since 2010.

The long, sandy beaches are certainly some of the most important tourist attractions. However, there are certain obstacles such as the lack of toilets in the villages close to the beach and the consequence of using the beach as such. Also, garbage – mostly plastic – is piling up at the beach, some of it disposed there, some washed up from the sea by the tide.

Apart from the sandy beaches, another natural attraction in the district is the Volta River and its estuary. The Volta River forms the eastern boundary of the district before it reaches the Gulf of Guinea. The islands in the river and in the estuary are a wildlife paradise: marine turtles, birds, crocodiles and monkeys are some of the animals living there. The mangrove vegetation in the salty parts of the estuary is another attraction and an important ecosystem. It is however endangered by human activity along with rare animals that are often hunted down.

The estuary also offers the best conditions for water sports like sailing, canoeing, fishing, water skiing, wake boarding and jet skiing.

Another important water body and one of the most important salt mining areas in the country is the Songor Lagoon. Additional to visiting it and learning about salt mining it serves as a base for birdwatchers.

<h2>Talk</h2>
Most of the inhabitants (85.9 %) belong to the Dangme Tribe. The local language in the Dangme East and West District is Dangme, also called Adangme. It is a Kwa language and is spoken by around 800.000 people in the Dangme East, Dangme West, Volta Region and Togo. They are part of the Ga-Dangbe ancestral lineage. The Dangme speak und understand Ga Language as it is similar to Dangme. English is also spoken by nearly everyone since it is the official language of the country. Many people also speak some Ewe (to communicate with the neighboring people of the Volta Region, Togo and Benin) or Twi.

<h2>Get in</h2>
The best way to get to Ada is by Tro-Tro (small bus), taxi, your own or a rental car. 

From &lt;a href="Accra"&gt;Accra&lt;/a&gt;: there is a reagular connection (1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, about 120 km) from Tudu Station or from Tema Roundabout. Some Tro-Tros go directly to Ada Foah, with others you have to change in Ada Kasseh. The usual times of operation are between 4.30 am and 9.30 pm, but can vary according to the day of the week. 

From &lt;a href="Aflao"&gt;Aflao&lt;/a&gt;:take a Tro-Tro in the direction to Accra and get off at Ada Kasseh (3-4 hours, about 80 km).

You can also get there by ferry from the Volta Region (Anyanui). It only operates on Wednesdays and leaves Anyanui at around 1pm and 6pm and takes about 1 1/2 hours. It departs in Ada Foah around 8am and 3pm. 

<h2>Get around</h2>
Taxis are readily available, either by car or by motorcycle. Even though motorcycles are not officially allowed to operate as taxis, it is a very common and affordable means of transport. And it can bring you to faraway places that don't seem to be accessible with any vehicle. Just stand at the street and stop a passing one. You can also ask your guesthouse or the Tourist Information Center to book one for you.

The best way to get around is the ever present Tro-Tro (small bus). It's easy to get around with a reagular connection between Ada Foah and Kasseh (about 20 km). 

If you feel like taking the water route, consider joining the ferry to the market in Anyanui on Wednesdays. This is a very fun way of getting to the other side of the Volta River with a big crowd of locals who bring their products to the market. The ferry leaves Ada Foah around 8 am and 3 pm and returns from Anyanui around 1 pm and 6 pm. It takes about 1 1/2 hours one way. These are only approximate times - in general, the ferry operates similar to the Tro-Tro: it leaves when it's full.

The Estuary Beach camps are a little harder to reach. The typical way is to grab a motor canoe from virtually any beach on the bayside, with the closest, cheapest option being from the end of the taxi-passable road at the entrance to Azazanyi Village. You can do the sandy 30-minute walk through Azazanyi too, with the most direct (and lightest hassle) route being along the oceanside beach.

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Community zoo♡❤♡. Samuel Kabutey Kabo caught his first snake when he built a well some years ago. He went to town to get some supplies and accidentally ran over a cobra with his bike. The snake got very angry and followed him back to his house where it fell into the half-finished well. Samuel's first instinct was to kill the snake, but the Wildlife Division told him that he should keep it and show it to the people to educate them about local animals. That is how the community zoo started. After the Cobra Samuel also caught some pythons and crocodiles that can all be visited at the zoo.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Crocodile Island♡❤♡. There used to be a great number of crocodiles living on one of the islands in the river. But increased human activities drove them away. All that is left nowadays are two or three crocodiles living in a small walled cage on Pediatorkope island. There is no tour to visit them, but any boat operator will take you there if you want or just rent a canoe and paddle there yourself.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Fetish shrines♡❤♡. Shrines are part of daily life in Ghana. The two major shrines in Big Ada were closely connected to Trokosi, or girl child slavery. In this traditional perception, a crime is atoned for when a girl of the offender's family is send to a shrine to serve the gods. This can be for months, but also for many years. Although this practice was legally abolished in 1998, there are still some groups who want to hold on to this tradition. Other opposing groups on the other hand have put much effort into the liberation of the girls and their education and reintegration into society.
</ul>
In Big Ada, Dasume Shrine and Dada Shrine (also called Ogbekpe) can be visited. There is another big one in Goi, one on the island of Alorkpem and one on the other side of the Volta in Anyanui. 

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Fetish priests♡❤♡. Every shrine has its priest who takes care of it and worships the gods in it. So naturally, there is a great number of shrines in the district – most of which can also be visited. Many priests have special healing abilities, do spiritual ceremonies and are consulted for any kind of problem from sicknesses to family problems, unemployment or bad luck.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Fishing♡❤♡. Building traditional fishing boats requires much work and is very expensive. The lower part of the boat is made of one big piece of wood, the upper part of planks. All the boats are then painted in many colors with religious sayings written on it. There are many fishing villages around, the bigger ones being Akplabana and Pute.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Monkey Island♡❤♡. You have to get up early to see the monkeys on so called "Monkey Island" in the Volta River. During the day they stay away from the villages and retreat far into the woods, but if you manage to arrive around 6.30 a.m. you can watch them from one of the watchtowers that were built for this purpose.

</ul>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Old trading fort at the seaside♡❤♡. Only few people know where Ada Foah has got its name from. The reason is the fort near the Presbyterian Church that gave the town its name to distinguish the two Adas: Ada Fort, village of the fort. As the sea comes closer more than 1.5 meters each year, it is gradually washing the building that once used to be a prison into the ocean. Half of it is already eroded but hopefully the upcoming construction of the sea defense wall will stop this progress.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Ostrich Farm♡❤♡. If you want to see some really big birds go to Dedukope Ostrich Farm, located close to the border of the Dangme East District. They have some hundred ostriches living in enclosures whose meat is sold to restaurants. You can walk along the enclosures and have a look at the giant eggs. It's a bit difficult to get there, there is no established tour so far and the only information you get is from the watchman or the taxi driver (a small tip is appreciated for the visit).
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Presbyterian church and missionary cemetery♡❤♡. When looking at the Presbyterian Church in Ada Foah you will be aware that it is a missionary church built by the first generation of Ghanaian Christians at around 1890. When the European missionaries came to Ghana in the 19th century they faced harsh conditions that they were not adapted to. Many died very young of various tropical diseases. These missionaries were buried at the cemetery next to the Presbyterian Church in Ada Foah.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Sacred Woods♡❤♡. In traditional belief, walking into a sacred wood can turn that person into an animal or he or she might vanish and never return. There are about 20 sacred forests in a near Big Ada which are believed to house deities that are worshiped by people with traditional beliefs. Officially, these forests are only allowed to be entered by people of traditional beliefs and are mostly feared by all others.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Songor lagoon♡❤♡. Visit the Songor Lagoon, the biggest natural salt mining area in Ghana; only about 15 minutes drive from Ada. At this communal salt field you can watch locals at all stages of salt production: from inducing salt water from the ocean into the pans, the crystallization when it dries to washing and packing the salt into bags and loading them unto trucks. Apart from watching the salt mining activities, it is also an excellent place for watching the wintering European birds. The Wildlife Division has put up some observation towers and offers guided tours to the sight.

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Asafotufiami Festival♡❤♡. Historically, the Asafotufiami is a remembrance of ancient wars with neighboring tribes. The "Asafotu" are companies of warriors who fire their muskets in celebration. These days, the festival is a grand homecoming for the Ada diaspora. The celebration starts on Thursday in the first week of August and goes on until the following week. The days are filled with celebrations, traditional ceremonies, beach parties, boat races, river excursions and football matches.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Bird watching♡❤♡. The Songor lagoon is an area of international importance as it hosts thousands of migratory European birds wintering in Ghana. The lagoon provides feeding, breeding and resting ground for over nearly one hundred migrant and local birds. The best time to watch birds is towards the dry season (August to February) – the European winter, and in the early morning or late afternoon.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Boat race♡❤♡. A boat race can be witnessed on the river near the estuary every year in December. Paddle boats for 5 or 15 people compete against each other. Visitors can watch the race and also participate if they register as a group about a week in advance.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Church♡❤♡. The majority of the Ghanaians are Christians and religion is very present in everyday life. Signs of this are many religious shop names such as “God is great” or “Fear God” and the enormous number of churches in every town and village. The majority of people go to church on Sunday and visitors are always welcome to join.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Funerals♡❤♡. Funerals are part of everyday life and it is common to see people walking around in the mourning colors black, white and red on weekends. The celebration follows a strict schedule: On Friday the corpse is brought to the family house accompanied by songs of brass bands and the ceremony starts. On Saturday the corpse is buried accompanied by drumming and music before and after the burial. Throughout the whole ceremony, the sympathizers are expected to make a contribution that is noted precisely. On Sunday, the guests attend a thanksgiving church service in memory of the deceased in case it is a Christian funeral and give thanks. If it is a traditional funeral, the ceremony is continued until the afternoon when the guests depart.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Monthly Beach Soccer event♡❤♡. There is a beach soccer tournament on the first weekend of each month at the seaside near the estuary where teams from different communities in the district compete against each other. Before the start of the tournament the beach is cleaned which is the underlying intention of the whole event.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Monthly symposium♡❤♡. Once a month the ferry that operates between Ada Foah and Anyanui turns into an event location. This unusual venue hosts a monthly symposium that informs both locals and tourists about specific topics concerning health, tradition and education. For the current topics, ticket purchase and the exact dates please contact the Tourist Information Center.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Sea turtle watching♡❤♡. Every year from August to February the Leatherback turtle, Green turtle and Olive Ridley turtle lay their eggs at the seashore. The main nesting areas are the islands/sandspit between the two estuaries and beaches westward of the estuary. Visitors can witness this fascinating sight of the huge turtles coming out of the water and nesting in the sand. Night tours are organized by the Wildlife Division.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Coffins♡❤♡. Ever thought about being buried in a tomato? Or maybe a truck? Although the majority of the Ghanaians are buried in normal ones, there are some carpenters that have specialized in building eccentric coffins. All are made for order and can be any shape you can imagine, from fish, canoes and Tro-Tros to sewing machines, pepperoni, tomatoes and books. The shape of the coffin is always connected to the life or profession of the deceased, so a fisherman would be buried in a fish or canoe, a teacher in a book and a farmer in a tomato.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Markets♡❤♡
</ul>
There is a big market in Kasseh on Tuesdays and Fridays where you can get just about anything you can imagine. From 

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Rum factory♡❤♡. Ebenezer from Aflive calls his island the "rum island". His sugar cane distillery and the produced "Igo-gro" (from "I go - I grow") has gained quite some fame and people come from faraway places to stock up on his homemade rum.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Tailors♡❤♡. The rattling of sewing machines can be heard everywhere around the towns and most people have their clothes sewn there instead of buying manufactured clothes. There are sewers for women’s, men’s and children’s clothes and special sewers for school uniforms. So just get yourself some colorful fabric at the market, choose a design from the pictures and order for a custom-made dress or shirt.

</ul>
<h3>Traditional handicrafts</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Basket weaving♡❤♡. Weaving palm leaves into baskets, rope or mats for sleeping is a widespread local activity. Palm leaves are collected, cut and woven into ropes. Those ropes are used for typing straw mats or any other thing and are very durable. On many islands in the river (especially Aflive and Alorkpem) visitors can watch the women and men weaving and also try it out for themselves.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Pottery♡❤♡. The Vume Pottery Cooperation, located in the Volta Region close to the border to Dangme East draws clients from faraway places to buy it there. Visitors can buy the locally produced vases and pots, watch the men and women work on the potter's wheel and with their hands and try it out themselves.

<h1>Adama</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Adama♡❤♡, also known as ♡❤♡Nazareth♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡Nazret♡❤♡, is a large city in &lt;a href="Central%20Ethiopia"&gt;central&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;. From 2003 to 2006, it served as the capital of the Oromia region, before the capital was moved back to nearby &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;. It is a popular weekend destination for residents of Addis Ababa and hosts many governmental and non-governmental conferences.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Adama was renamed Nazret or Nazreth after Nazareth, the childhood hometown of Jesus, in the 1940s. It reverted to Adama in 2000, but is still also known as Nazareth.

Being at 1600 m altitude (750 meters lower than Addis Ababa) in the middle of the Rift valley, Adama is significantly warmer than Addis and other parts of Ethiopian highlands. It is also much drier due to the location between two mountain ranges, with many sunny days even in the middle of the rainy season. The resulting climate is quite pleasant, with daytime temperatures of 25 to 30 degrees Celsius and nights at around 15 degrees year round.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Adama lies approximately 100 km southeast of Addis Ababa, along the main highway that leads to &lt;a href="Djibouti"&gt;Djibouti&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="Dire%20Dawa"&gt;Dire Dawa&lt;/a&gt;. If coming from Addis Ababa, it's probably better to ask the best way to go to Adama at the place where you stay, as the buses no longer depart from Le Gare in downtown (like some older guidebooks say), and the main southern/eastern terminal is inconveniently located in Kality suburb 10 km from the downtown (and still far from the southernmost LRT station of the same name) - more than half an hour and 15 birr (2019) by very crowded minivan from the city center, but "probably at least 300-350 birr" by taxi. When going from Adama, you're likely to be asked where are you going to in Addis - and some places offered, e.g. Megenagna, are both much closer to the city center and near the LRT station. The trip from the Kality bus terminal to Adama was 50 birr (2019), while the return trip to Megenagna was 60 birr.

The buses do not follow a strict timetable. Generally the driver waits for the entire bus to fill with passengers, though usually this means that buses leave at least once an hour (less in case of a minibus). Make sure the bus/minibus you're going to take is "Express" - which means it goes non-stop via the (nice) toll road connecting Addis Ababa and Adama. This way, 80 km trip between Addis outskirts and Adama will take just over an hour - but the traffic in Addis could easily double that.

On arrival to Adama, the minibus will likely stop a few times on the main road offloading some of the passengers, before turning to the right at the town center - choose the stop nearest to the place/area where you intend to stay, as the bus terminal is a few kilometers away from the center.

The Addis Ababa-&lt;a href="Djibouti"&gt;Djibouti&lt;/a&gt; railroad runs through Adama.

<h2>Get around</h2>
Street names and addresses are not discernibly marked (if, indeed, they are used at all). The Addis Ababa-Dire Dawa Road is the main thoroughfare through the town, and is pretty walkable by African standards, at least in the city center. Blue-and-white taxis use fixed routes along major streets, and cost less than one ♡❤birr♡❤ per person, per ride. These will pick up and let off other passengers along the route. It is possible to hire a taxi for private use (called "contract") for a higher fare, which should be agreed upon in advance. A horse-drawn cart, or ♡❤gari♡❤, is even cheaper than a public taxi, though by 2010 these had been largely supplanted by auto-rickshaws (called "Bajaj," after their manufacturer). Bajaj drivers do not particularly pester foreigners passing by (there are few, if any, white foreigners anyway), but some may try to ask on arrival for more than agreed before (like 100 birr to the bus station instead of 50 - inner-city rides definitely should be even cheaper), possibly claiming misunderstanding.

<h2>Buy</h2>

<h2>Eat</h2>
The famous "tibs", or "kurt", raw or roasted beef in the city's famous restaurants specialized in serving roasted beef dishes.

Small restaurants on the main street are inexpensive (with most expensive meat dishes around 100-120 birr), but often there's neither English menu, nor someone speaking enough English to help a foreigner. Oromo language in menus, unlike Amharic, uses Latin script, but the names are quite different from what you could know from Addis - worth to do some research if you want to try some truly local (or Somalian) delicacies.

<h2>Drink</h2>

Several cheap (around 20 birr per mug) bars are available at and near the main road, where you'll see many visitors from Addis enjoying their beer on a weekend.
A few nicer club-like bars are open till late, but other than that, there's not much of nightlife in town.

As it is Ethiopia, coffee is also cheap, good and easy to find.

<h2>Sleep</h2>
Many inexpensive guesthouses are available in the side streets off the main road, quite a lot of them are signposted in English and/or may be found via Google Maps. You may have to walk around a bit if arriving on a weekend, as it's when many people from Addis Ababa come to Adama. The price asked for a clean room with hot shower and old TV in a nice (for a guesthouse) building was 250-300 birr (July 2019).

The well-kept rooms are situated around a lush courtyard with a swimming pool and observation tower. As of 2004, a two-room suite with a double-bed cost approximately US$26.00 per night. A full dinner in the hotel restaurant cost US$3 to US$6 per person.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

Large, modern hotel, built in 2009. It is located near the base of the cliff at the western edge of the city. As of 2010, the hotel had good service and a good restaurant, with ethernet (not wi-fi) connections in each room.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡La Residence Hotel♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Peacock Road, Adama&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A lot of time and effort was invested into making this a smart traditionally styled hotel. It has faded somewhat since it was built. It is rarely busy, you could be alone there. Electricity and internet can be intermittent. However, it remains a comfortable place to stay. It is one of the few hotels that can be booked online.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Connect</h2>
Most telephone numbers in Adama use the city code 022 (or simply 22 from outside Ethiopia), though some numbers use 011 (which is the same city code as Addis Ababa).

Internet access is available at most hotels, as well as at various internet cafes. Cheaper guesthouses may or may not have Wi-Fi. As of 2019, internet access in Adama uses ADSL connections which provide a usable but not fast connection. 3G mobile internet is available through Ethiotel. Both types of connection can fail at times.

<h2>Go next</h2>
Adama is about 25 km north of the spa town &lt;a href="Sodere"&gt;Sodere&lt;/a&gt;. Minibuses will take passengers to the entrance of &lt;a href="Sodere"&gt;Sodere&lt;/a&gt; for a few birr. While there is a large hotel at Sodere, the resort is perhaps more well-suited for day trips, as accommodations are better in Adama.

Minibuses to the places further east (of which &lt;a href="Harar"&gt;Harar&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most interesting for a traveller) are stopping to pick up the passengers at the main road occasionally - choose the correct (southern) side of the road, and look for someone shouting the desired town's name.

To go to &lt;a href="Addis%20Ababa"&gt;Addis Ababa&lt;/a&gt;, it may be better to take a ♡❤bajaj♡❤ to the bus station, as minibuses passing the main road are often already full, and at the bus station it will be easy to choose the destination bus station in Addis, saving time and/or money on local transportation there.

<h1>Adams (Massachusetts)</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Adams♡❤♡ is a small town in the &lt;a href="Berkshire%20Hills"&gt;Berkshire Hills&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;. It features the summit of Mt. Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts at 3,491 ft (1064 m), which is on the &lt;a href="Appalachian%20Trail"&gt;Appalachian Trail&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Adams is on State Route 8. State Route 8 can be accessed from Dalton Avenue in northeast Pittsfield, from which you need to drive north to reach Adams.

<h2>Get around</h2>
The downtown area is small, but if you are anywhere outside that immediate area, it is best to have at least a bicycle to get around. Route 8 is not pleasant to walk on, while the cars speed past you.

Most non-hikers will probably prefer to drive to the summit of Mt. Greylock, though it is also possible to cycle up the winding roads.

Also at the summit is Veterans War Memorial Tower, a 93 ft (28 m) tall Quincy granite tower with possible 90-mile views. Make sure to bring warm clothing even in the summer; it can be quite windy at the summit.

&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Adana♡❤♡ is in &lt;a href="Mediterranean%20Turkey"&gt;Mediterranean Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Lying a fair distance away from the Mediterranean coast, in the centre of huge &lt;a href="Cilician%20Plains"&gt;Cilician Plains&lt;/a&gt; and on the banks of ♡❤♡Seyhan♡❤♡ River, Adana is the fifth most populous city in Turkey with a population of over 1.5 million. It's not much known as a tourism destination, though, especially when compared with its southern and western neighbours. There are sites of interest in the surrounding countryside.

Modern Adana consists of two quite separate sections: cramped old city centre and newer, mostly high-rise suburbs overlooking the Seyhan dam to north of the old centre, usually called ♡❤Kuzey Adana♡❤ or ♡❤Yeni Adana♡❤ (i.e. "North Adana" or "New Adana", respectively).

Despite its location Adana is a remarkably modern and Western city. This is in large part due to the presence of a NATO base in Incirlik, which provides the city with an unusually large population of Westerners, and foreign-educated Turks. Adana is also a destination for dental tourism, owing to a large number of cheap, effective, English-speaking dentists in the area.

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q1430728"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Adana Şakirpaşa Airport♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ADA &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/bdi&gt;) (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;located in the city outskirts&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;It's a fairly short cab ride to city center (costing about 20 TL) and is served frequently by dolmuş.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h3>By bus</h3>
As with the rest of the country, another common way of getting here is to use the ♡❤♡buses♡❤♡. They arrive here frequently from Ankara, Istanbul, &lt;a href="Izmir"&gt;Izmir&lt;/a&gt;, and several other cities around Turkey. Journey time from Istanbul is around twelve hours, fares starting at 50 TL. Inter-city bus companies includes Varan, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ulusoy.com.tr"&gt;Ulusoy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.metroturizm.com.tr"&gt;Metro&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you get off at the right station as most buses also stop at a station in the suburbs, about 4 km west of city centre. Getting off at the wrong station may be frustrating, but not an disaster since a local bus connects them. The bus station in city centre lies close to the Hilton hotel.

<h3>By train</h3>
The best route from Istanbul or Ankara is to take the YHT fast train to &lt;a href="Konya"&gt;Konya&lt;/a&gt;. From there a daily train departs around 14:30, taking six hours via Karaman to Adana; the return train leaves Adana around 07:40. So a same-day connection is possible. The line between Konya and Adana is being upgraded for YHT: there was a lengthy partial closure in 2016/17, and future engineering disruption seems likely. 

The ♡❤Cukurova Express♡❤ overnight sleeper between Ankara and Adana has been suspended for a few years due to construction works, but is expected to return in 2019 or early 2020. A daily train between Adana and &lt;a href="Kayseri"&gt;Kayseri&lt;/a&gt; and a few regional trains from &lt;a href="Elaz%C4%B1%C4%9F"&gt;Elazığ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Mersin"&gt;Mersin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Iskenderun"&gt;Iskenderun&lt;/a&gt; are also available. The lines to &lt;a href="Aleppo"&gt;Aleppo&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="Gaziantep"&gt;Gaziantep&lt;/a&gt; thence across Syria to Mosul in Iraq, are closed indefinitely.

</ul>
<h3>By car</h3>
♡❤♡Driving♡❤♡ to Adana is an option; from &lt;a href="Ankara"&gt;Ankara&lt;/a&gt;, the national capital, there is highway all the way (European road number: E90) but distances are long. The motorway ♡❤♡O-21♡❤♡ will connect the two cities, but it doesn't reach any further north from &lt;a href="Ni%C4%9Fde"&gt;Niğde&lt;/a&gt; for the time being. However, even if there is no motorway for about half of the route from Ankara, the current highway has separated directions all along it, anyway. Once you have passed the pass of Cilician Gates (♡❤Gülek Boğazı♡❤) through the Taurus Mountains into the &lt;a href="Cilician%20Plains"&gt;Cilician Plains&lt;/a&gt;, take O-51 eastwards.

<h1>Ad Dakhla</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡Ad Dakhla♡❤♡ (♡❤Dakhla♡❤, ♡❤Dajla♡❤) is a city in southern &lt;a href="Western%20Sahara"&gt;Western Sahara&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By plane</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Dakhla Airport♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;&lt;b&gt; VIL &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;With almost daily flights from/to &lt;a href="Casablanca"&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt; with Royal Air Maroc, once a week to Agadir as well. There is a regular flight to &lt;a href="Las%20Palmas"&gt;Las Palmas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Gran%20Canaria"&gt;Gran Canaria&lt;/a&gt; with CanaryFly, though only seasonal.
</ul>
&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; 

<h3>By bus</h3>
There are a few buses daily from as far away as Casablanca and &lt;a href="Marrakech"&gt;Marrakech&lt;/a&gt;. Buses are run by CTM, Supratours and Satas. There are no regional operators.

Supratours and CTM buses run to and from &lt;a href="Agadir"&gt;Agadir&lt;/a&gt; (~20 hr, ~350 dirham. Supratours has two buses per day, while CTM has one. Be prepared for up to eight checkpoints along the way and, if a Westerner, to be checked thoroughly.

<h3>By car</h3>
♡❤♡National Route 1♡❤♡, running the length, of the country passes by Dakhla It is also the only major road in the vicinity. Distance from the nearest major city in the north, &lt;a href="El%20Aaiun"&gt;El Aaiun&lt;/a&gt; is 535 km. This road is in good condition but expect long distances between gas stations.

To the south of Dakhla is 440 km of almost uninhabited territory, except for a few tiny fishing villages, until the Mauritanian border and &lt;a href="Nouadhibou"&gt;Nouadhibou&lt;/a&gt;. Travelling this stretch by car is perfectly possible but requires some planning and careful preparations. There are only two gas stations along the entire route and breakdown could include hours of wait in scoring temperatures.

<h2>Get around</h2>
The city centre is small enough to navigate on foot. Should you want to head further out, petits taxis abound and are metered.

<h2>See</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Take a road trip to Aoussard: UN base, followed by mine field, followed by Moroccan army base. Take water with you and fill up with gas: it's a 3-hr drive (if you obey speed limits) and it gets hotter with each kilometre.
BULLET::::- Take a break at the laguna and watch kite-surfers. They even have a special road sign that says "watch out for kite surfers that sometimes crash on the road".
BULLET::::- Drive to the historic lighthouse west of Ad-Dakhla: albeit as of January 2014 climbing it was no longer permitted, the building continues to be one of the most recognisable landmarks of Western Sahara due to the black-and-white ring pattern.

</ul>
<h2>Do</h2>

There are windsurfing and quad driving opportunities north of Dakhla. Inquire locally. A kite shop next to the Supratours office at the waterfront is helpful with all the necessary info. You can wind and kitesurf on both the western (ocean) and eastern (lagoon) side of the peninsula.

<h2>Buy</h2>

<h2>Eat</h2>
Many patisseries offer cheap pastry. The restaurant at Sahara Regency hotel has decent European food, though the choice is limited and it is not always fresh. There are also numerous eateries in town.

<h2>Drink</h2>

<h2>Sleep</h2>
There are plenty of budget hotels clustered around the city centre. Due to military presence, most only have twin rooms and you will pay almost the same price if you are alone. Twin rooms usually cost 60 dirham. Prices, as always, are negotiable.

There are a few campsites by the road to the north of Dakhla. Camping Moussafir is a popular spot with overlanders, and is located just south of the first checkpoint out of town.

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Hotel Sahara Regency♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A high-end option in town offering all the modern amenities a desert traveller could long for, including free WiFi and a restaurant serving up wines and spirits.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Hotel Calipau Sahara♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Upscale hotel just at the outer rims of Dakhla. Located at a private bay, has sea-water pools. Good breakfast, extensive dinner menu and serves alcohol. Prices are steep, about 5 times what one pays at supermarkets. Amazing walk-in showers with hot water on demand. Haggling recommended, one can cut the price for a room by about 50%. The posted date for rooms starts at €180.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Go next</h2>
<h3>North</h3>
Ticket for any bus heading north can be bought at the corresponding agency, they all have offices around the town centre (Satas is a bit further south).

<h3>South</h3>
Supratours runs a bus south to the Mauritania border. The bus leaves from the waterfront office at 08:00 and costs 160 dirham, arriving at the frontier at 13:00. It returns to Dakhla at 15:00, arriving Dakhla at 20:30.

Finding a lift is usually not a problem. You can try to get a lift from overlanders (ask around at Camping Moussafir) or catch a ride with the Mauritanian traders, who gather on a lot opposite from the first police checkpoint north of Dakhla (take a petit taxi to get there for about 15-20 dirham, or walk the 7&amp;nbsp;km). The going rate is 250 dirham for a ♡❤car♡❤ (a minivan) or 350 dirham for a Mercedes. The cars leave in the morning.

You can also organize your ride to Nouadhibou (350-400 dirham, ~10 hours including border crossing) or Nouakchott (600 dirham, min. 12 hr) at Hotel Sahara in the centre. Ask for Tawfiq. The cars leave around 07:00.

Be prepared to spend several hours on both sides of the border.

<h1>Addis Ababa</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Ambox/styles.css" /&gt;
♡❤♡Addis Ababa♡❤♡ (&lt;a href="Amharic%20phrasebook"&gt;Amharic&lt;/a&gt;: አዲስ አበባ, &lt;a href="Oromo%20phrasebook"&gt;Oromo&lt;/a&gt;: ♡❤Finfinne♡❤) is the capital and largest city of &lt;a href="Ethiopia"&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/a&gt;. It had a population of 3.4 million in 2007 and it is growing very rapidly like many &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;n cities.

<h2>Understand</h2>
There are more than 120 international missions and embassies in Addis Ababa, making the city a hub for international diplomacy concerning &lt;a href="Africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. The headquarters of the African Union and the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.uneca.org/"&gt;UN Economic Commission for Africa&lt;/a&gt; (UNECA) are both in the city. The &lt;a href="European%20Union"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; both have two delegations in Addis Ababa, one for bilateral relations with Ethiopia and one for the African Union.

The city is divided into ten boroughs, known as subcities, then further divided into wards (♡❤kebeles♡❤). Suburbs include Shiro Meda and Entoto in the north, Urael and Bole (home to Bole International Airport) in the east, Nifas Silk in the south-east, Mekanisa in the south, and Keraniyo and Kolfe in the west. Many of the wealthiest people live in the southeast (Bole), southwest (old airport), CMC, Ayat and Lamberet parts of town. The city is one of the first in Sub-Saharan Africa to have rail based public transit. The light rail system built with Chinese help is often credited with a rapid change of connected parts of the city.

<h3>Climate</h3>

&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Climate/style.css" /&gt;
Addis Ababa features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb), a variety of the temperate oceanic climate, with wet summer (comparable to &lt;a href="Mexico%20City"&gt;Mexico City&lt;/a&gt;). The average highs are between and . The average lows are between and . The warmest months are February to May, but not "hot" as people imagine Africa: Most hotels do not have air-conditioning. Temperatures and climate can vary due to elevation. Addis Ababa has 132 rainy days per year and records of rainfalls annually.

Temperatures in Addis Ababa are remarkably constant from month to month: the annual temperature variation is low with around . However, due to its altitude of , the diurnal temperature variation is high with around difference between day and night in average: It is often at lunchtime and at night; always take a second layer with you during the evening.

<h4>Seasons</h4>
<ul>
BULLET::::- The dry season is from mid-September to mid-June.
BULLET::::- The rainy season is from mid-June to mid-September. Even if temperature are similar with other month, July and August appear colder and less comfortable due to 80% relative humidity, few hours of sunshine and daily rains: tonsillitis and common cold are frequent. Rains also cause mud and make dirt-roads soapy. Floods happens on roads creating traffic jams, notably at the beginning of the rainy season (end-June), when the water drainage pipes are corked by dust and wastes accumulated during 8 months of dry season. Thunderstorms (short but heavy rains) are frequent and isolated. In instance, it not uncommon to move to another area of the city for a 2-hour lunch in Bole and discover wet roads when coming back to Arada. In August, it is also possible to experience some hail.
BULLET::::- The "small rainy season" around April is almost unnoticeable in Addis Ababa (more visible in other parts of Ethiopia).

</ul>
<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>By plane</h3>

&lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;b&gt; ADD &lt;/b&gt; ) is the busiest airport in East Africa. It is the main hub for &lt;a href="https%3A//www.ethiopianairlines.com/"&gt;Ethiopian Airlines&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most successful and reputable airlines in Africa, offering superior service on international flights to any of the US carrier members of the Star Alliance. The airport also hosts Lufthansa, Sudan Airways, Kenya Airways, British Airways, KLM, Turkish Airways, Emirates, Gulf Air, Egypt Air and fly Dubai. There are daily flights from &lt;a href="Europe"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="United%20States"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, and many African cities including &lt;a href="Accra"&gt;Accra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bamako"&gt;Bamako&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Brazzaville"&gt;Brazzaville&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cairo"&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Dakar"&gt;Dakar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Dar%20es%20Salaam"&gt;Dar es Salaam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Djibouti%20%28city%29"&gt;Djibouti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Khartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Harare"&gt;Harare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Johannesburg"&gt;Johannesburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;. From the U.S., there are ♡❤direct♡❤ flights from &lt;a href="LAX"&gt;LAX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Newark%20Liberty"&gt;Newark Liberty&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Washington%2C%20D.C."&gt;Washington, D.C.&lt;/a&gt;, stopping over at either &lt;a href="Dublin"&gt;Dublin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Lom%C3%A9"&gt;Lomé&lt;/a&gt;.

There are two terminals. Terminal 1 (the older, smaller one) is for all domestic flights and most flights to cities in neighbouring nations (&lt;a href="Djibouti"&gt;Djibouti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Khartoum"&gt;Khartoum&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). Terminal 2 (the newer 2003 building) is for all other international flights of Ethiopian Airlines and most other companies – arrangements may change so check first. Terminal 2 is said to be the largest terminal in sub-Saharan Africa. There are ATMs accepting Visa and Mastercard and forex services taking a wide range of currencies. Travellers' cheques and cash can usually be exchanged at the airport. 

Access into the terminals is restricted, as of July 2012. Taxis and anyone who comes to meet you will be out in the carpark, though a dozen of the top hotels still have a booth inside the arrivals area. Similar rules apply at the other airports in the country, for both arrivals and departures. Many hotels will send a vehicle to pick up guests if you have arranged it. The Sheraton Addis, Dreamliner, Hilton Addis, most other hotels, and many popular guesthouses provide a regular shuttle service for guests. There is a public transport stop a bit outside, under the highway (Ring Road) bridge. As of 2017, the airport is more than from the closest Light Rail Transit Station, which makes it unconnected in practice. In the future, a new line is planned to connect Bole Airport to the rest of the Light Rail Transit network.

There is a fixed taxi fee of 300 birr to get from the airport to practically any place in the city center, as of December 2018. Taxi drivers gather in a parking lot next to the airport. Most likely they will approach you shouting "Taxi!". Legit drivers should have their car marked in yellow/green color and place a license in a visible place.

Foreigners are often greeted by a throng of locals attempting to "help" load their luggage into cars. They're largely harmless and just looking for a tip, but it could be easy to lose a bag. An appropriate tip for a minor task like loading luggage into a car is 5 to 15 birr (ignore requests for more money just because you are a foreigner). If you have one person help you, twenty will ask for a tip. If you have a driver pick you up at the airport they will typically take care of any tips for you. Avoid walking alone around the airport, especially at night.

<h3>By car</h3>
Most of the major roads are in good condition:
<ul>
BULLET::::- From &lt;a href="Asmara"&gt;Asmara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Dese"&gt;Dese&lt;/a&gt;: Highway 1

<h3>By bus</h3>
♡❤♡Terminals:♡❤♡

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Autobus Terra♡❤♡, corner of Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis St and Central African Republic St / Somalia St, on the north-west side of Mercato. This is the main bus terminal where most of the national buses arrive and depart.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Ras Mekonin Avenue♡❤♡ near the railway station. Buses to/from &lt;a href="Adama"&gt;Adama&lt;/a&gt; (Nazret), &lt;a href="Debre%20Zeyit"&gt;Debre Zeyit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Dire%20Dawa"&gt;Dire Dawa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Nairobi"&gt;Nairobi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Lalibela"&gt;Lalibela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Shahemene"&gt;Shahemene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Awasa"&gt;Awasa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bahir%20Dar"&gt;Bahir Dar&lt;/a&gt; are or were here. July 2011 - Ras Makonnen - or La Gare - closed and moved to the Akaki Kality District on Sierra Leone St (Debre Zeit Rd).
BULLET::::- Buses west to Nekempte and beyond go from Asco on the old Ambo Road.

</ul>
<h3>By train</h3>
The railway line connecting Addis Ababa with the port city of &lt;a href="Djibouti_%28city%29"&gt;Djibouti&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;a href="Dire%20Dawa"&gt;Dire Dawa&lt;/a&gt; opened in 2016/17. Journey time is about twelve hours and as of 2019 there is one train every second day. Tickets can be bought at the railway station or at a ticket office next to the old colonial ♡❤Legehar♡❤ station (a portmanteau of the French name for station, la gare) on Churchill Ave.

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Addis Ababa Furi-Lebu railway station♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;This impressive new station is unfortunately located almost south of city center, far away from anything. Taking a taxi is the best option, expect up to 45 minutes for a trip to the central city.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Get around</h2>
Very few streets have names and when they do, they may not be named correctly on a map; use landmarks to navigate the city.

<h3>By bus</h3>
♡❤♡Blue and white minibuses♡❤♡

Blue and white minibuses/taxis travel quite efficiently around town. Since they are full with people most of the time, it is very cheap too; usually between 1–3&amp;nbsp;birr depending on how far you are going. To catch a minibus, stand on the side of the road and hail it. This can be done anywhere it is possible for the bus to stop. The conductor inside will call out the destination, and if that's where you want to go: get on. You pay the conductor when he signals to you that he wants money (which might take a few minutes). To get change. To get out say "woraj alle", or just "woraj". It is worth having an Ethiopian guide with you if it is your first time using these taxis, since it can be quite chaotic to find out what minibuses go where, and from what places.

♡❤♡Orange/yellow public buses♡❤♡

These buses connect the whole city for a fare of 0.5–3&amp;nbsp;birr (2016). There are no schedules or maps available, however if you wait on a major street where a crowd gathers you can ask other people or the cashier – which is always in a cabin at the back door – for your destination. Line 31 for example is a convenient line from Meskel Square to the National Museum or Trinity Church. The buses are often overcrowded, so watch your belongings
<h3>By taxi</h3>
♡❤♡Small blue Lada taxis♡❤♡

Small blue Lada taxis are more expensive. Negotiation is the norm and you often have to press quite hard to get a bargain as a foreigner. They can be contracted for a single trip, an hour, or a full day; just negotiate. Do not be surprised if the price of the taxi increases at night for the same trip. For example the trip Piazza-Bole Airport can be as low as 100&amp;nbsp;birr at day, but rises to 150 after dark (2016).

♡❤♡Yellow taxis♡❤♡

Yellow and green taxis usually hang around hotels like Sheraton. They are more expensive, but reliable. If you're willing to pay for peace of mind, slightly better drivers and a car that wasn't featured in the Flintstones, use these cars.

<h3>By light rail</h3>

The Chinese built a system of light rail lines (one of the first in sub-Saharan Africa) in the 2010s. There are two lines that cross near Meskel&amp;nbsp;square:
<ul>
BULLET::::- West–East green line 1 is from ♡❤Tor Hailoch♡❤ station to ♡❤Ayat♡❤.
BULLET::::- North–South blue line 2 is from ♡❤Kality♡❤ station to ♡❤Menelik&amp;nbsp;II&amp;nbsp;Square♡❤ station (aka ♡❤Piazza♡❤).
</ul>
Cost is 2&amp;nbsp;birr for an 8-station trip and up to 6&amp;nbsp;birr to go everywhere. Development along light rail stations is going on at breakneck pace and many former slums have been replaced by relatively upscale housing businesses and retail.

<h3>Airport shuttle</h3>

If you need an airport shuttle to your hotels or other destination, there are some taxis parked outside the airport. They probably take you anywhere you want to go but negotiate the fee before you board. If you want a peace of mind, you can reserve a shuttle service called &lt;a href="http%3A//iethio.com"&gt;iEthio.com&lt;/a&gt; before you arrive.

<h2>See</h2>
 

If you walk along the road from Meskel Square to Sidest Kilo, you'll probably find it quite entertaining and interesting. You'll see the Africa Hall, the palaces and the Parliament building, the Hilton Hotel, the marvellous architectural adventure of a building hosting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Sheraton Hotel, the first modern school (which Emperor Menelik II built in the 1880s), the Trinity Orthodox cathedral, the National Museum, and the Addis Ababa University (which hosts a former palace and museum).

Arat Kilo Avenue is marked by a statue built in commemoration of the Ethiopian day of victory during the Second World War, while Sidest Kilo Avenue is marked by a statue commemorating some 39,000 residents of Addis Ababa killed by Italian fascist troops. Around Arat Kilo, you will find part of an old town known as Serategna Sefer (literally, the residential area of labourers).

If you go past Sidest Kilo, the road becomes steeper and many of the attractions will be on the right side of the road. The Entoto college (previously Teferi Mekonnen School) and the US Embassy are on this side of the street. After the Embassy there's an open market called Shiro Meda where traditional craftsmen sell their homemade fabrics, pots and other craftwork. The marketplace is at the foot of the Entoto Mountains, which rise up to 3,300&amp;nbsp;m (10,827&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.

You can take a taxi or a bus to the mountain unless you are of a mind to try it yourself. On the mountain, you will find the first churches of Addis Ababa, called Saint Mary and Saint Raguel, and a smaller palace of Menelik II. Walking the mountain, especially between the churches, is refreshing and gives the chance to see rural life, the city, forest and unbelievably beautiful landscape intersected by farmlands and farmers trails. It is from here that Menelik II and Queen Taitu conceived the establishment of Addis Ababa. You can get a sense of the city plan by viewing the city from here.

One can see old paintings by many Ethiopian celebrity artists. Has a museum displaying church articles given by many famous people of the country including the emperor Haile Selassie and his Empress.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q2599114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Holy Trinity Cathedral♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;off Niger St, Arat Kilo area, Arada subcity&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;08:00–13:00, 14:00–18:00; museum: 08:00–12:00, 14:00–17:00&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;It was built to commemorate the country's liberation from the Italians, and many victims killed by the Italians during occupation are buried here.

Shoes must be left outside.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

The cathedral is a octagonal building. As you walk around it, you will notice people praying beside the walls, but it is unlikely that you will find an entrance. The Cathedral houses a small museum and close to it you will likely meet one of the archdeacons of the Cathedral. If he offers to be a guide, take his offer and visit the Cathedral with him. The interior is beautifully decorated with huge paintings and mosaics, and will make the trip worthwhile. It is worth visiting the museum with a guide as well to see ceremonial clothes and ancient manuscripts.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Bata Maryam Church♡❤♡, also known as the Menelik mausoleum, is located just south of the Menelik palace in Addis Ababa.

<h2>Learn</h2>

♡❤♡Addis Ababa University♡❤♡ is the largest and the oldest university in Ethiopia. It was originally named "University College of Addis Ababa" at its founding, then renamed for the former Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie I in 1962, receiving its current name in 1975. Although the university has six of its seven campuses within Addis Ababa (the seventh is located in Debre Zeit, about 45&amp;nbsp;kilometres away), it also maintains branches in many cities throughout Ethiopia, leading to the claim of being "the largest university in Africa."

The government assigns qualified students to these universities upon completion of secondary school. Students also attend other private colleges, such as ♡❤♡Unity College♡❤♡. Addis Ababa University was founded in 1950 at the request of Haile Selassie by a Canadian Jesuit, Dr Lucien Matte as a two-year college, and began operations the next year. Over the following two years an affiliation with the ♡❤♡University of London♡❤♡ was developed.

There is also ♡❤♡Theological College of the Holy Trinity♡❤♡, a theological school of higher education located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It provides religious and secular education to both clergy and lay members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, as well seeking to be a centre of theological and ecclesiastical study for all ♡❤♡Oriental Orthodox Churches♡❤♡ as well.

Founded as a high school by Emperor Haile Selassie in 1942, the college division was added in 5 October 1960, and the elementary education section eliminated on 18 December 1961 and the college became one of the chartered units of this first National University of Ethiopia.

Haggling and bargaining are standard procedure, and foreigners (especially those of European ancestry) should expect to be charged higher prices. To ensure a positive experience, maintain a sense of humour, don't be afraid to negotiate aggressively, and above all don't let yourself be bullied by the many "brokers" who frequent the market, and will try to steer you towards certain stores in exchange for a kick-back from the merchant. You will be able to negotiate lower prices if you can avoid brokers, and especially if you have a local friend or guide to buy things on your behalf.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h3>Get money</h3>
Ethiopia operates a cash economy. Domestic credit cards are non-existent, and international cards are accepted in very few locations (mostly those catering to expatriates).

♡❤♡ATMs/cash machines♡❤♡ are found throughout Addis Ababa. ♡❤♡Dashen Bank♡❤♡ is a principal member of both ♡❤♡VISA and MasterCard International♡❤♡ and has ATMs. Some of the ATMs found at D.H. Geda Tower (next to Friendship City Center) accept Visa and MasterCard, Dembel City Centre (quite hidden, use the main entrance, than to the left, at the window), Edna Mall, in some hotels (Hilton, Sheraton, Intercontinental, Wabi Shebelle Hotel, Ethiopia Hotel, Semein Hotel, Harmony Hotel). Also near the National Museum (Lucy Gazebo Restaurant), ground floor of Getu Commercial centre just at the entrance and some branches of &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dashenbanksc.com/atmnetwork/index.htm"&gt;Dashen Bank&lt;/a&gt;. Not all cards are accepted everywhere, Dashen Bank ATMs accept Visa/MasterCard/Cirrus/Plus while Zemen bank ATMs do not accept MasterCard. Most ATM machines have a 4,000–6,000&amp;nbsp;birr limit per day, but most do not charge a local ATM fee (international or third-party ATM fees from your financial institution may apply).

♡❤♡Warning:♡❤♡ Some ATM machines are targeted for "skimmer" scams, allowing thieves to steal your ATM card information. To protect yourself, the safest ATMs to use are the ones located at the Hilton (Dashen, Zemen, CBE); Radisson Blu (Dashen, Zemen, Wegagen); or Sheraton (Dashen) hotels.

There is an illegal black market where you can get a slightly better rate, especially if you bargain. Check your money very carefully before you leave and do not allow it to leave your hand after your final count. Most souvenir shops off Churchill Rd and Zambia St do it.

<h2>Eat</h2>
Food is generally cheap. Make sure you try the national dish ♡❤injera♡❤ at least once, since there is no other food like it. It is a yeast-risen flat bread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. It is traditionally made out of teff flour. In making injera, teff flour is mixed with water and allowed to ferment for several days, as with sourdough starter. As a result of this process, injera has a mildly sour taste. It's what the locals eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Most ordinary Ethiopian restaurants have it, and a serving for 2 people with free refills can be as cheap as 15&amp;nbsp;birr.

<h3>Budget</h3>
Addis has hundreds of cake and coffee cafes. They sell various coffees, tea - black unless you ask for "machiatto" - and sometimes fruit juices. There are also juice beits. The cafes along Bole Road and around the Piassa area are of a high standard and relatively inexpensive. Most are very similar to each other.

Most cafes serve the common drink called 'sprice juice' (fruit pulp served in layers in a glass). There are usually three layers from a selection of avocado, mango, papaya, banana, guava etc. The juice is eaten with a spoon. It is colourful and tastes delicious. Single fruit juices are also great, such as orange, papaya, mango, and pineapple - beautifully fresh. 7&amp;nbsp;birr up to 25&amp;nbsp;birr in Hilton.

From injera to club sandwich.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
Restaurants that do not have an English menu are cheaper. Example: Connection between Bole Road and Tele-Bole, next to Bole roundabout, at NOC-Fuelstation, close to ♡❤♡German Kantine♡❤♡. You can have lunch (local food, spaghetti) for less than 20&amp;nbsp;birr. If you don't have a translator, ordering is a lot of fun.

<h3>Budget</h3>

As of 2013, it is still possible to find "rooms" for 50&amp;nbsp;birr, but a somewhat decent room will cost about 100&amp;nbsp;birr, and most cost 150&amp;nbsp;birr and up. Most tourists stay in the piazza area, where there are many hotels ranging from very cheap to moderately cheap. Except for the cheapest, most of them have running hot water.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Addis is safer than most cities in Africa. Gang violence and similar serious activities are unusual. However, you may encounter some ♡❤♡pick-pockets♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡con-artists♡❤♡ around and inside Bole Airport, Mercato, Piazza and many other areas. Keep your belongings close, and pay attention to your surroundings. A common tactic is to show you a tray of things to buy with one hand and to try your pocket with the other. The good news is most of these pick-pockets are unarmed and young boys. If they know that you are aware of what they are up to, they may get intimidated and go away. However, some can be quite persistent and even involve older boys.
BULLET::::- Watch out for the spitting scam which happens in Piazza area. Typically it involves someone "accidentally" spitting on you, offering a handkerchief / tissue to clean it up, trying your pockets while you are distracted by this "accident" and then jumping into a companion's car with your belongings.
BULLET::::- As most Ethiopians are very welcoming, there is an infamous scam where young locals "befriend" tourists and invite them over after a nice day together to celebrate a "special holiday". You will get fed a lot of khat leaves, a chewing drug, and have a good time with them, but in the end you will be asked for a tremendous amount of money for the khat as they claim it is a "special" quality. Be aware of too friendly locals and ask if there is a price to anything, even if they claim you are invited.
BULLET::::- Be aware of your belongings on Line Taxis: They usually get very crowded – keep your wallet/phone/bag close to you.
BULLET::::- The major and important roads and areas are patrolled by the 'Federal Police' or, as the city residents refer them ♡❤Federal♡❤. They have a reputation of being merciless with suspected criminals. In contrast, the Addis-Ababa city police, who most of the time patrol the less important city streets, markets and neighborhoods are more tolerant and less respected police officers.
BULLET::::- For all emergencies &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; 911 &lt;/bdi&gt; . In Addis, major streets are generally safe at night.
BULLET::::- Unlike in other African cities, in Addis-Ababa, police officers ♡❤never♡❤ approach foreigners to ask them to present a passport, ID or "legal" papers. Once you show your passport at the airport, you are free to move around pretty much anywhere. The only time you need your passport or ID is for hotel reservation and other similar and few instances. However, it is important to have your ID with you at all times.

</ul>
<h2>Cope</h2>
♡❤♡Watch what you drink♡❤♡ or you can fall ♡❤♡sick♡❤♡. It is important to remember to only drink bottled water. There are many brands to choose from; ♡❤♡always♡❤♡ check the plastic seal on all bottles before paying any vendor. Most travelers should be warned against eating vegetables such as those in salads that may have been washed in water. Try limiting fruits and vegetables to those you peel yourself such as oranges, mangos, etc.

♡❤♡Pollution♡❤♡. Addis Ababa is badly polluted because of badly maintained diesel vehicles and dust. If you have any sensitivity to this, it is worth wearing a dust mask as is popular in many Asian countries.

♡❤♡Be prepared for culture shock♡❤♡. If you take photos of the people, ask first and offer to show them their picture if you have a digital camera with a display screen. Children enjoy seeing their pictures a lot of the time!.

♡❤♡Overwhelmed♡❤♡. Many first time visitors may feel overwhelmed if they have not experienced this type of culture difference before. Be polite but not intrusive. It is OK to ask questions of the locals, but you should be prepared to be hassled a lot of the time, especially if you are white. Additionally, for foreigners who are black, it may be possibly to "blend in", precautions are in order (depending where you are, in Addis on Bole road they are used to seeing foreigners compared to the country side). If you prepare yourself before arrival, you will be better able to cope.

<h2>Connect</h2>

<h3>Telephone</h3>
The country code for calling Ethiopia is ♡❤♡251♡❤♡. The city code for Addis Ababa is ♡❤♡011♡❤♡ (or ♡❤♡+251&amp;nbsp;11♡❤♡ from outside Ethiopia).

<h4>Mobile</h4>
Ethiopia uses a GSM network operated by Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation. There is decent coverage around big cities such as Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, Bahir Dar, Debre Markos, Dese, Gonder, Harar, Mekele, and Nekemete. It is expanding into most small cities.

Roaming charges are very steep. For a short visit, your best option for mobile access is to rent a SIM card with a phone. Only a few stores rent SIM cards: you can rent a SIM card and phone inside Addis Ababa Sheraton hotel but is it very expensive. Another option is to rent a SIM card and mobile phone from local stores.

An easy third option is to buy a SIM card, at 30&amp;nbsp;birr (June 2019). Ask a cell phone retailer or better still an Ethiotel shop. Be prepared: you will need a passport-sized picture and a photocopy of your passport that the seller will keep. The SIM card has to be registered before it will work properly. The registration can take 24 hours to be completed by the network. The SIM card will need to be cut to size as they are supplied as mini SIM's. Cutting will cost 20&amp;nbsp;birr in a shop. The Ethiotel service is not 100% reliable. It is not unusual for the entire network to go down for an hour every day or two. Monthly internet bundles are available - 1GB for 100&amp;nbsp;birr. Dial *999# and follow the prompts to subscribe. For internet access, the APN is etc.com

<h3>Internet</h3>
In Addis Ababa, especially in Bole Subcity, you can find quite a number of internet cafes. Some still use dial-up connections, but broadband is becoming more popular. Most of the high-end hotels have internet connections (either Ethernet or Wi-Fi), which are reasonably fast and often free for hotel guests.

A general problem with the Internet in Ethiopia is the unstable international high-speed connection. If it is not working, even broadband cafes only deliver dial-up speeds and less. The local definition of highspeed broadband is 128Kb! Another general problem is the shortage of electricity, forcing daytime blackouts of whole areas 1–2&amp;nbsp;days a week, so it is good to plan ahead where you are going for internet access.

Skype and VoIP service are legal in Ethiopia. According to local press, Ethiopia today has the fourth worst internet in the world.

Most of the time it is not crowded, so a good connection can be expected.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡DMG Internet Center♡❤♡, near Edna Mall next to Kaldi's Cafe just off Djibuti St (the road leading from Tele Bole towards 22), has broadband connection and 11 terminals. 2&amp;nbsp;MB speed Internet, which translates to pretty decent speed for the country. Open M–Sa 08:30–20:00.

</ul>
<h4>Wireless internet</h4>

3G Internet services (known as WCDMA or UMTS) are available in many parts of Addis Ababa. A special SIM card and capable phone is needed. Price is 0.04 birr per 100&amp;nbsp;KB. CDMA is also available, which needs special devices (prices around 0.10&amp;nbsp;birr per minute, around 128&amp;nbsp;kbit/s). EV-DO requires a USB device and is faster than CDMA but requires monthly payment of 500&amp;nbsp;birr for 2&amp;nbsp;GB data plan. CDMA and EV-DO are also available in all regional and most zonal capitals in Ethiopia.

<h1>Addison</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.addisontexas.net/"&gt;Addison&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is a suburb of &lt;a href="Dallas"&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the area's most popular places. Addison's main attractions are based around restaurants, and has some of the most restaurants per square mile in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.

<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>By car</h3>
Addison is centered on the intersection of Belt Line Road and Dallas North Tollway. It is almost completely surrounded by &lt;a href="Dallas/North%20Dallas"&gt;North Dallas&lt;/a&gt;. The tolls from Downtown Dallas amount to less than 2 dollars.

<h3>By bus</h3>
Public transit via &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dart.org"&gt;DART buses&lt;/a&gt; is found at the Addison Transit Station on Arapaho Rd, one block north of Belt Line Rd on Quorum Road. This is right next to Addison Circle Park, making it a convenient option if you are attending a festival or show at the WaterTower. The main dining strip is a 5-10&amp;nbsp;minute walk south to Belt Line.

<h3>By plane</h3>
Addison is served commercially by ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Dallas/Fort%20Worth%20Airport"&gt;Dallas/Fort Worth Airport&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ and Love Field, but also has its own airport for private planes and corporate aviation. Private jet service is available from multiple fixed base operators. International travelers can utilize the airport's 24-hour Customs port.

<h2>Get around</h2>

<h3>By car</h3>
Driving along Belt Line Road can be slow at the heaviest dining times, but usually not too bad. Weekday lunch time and weekend evenings have the worst traffic. If a festival is happening, especially KaboomTown, expect to sit in traffic much longer.

Be watchful for traffic cops as they are strict and tend to hide themselves well. Arapaho Road, Belt Line Road, Midway Road and Quorum Road are well patrolled.

<h3>By bus</h3>
Most placed in Addison are accessible by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.dart.org"&gt;DART bus&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>On foot/By bicycle</h3>
Most streets in Addison have sidewalks, and the city is working to make the city more accessible on foot or by bike. There are bicycle racks on the front of all DART buses serving Addison. The &lt;a href="http%3A//www.addisontx.gov/Departments/parks/News___Articles/Les_Lacs_Linear_Park.asp"&gt;Les Lacs Linear Park&lt;/a&gt; is available in the southern part of Addison for a quiet and pleasant 2.7-mile paved trail.

Many different types of historical planes are collected amongst four hangars. Note: Since these are located in airplane hangars, air conditioning is virtually non-existent here, and while there are vents to blow the air through the hangars can get quite warm on a hot summer's day.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;Adults: $8, Children (6-12): $4, Children under 6: Free&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

Some notable shops here are Paciugo Gelato, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Grand Spa International, and Harold's Closeout. Because this shopping center has many restaurants and bars it can get quite busy on weekend nights.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

The lobby is decorated in very loud bright colors. The dining room has the same bright colors with loud and gaudy wallpaper. Every obscure, brightly-colored accessory is hanging on the wall. And even the waiters are dressed in various fictional characters. People go there for the atmosphere, and with as much work as they put into their atmosphere they left the food a bit lacking. The food isn't bad, but it doesn't stand out as anything special. Overall it's a fun place to take the kids.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
Addison is actually a safe place overall. As Addison caters to the more affluent crowd the city does not really have a lower income neighborhood. The only people that you have to watch out for are the drunks, and the Addison police (in case you're the one that's drunk). Don't yell at the police officers, and if they give you a command you should do what they say. The police can be strict, but they're still there to protect and serve.

<h1>Addo Elephant National Park</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

The ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.sanparks.org/parks/addo"&gt;Addo Elephant National Park&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ (♡❤pronounced Ahh-Dow♡❤) is in the &lt;a href="Eastern%20Cape"&gt;Eastern Cape&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="South%20Africa"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and is one of the country's larger parks.

<h2>Understand</h2>

<h3>History</h3>
In the parks early years, during times of drought (and before the waterholes were artificially kept full) the park keepers fed the elephants on oranges from the local orange groves. Gradually the elephants became addicted to the taste of the fruit! This practice stopped along time ago, but the older elephants still remember the smell and have been known to reach into vehicles and get their favourite fruit!

<h3>Landscape</h3>

<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>
The park has elephant, Black Rhinoceros, Cape Buffalo, lion and leopard on land. In the Marine reserve you will find dolphin, whales (♡❤southern right♡❤) and penguins.

<h3>Climate</h3>
Due to its terrain, &lt;a href="Addo"&gt;Addo&lt;/a&gt; stays at a comfortable 27-30°C throughout the Winter.

<h2>Get in</h2>

Addo NP is about 70km north-east from &lt;a href="Port%20Elizabeth"&gt;Port Elizabeth&lt;/a&gt;. There is no public transport to or within the park so you need your own car (car rental is available in Port Elizabeth). Or book an organized tour but going on your own pace is really the best option. The park can be visited on a day-trip from Port Elizabeth.
On the road you might notice signs to the 'Addo Olifant Nasionale Park'. These signs are the old Afrikaans version of the more modern road signs.

The rangers will do an quick search of your car when you enter and leave the park to make sure no firearms and/or animals are brought in/out.

<h2>Fees</h2>

Valid to 31 October 2017:
<ul>
BULLET::::- South African citizens and residents (with ID): R62 per adult, R31 per child, per day
BULLET::::- SADC nationals (with passport): R124 per adult, R62 per child, per day
BULLET::::- Foreign visitors: R248 per adult, R124 per child, per day

</ul>
<h2>Get around</h2>
The well-kept tar and dirt road within the park can be driven with any vehicle, 4x4 is not required. Be sure to fill up your car with gas before you enter: The park is big and there are no fuel stations inside.

Games drives are available starting from the main camp at R240 per person and two hour horse trails at R245.

<h2>See &amp; do</h2>

The Park is famous for its &lt;a href="African%20flora%20and%20fauna%23Elephant"&gt;elephant&lt;/a&gt; population that has a special, brownish skin colour due to the red soil. Amongst the elephants other animals, like &lt;a href="African%20flora%20and%20fauna"&gt;ostriches&lt;/a&gt;, different antelopes and &lt;a href="African%20flora%20and%20fauna"&gt;warthogs&lt;/a&gt; can be seen. As part of the park's expansion, a group of &lt;a href="African%20flora%20and%20fauna%23Lion"&gt;lions&lt;/a&gt; and a group of &lt;a href="African%20flora%20and%20fauna%23Spotted%20hyena"&gt;spotted hyenas&lt;/a&gt; were introduced to the park in 2004.

A viewpoint and underground hide overlooking a watering hole is located in the main camp and can be used after vehicle access closing time to the game viewing area.

<h2>Buy</h2>

<h2>Eat &amp; drink</h2>
There is a restaurant and shop at the main camp, near park's entrance.

A fenced off picnic area with undercover seating, barbecue grills, water and toilet facilities is located near Hapoor Dam. No refuse bins are provided at the picnic area; you are required to take out everything you bring into the area.

<h2>Sleep</h2>

<h3>Inside the park</h3>
There are 3 camps in Addo, the Main Camp in the north east near the town of Addo, with an entrance to the R342, Spekboom hide &amp; tented camp approximately 11 km south of the main camp and the much smaller Camp Matyholweni, in the south at the Colchester entrance to the park on the N2 between Port Elizabeth and Grahamstown. Main Camp boasts a restaurant, camping facilities and a number of chalets for overnight stays. Camp Matyholweniare has only chalets while Spekboom offers five secluded two-person tents with braai facilities.

Tent and caravan sites from R300, safari tents from R815, cabins from R930, rondavels and cottages from R1500 (2017).

<h3>Outside the park</h3>

There are over 70 listed places of accommodation in the area surrounding the Addo Elephant Park. These range in price from R50 for camping to R350 per room for basic backpackers accommodation, or self-catering to many exclusive game lodges and a great number of bed and breakfast establishments and guest houses. Prices go up to R5000 per person sharing at the more exclusive resorts, but there are many facilities priced in the R250-500 price range. For more information contact the reception at the park or the backpackers info centre at the Orange Elephant, who have a file containing telephone numbers and prices.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>

Stay in your car at all times, except where specifically permitted to leave your vehicle. At some of the unfenced lookout points one is allowed to exit your vehicle, but do so with care and only after ensuring that there are no animals around.

♡❤♡Do not carry any citrus fruit in your car♡❤♡, the elephants have developed an addiction for the fruit and will search it out!

<h2>Get around</h2>
The four islands of &lt;a href="Gan"&gt;Gan&lt;/a&gt;, Feydhoo, Maradhoo and Hithadhoo are connected to each other by causeways. There is a bus service which runs daily every two hours (except on Friday morning) all the way from the Gan island up to the north of the Hithadhoo island and back. The bus is reliable but slow: the 15-km-long route takes almost an hour. On the Feydhoo island the bus passes the Feydhoo ferry terminal from where you can take a ferry to Meedhoo. On the Gan island the bus doesn't go directly to the airport but terminates about 500 m away from the airport (to get there walk out of the airport, turn left and walk for about 500 m along the Link Road until you see a building with the label "ASTRA" on the left side of the road, this is where the bus terminates).

<h1>Adelaide</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡&lt;a href="https%3A//www.cityofadelaide.com.au/explore-the-city/visit-adelaide/"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is the capital city of &lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It lies on the eastern shores of Gulf St Vincent in the central, southern part of the Australian continent. Adelaide is Australia's fifth largest city, with a population of over 1.2 million. More than three quarters of South Australians live in the Adelaide metropolitan area.

Adelaide is on a plain between the rolling &lt;a href="Adelaide%20Hills"&gt;Adelaide Hills&lt;/a&gt; and the Gulf and is bordered by many of Australia's famous wine regions. The &lt;a href="Barossa%20Valley"&gt;Barossa Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Clare%20Valley"&gt;Clare Valley&lt;/a&gt; regions lie to the north, the &lt;a href="McLaren%20Vale"&gt;McLaren Vale&lt;/a&gt; and Langhorne Creek regions to the south and the cooler climate &lt;a href="Adelaide%20Hills"&gt;Adelaide Hills&lt;/a&gt; region to the east. Historically known as the City of Churches due to its new world origins as an incubator for religious freedom, much of the architecture in the inner city is retained from the colonial era. Heavily influenced by the prevailing styles popular in England at the time, the heritage architecture is similar to many European cities built in the 19th century.

Proximity to premium wine and food growing regions, as well as waves of immigration from Germany, Italy, Greece, Vietnam, China and India have created a unique multicultural gourmet food and café culture in the City and inner suburbs. This café culture is supported by Adelaide's global reputation for the arts and particularly the arts festivals held in March including the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.adelaidefestival.com.au"&gt;Adelaide Festival&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.adelaidefringe.com.au"&gt;Adelaide Fringe Festival&lt;/a&gt;, which is second only to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in size.

The city is the home of Adelaide Oval, famed as one of Test cricket's most picturesque grounds and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.adelaideoval.com.au"&gt;under redevelopment&lt;/a&gt; to host AFL football matches during the winter months. Australian football has a long history in Adelaide and AFL matches are played at Adelaide Oval in North Adelaide. Adelaide and the surrounding wine regions also host the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tourdownunder.com.au"&gt;Tour Down Under&lt;/a&gt;, which is the largest cycling race in the Southern Hemisphere and the first stage of the UCI WorldTour.

<h2>Understand</h2>
The &lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; time zone is ♡❤♡30 minutes behind♡❤♡ Australian Standard Eastern Time (AEST) used in &lt;a href="Victoria%20%28state%29"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="New%20South%20Wales"&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>Climate</h3>

&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Climate/style.css" /&gt;
Adelaide is Australia's driest capital city, with summers that are hot and dry, and with winters that are rainy and cool.

In ♡❤♡summer♡❤♡, the average maximum is 29°C (84°F) but there is considerable variation and Adelaide can usually expect several days a year when the daytime temperatures soar above 40°C (104°F). Rainfall is light and infrequent throughout summer. The average in January and February is around 20 millimetres (0.8 inches) but completely rainless months are by no means uncommon. Given the regular hot weather, virtually every public building, indoor tourist destination and most public transport is fully air-conditioned.

In ♡❤♡winter♡❤♡ from June to August, the average maximum is 15–16°C (59–61°F) and the minimum is usually around 8°C (46°F). Winter sees regular rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80mm. Frosts are common in the valleys of the &lt;a href="Adelaide%20Hills"&gt;Adelaide Hills&lt;/a&gt;, but rare elsewhere. Adelaide experiences no snowfall in the city centre itself, although very occasionally a small sprinkling can be observed on higher ground at the top of Mount Lofty and in the Adelaide Hills.

♡❤♡Autumn♡❤♡ and ♡❤♡spring♡❤♡ are slow, gradual changes between the extremes of summer and winter. From mid-February to late March, Adelaide goes into its ♡❤♡mad March♡❤♡ festival season of arts, music and sport festivals to take advantage of the moderate weather. Spring also makes a good time to visit Adelaide, as flowers are usually in bloom following the rains of winter.

The first people to live on the Adelaide plains were the ♡❤♡Kaurna people♡❤♡, whose territory extended from what is now &lt;a href="Port%20Broughton"&gt;Port Broughton&lt;/a&gt; to Adelaide's north, south to &lt;a href="Cape%20Jervis"&gt;Cape Jervis&lt;/a&gt; on the southern tip of the &lt;a href="Fleurieu%20Peninsula"&gt;Fleurieu Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. The Kaurna lived on the Adelaide plains in family groups called ♡❤yerta♡❤, a word which also referred to the area of land which supported the family group. Each yerta was the responsibility of Kaurna adults who inherited the land and had an intimate knowledge of its resources and features. Adelaide's rich Aboriginal history and living culture can be explored at &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tandanya.com.au"&gt;Tandanya&lt;/a&gt;, an Aboriginal-owned culture and history centre on Grenfell Street. Tandanya is free to visit and tours are available for a small charge.

<h4>European settlement</h4>

Following the mapping of South Australia's coastline in the early 19th century by European explorers Matthew Flinders and Nicolas Baudin, an expedition down the Murray River was held which reported favourably on land on the coast of Gulf St Vincent. At the same time, British reformers were keen to establish a colony based on free settlement rather than by the transportation of convicts, as all the other Australian colonies at the time were founded. In 1834, the South Australia Company was founded and it convinced the British Parliament to pass a law which created a colony for free settlers in South Australia. In December 1836, after a 10 month journey by a fleet of ships from England, the first Governor, John Hindmarsh proclaimed the creation of the new province in a ceremony in what is now the beachside suburb of Glenelg.

After wrangling between the colonists, Adelaide's first surveyor, William Light designed a city grid of wide boulevards surrounded by parklands, with one central square (Victoria Square) and four smaller squares (Hindmarsh, Light, Whitmore and Hurtle) set on the southern banks of the Torrens. Light's original design, with small changes, largely survives to this day.

The city's early industries were based around mining and agriculture, with England as the key export market. The relatively radical politics of many of the free settlers led to Adelaide being home to early progressive reform including the secret printed ballot, the first jurisdiction in the world to allow women to vote and run for Parliament and early trade unionisation and activism.

<h4>Post-Federation</h4>
Following Australian federation in 1901, South Australia began to move into secondary manufacturing industries, a process which was sent into overdrive by the long term government of the conservative Premier Thomas Playford following World War 2. Playford set out to actively attract manufacturing companies like General Motors to South Australia by offering cheap land and low taxes. This, along with the growing ubiquity of car transport, led to Adelaide's relatively low density as workers lived close to the factories where they worked in the outer suburbs.

Mass migration from southern Europe transformed Adelaide's Anglo-Celtic culture, with Greek migrants mainly settling in the inner western and inner southern suburbs and Italian migrants settling in the inner eastern and north-eastern suburbs. These cultural identities persist to today, with continental delis and cafés being a common feature of Adelaide's inner city.

While South Australia's economy boomed, its public and cultural life lost much of its early radicalism, with blue laws requiring bars and pubs to close at six in the evening - causing the "six o'clock swill". The White Australia policy also meant that Adelaide residents were overwhelmingly from European backgrounds.

<h4>Cosmopolitan capital city</h4>
The 1960s saw a dramatic change in Adelaide's cultural life, with the start of the Adelaide Festival of Arts and Adelaide Fringe Festival, which transformed Adelaide's arts culture and the end of the decade saw the election of the first Labor government since the 1930s. By 1970, Don Dunstan became Premier of South Australia. Dunstan was a transformational figure and sought to reshape Adelaide in the mould of a modern cosmopolitan capital city. Dunstan's government ended the six o'clock swill, pedestrianised Rundle Street creating Rundle Mall and built the Festival Centre, creating a hub for arts in Adelaide. His government enacted a range of progressive reforms, including making South Australia the first jurisdiction in Australia to legalise homosexuality. This time also saw changes to Australia's immigration laws which saw Vietnamese and Chinese migrants join earlier waves of migration and the creation of communities in the north-west and western suburbs, as well as Gouger Street's multilingual Chinatown precinct next to the Adelaide Central Market.

After losing government for one term to the conservatives at the end of the 1970s, Labor returned to office under John Bannon in the 1980s. A more business friendly leader than Dunstan, Premier Bannon sought to drive the development of Adelaide's city, seeing the construction of Adelaide's tallest building now known as Westpac House and the development of the Adelaide Convention Centre and Adelaide Casino. However, bad bank loans saw the state-backed State Bank of South Australia collapse in the early 1990s, requiring a huge government bailout and plunging the state deep into debt.

<h4>Revival after the State Bank</h4>
The 1990s under the Liberal government led by Premiers Dean Brown, John Olsen and Rob Kerin saw the conservative government undertake asset sales and reduce government services to reduce the state debt. This reduction in government spending, as well as the decline of Australian manufacturing following the abolition of the tariff wall by the federal government, led to slow growth in South Australia's economy and widespread emigration to the eastern capitals, particularly Melbourne.

Labor returned to office in 2002 under Mike Rann who sought to reshape Adelaide's industrial base to focus on education services, mining and defence industry, as well as building on its strengths in wine. Rann's government invested heavily in rebuilding the city, with overhauls to public transport, the construction of a new central hospital and the redevelopment of Adelaide Oval. Following ten years with Premier Rann as leader, Labor elected Jay Weatherill as Premier in 2011, who has largely continued this agenda, but with a renewed focus on transforming public spaces in the inner city through the relaxation of planning restrictions and looser liquor licensing for small bars.

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q14302"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Adelaide International Airport♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;&lt;b&gt; ADL &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/bdi&gt;) (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;is around to the west of the city centre and is close to popular tourist beaches at Glenelg and Henley Beach.&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Adelaide International Airport is surprisingly well connected, and has daily international flights to hubs in Asia, the Middle East and New Zealand which allow for one-stop connections around the globe. More frequent flights connecting via &lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; may be cheaper.
</ul>
&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; 

<h4>Between the airport and the city</h4>
♡❤♡Adelaide Metro's regular &lt;a href="http%3A//adelaidemetro.com.au/Timetables-Maps/Special-Services/JetBus-Airport-Service"&gt;JetBus&lt;/a&gt; J1/J2/J7/J8♡❤♡ connects the airport with the City, Glenelg and some major shopping centres. J1 Services depart every 15 minutes 8AM to 6PM every day to the City, less frequent from 5AM to 11PM. The journey to the City takes around 25 minutes during peak hour. Additionally JetBus J1X offers express service from the airport to the city Monday through Friday hourly between 5 AM to 10 AM and 4 PM to 9 PM with a circular route around the CBD for more convenience to hotels. Services to Glenelg are every half hour during the day, less at night. Services to Arndale, West Lakes and Marion shopping centre are hourly during weekdays.

Buses depart from a single dedicated stop left (west) of the Short Term Car Park outside the main terminal. All buses in all directions leave from this one stop, so check the front of the bus to make sure its heading where you want to go! Realtime bus information is &lt;a href="http%3A//m.adelaidemetro.com.au/stops/view/17327"&gt;available for this stop&lt;/a&gt; and all Adelaide Metro stops or via dedicated apps for your Smartphone like &lt;a href="https%3A//adelaidemetro.com.au/Timetables-Maps/Mobile-Apps"&gt;metroMATE&lt;/a&gt;.

The JetBus is part of the Adelaide Metro network, so the standard ticket types and fares in the &lt;a href="%23Public_transport"&gt;public transport&lt;/a&gt; section apply, and a ticket used on the JetBus can be used with another bus, train or tram according to its type. Metrocards are also available for sale at the airport from a vending machine next to the JetBus stop.

♡❤♡Taxis♡❤♡ are available downstairs out the front of the terminal. A taxi to the City costs around $30 during the morning peak hour and around $20 at other times, which can make it as economical as the JetBus for a group. Drivers will always use the meter, but a $2 surcharge is payable in addition to the metered amount for pickups from the airport.

Major national ♡❤♡rental car companies♡❤♡ operate kiosks on the ground floor near baggage claim including &lt;a href="http%3A//www.avis.com.au"&gt;AVIS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.budget.com.au"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.europcar.com.au"&gt;Europcar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https%3A//www.hertz.com.au/rentacar/hire-a-car/south-australia/adelaide"&gt;Hertz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.thrifty.com.au"&gt;Thrifty&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.redspot.com.au"&gt;Redspot Sixt&lt;/a&gt;. The car rental car park is on the ground level directly opposite the terminal.

<h3>By car</h3>
Adelaide is at least a day's drive away from the capital cities on the Australian east coast. The shortest driving route from Adelaide to &lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; takes 8–9 hours. There are some freeway sections, but the roads are mostly 2 lane roads of highway quality.

From ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Melbourne"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, Adelaide is 736km (457&amp;nbsp;mi) via &lt;a href="Horsham"&gt;Horsham&lt;/a&gt; (National Highway 8) or 901km (560&amp;nbsp;mi) via &lt;a href="Mount%20Gambier"&gt;Mt Gambier&lt;/a&gt; (National Highway 1). The journey via Mt Gambier takes you through the &lt;a href="Coonawarra"&gt;Coonawarra&lt;/a&gt; wine region, one of the most renowned cabernet sauvignon regions in Australia and also is convenient for a side tour via the &lt;a href="Great%20Ocean%20Road"&gt;Great Ocean Road&lt;/a&gt;. The trip via Horsham is more direct, on high quality highways, but has fewer tourist attractions.

From ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Sydney"&gt;Sydney&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, Adelaide is 1,422km (884&amp;nbsp;mi) via &lt;a href="Wagga%20Wagga"&gt;Wagga Wagga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Mildura"&gt;Mildura&lt;/a&gt; (National Highway 20). Freeway conditions from Sydney to Wagga Wagga cut hours from the trip. This route also passes close to &lt;a href="Canberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;, Australia's national capital, which is 1,196km (743&amp;nbsp;mi) from Adelaide.

Another option from Sydney is the 1,659km (1031&amp;nbsp;mi) route via &lt;a href="Broken%20Hill"&gt;Broken Hill&lt;/a&gt; (National Highway 32), which takes you through the Outback and one of Australia's most historic mining towns. The 2,031km (1,262&amp;nbsp;mi) route from ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Brisbane"&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ also goes via Broken Hill.

While Adelaide is the closest capital city to ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Perth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡, the 2,550km (1584&amp;nbsp;mi) journey across the &lt;a href="Nullarbor"&gt;Nullarbor&lt;/a&gt; is still arduous, though it's a unique drive through some of the most remote places in the inhabited world. Similarly, the 3,027km (1884&amp;nbsp;mi) journey north to ♡❤♡&lt;a href="Darwin"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ via &lt;a href="Alice%20Springs"&gt;Alice Springs&lt;/a&gt; travels through the true &lt;a href="Outback"&gt;Outback&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Uluru"&gt;Uluru&lt;/a&gt; is only a few hours from the main highway north.

<h3>By train</h3>
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.gsr.com.au"&gt;Great Southern Railway&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ runs long distance tourist train services to and from Adelaide. &lt;a href="The%20Ghan"&gt;The Ghan&lt;/a&gt; runs to &lt;a href="Alice%20Springs"&gt;Alice Springs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Darwin"&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Across%20Australia%20by%20train"&gt;The Overland&lt;/a&gt; runs to Melbourne, and the &lt;a href="Indian%20Pacific"&gt;Indian Pacific&lt;/a&gt; runs to &lt;a href="Perth"&gt;Perth&lt;/a&gt;, Broken Hill and Sydney. These journeys are train experiences, and offer sleepers, and the opportunity to take your car with you on the train. However, they take considerably longer and invariably cost more than the journey by bus or plane, with the exception of the Melbourne-Adelaide route, which can be cheaper than or of comparable price with air fares. Further, the trains stop at intermediate stops which may not be serviced by air connections, particularly on the Melbourne-Adelaide route.

These interstate trains depart from the &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; just outside of the city. The station can be accessed by car or bus from Richmond Road. Since the demolition of Keswick station, there are no connections to the suburban rail network. Taxis are also available to meet all arrivals.

There are no country rail services in South Australia.

<h3>By bus</h3>
♡❤♡Interstate buses♡❤♡ are operated by a number of coach companies including &lt;a href="http%3A//www.greyhound.com.au"&gt;Greyhound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.fireflyexpress.com.au/"&gt;Firefly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.vline.com.au"&gt;V/Line&lt;/a&gt;. The journey from Melbourne takes around eleven and a half hours, with both day and overnight services. The trip from Sydney can take up to 24 hours and by definition, travels overnight. Fares are less than train travel, but can be more than a budget airfare if you are booking well in advance.

♡❤♡Regional buses♡❤♡ to South Australian country cities and towns are also operated by the interstate bus companies, but local South Australian coach companies including &lt;a href="http%3A//www.linksa.com.au"&gt;LinkSA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.premierstateliner.com.au"&gt;Premier Stateliner&lt;/a&gt; often provide more frequent services.

Almost all interstate and regional buses depart from the &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at 85 Franklin Street in the City. The Central Bus Station operates 05:00-21:30, 7 days a week. It has modern amenities as well as a café and it is just across the road from the Adelaide Central Market, a Coles supermarket and Chinatown.

<h3>By ship</h3>

A range of cruise ships call at the &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during the cruise boat season, which runs from November to April each year. In the 2012/2013 season, ships called at the Port for a total of 26 days throughout the season. A list of ships arriving in Adelaide is available from &lt;a href="http%3A//portmis.flindersports.com.au"&gt;Flinders Ports&lt;/a&gt;.

Bikes are available from more than 10 locations across the City and the inner suburbs for free, but must be returned M-F before 16:30 or 17:00 weekends or a $25 fee is payable. Arrangements can be made for bicycles to be hired overnight for an additional fee but all hires are stopped if temperatures are forecast to top 38°C. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.bikesa.asn.au/adelaidefreebikes"&gt;A list of locations for hire is listed on Bicycle SA's website&lt;/a&gt; Bikes are step thru-models with front baskets and a sturdy rear carrier (but you'll need to provide bungy straps or lashings). Front calliper brake, rear brake is an annoying back-pedal arrangement. Shimano 3 speed hub gear. They'll also supply you with a long sturdy combination lock and cycle helmet when you leave some photo ID.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt; 

A popular ride is to ride from the city centre along the River Torrens out to West Beach, then down to Glenelg and back. ♡❤♡You cannot take your bike on the Glenelg Tram or any bus♡❤♡, even outside peak hour, however you can take them on trains. An alternative to taking the tram back from Glenelg is to ride a further 20 minutes south along the coast to Brighton Station on the Noarlunga Centre Line where there are reasonably frequent trains back to Adelaide.

<h3>Public transport</h3>
Accurate transit directions can be obtained through Google Maps. To navigate around, just enter your "to" address and "from" address (or use current location) on your device (including iPhone, Android), then select the public transport icon. Realtime arrival information is available from the Adelaide Metro website or a number of apps for smartphones (e.g. Transittimes), use the time before your vehicle arrives to have a look around the nearby area.
<h4>Ticketing and route information</h4>
Metropolitan train, tram and bus services are operated under the unified brand name ♡❤♡Adelaide Metro♡❤♡ and use a unified ticketing system, "Metroticket".

</ul>
Single trip tickets with unlimited transfers for two hours are sold on buses, trams and at major train stations for $5 peak and $3.00 off peak. Alternatively, a $9.10 daytrip ticket is available, allowing unlimited travel within the Adelaide Metro area for an entire day.

Travellers in Adelaide for longer than a couple of days should buy a Metrocard for $10 which comes with $5 of value included. Trips on Metrocard cost $3.19 peak and $1.75 off peak. Metrocards are sold at major train stations (Adelaide, Elizabeth, Gawler, Noarlunga Centre, Oaklands, Mawson Lakes and Salisbury) as well as most newsagents and corner stores. &lt;a href="http%3A//adelaidemetro.com.au/Tickets/Where-to-buy"&gt;A list of locations is on the Adelaide Metro website&lt;/a&gt;. Metrocards can be topped up wherever they are sold as well as on trains and trams using coins or major credit cards.

There is also a $25 visitors pass that can be used for unlimited travel on the network for 3 days. After the 3 day period, the pass can be topped up and used just like a normal metrocard.

<h4>Train</h4>

The &lt;a href="https%3A//www.adelaidemetro.com.au/"&gt;Adelaide Metro&lt;/a&gt; train system has four main lines, with two additional branch lines.

Travelling ♡❤♡north♡❤♡:

<ul>
BULLET::::- The ♡❤♡Outer Harbor Line♡❤♡, which goes up the Le Fevre Peninsula in the north-west of the city via Port Adelaide. The Outer Harbor line is convenient for the Semaphore tourist precinct, the historic maritime district in Port Adelaide and the Queen Street cafe strip in Croydon. The ♡❤♡Grange line♡❤♡ branches off the Outer Harbor line at Woodville.
BULLET::::- The ♡❤♡Gawler Line♡❤♡, to Gawler Central in the north of the city, through Ovingham, Mawson Lakes, Salisbury and Elizabeth.

</ul>
Travelling ♡❤♡south♡❤♡:

<ul>
BULLET::::- The electrified ♡❤♡Seaford Line♡❤♡, which extends to Seaford in the far south of the city, via the beachside suburb of Brighton and Noarlunga Centre. The Seaford line provides access to beaches at Brighton and Hallett Cove, as well as Westfield Marion at Oaklands. The ♡❤♡Tonsley line♡❤♡ branches off the Seaford line and it only operates Monday to Friday until the early evening.
BULLET::::- The picturesque ♡❤♡Belair Line♡❤♡ which extends to Belair in the Adelaide foothills through Blackwood and the inner south-eastern suburbs of the city. The Belair line is useful to access Belair National Park.

</ul>
<h4>Buses</h4>

The Adelaide Metro has a comprehensive bus network, centred in the City. Full maps and information are available at the &lt;a href="https%3A//www.adelaidemetro.com.au/Timetables-Maps/Maps/Network"&gt;Adelaide Metro website&lt;/a&gt;. ♡❤♡Most main roads including café precincts like The Parade, Prospect Road, Henley Beach Road, King William Road and O'Connell St are 'Go Zones♡❤♡' which have regular buses on weekdays at least every 15 minutes until the early evening. Adelaide's bus network extends out to the outer suburbs, to the Adelaide Hills in the east, down to &lt;a href="McLaren%20Vale"&gt;McLaren Vale&lt;/a&gt; in the south (although buses there are infrequent) and as far as Gawler in the north. It does not cover the Barossa Valley. Frequencies in the outer suburbs are much lower than in the City.

The ♡❤♡O-Bahn♡❤♡ is a bus rapid transit line which runs to Adelaide's north-eastern suburbs. O-Bahn buses run from Grenfell Street in the City, entering the O-Bahn at Hackney and stop at Klemzig, Paradise and Modbury Interchanges. After finishing on the O-Bahn, the buses drives the same as a regular bus to reach its destination. O-Bahn services are very frequent, as often as every 3 to 5 minutes during peak hour to interchanges and every 15 minutes off peak.

Be warned that bus frequency declines sharply after 19:00, with hourly intervals being typical in the outer suburbs, half hourly along Go Zones and every 15 minutes on the O-Bahn. All services cease operation around midnight, so check your timetables and expect to catch a taxi if required if you are out after this time. Very basic ♡❤After Midnight♡❤ bus services along limited routes operate hourly after midnight ♡❤♡on Saturday nights only♡❤♡.

The free ♡❤♡City Loop (99C)♡❤♡ bus runs on weekdays from 07:40–18:00 every 15min. On Fridays, it also runs at night 18:00-21:20 every 30min, Saturdays 08:00–17:00 every 30 minutes and Sundays (and public holidays) 10:00-17:00 every 30min. It has clockwise and anticlockwise routes each with about 30 stops taking in all the major cultural and commercial centres in the City, beginning at Victoria Square and including Adelaide Railway Station. The buses feature ground-level access ramps.

<h4>Tram</h4>

Adelaide has ♡❤♡a tram line♡❤♡ which runs from the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in Hindmarsh through the City, then down through the south-western suburbs to the beachside suburb of Glenelg. ♡❤♡Travel in the City between the Adelaide Entertainment Centre and South Terrace is free♡❤♡, while travel to Glenelg needs a ticket or a Metrocard. Tickets can be purchased on the tram from conductors, or from ticket machines at some stops.

As well as being convenient for popular tourist destination Glenelg from the City, the tram also stops at Rundle Mall, Victoria Square near the Adelaide Central Market and at North Terrace near Adelaide Railway Station. Travelling north on the tram takes you to Hindmarsh and Bowden, the home of the Adelaide Entertainment Centre venue for stadium concerts as well as a popular cafe and restaurant strip along Port Road and the side streets alongside.

If you're driving a car, a convenient (and popular) ♡❤♡alternative to parking in the City♡❤♡ is to park at the Entertainment Centre and catch the tram into the City. It only costs $4 for a whole weekday, which is much cheaper than city parking.

<h3>By foot</h3>
The City centre is relatively compact and can be easily covered on foot. Most attractions are centred around the blocks between North Terrace and Victoria Square on either side of King William Street. The core Rundle Mall shopping district is entirely pedestrianised. The Gouger Street precinct and the Adelaide Central Market are also great destinations for a walking traveller.

Travellers keen to keep up on jogging while away can use popular jogging tracks along the River Torrens and through the Parklands.

<h3>By taxi</h3>

Adelaide has three main taxi companies which operate 24/7:

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Adelaide Independent Taxis♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 13 22 11 &lt;/bdi&gt; .&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Suburban Taxis♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 13 10 08 &lt;/bdi&gt; .&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Yellow Cabs South Australia♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 13 22 27 &lt;/bdi&gt; .&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
Cabs in South Australia are ♡❤♡white♡❤♡ (even those operated by 'Yellow Cabs') and they are clearly marked. It is generally possible to hail a taxi in the street or from a major hotel during business hours in the City, but in the suburbs you typically need to call one of the company booking services listed. There are a number of cab ranks which are staffed by the Taxi Council at night on weekends. Supervised taxi ranks offer extra security with lights and supervision by a concierge and a security officer. They operate 23:00-03:00 on Fridays and 23:00-05:00 on Saturdays. &lt;a href="http%3A//www.taxicouncilsa.com.au"&gt;A map of locations is available on their website&lt;/a&gt;.

All taxis in Adelaide are required by the State Government to charge a regulated metered tariff, according to the time that the journey commences. Tariff one is the normal tariff rate and tariff two is a higher rate that applies between Monday to Friday 19:00-06:00, and on weekends and public holidays. Drivers almost always use the meter and are legally required to do so. Payment can be made by cash, EFTPOS, debit and credit cards and Cabcharge. It's a good idea to let the driver know if you are planning to pay with a method other than cash before you start your trip, as the machines can be unreliable.

<h3>By car</h3>
Adelaide's city centre and inner suburbs like Glenelg, Norwood and Prospect are easily traversed walking and using public transport. However, if you are expecting to spend a lot of time outside of the CBD or you are planning a trip to a wine region, a car is useful to avoid long trips on public transport or in the case of the Barossa Valley, to get around at all.

Unlike other Australian state capitals, Adelaide does not have a network of freeways leading directly into the city centre. The freeways that exist begin in the outer suburbs and are for the purpose of carrying traffic to the nearby country towns. Speed limits on most major roads are signposted at 60km/h, though the default speed limit is 50km/h if no speed limit is posted.

Another good place to look for semi-luxury items would be &lt;a href="http%3A//www.burnsidevillage.com.au/"&gt;Burnside Village&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern suburbs.

<h3>Malls and shopping precincts</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Rundle Mall♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8203 7200 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A pedestrian-only shopping strip, with many arcades and side streets coming off it. Runs parallel to North Terrace. Over 800 shops.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Tea Tree Plaza♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;TTP for short&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A medium-sized shopping centre with over 250 shops. Tea Tree Plaza is the terminus of the Adelaide O'Bahn dedicated busway which begins in the city centre at Hackney Rd. It is easy to get there from the city centre; most of the buses that stop on the Grenfell St stops travel to the &lt;a href="https%3A//www.adelaidemetro.com.au/var/metro/storage/original/application/02e9b0d5da87c2eb7b0c242970a65184.pdf"&gt;TTP interchange&lt;/a&gt; via the O'Bahn busway. It's easy to see from a distance as it has the large antenna and supporting pyramid type structure, well-known to the locals, on the roof of the Myer department store. Ample parking is available around, on top of, and underneath the complex. The much smaller Tea Tree Plus shopping centre is right next to Tea Tree Plaza.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Westfield Marion Shopping Centre♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Adelaide's largest shopping centre with over 400 shops. There are direct buses from the city centre.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Harbour Town♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Mid sized mall undergoing an expansion, featuring outlet shopping, situated up against the western edge of the Adelaide Airport. Only a short bus ride from the Airport, and 30&amp;nbsp;minutes from the city centre.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

You can borrow a shopping cart from Coles Supermarket next door to stop your arms being pulled from their sockets by all the goodies you'll buy. It's not just vegetarians that will salivate here since foods and non-foods of every variety compete for the best displays. Cheap multi-storey parking adjacent.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Chinatown♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A pedestrian-only area (Moonta St) adjacent to Central Market.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

Most items available in larger quantities.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h4>The BYO culture</h4>

While fairly unusual in the rest of the world, it's common for restaurants in Australia and New Zealand to allow patrons to bring bottled wine to dinner. This practice is called 'BYO' - 'bring your own'. Originally resulting from a loophole in liquor licensing laws, BYO is now a great opportunity to enjoy some of the wine which you have bought in a wine region, or to visit a local 'bottle shop' and enjoy a wider selection at lower prices.

Nowhere in Australia is BYO more common than in Adelaide. Most restaurants in Adelaide which serve alcohol will also allow BYO, though it's a good idea to call ahead to make sure. It's common for a charge called 'corkage' to be applied to the bill. Corkage will typically be around $10–$15 per bottle, though higher charges are not unheard of. Corkage is applied even if your wine is under a screwtop rather than a cork, like virtually all recently produced Australian wine.

<h3>Adelaide</h3>
The City caters to virtually every different taste and price range. Adelaide has one of the largest number of restaurants and cafes per person in Australia and most of the best are in the City.

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Gouger Street, Chinatown and the Central Market precinct♡❤♡ is a multicultural food and wine paradise. Best known in Adelaide for good quality Asian food at a reasonable price, Gouger Street attracts a wide range of clientele from lawyers and public servants from the adjacent courts and State government precinct to new migrants. Chinatown and Gouger St is the hub of Chinese cuisine and culture in Adelaide and there are a wide range of Chinese restaurants along the strip. Other Asian cuisines are also featured including Thai, Vietnamese and Indian. On the northern side of Gouger St, the Adelaide Central Market has a great range of hawker style food stalls as well as a few older European cafes. The last decade has also seen the emergence of high-end dining on Gouger St, with a number of more expensive options joining the long standing and locally famed Argentinian restaurant, Gaucho's.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Rundle Street and the East End♡❤♡ is the traditional hub of Italian and Greek cuisine in Adelaide, but there are also newer Chinese, Thai and Japanese restaurants. Like Gouger St, it has options across the spectrum of budgets, with the western end of the street closer to Adelaide University catering more to the budget end while the eastern end is more upmarket. The East End laneways off of Rundle Street have a range of smaller, quirkier cafes - Ebenezer Place, Bent Street and Union Street all have a few alternative options.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Waymouth Street and Pirie Street♡❤♡ have emerged as new eating destinations over the last decade, particularly for an upmarket lunch. Waymouth Street, on the western side of King William Street, has a range of high end cafes, bistros and bars, while Pirie Street has a few new cafes.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Hindley Street♡❤♡ is best known for its bars and nightlife, but has a range of multicultural food options, particularly Middle Eastern and Asian. The ♡❤♡Leigh Street and Bank Street♡❤♡ laneways have also emerged as dining destinations in their own right.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Hutt Street♡❤♡ is smaller scale and offers a small variety of upmarket restaurants that please most tastes, and also has a wide variety of gourmet shops and supermarkets.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡The South West Corner♡❤♡ of the City's square mile, south of the Gouger Street precinct, is more residential but includes some of Adelaide's most interesting dining experiences sprinkled among the heritage homes and apartments.

</ul>
<h3>North Adelaide</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- An eclectic mix of small restaurants and cafes make ♡❤♡Melbourne Street♡❤♡ an interesting place to eat.
BULLET::::- The variety of take-aways, pubs, cafes, bakeries and restaurants that line most of ♡❤♡O'Connell Street♡❤♡ means you won't be wanting.

</ul>
<h3>Suburbs</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡The Parade♡❤♡, Norwood has a long stretch of shopping and cosmopolitan dining. Buses from the CBD numbering 122-124 or a very short taxi ride.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Jetty Road / Mosley Square♡❤♡, Glenelg has a variety of restaurants and pubs at the end of a 30&amp;nbsp;minute tram journey.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Stuart Road♡❤♡, Dulwich features two cafes, a licensed restaurant and a very good bakery. Catch the 145 or 146 from North Ter which heads along Fullarton Rd and up Dulwich Ave.
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡King William Road♡❤♡, Hyde Park is an upmarket strip of fashionable cafes, coffee shops and restaurants.

</ul>
<h3>Budget</h3>
There are actually a lot of budget eateries in Adelaide. They don't usually look like much from the outside but most have something going for them - the reason that they are still in business. It pays to look through menus plastered onto doors. Cheap eats should be anywhere from $8–14 for a main, and no more.

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Elephant walk♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;76 Melbourne St&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8267-2006 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Particularly interesting because it is a small, cosy cafe which is very dimly lit. Each booth is separated by straw screens so you can't really see the other patrons. It opens at 8PM and if they're full, you'll have to wait outside for a table.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Jerusalem Sheshkebab House♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;131B Hindley St&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8212 6185 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;An Adelaide institution with decorations which probably haven't been changed in 30 years. Arguably Adelaide's best falafel and be sure to try the cauliflower dishes. Vegetarian/vegan friendly and BYO.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Nano Cafe♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;23 Ebenezer Pl&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;in East End&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8227 0468 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;Daily&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Italian home-style food, great breakfast, good coffee, value for money, breakfast &amp; lunch only, fresh daily.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;$5.80-15&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Dumpling King♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;95 Grote St&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Plates of 10-15 dumplings, steamed/friend, pork/chicken and prawn, for $6.80-7.80.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Food courts off of Moonta St♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Many different Asian cuisines at cheap prices. All you can fit on your plate for varying prices plus made to order food.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Hawker's Corner♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;141 West Terrace&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;cnr Wright St.&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Much the same as the food courts but open at night. Cheap but tasty with a wide range of food.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Cafe de Vili's♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;2-14 Manchester St&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;off South Rd, after Richmond Rd&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Vili is an Adelaide producer of pastries, especially pies and pasties. This unpretentious eatery at their factory serves full meals in addition to pastries. Shift workers and night owls regularly eat there because it is open 24 hr, 7 days. It is a minor Adelaide icon. It has a second location at 426 Main N Rd in the Blair Athol district.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Fasta Pasta♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;multiple restaurants around Adelaide&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;The ♡❤Fastfood♡❤ version of pasta; although found in other states its popularity in South Australia is due to the chain having started in Adelaide.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;Expect to pay from $10 for a plate of pasta&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h3>Mid-range</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Amalfi♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;29 Frome St&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8223 1948 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;This little Italian place just off Rundle St has a loyal following and is usually jam packed. It has an inventive range of pizzas and pastas, with quality a cut above the other Italian cafes filling Rundle St.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Chefs Of Tandoori♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;292 Unley Rd&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8373 5055 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;As the name suggest, founded by Indian chefs who deserted the Tandoori Oven across the road. Good Indian food at a very reasonable price.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Fellini♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;102 O'Connell&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8239 2235 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;This St. Large North Adelaide cafe is packed to the rafters every weekend. The menu is Italian-based pasta, pizza and so on, but what keeps the punters coming back is the large size of the menu and inventiveness of the dishes.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Hotaru Japanese Restaurant♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;162 Gouger St&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8410 2838 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Cosy Japanese restaurant with wonderful food, particularly the fresh sashimi, various sushi rolls and the grilled eggplant. Home-made sesame ice cream and green tea ice cream. Hotaru is off the main Gouger St area.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Jasmin♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;31 Hindmarsh Sq&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8223 7837 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Arguably Adelaide's best Indian restaurant. Beautifully decorated, with classical music playing and impeccable service. The very hot curries (vindaloo and tindaloo) are especially good. You might also consider trying the mixed entree or orange sponge cake.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Nu Thai♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;117 Gouger St&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8410 2288 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Slightly more expensive than Regent, with a more adventurous menu. They have a huge blackboard inside with a long list of specials which change regularly.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Raj on Taj♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;109 King William Rd&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8271 7755 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Good, reasonably priced Indian food. There are two Raj on Taj restaurants, one in Hyde Park and one nearby in Unley. The Hyde Park one is the better of the two.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Regent Thai♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;165 O'Connell St&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8239 0927 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Excellent and consistent standard Thai menu. The friendly proprietor Chang was a refugee from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. Try the oysters in coriander sauce, the red curry chicken, or ask for a whole fish steamed with ginger and shallots. Its sister restaurant at Glenelg, Phuket, is worth checking out as well.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;Mains $13-18.&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h3>Splurge</h3>

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Magill Estate Restaurant♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;78 Penfold Rd&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8301 5551 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Magill. While the food here is good, the real stars are the view and the wine list. This restaurant is owned by Penfolds, probably Australia's best-known premium red wine maker, and overlooks the vineyards on their Magill property, not far from the city centre. The grapes grown on this estate are used to make the Magill Estate label single vineyard Shiraz. The wine list allows you to order back vintages of the Penfolds and other wines going back 20 or more years.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Windy Point Restaurant♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;Windy Point Lookout, Belair Rd&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8278 8255 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Windy Point Lookout, Belair Rd. Nice ambiance, excellent service and good food prepared in a unique way with a nice view of the city skyline. For those who wish to have a less formal setting, the adjacent cafe also offers a good selection. Usually only open for dinner from 6PM onwards, though lunches are possible with prior arrangements.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Red Ochre♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;War Memorial Dr&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8211 8555 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;War Memorial Dr, North Adelaide. Modern Australian restaurant with a nice ambience situated on the River Torrens and with a good view of the city skyline.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Shiki Restaurant♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;North Terrace&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Intercontinental Hotel Adelaide&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8231 2382 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Japanese restaurant with a nice atmosphere in one of Adelaide's premier hotels. Mainly known for it's teppanyaki but also serves other Japanese dishes like sushi, sashimi and tempura.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
<h2>Drink</h2>

There are pubs and bars dotted all around the CBD, but a few districts are worth singling out. Rundle Street and its neighbouring area known simply as "The East End" have a number of popular pubs. Hindley St used to be notorious as the seedy home of Adelaide's strip clubs and bikie bars, but it, and "The West End" have undergone a renaissance. The eastern end of Hindley Street is more mainstream, whereas the western end, west of Morphett Street has a few trendier and more alternative venues. The seedy places are still there, but so too is a university campus and a number of trendy bars and clubs. Also important are Gouger Street and its many restaurants but with an increasing number of bars and pubs. O'Connell Street is home to a few of North Adelaide's popular pubs.

There are also many bars in the suburbs of Adelaide which usually are busier on Thursday and Friday evenings. Quite a lot of the locals will go to the hotels in the suburbs on Thursday and Friday evenings, and go into the Adelaide CBD on Saturday evenings.

Smoking in pubs and clubs is banned under South Australian law. Many drinking establishments have outdoor areas where smoking is permitted.

<h3>Pubs</h3>

As a rule, pubs seem to be located in hotels.

Goths, metalheads, punks and hippies all mingle in this multi-roomed venue, sipping beer. But don't worry, piercings and tattoos aren't essential to have a good time. Music playing could be just about anything.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

This lively pub features a beer garden and a solid restaurant. The crowd is generally early to mid 20s, many from the nearby Hindley Street campus of the University of South Australia. While it definitely has a strong pub feel, the music is more like a bar, with live jazz and funk, house and drum'n'bass (rather than rock) the order of the day.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

At night, it has an alternative feel drawing crowds from all areas. Two back rooms contain a great little restaurant. The curry nights on Wednesday and Thursday are popular. Small music venue, mostly showcasing live alternative bands. M-Su 11AM-late.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

Be aware that it has to close earlier than most places (usually midnight) due to residential noise restrictions.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡The Cumberland Arms♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;The Cumby&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;205 Waymouth St&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8231 3577 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;M 9AM-midnight, Tu 9AM-1AM, W-Th 9AM-3AM, F Sa 6PM-4AM, Su 6PM-2AM&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;In a strip of bars and clubs along the southern end of Light Square adjacent to Hindley St. The Cumberland was bought out and refurbished some years ago. Nowadays it's a cozy spot which does a good job of being all things to all people. The front bar areas conceal a dance floor within, where a DJ is invariably playing house, and an outdoor area around the side. The popularity of "The Cumby" is cyclic, but if it's not happening, one of the adjacent places will be.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡The Grace Emily♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;232 Waymouth St&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(♡❤Opposite "The Cumberland♡❤)&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8231 5500 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;The Grace has plenty of trinkets behind and around the bar to keep one's eyeballs busy whilst nursing a Coopers or bloody mary. Local, interstate and overseas bands play most nights. Every Monday night Billy Bob's BBQ Jam sees a variety of local bands strut their stuff to impress the crowd with 3 or 4 songs (though perhaps more by popular demand) whilst a sausage sizzle out the beer garden feeds the hordes - a highlight of an otherwise quiet evening in Adelaide.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡The Austral♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;205 Rundle St&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Rundle St. On the main street for shopping and nightlife in Adelaide, which is really the same long street as Hindley St but with a different name either side of King William Road, and the pedestrian only Rundle Mall in the middle. The Austral is the unofficial backpackers pub of choice.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡The Original Coopers Alehouse♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="nickname listing-alt"&gt;also known by the original name still on the front facade The Earl of Aberdeen&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;316 Pulteney St&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;10&amp;nbsp;minute walk from the Rundle St-Pulteney St intersection&lt;/bdi&gt;), &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8223 6433 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;The only pub to hold the complete range of Coopers beers on tap, including the Vintage Ale. Also serves good food, including schnitzels and pizzas, in the attached ♡❤♡Arnou Woodfired at the Earl♡❤♡ restaurant.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡The Stag♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;299 Rundle St&lt;/bdi&gt; (&lt;bdi class="listing-directions" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;cnr of Rundle and East Tce&lt;/bdi&gt;). &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;More up market establishment, with good views of the parklands from the al fresco seating, good range of drinks and weekly live music. The second floor balcony literally overlooked the old Formula 1 street circuit and was always crammed with race fans. With the shortened Clipsal 500 course this is no longer possible, but still a good place to go after the days races.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡The Union Hotel♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;70 Waymouth St Adelaide&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8231 2144 &lt;/bdi&gt; , &lt;abbr title="email" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;✉&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;span class="email listing-email"&gt; info@theunionhotel.com.au &lt;/span&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;Open most days 11:00-01:00&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Good value meals every night including cheap pizza night every Monday. On Friday nights the crazy is dialed up with Generation Pop, a mix of pop music from retro to modern and very popular with the after work crowd (7.30-1am). Saturdays is Get Back, Adelaide's only weekly retro dance club playing music from the 50s-80s (8pm-1am). Entry is free to both nights. Crowd is a healthy mix of ages, even after dark.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

First started life as a chilled out cocktail bar, but rapidly became popular as an after-work spot on Fridays, and could now also be filed under "clubs". On weekends they are packed out and play commercial house, but on weeknights it reverts to the original cocktail bar atmosphere.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Fumo Blu♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;270 Rundle St&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;abbr title="phone" style="text-decoration:none"&gt;☏&lt;/abbr&gt; &lt;bdi class="tel listing-phone"&gt; +61 8 8232 2533 &lt;/bdi&gt; . &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;Below ground cocktail lounge in the heart of Rundle St.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

Half-price cocktails Wednesday and Sunday 6-9PM.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

Live venue hosting international/interstate and local alternative indie acts. Also home to indie/alternative Modular nights and Abracadabra on Fridays. Open every weekend until late.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

It is easily Adelaide's largest club. The big nights are Saturday, where you'll hear mostly commercial house, with a little trance, and Wednesday, which is a retro night. Fridays can also be big, depending on what's on.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Jive♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;, &lt;bdi class="adr listing-address street-address"&gt;181 Hindley St&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-hours"&gt;Open every weekend and sometimes during the week.&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;300 capacity mainly live venue that hosts local and interstate rock/alternative/indie acts.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>

The Australia-wide emergency number is 000. The ambulance service, fire service and police are available through this number. For non-emergency police assistance, dial 131 444.

Adelaide is considered a safe city, and much more so than other Australian capitals. People should however exercise personal safety, particularly at night.

The city parklands are poorly lit and are best avoided after dark due to the presence of intoxicated people. If you need to cross the parklands to reach the suburbs, stay near the road. Catching a taxi or public transport is recommended at night.

Trains in Adelaide are generally reliable and arrive and depart on schedule. (Buses can be slightly more variable.) There are security guards on all trains after 7PM and many rail services have bus connections available.

At night, police actively patrol the city centre, especially Hindley Street, the latter being where many of the city's nightclubs and bars are. Taxi ranks are near the Adelaide Casino on North Terrace, the Hilton Adelaide Hotel on Victoria Square, and the junction of Rundle Street and Pulteney Street outside the Hungry Jacks fast food outlet. Most regular public transport services end before or at midnight, but special &lt;a href="http%3A//www.adelaidemetro.com.au/Timetables-Maps/Special-Services/After-Midnight-Services"&gt;After Midnight bus services&lt;/a&gt; operate Saturday night only, travelling from the city to brightly-lit points throughout Adelaide's suburbs.

<h2>Stay healthy</h2>

Adelaide's remote location in the world's driest continent means that all of its drinking water is sourced from the River Murray or local reservoirs. Although the water is perfectly safe to drink, it does make tap water unpalatable to those not used to it and is best drunk filtered.

<h2>Connect</h2>
There is extensive free Wi-Fi access (port 80 only) in the CBD and the airport provided by &lt;a href="http%3A//www.internode.on.net/coverage/"&gt;Internode&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Cope</h2>
<h3>Consulates</h3>
The Consulate for the &lt;a href="United%20Kingdom"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; has closed, therefore the British High Commission in &lt;a href="Canberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt; is the closest.

♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.southaustralia.com/adelaidehills.aspx"&gt;Adelaide Hills&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is in &lt;a href="South%20Australia"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It is an easy 30-minute drive from &lt;a href="Adelaide"&gt;Adelaide&lt;/a&gt; central business district. The highest point is Mount Lofty, 712 metres above sea level.

<h2>Understand</h2>
<h2>Other destinations</h2>

<h2>Get in</h2>

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.southlink.com.au/"&gt;Southlink&lt;/a&gt; operates services around the area, including bus services direct to Adelaide central bus station. The fares and timetables are integrated with the Adelaide services. Google Maps operates the trip planner service, and the fares and route details are on the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.adelaidemetro.com.au/"&gt;Adelaide Metro site&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Get around</h2>
The Hills is a challenge to drive around by car, with some inadequate signage and winding roads, but they are beautiful to drive. With a map you won't go to far in the wrong direction and no doubt have taken a scenic drive.

Public transport isn't great around the Hills, which is a shame given the fantastic wines of the region, however there are a couple of tour companies providing regular services.

BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span id="Q643818"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡Belair National Park♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;A national park of 835 ha, 11 km south of Adelaide City. Due to its history as a "recreation park", it has many good trails for bushwalking, as well as tennis courts and grassy areas available for hire, and a good adventure playground for children. Old Government House, the colony's first official vice-regal summer residence, is in the park. A vehicle entry fee applies to cars entering the park, or else its western parts can be accessed from the Belair line train, a 35-minute journey from Adelaide city. Gates open 8AM-sunset, except 25 Dec.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

Visitors can feed and wander at their leisure among kangaroos, wallabies, Emus and waterfowl. Displays of Dingoes, reptiles, Tasmanian Devils, Wombats, Echidnas and Koalas allow easy viewing access, or stroll through the aviaries.

Walkers can access the park from sunrise to sunset.&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;10 km (6&amp;nbsp;mi) north-east of the CBD, where the suburbs meet the Adelaide hills. It covers 533 ha (1,317 acres), and contains numerous walking trails of various levels of difficulty, including trails that pass by three major waterfalls, and provide panoramic views over Adelaide itself. There is a popular rock climbing area within the park and a giant cave. The waterfalls only flow in the winter months, and are usually completely dry by Christmas.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h1>Aden</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Aden♡❤♡ is a city in the &lt;a href="Yemeni%20Coastal%20Plains"&gt;Yemeni Coastal Plains&lt;/a&gt;, on the Gulf of Aden at the southern end of the Red Sea. It is a &lt;a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Site"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Aden has a long and complex history.
<ul>
BULLET::::- It was a major port on the &lt;a href="Maritime%20Silk%20Road"&gt;Maritime Silk Road&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="On%20the%20trail%20of%20Marco%20Polo"&gt;Marco Polo&lt;/a&gt; described it as a hub of commerce, where goods arriving by ship from the East were transferred to smaller boats for the trip up the Red Sea and on to Alexandria and Christendom.
BULLET::::- At one point it ruled a small empire, the part of Africa just across from it.
BULLET::::- In the 19th century, it became a British protectorate.
BULLET::::- It was the capital of South Yemen until Yemen was re-united in 1990.

</ul>
It is a very picturesque city with a mix of traditional Arabic and British influences. It was the capital of the liberal South, but it has been changing due to the take-over of the tribal forces of the North. For instance the Soviets banned head scarves for women and for decades, women were relatively emancipated and could carry out university degrees abundantly. Now, the scarves are back on the street. There is also notice a sizeable Somali minority (war refugees).

<h3>Climate</h3>
&lt;templatestyles src="Template:Climate/style.css" /&gt;

The city swelters through a desert climate all year round, with high temperatures and little to no rain.

<h2>Get in</h2>

Access to Aden is available by car, airplane and bus. Airfare from Sana'a on Yemenia, the national carrier, is around 10,000 rials or USD55. Buses are generally comfortable and the journey from Sana'a to Aden takes about 8 hours. A ticket costs ~1500 rials. Be prepared to show a travel permit (Tashrih) on military checkpoints. You can't leave capital Sanaa without it. It's good idea to have also few photocopies of your passport ready. If you travel to Aden or elsewhere in Yemen by plane, no travel permit is required.

There are direct flights to many cities in the Middle East. If you are flying in from outside the region, it will be necessary to transfer in Egypt, Jordan or the United Arab Emirates.

<h2>Get around</h2>

The different current options are:
<ul>
BULLET::::- private taxi
BULLET::::- collective taxi ("mer mer") - costing 40 rials from Tawahi to Crater or Sirah for instance (ask for colour codes if you speak Arabic), cheap and easy to use along common routes
BULLET::::- by foot - for any climbing and to complement many collective taxi trips.

</ul>
Taxis are practical, yet always bargain with the taxi driver before getting in. Otherwise, they have the tendency to get it done at their high price. If you know the city very well, you can use the mini-buses along with the public. The mini-buses are easy to use; they follow an essentially circular path around the city. Find someone familiar with the area to explain their route as the fare for the buses is around 30 rials, or roughly a tenth of the average taxi ride. There are also many boats that will take you whenever on a little cruise on the sea. 

Aden International Airport is accessible, yet if you are in Yemen it is better to drive there. You can also rent cars from international companies.

<h2>See</h2>
Sunsets, lagoons (for bird-watching), the Aden museum, Crater (including a shopping district), people, beach and reservoirs.

<h2>Do</h2>

<ul>
BULLET::::- snooker ("billiard")
BULLET::::- hanging out at fresh juice bars or small restaurants with kubz (giant pita bread)
BULLET::::- chewing betel (2 versions: tobacco, sweet). This causes cancer in the long-run, and also stains teeth and gums red. Tobacco version is very strong and spitting regularly is highly recommended. The sweet version is particularly tasty and doesn't induce the same urge to spit.
BULLET::::- chewing qat - the national past-time. This also causes cancer in the long-run; first-time use generally induces restlessness, insomnia and general mouth fatigue and aches
BULLET::::- climbing on the mountain tops for great views of the city (beware of the no trespassing zone and take abundant water and sun screening equipment)
BULLET::::- beach activities.

</ul>
Aden is especially known for the beautiful beaches and swimming activities. Besides this, Aden has the only considerable nightlife in Yemen, and foreigners can enjoy wonderful Arabian nights. 

Sport fishing: tunas and sharks can be hunted near the coast. 

A visit at the Gold Mohur Beach and Elephant Bay Hotel is a must. For women travelling alone, there is also a women-only beach at the Sheraton Hotel. Excellent snorkeling is available although not as clear as Sharm El-Sheikh.

<h1>Adirondacks</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

The ♡❤♡Adirondack Park♡❤♡ is both the largest and the first government-protected park in the &lt;a href="United%20States%20of%20America%23Geography"&gt;contiguous United States&lt;/a&gt;. It covers a vast expanse&amp;mdash;bigger than &lt;a href="New%20Hampshire"&gt;New Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;of rugged, thickly wooded, mountainous terrain in northeast &lt;a href="New%20York%20%28state%29"&gt;New York State&lt;/a&gt;. The Adirondacks are a popular destination for all lovers of outdoor activities, from hiking and skiing to ice and rock climbing.

<h2>Towns and villages</h2>
As the Adirondacks are for the most part protected parkland, there are no major cities. The strict restrictions on development do not apply within the various incorporated villages which were already extant at the time of the park's creation, but the largest of these settlements have no more than a few thousand permanent inhabitants.

<h3>History</h3>
Tourism to the Adirondacks was initially spurred by the 1849 publication of Joel Tyler Headley's ♡❤Adirondack; or, Life in the Woods♡❤ and by &lt;a href="rail%20travel%20in%20the%20United%20States"&gt;passenger rail travel&lt;/a&gt;. Thomas C. Durant's 1871 Adirondack Railway, the first of multiple lines into the region in an era of wildly-speculative rail construction, is now the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.sncrr.com"&gt;Saratoga and North Creek Railway&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href="heritage%20railways"&gt;heritage railway&lt;/a&gt;). Because of the relative ease by which rail brought &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Albany%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt;'s wealthy elite northward, by 1875 there were more than two hundred hotels in the Adirondacks and the well-to-do were building "Great Camps" along the lakefronts as recreational property. 

A Dr. Ed Trudeau, great-grandfather of ♡❤Doonesbury♡❤ cartoonist Garry Trudeau, opened a tuberculosis clinic (the Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium) in &lt;a href="Saranac%20Lake"&gt;Saranac Lake&lt;/a&gt; in 1884, believing the cold, clear mountain air of the region to aid in medical recovery. Hundreds of "cure cottages", houses with large, glass-enclosed porches where patients would take in the mountain air, were constructed in this era. Robert Louis Stevenson, author of 'Treasure Island' and 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde', spent the winter of 1887-88 in Saranac Lake writing 'The Master of Ballantrae.' Sixty-three of the cottages still remain on the National Register of Historic Places, although the introduction of suitable antibiotics in the mid-1940s largely eradicated tuberculosis a decade later.

In the immediate post-&lt;a href="Civil%20War"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; era, logging caused extensive deforestation in the southern Adirondacks, with the topsoil runoff fed directly into the &lt;a href="Hudson%20Valley"&gt;Hudson River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Erie%20Canal"&gt;Erie Canal&lt;/a&gt; watersheds. Adirondack Park was created by &lt;a href="New%20York%20State"&gt;New York State&lt;/a&gt; in 1892 to protect key natural resources, including freshwater and timber. Waterways which fed from the park into the &lt;a href="Erie%20Canal"&gt;Erie Canal&lt;/a&gt; system and to the Hudson were seen as vital to the continued contribution of the canal to New York's commercial shipping industry. The Adirondack Forest Preserve (the part of the Adirondack Park under state control) was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1963 and attracts several million visitors annually.

<h3>Landscape</h3>

The Adirondack region is mountainous with about three thousand small lakes, many streams and extensive old-growth forests. Forty-two of the 46 Adirondack High Peaks are above 4,000 feet (1,219 m), with the remaining four (Blake Peak, Cliff Mountain, Nye Mountain and Couchsachraga Peak) just under four thousand feet in height. Whiteface Mountain, near Wilmington and Lake Placid, served as a winter Olympic ski venue in 1980; in summer, a trail is open for mountain biking.

<h3>Flora and fauna</h3>
There are 53 known species of mammals in the park; various attempts have been made (with varying success) to introduce or re-introduce beaver, elk, fishers, American marten, moose, Canadian lynx and ospreys. Deer are plentiful. Hawks, owls, fox and weasels have been known to prey upon many species desired by hunters. Wolves and cougars also prey upon other species in the park.

Hunting and fishing are allowed in some portions of the Adirondack Park, but are strictly regulated. Some portions are protected from human encroachment as wilderness areas.

<h3>Climate</h3>
Climate during the winter months can be severe, with temperatures occasionally falling below −30°F. The air is cold and clear.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By car</h3>
From &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;NYC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Albany%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Montr%C3%A9al"&gt;Montréal&lt;/a&gt;: The main route along the eastern edge of the Adirondacks is Interstate 87, commonly known as "the Northway." There are no tolls north of Albany on I-87; the highway continues north through Montréal (as Autoroute 15) into the Laurentians. The Northway has beautiful views of the mountains, but limited services north of Lake George.

From &lt;a href="North%20Country"&gt;Northern New York&lt;/a&gt;: From &lt;a href="Watertown%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Watertown&lt;/a&gt;, take NY 3 (Arsenal Street, Watertown's main street) through the park to &lt;a href="Saranac%20Lake"&gt;Saranac Lake&lt;/a&gt;. It's also possible to reach the park from the north side by taking US 11 to &lt;a href="Malone%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Malone&lt;/a&gt;, then turning south on NY 30.

From &lt;a href="Utica"&gt;Utica&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Rome%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt;: NY 28 runs north into the park from &lt;a href="Herkimer"&gt;Herkimer&lt;/a&gt;; to pick up NY 28 from Utica use NY 12 northbound, from Rome use NY 365.

From &lt;a href="Vermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt;: The Green Mountain State is largely separated from the Adirondacks by Lake Champlain. This usually means crossing by ferry, but there is a Lake Champlain Bridge between the Chimney Point state historic site (on VT 17) and the &lt;a href="Crown%20Point%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Crown Point&lt;/a&gt; historic area (in the park, on NY 185). Another option is to head south and miss the lake entirely (so Fairhaven and &lt;a href="Rutland%20%28Vermont%29"&gt;Rutland&lt;/a&gt; VT to &lt;a href="Lake%20George"&gt;Lake George&lt;/a&gt; is overland). Traffic originating at the northernmost edge of the state (St. Albans, Jay Peak) takes the US 2 bridge at the north end of the lake to &lt;a href="Champlain%20and%20Rouses%20Point"&gt;Champlain and Rouses Point&lt;/a&gt;, then follows I-87 or US-9 through Plattsburgh to the park.

<h3>By bus</h3>
There is limited &lt;a href="http%3A//trailwaysny.com"&gt;Trailways&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="intercity%20bus%20travel%20in%20the%20US"&gt;bus service&lt;/a&gt; from Rochester, Syracuse and Albany to points north including Keene Valley, Lake Placid, Tupper Lake and Plattsburgh.

<h3>By train</h3>
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.amtrak.com"&gt;Amtrak's&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ aptly named ♡❤Adirondack♡❤ train runs between &lt;a href="Montreal"&gt;Montreal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and Penn Station in &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Stops in-region include Port Kent (seasonal, Burlington VT ferry dock), &lt;a href="Westport%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Westport&lt;/a&gt; (connection to &lt;a href="Lake%20Placid"&gt;Lake Placid&lt;/a&gt; bus), Port Henry, &lt;a href="Ticonderoga"&gt;Ticonderoga&lt;/a&gt; and Whitehall. The train leaves Montreal at 9:30AM daily, and New York at 8:30AM. The trip takes approximately 10&amp;nbsp;hours but expect delays at the border. It used to be one of the most delayed in the whole Amtrak system, but recently some of the issues causing delays have been addressed, notably improving on-time performance.

<h3>By boat</h3>
The main Plattsburgh-Burlington ferry crossing runs from Grande Isle VT (west of Colchester across the US 2 bridge) directly to Plattsburgh; from there, take I-87/US-9 south to the park. 

There are also Vermont/Lake Champlain ferry crossings within the park:
<ul>
BULLET::::- A ferry crosses from &lt;a href="Burlington%20%28Vermont%29"&gt;Burlington (Vermont)&lt;/a&gt; to Port Kent, near &lt;a href="Keeseville"&gt;Keeseville&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::- A ferry crosses from Charlotte VT to &lt;a href="Essex%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Essex (New York)&lt;/a&gt;
BULLET::::- A ferry crosses from Larrabees VT to &lt;a href="Ticonderoga"&gt;Ticonderoga&lt;/a&gt;

</ul>
<h3>By plane</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="http%3A//www.capeair.com"&gt;Cape Air&lt;/a&gt; provides subsidised Essential Air Service twice-daily to &lt;a href="Saranac%20Lake"&gt;Saranac Lake&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt; and a similar service to &lt;a href="Plattsburgh"&gt;Plattsburgh&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- Additional flights are available in Burlington, &lt;a href="Montreal/West%20Island"&gt;Montréal-Dorval&lt;/a&gt; and Albany.

</ul>
<h2>Fees and permits</h2>

Except for improved public campgrounds, there is no fee to camp or travel on state land.

It is illegal to transport untreated firewood more than 50 miles from its source. Local firewood can easily be found in roadside stands and convenience stores. Retailers include a slip of paper documenting the source of the firewood. Without this proof, your firewood may be seized.

<h2>Get around</h2>
<h3>By car</h3>
Interstate 87 runs along the Eastern edge of this area, following a similar path to its predecessor, US Highway 9. NY 30 enters the park from Malone in the north. Access to most of the park is via two-lane New York State highways. 

NY 86 joins Lake Placid to Saranac Lake, from which NY 3 goes to I-87 in the east or I-81 &lt;a href="Watertown%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Watertown&lt;/a&gt; in the west.

The main roads around the High Peaks region are Route 73 to the north and east which runs through Lake Placid, routes 3 and 30 through Tupper Lake to the west, and route 28N and Boreas road to the South. Fuel stations are available about every 20&amp;nbsp;miles in these areas.

<h3>By train</h3>
The &lt;a href="http%3A//adirondackrr.com"&gt;Adirondack Scenic Railroad&lt;/a&gt; runs a &lt;a href="tourist%20trains"&gt;tourist train&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="Lake%20Placid"&gt;Lake Placid&lt;/a&gt; to nearby &lt;a href="Saranac%20Lake"&gt;Saranac Lake&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a train in &lt;a href="Old%20Forge"&gt;Old Forge&lt;/a&gt;.

<h3>By boat</h3>

&lt;a href="Cruising%20on%20small%20craft"&gt;Cruising on small craft&lt;/a&gt; is permitted on most of the larger lakes such as Lakes George, Champlain, Raquette, Tupper, Indian, Schroon, and Blue Mountain Lake. Hundreds of smaller lakes, ponds, and streams provide canoe routes of varying length, but not all are open to motorised vessels.

Boat tours are available on &lt;a href="Lake%20George"&gt;Lake George&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>See</h2>
Local museums include the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.adkmuseum.org"&gt;Adirondack Museum&lt;/a&gt; and store in &lt;a href="Blue%20Mountain%20Lake"&gt;Blue Mountain Lake&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hydecollection.org"&gt;Hyde Collection Art Museum&lt;/a&gt; and Historic House in Glens Falls (near &lt;a href="Lake%20George"&gt;Lake George&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.wildcenter.org"&gt;Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Tupper%20Lake"&gt;Tupper Lake&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.adirondackvic.org"&gt;Paul Smith's College&lt;/a&gt; Visitor Interpretive Centre in the hamlet of Paul Smiths (near &lt;a href="Saranac%20Lake"&gt;Saranac Lake&lt;/a&gt;).

In Lake Placid, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.nysparks.com/historic-sites/29/details.aspx"&gt;John Browns Farm State Historic Site&lt;/a&gt; preserves the last home and burial site of a famed &lt;a href="Underground%20Railroad"&gt;abolitionist&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.lakeplacidhistory.com/"&gt;North Elba Historical Society Museum&lt;/a&gt; (in the former New York Central rail terminal) and a &lt;a href="http%3A//www.whiteface.com/activities/lake-placid-olympic-museum"&gt;Winter Olympic Museum&lt;/a&gt; (in the Olympic centre) recall sporting history and the 1932 &amp; 1980 Lake Placid winter games.

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.fortticonderoga.org"&gt;Fort Ticonderoga&lt;/a&gt;, an 18th century &lt;a href="France"&gt;French&lt;/a&gt; fortress which overlooks Lake Champlain from &lt;a href="Ticonderoga"&gt;Ticonderoga&lt;/a&gt;, offers tours, historic galleries, walking trails and gardens for visitors.

<h2>Do</h2>

The region is famous for winter sports, particularly downhill skiing. &lt;a href="Lake%20Placid"&gt;Lake Placid&lt;/a&gt; is in the unusual position of having hosted not one but two Winter Olympiads, in 1932 and again in 1980. The Olympic ski competition took place at Whiteface Mountain, near &lt;a href="Wilmington%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Wilmington (New York)&lt;/a&gt; and other Olympic facilities can be found in Lake Placid.

The many huge, open spaces appeal to outdoorspeople, where the many lakes and streams draw fishermen, canoeists and nature lovers.

Live theatre venues include the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.atfestival.org"&gt;Adirondack Theatre Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Glens Falls, the &lt;a href="http%3A//www.pendragontheatre.org"&gt;Pendragon Theatre&lt;/a&gt; in Saranac Lake, the &lt;a href="http%3A//depottheatre.org"&gt;Depot Theatre&lt;/a&gt; at the Westport rail station and the &lt;a href="https%3A//www.lakeplacidarts.org/performances/theatre"&gt;Lake Placid Center for the Arts&lt;/a&gt;, a year-round performing and visual arts facility.

Sightseeing tours are available on lake boats in &lt;a href="Old%20Forge"&gt;Old Forge&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Buy</h2>

Various traditional crafts and rustic wooden furnishings are manufactured in the region.

The ♡❤♡Adirondack chair♡❤♡, originally a "Westport plank chair" designed by Thomas Lee in &lt;a href="Westport%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Westport&lt;/a&gt;, New York in 1903 and patented by carpenter Harry Bunnell in 1905, is simple in design. One plank of hemlock, pine or cedar is cut into eleven pieces and assembled onto a simple wooden frame as a distinctive outdoor chair which tilts slightly back. The patents for the chairs, popular among cottagers, have long expired; woodworkers in many faraway places (including a few Amish communities) have readily adopted the basic designs. While there have been endless knockoffs, ranging from &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;'s "&lt;a href="Muskoka"&gt;Muskoka&lt;/a&gt; furniture" of similar construction to the mass-market composite, resin or recycled plastic imitations which turn up at hardware and lumber dealers nationwide, some of the original wooden chairs are still made in the region and shipped far and wide.

As the handful of villages within the park boundary are small (typically fewer than 5000 people each), most of the local merchants are small independents. The closest major shopping mall is the Champlain Centre in &lt;a href="Plattsburgh"&gt;Plattsburgh&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Eat</h2>
As fish and game are abundant, culinary options can be as local as smoked venison, roast duck, and fresh rainbow or brook trout caught in the Adirondacks and cooked over an open camp fire. Locally-harvested maple syrup can also be had in season.

Conversely, everything from Asian or Italian cuisine to Tex-Mex can be had from various local restaurants in the villages. The area around &lt;a href="Saranac%20Lake"&gt;Saranac Lake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Lake%20Placid"&gt;Lake Placid&lt;/a&gt;, once the home of the "Great Camps" of &lt;a href="New%20York%20City"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;'s wealthy and powerful elites, offers various opportunities for fine waterfront dining and eateries in all price ranges.

<h2>Drink</h2>
Food and drink establishments are plentiful in the various small villages within the park boundary. There are a few &lt;a href="http%3A//visitadirondacks.com/attractions/breweries-and-wineries"&gt;wineries&lt;/a&gt;, microbreweries and cider makers in the region, as well as a distillery.

<h2>Sleep</h2>
Get a tent, sleep almost anywhere.

<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;bdi class="vcard"&gt; &lt;bdi class="listing-name"&gt;♡❤♡NYS DEC Campgrounds♡❤♡&lt;/bdi&gt;. &lt;bdi class="note listing-content"&gt;The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation runs a few dozen campgrounds scattered throughout the park. Reservations may be required, especially during peak season and holidays.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;~$20 a night, with a $5 nightly surcharge for out of state visitors&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

</ul>
Another option is to stay in any of the villages within the park boundary, which typically offer the full standard range of accommodations from bed and breakfast or small independent motels or hotels to the name-brand chains or the luxury lakeside resorts around Lake Placid, Lake George, Saranac Lake, Old Forge, Schroon Lake and the St. Regis Lakes.

<h2>Stay safe</h2>
There is very little crime in the Adirondacks. Still, be vigilant when driving alone at night on back roads. Think twice before stopping the car for strangers on the road. As anywhere, the road conditions can be dangerous in the winter months. In all seasons, be on the lookout for deer on the road.

The most common problem is travelers going into the wilderness without proper experience or equipment. There is prevalent wildlife throughout the Adirondacks, and interactions between humans and wild animals are common.

In some areas, bear resistant canisters are required. Check the areas where you are staying to see if this is the case.

<h2>Go next</h2>
One can take a ferry across Lake Champlain to get to &lt;a href="Burlington%20%28Vermont%29"&gt;Burlington&lt;/a&gt;, a lively college town and the biggest city in &lt;a href="Vermont"&gt;Vermont&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href="Central%20New%20York"&gt;Central New York&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="North%20Country"&gt;North Country&lt;/a&gt; are also nearby, as is &lt;a href="Saratoga%20Springs"&gt;Saratoga Springs&lt;/a&gt;. To the south, the &lt;a href="Erie%20Canal"&gt;Erie Canal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="American%20Industry%20Tour"&gt;American Industry Tour&lt;/a&gt; both pass through the &lt;a href="Albany%20%28New%20York%29"&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; state capital region.

One could also continue northwest into the &lt;a href="Thousand%20Islands"&gt;Thousand Islands&lt;/a&gt; or north into &lt;a href="Canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="Montr%C3%A9al"&gt;Montréal&lt;/a&gt; is relatively easy to reach from &lt;a href="Plattsburgh"&gt;Plattsburgh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Ottawa"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="Gatineau"&gt;Gatineau&lt;/a&gt; less than an hour's drive from &lt;a href="Ogdensburg"&gt;Ogdensburg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="Algonquin%20Park"&gt;Algonquin Park&lt;/a&gt; is the closest provincial park of comparable size and scale.

<h1>Adra</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Adra♡❤♡ is a town in &lt;a href="Almeria"&gt;Almeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Andaluc%C3%ADa"&gt;Andalucía&lt;/a&gt;, in southern &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Adra is easily accessible on the A-7 by road. Buses come from &lt;a href="Almeria"&gt;Almeria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Malaga"&gt;Malaga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Granada%20%28Spain%29"&gt;Granada&lt;/a&gt;, and most other large towns in &lt;a href="Andaluc%C3%ADa"&gt;Andalucía&lt;/a&gt;.

The nearest train station is in &lt;a href="Almeria"&gt;Almeria&lt;/a&gt; and has connections to &lt;a href="Madrid"&gt;Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Barcelona"&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of &lt;a href="Spain"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.

The nearest large international airport is in Malaga, but there is a smaller airport that has limited flights in Almeria city.

<h2>Get around</h2>

<h2>See</h2>

<h2>Do</h2>
♡❤♡Beaches♡❤♡ 
Adra has 3 beaches. Poniente is located west of the harbor, and is the largest of the three. San Nicolas and Censo are located east of the harbor and extend to the town limit. There is a nice walking/biking path along all three beaches.

<h2>Buy</h2>

<h2>Eat</h2>
Tapas are the name of the game in Adra. With about a dozen tapas bars, one is bound to find something they like. Seafood is the speciality and foods like octopus and mussels are not to be missed. As with the rest of &lt;a href="Almeria"&gt;Almeria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Granada%20%28Spain%29"&gt;Granada&lt;/a&gt; the tapas are always free.

Restaurants are almost non existent in Adra. The couple that are available tend to be overpriced.

<h2>Drink</h2>
Most tapas bars are located on Paseo de los Tristes in the center of town. There are a couple tapas bars dispersed through the rest of the town, although most are found relatively near or on the beachfront.

<h2>Sleep</h2>

For all intents and purposes it is a four star beachfront resort that caters to mostly package tourist groups. Rooms are very modern and all have a balcony facing the beach. Breakfast is included in room rates. Despite being the only option, this is a great hotel to stay at.&lt;/bdi&gt; &lt;bdi class="note listing-price"&gt;&lt;abbr title=" €60 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€60&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;.&lt;/bdi&gt;

<h1>Adrar des Ifoghas</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

The ♡❤♡Adrar des Ifoghas♡❤♡ is a large plateau in the eastern &lt;a href="Kidal%20%28region%29"&gt;Kidal&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href="Mali"&gt;Mali&lt;/a&gt; covering roughly 250 000 square kilometers. Adrar is the Tamasheq word for mountain while Ifoghas is the name of a Tuareg clan which lives in the region, the French so named it to differentiate from their (long-held) Adrar in Mauritania. The area is home to a surprising number of animals, including gazelles, antelopes, hyenas, jackals, snakes, &amp; lizards. It contains some very scenic desert landscapes, including granite outcrops, eroded sandstone, gueltas (similar to an oasis, but less "green" around them), rock paintings, petrified wood, and even an ancient river valley.

<h2>Understand</h2>

The Adrar des Ifoghas is a remote part of the Sahara with plenty of remnants to evoke its ancient, non-desert past.
<h3>Settlements</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Abeibara &amp;mdash;
BULLET::::- Aguelhok &amp;mdash;
BULLET::::- Essouk &amp;mdash; called by some the "cradle of the Tuareg" this tiny town was once a prospering town along trans-Saharan trade routes from the 9th to 12th cneturies; rock painting dating to 8000 BC can be found, although little remains of its ancient past. Legend holds that Boctou, founder of Timbuktu, was born here.
BULLET::::- Tessalit, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.tessalit.info/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a town of a couple thousand Tuareg which serves as the border post for the small amount of traffic between Mali &amp; Algeria; the town has some gypsum and ancient salt mines.
BULLET::::- Tin-Essako &amp;mdash;

</ul>
<h2>Get in/around</h2>
The only way into the region is via 4x4 (although Tessalit has a rarely used airstrip). Given the remoteness of the region, it is best to hire a guide who has an understanding of the region and knows where all the main sights are. Trips can be organized out of &lt;a href="Kidal"&gt;Kidal&lt;/a&gt;, you best bet to find one is inquiring at the hotels: Mount Krutel (285 00 90), Hotel Campement les Dattiers, or Chez Catharine. Two Tuareg-run travel agencies can be found in Kidal:

BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Rock paintings♡❤♡ &amp;mdash;

</ul>
<h2>Do</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- ♡❤♡Camel treks♡❤♡ &amp;mdash;

</ul>
<h2>Eat</h2>
Bring all the food you will need, as food cannot be purchased outside Kidal. If you stay in a settlement for a night, you may be offered (or can possibly pay for) a meal with a Tuareg family.

<h2>Drink</h2>
The Tuareg are Muslim and it would be very insulting of you to bring alcohol! Having three cups of tea with a Tuareg is a classic experience and not to be missed. As for water, bring all the water you will need! The settlements have wells and there are some large gueltas to replenish your water supply, though.

<h2>Sleep</h2>
<h2>Stay safe</h2>
Do not underestimate the remoteness!!! You must have proper supplies for an extended trip into the desert, about a week is necessary to travel from Kidal and spend a few days exploring...best to bring two weeks' worth of supplies in case you get lost or caught in a dust storm. Independent travel is highly discouraged and a guide and 4x4 is absolutely essential.

When camping (and sleeping) be sure your tent is entirely sealed as most animals, including venomous snakes and scorpions along with hyenas &amp; jackals, are nocturnal. Be very careful when climbing around rocks and any place that is shady and cool, as these are the places snakes, scorpions, and other animals stay cool during the day. The sand viper buries itself entirely so that only the eyes appear above the sand, while there is a species of scorpion whose venom is more deadly than a cobra! Try to trod heavily to avoid stepping on a viper!

♡❤♡Adrian♡❤♡ is a county seat of &lt;a href="Lenawee%20County"&gt;Lenawee County&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>

Adrian was founded on June 18, 1826 as ♡❤♡Logan♡❤♡ by Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad promoter Addison Comstock. His wife renamed it to its current name after Roman Emperor Hadrian. Even though it shaped up to be one of the motor capitals of the world from 1900 to 1912, it failed due to one company making bad financial decisions and the other to a fire at its plant. However, J. Wallace Page invented the first successful wire fence, making Adrian known from the late 1800s to the early 1900s as the ♡❤♡fence capital of the world♡❤♡ with one of the world's first fencing manufacturers.

<h1>Adrian (Texas)</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.oldhamcofc.org/index.php%3Fpage%3Dmidpoint-of-route-66"&gt;Adrian&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ is an incorporated city in the &lt;a href="Texas%20Panhandle"&gt;Texas Panhandle&lt;/a&gt; with a population of about 140. The tiny city promotes itself as the "Midpoint of &lt;a href="Route%2066"&gt;Route 66&lt;/a&gt;", a highway which once led from &lt;a href="Chicago"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Santa%20Monica"&gt;Santa Monica&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Adrian is in Oldham County, approximately 14 miles from &lt;a href="Vega%20%28Texas%29"&gt;Vega (Texas)&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Get in</h2>

Access is by highway. Adrian is on Route 66, a once-famous US Highway which was bypassed long ago by Interstate 40. In the Texas Panhandle, the old road still exists in the individual towns as "Interstate 40 BUS" but otherwise was "upgraded in place" (or replaced) by mainline I-40.

<h1>Adrogué</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
&lt;a href="http%3A//www.almirantebrown.gov.ar/turismo/adrogue"&gt;♡❤♡Adrogué♡❤♡&lt;/a&gt; is a city and capital of the ♡❤♡Almirante Brown♡❤♡ partido (district) in &lt;a href="Buenos%20Aires%20%28province%29"&gt;Buenos Aires (province)&lt;/a&gt; Province in &lt;a href="Argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
Adrogué is located 23&amp;nbsp;km south of the &lt;a href="Buenos%20Aires"&gt;City of Buenos Aires&lt;/a&gt;. With slightly more than 30,000 inhabitants, it stands out as a distinguished residential area, with numerous cobbled streets, lush trees and several squares. In addition, it has an important commercial center, with a variety of shops and bank entities, and a shopping mall.

The best seasons of the year to visit Adrogué are the spring and the summer, because the city looks really green. The lush trees cast some sort of an arcade over the streets, which makes a beautiful picture. The stillness and peacefulness of the city are an ideal contrast for the chaotic downtown.

Adrogué is not a common tourist destination, but it's worth a visit. The place is safe, but traveling to and from downtown after midnight is just not nice.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By train</h3>
Getting in by train is the easiest way to make your way to Adrogué if you're coming from the City of Buenos Aires. From the ♡❤Constitución♡❤ train station, you should take a train going either to stations ♡❤Glew♡❤ or ♡❤Alejandro Korn♡❤ (normally leaving from either platform 4 or 5). You can get from Downtown Buenos Aires to Constitución using the C line of the subway (subte).

A one-way ticket from Constitución to Adrogué costs ARS&amp;nbsp;0.70 (about USD&amp;nbsp;0.20) and a return ticket costs ARS&amp;nbsp;1.40 (about USD&amp;nbsp;0.40).

The trip from Constitución to Adrogué takes 28 minutes (it may take longer in the rush hour). Adrogué is the ninth station from Constitución. The order of the stations is: Constitución - Hipólito Yrigoyen - Avellaneda - Gerli - Lanús - Remedios de Escalada - Banfield - Lomas de Zamora - Temperley - Adrogué.

The first train from Constitución to either Glew or Alejandro Korn leaves at around 5 am and the last train from Adrogué to Constitución leaves at around midnight.

It is not recommended to travel by train as it is usually crowded, and security and cleanliness on the coaches are poor.

<h3>By bus</h3>
Buses in Argentina are called ♡❤colectivos♡❤. The bus will usually take longer than the train because it makes more detours. However, this will depend on the traffic. The advantage is that buses normally run around the clock.

Near Constitución station you can take any bus 79 except the one which goes to San José (it takes a different route and don't make it to Adrogué).

From Correo Central, close to the Pink House, you can take bus 74.

Bus 160 will also take you to Adrogué from Ciudad Universitaria (UBA campus), Palermo or Jorge Newbery Airport (Aeroparque).

In all cases, you should ask the driver to tell you where to get off.

The ticket costs ARS&amp;nbsp;1.35 (about USD&amp;nbsp;0.40) and can only be paid with coins (no banknotes!). Remember to get some before taking the bus.

Getting to Adrogué by bus may take from 1h15min to 1h30min.

<h3>By Van</h3>
Vans are often called ♡❤Combis♡❤ in Argentina. There is a private Combi service traversing from Teatro Colón in the City of Buenos Aires to Adrogué and beyond. The trip usually costs ARS&amp;nbsp;9.00 (about USD&amp;nbsp;2.25) and is by far the most comfortable way to travel.

The trip takes about 1h, and may take up to 1h30min during rush hours. It is also possible to reserve your place in advance.
- Adrogue Bus (Shuttle Company): 4293-5309

<h3>By taxi</h3>
A taxi from the City of Buenos Aires (from the Obelisk, for example) to Adrogué costs about ARS&amp;nbsp;80 (about USD&amp;nbsp;20). This is a good option if you're visiting Adrogué in a group of 3 or 4 people. The trip may take from 50 minutes to 1h15min depending on traffic conditions.

<h3>By car</h3>
You can go from the Obelisco in Buenos Aires to Adrogué taking 9 de Julio avenue to the south, then 9 de Julio Sur freeway, and taking Pavón/Yrigoyen avenue. Adrogué starts approximately at 12.500 Yrigoyen avenue.

<h2>See</h2>
If you are interested in architecture, you'll like the houses in Adrogué. Some nice-looking houses are on Seguí street, for example.

Some of Adrogué's earliest residences are still preserved. They were usually built in French, Italian or English style, and they served as summer houses for many of Buenos Aires wealthiest families between 1870 and 1930. Some of the best examples are the Adrogué Tennis Club, former residence of city founder Esteban Adrogué (Macías &amp; Sánchez streets), the St. Michael's School (Uriburu street &amp; St. Michael's alley)and the former Aráoz Castex residence (Seguí &amp; Avellaneda streets), among others.

There are many parks and squares. Some squares are actually rotaries. The main square is Plaza Brown. The town hall, the church of Saint Gabriel, and a religious school (Colegio del Carmen) are located opposite to it. Connected to it by diagonals are the Bynnon, Espora, Cerreti and Bouchard squares. The square next to the train station is Plaza San Martín.

In the commercial area there's the so-called House of Culture (♡❤Casa de la Cultura♡❤), with different expositions and plays.

The Boulevard shopping mall is located in Adrogué. You can get there with bus 318 (will leave you close to it) or by taxi (♡❤remise♡❤).

Its name comes from the first owner of these lands, Juan Glew. In 1905, Santa Ana Chapel was inaugurated. At the same time, in Buenos Aires, Raul Soldi was born. He would be one of the most known Argentinean plastic artists. This story began in the early 1950s, when Soldi arrived in the town and immediately loved its quiet streets, with only a few sulkies coming and going from time to time. Shortly after he bought a weekend house where he stayed during the summers. There he met Santa Ana Chapel which was built by Pablo Regazzoni in neoclassical style. It had a double bell tower, with a brick facade, a gable roof, white walls covered with lime and wooden saints. This motivated the painter to give it color and paint different figures. So, since 1953 he worked during 23 summers with the frescoes renaissance technique. First, he prepared the walls and then he applied paint with a spatula. He finished one series of 13 frescoes that showed Virgin Maria’s life. A curiosity is that it’s possible to recognize some places or landscapes, and some people from he town, for example the place where the Virgin was born was the yard of a house near the temple. You can also discover the windmills, the village library and even the façade of the chapel. Above, where the choir stans, is the figure of the poet friar and next to him the parish priest and the altar boy of that time. Santa Cecilia, who is sitting on the organ, is the girl who sang on Sunday Mass. Other figures represent the friend of the teacher’s wife, through whom he met the town, and the person who cleaned the place. Santa Ana is a known neighbor who sang at the church choir. The paintings have been restored and they are well preserved. Later he bought a second and a third house where the Soldi Fundation works today. Here you can find 60 works, oil paintings, drawings and engravings that he donated in life. Daniel Soldi, the artist’s son, is in charge of the foundation.&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;span class="listing-sister-icons"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/bdi&gt;

Adygea is one of a few fully enclaved Russian Federation regions (the only other ones are the cities of &lt;a href="Moscow"&gt;Moscow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Saint%20Petersburg"&gt;Saint Petersburg&lt;/a&gt;). All its territory is surrounded by neighboring &lt;a href="Krasnodar%20Krai"&gt;Krasnodar Krai&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Get in</h2>
Direct buses from Krasnodar bus station, 170 RUR, 2.5 hours.

Intercity buses from many other cities in Krasnodar krai, nearby regions and even from Moscow. Buses are very old and in poor condition, no air conditioning. Use trains if possible, especially in summer.

A number of trains (from Moscow etc.) stop at Belorechenskaya station, where bus and local train connections to Maykop are available.

Fast local train from Adler/Sochi goes once per day, scenic sea views between Sochi and Tuapse, 700 RUR first class, 650 RUR 2nd, timetable (stand 10.2011): Maykop 5.50 - Sochi 11.30, Sochi 17.05 - Maykop 22.45.

<h1>Aegadian Islands</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;
The ♡❤♡&lt;a href="http%3A//www.egadiweb.it/"&gt;Aegadian Islands&lt;/a&gt;♡❤♡ or ♡❤♡Egadi Islands♡❤♡ (Italian: ♡❤Isole Egadi♡❤) are a group of three islands about 10&amp;nbsp;km west of &lt;a href="Trapani"&gt;Trapani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Marsala"&gt;Marsala&lt;/a&gt; on the north-western coast of &lt;a href="Sicily"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Understand</h2>
<h3>Islands</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Favignana – the main island, well known for its beaches
BULLET::::- Levanzo – small, quiet and pretty
BULLET::::- Marettimo – the furthest from Sicily, with fewer boats; attractive and good for walks

</ul>
<h2>Get in</h2>

<h3>By boat</h3>

&lt;a href="http%3A//www.siremar.it/"&gt;Siremar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usticalines.it/en/default.asp"&gt;Ustica Lines&lt;/a&gt; (+39 0923 873813) run car ferries and much quicker hydrofoils from &lt;a href="Trapani"&gt;Trapani&lt;/a&gt; to all three islands – lots in summer, with fewer during spring, autumn and winter and on Sundays. Ustica ferries also run from &lt;a href="Marsala"&gt;Marsala&lt;/a&gt; to Favignana and Marettimo. The first ferries leave for Favignana between 7:00 and 7:30AM. The last ferry departs Favignana for Trapani at 20:00. The last ferry to Marsala leaves at 17:00. Tickets can be purchased from kiosks at the port. Arrive early for the evening return ferries, particularly on the weekends, as they sell out at times. Fares are between &lt;abbr title=" €5 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€5&lt;/abbr&gt; and &lt;abbr title=" €9 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€9&lt;/abbr&gt; each way.

Several operators run all-day excursions to the islands from Trapani. Typically they visit two islands, giving you time to spend on the islands, and stops in bays where you can swim off the boat, with lunch provided on board. Prices are around &lt;abbr title=" €39 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€39&lt;/abbr&gt; for excursions to Favignana and Levanzo, and &lt;abbr title=" €45 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€45&lt;/abbr&gt; to Favignana and Marettimo. The boats leave from the part of Trapani port between Via XXX Gennaio and Via Rallo and you can buy tickets there or at other outlets around the old town. To be sure of getting a ticket at busy times, you might want to book the day before.

<h2>Get around</h2>
Levanzo and Marettimo are small enough to walk around. Most people hire bikes on Favignana to get to the beaches on the south coast.

<h1>Aegean Turkey</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

♡❤♡Aegean Turkey♡❤♡ (♡❤Ege Bölgesi♡❤) is in &lt;a href="Turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;. It occupies the western part of the country, including the western coast (Aegean Sea coast) across from a wide arch of Greek islands and some places more inland.

<h2>Regions</h2>
 

<h2>Cities</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; Turkey’s third biggest city, and a beautiful coastal one. Undeniably the capital of the region.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — pleasant village with preserved architecture and impressive Temple of Athena overlooking the Aegean
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — a pleasant town in the north with distinctlively Greek/neo-classical architecture everywhere.
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — located near the ruins of the ancient city of Pergamon
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — nice and trendy resort known for its castle and/or “foam parties”
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — town on the westernmost tip of Turkey
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — unspoilt town with the nearby ancient city of Knidos forming the boundary between Aegean and Mediterranean
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — inland city serving as a hub to Roman sites such as Pamukkale, Hierapolis, Aphrodisias in southeastern Aegean Region
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — a resort town with the citadel on an island. Has a large harbour used by ships cruising around Mediterranean

</ul>
<h2>Other destinations</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — great ruins of an ancient city founded in honour of the goddess of love
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — perhaps the wildest stretch of land on the Turkish Aegean coast, with its lush forests, hiking trails, and desolate beaches, this is a great get-away from concrete sprawls of resorts
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — the best preserved of the ancient cities in Turkey, Ephesus was once the capital of Roman province of Asia Minor
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — the "cotton castle", the white world of travertines
BULLET::::- &lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — the ruins of the capital of the Lydians, the inventors of "money", backed by the craggy Mt. Tmolos

</ul>
<h2>Understand</h2>
Aegean coast of Turkey is lined by a succession of modern cities with palm-lined avenues and liberal attitudes, towns with old quarters that are filled with elegant turn of the 20th century neo-classical architecture, and ruins of what were once major powers of the Mediterranean in ancient times; all backed by fertile valleys and hills, sides of which are dotted with picturesque villages and large oliveyards—which help to make Turkey one of the biggest producers of olive oil in the world. It's little wonder that much of ancient art and philosophy—from Aristotle to Homer, many were citizens of cities along this coast—was developed in this land of wine and honey, which has a favourable climate year round.

During the &lt;a href="Roman%20Empire"&gt;Roman era&lt;/a&gt;, Aegean Turkey and the neighbouring parts of &lt;a href="Central%20Anatolia"&gt;Central Anatolia&lt;/a&gt; constituted the ♡❤♡Province of Asia♡❤♡ (hence "the Seven Churches of ♡❤Asia♡❤", see &lt;a href="%23Seven%20Churches%20of%20Asia"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;). The name of the province was later extended to include &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;all of the continent that lies to the east&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Talk</h2>
&lt;a href="Turkish%20phrasebook"&gt;Turkish&lt;/a&gt; is the native language in the region. But as tourism is one of the main industries of this region, finding someone who can communicate in English or &lt;a href="German%20phrasebook"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt; to a lesser degree is generally not a problem.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<ul>
BULLET::::- Most of the tourism-oriented towns have direct ♡❤♡bus♡❤♡ services from many other important centres of the country, such as &lt;a href="Istanbul"&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- The major ♡❤♡airports♡❤♡ of this region are located in/near &lt;a href="Izmir"&gt;Izmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bodrum"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Dalaman"&gt;Dalaman&lt;/a&gt;. All handle a number of international flights as well as much more frequent domestic (national) flights.
BULLET::::- Most large hotels, tour operators and car rental companies located in the provinces of &lt;a href="Izmir"&gt;Izmir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bodrum"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- All major coastal towns have ♡❤♡ferry♡❤♡ links with the nearest &lt;a href="East%20Aegean%20Islands"&gt;Greek islands&lt;/a&gt;.
BULLET::::- Major hub of the region for ♡❤♡rail♡❤♡ transport is &lt;a href="Izmir"&gt;Izmir&lt;/a&gt;.

</ul>
<h2>Get around</h2>

<h2>See</h2>

The Aegean is the region with the highest concentration of ♡❤♡ancient city♡❤♡ ruins in Turkey, which should be no surprise given that this was the heart of the ♡❤♡Aeolian♡❤♡, ♡❤♡Ionian♡❤♡, ♡❤♡Lydian♡❤♡, and ♡❤♡Carian♡❤♡ civilizations. Expect to come across with another set of ruins as close to each other as every 10 or so kilometers. Some, such as &lt;a href="Ephesus"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt;—which very possibly is the best preserved ancient city in all of the Mediterranean basin, except for &lt;a href="Pompeii"&gt;Pompeii&lt;/a&gt;—still exhibit much of their former glory, while others may not seem to be offering much more than a pile of collapsed marble columns at first sight. In addition to Ephesus, other likely contenders to be on the checklist of many travellers to the region include &lt;a href="Assos"&gt;Assos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Bergama"&gt;Pergamon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Miletus"&gt;Miletus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Didyma"&gt;Didyma&lt;/a&gt;, but some often overlooked sites such as &lt;a href="Sardis"&gt;Sardis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Aphrodisias"&gt;Aphrodisias&lt;/a&gt; are also well worth a visit. Besides, as most of the still-inhabited cities and towns in the region are merely modern versions of ancient cities (it's hard to find a city ♡❤younger♡❤ than 3000 years old in the region after all), it's always possible to see yet another unexpected bit of ancient ruins, even in a city as modern-looking as &lt;a href="Izmir"&gt;Izmir&lt;/a&gt;.

When the fatigue from visiting one ancient city after another sets in, it might be time to look for ♡❤♡medieval Seljuk and Ottoman architecture♡❤♡ that some of the Turkish regions are known for. However, the scorched earth policy of the retreating Greek army in the final days of Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922, or the War of Independence as known in Turkey, left many Aegean towns in rubbles, and the concrete-mania of the following decades didn't certainly help either. Regardless, often unexplored inland village of &lt;a href="Birgi"&gt;Birgi&lt;/a&gt; southeast of Izmir is one of the places that happily escaped such destruction, and its Çakıroğlu Konağı, a three-storey mansion that is colourfully painted inside-out is a rare treat for architecture enthisuasts. It may also be possible to visit the odd ♡❤♡mosque♡❤♡ that dates back to the days of the Turkish frontier principalities (which rose to power after the central Seljuk authority vanished with the Mongol invasion in the 13th century), which has a unique post-Seljuk, yet pre-Ottoman transitionary style, one great example being İsa Bey Mosque in &lt;a href="Sel%C3%A7uk"&gt;Selçuk&lt;/a&gt;. Fans of ♡❤♡neo-classicism♡❤♡ are luckier, as the coastal towns that used to be inhabited by the Ottoman Greeks and have been full of neo-classical buildings were left intact—&lt;a href="Ayvalik"&gt;Ayvalık&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Fo%C3%A7a"&gt;Foça&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ala%C3%A7at%C4%B1"&gt;Alaçatı&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="%C3%87e%C5%9Fme"&gt;Çeşme&lt;/a&gt; are the towns that you should head to if this is what you are after.

So many years of wars and invasions mean that the ♡❤♡castles and citadels♡❤♡ are an unmissable mark of the regional landscape. Those that are in &lt;a href="Bodrum"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Kusadasi"&gt;Kuşadası&lt;/a&gt;, and Çeşme quite form the symbol of their respective towns, while the small picturesque castle of the coastal village of &lt;a href="%C3%87andarl%C4%B1"&gt;Çandarlı&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by well-manicured grasses, is one of the main attractions of the surrounding area. However, if you are looking for something really impressive and really off-the-beaten path, head for &lt;a href="Babakale"&gt;Babakale&lt;/a&gt; ("the father castle"), which has been proudly standing on the westernmost tip of &lt;a href="Asia"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;n mainland for centuries.

<h3>Seven Churches of Asia</h3>
Aegean Turkey played a major role in the development of early &lt;a href="Christianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, and of particular note are the ♡❤♡Seven Churches of Asia♡❤♡: &lt;a href="Ephesus"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Izmir"&gt;Smyrna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Pergamon"&gt;Pergamon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Akhisar"&gt;Thyatira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Sardis"&gt;Sardis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Ala%C5%9Fehir"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="Denizli"&gt;Laodicea&lt;/a&gt;. While the prophecies didn't refer to physical churches, and only Pergamon, Ephesus, and Philadelphia have Roman-era churches remaining, all of these cities have ruins of some kind, and Sardis has the ruins of a synagogue. Apart from Izmir (Smyrna), which doesn't have much in the way of Roman ruins, but is one of Turkey's major cities, the most popular of these cities are Ephesus and Pergamon, with Sardis and Laodicea coming in far behind, and Akhisar (Thyatira) and Alaşehir (Philadelphia) are almost never visited by tourists (except the handful seeking to see the Seven Churches). While Akhisar and Alaşehir's Roman-era ruins are minimal compared Ephesus, Pergamon, Sardis, or even Laodicea, these cities are still interesting to visit, as they remain local farming centers, with strikingly different feels.

All of these cities except for Pergamon can be reached (or the nearest city, no more than a 20&amp;nbsp;minute minibus ride away can be reached), by train, however except for &lt;a href="Sel%C3%A7uk"&gt;Selçuk&lt;/a&gt; (Ephesus) and Denizli (Laodicea) the trains run only a few times a day, and the schedules may be inconvenient.
<ul>
BULLET::::- Selçuk and Denizli can both be reached by the regional Denizli-Izmir train. Minibuses, taxis, or a long walk will be required to reach both sites from their associated cities.
BULLET::::- Sardis (Sart on the schedule) and Alaşehir can be reached by the regional Izmir-Uşak train. The train station for Alaşehir is in the center of two, while the location of Sart station seems to be slightly over a kilometer from the gymnasium complex.
BULLET::::- Akhisar can be reached by the either the 6 Eylül or 17 Eylül express between Izmir and Bandirma, each of which runs only once a day. The station itself is seven blocks, or about 400&amp;nbsp;meters, from the ruins.

</ul>
It is also possible to take buses or minibuses between the cities. In Izmir, the buses run to each of these cities at intervals ranging from every half hour (Bergama/Pergamon) to every two hours (Alaşehir). It's likely that buses between the other cities will be less frequent, so if you plan to make a loop around Izmir, ask at the bus station when the buses to your next city run.

<h2>Do</h2>
With its long craggy coastline, finding somewhere for a ♡❤♡swim♡❤♡ is rarely a daunting task in the region. As for the related ♡❤♡watersports♡❤♡, some towns are better suited to them than some others; for example the waters of &lt;a href="Ala%C3%A7at%C4%B1"&gt;Alaçatı&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Bitez"&gt;Bitez&lt;/a&gt; are known to be great for &lt;a href="windsurfing"&gt;windsurfing&lt;/a&gt;.

With the Mediterranean climate in charge, and the latitude being more southern than most of Europe, there is not much room for ♡❤♡wintersports♡❤♡ in the region (in coastal locations, it only snows once, and lightly, every decade—this is why the locals find the pictures of the amphitheatre of Ephesus under snow so magical and make them into postcards). While the snow-hungry residents of Izmir flock to the Mount Spylus near &lt;a href="Manisa"&gt;Manisa&lt;/a&gt; at every opportunity to witness the snowfall, that particular mountain does not really receive that much as to let skiing or doing other snow-related sports. For these, it may be more worthwhile to head more inland to Mt. Bozdağ, or ancient Mount Tmolos between &lt;a href="Salihli"&gt;Salihli&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="%C3%96demi%C5%9F"&gt;Ödemiş&lt;/a&gt;, which, with its mountain lake, is beautiful regardless the season.

When it comes to ♡❤♡thermal waters♡❤♡, the Aegean is less known as a destination than some other Turkish regions. Two especial places of note may be &lt;a href="Ilica"&gt;Ilıca&lt;/a&gt;, which has hot springs discharging from the sea floor inside natural rocky pools, and much more famous &lt;a href="Pamukkale"&gt;Pamukkale&lt;/a&gt;, which offers the unique experience of swimming amidst toppled ancient columns lying at the bottom of a thermal water-filled pool, which has been continuously in use for millennia.

<h2>Eat</h2>

<h2>Drink</h2>
While the viticulture is big business in the agricultural interior of the region, most of the produce is of the Sultana variety, which is not processed into wine, but rather exported as dried raisin. A number of towns around &lt;a href="Denizli"&gt;Denizli&lt;/a&gt; has some level of fame for their ♡❤♡red wines♡❤♡ which often have a strong flavour, while the village of &lt;a href="%C5%9Eirince"&gt;Şirince&lt;/a&gt; is well-known nationwide for its wines produced out of almost just about any fruit that can be imagined.

One drink that is unique to the region is the ♡❤♡♡❤sübye♡❤♡♡❤ of &lt;a href="Tire"&gt;Tire&lt;/a&gt;, oddly made of melon seeds.

While some of the inland towns might be a little bit more conservative than those on the coast, you are never too far away from a bottle of ♡❤Efes♡❤ ♡❤♡lager♡❤♡ whenever you are thirsty in the region.

If the sea, sun, and ancient cities here are not enough, why not moving on southeast to &lt;a href="Mediterranean%20Turkey"&gt;Mediterranean Turkey&lt;/a&gt;?

♡❤♡Aegina♡❤♡ (&lt;a href="Greek%20phrasebook"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;: Αίγινα, Aígina) is the nearest of the &lt;a href="Saronic%20Gulf%20Islands"&gt;Saronic Gulf Islands&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="Athens"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Other destinations</h2>

<h2>Understand</h2>
Aegina is a destination for the Athenians longing to get out of the urban hustle of the city, and is a wonderful island for swimming, shopping, and recreation. The locals are extremely friendly and helpful, and almost every merchant speaks excellent English. Aegina is worth at least a day of your itinerary, and you may find yourself staying overnight.

<h2>Get in</h2>
<h3>By boat</h3>
<ul>
BULLET::::- &lt;a href="http%3A//www.hellenicseaways.gr"&gt;Hellenic Seaways&lt;/a&gt; from Piraeus
BULLET::::- Nova Ferries (phone +302104126181) from Piraeus
BULLET::::- Aegean

</ul>
From the port at Piraeus, take a ferry or a hydrofoil to the island. Ferries run to Aegina Town frequently.The trip can take from 45 minutes if you choose a hydrofoil to an hour if you choose the ferry. Hellenic Seaways sails hourly to Aegina Town for &lt;abbr title=" €9.50 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€9.50&lt;/abbr&gt; . But a couple of other minor ferry companies have better prices especially to cars or motorbikes.

Unless you have already purchased a round-trip hydrofoil or boat ticket, be careful to avoid missing the late boat or you may find yourself involuntarily spending a night on the island. Most ticket agents speak English (especially if you smile and attempt Greek first) and accept credit cards for the transaction.

<h2>Get around</h2>
Take the bus from the port to several towns on the island.

You can rent a car for the day for &lt;abbr title=" €20-30 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€20-30&lt;/abbr&gt; , but be warned—you might be better off hiring a taxi. If the rental office manager starts pouring water into the radiator prior to your departure, you are better off renting a motorbike (inexpensive) or merely asking him to drive you around (more expensive, but infinitely more entertaining.)

You can also find motorbikes for rent within easy walking distance of the ferry. If you do, be sure to check to see how much petrol is in it.

<h2>See</h2>

<h3>Itineraries</h3>
Aegina is a triangle about 11&amp;nbsp;km on a side (83&amp;nbsp;km). The north and west coasts are fairly flat, well-populated, and easily accessible; the southeast is more rugged and wild, with smaller mountain and port villages.

One of the best ruins, the Temple of Apollo, overlooking the bay, is a five-minute walk from the port at Aegina. Turn to the left and start walking; admission to the museum at the entry point to the ruins is less than five Euros and will yield a fantastic experience. You can wear a swimsuit and bring lunch with you into the area, and actually sit on top of the crumbling marble and look out over the island and the water—almost all the way to Piraeus.

Also, ask about the temple of Aphaia—it's gorgeous and huge, and can be reached by taxi or motorbike. It's surrounded by pines on a hilltop overlooking Aghia Marina on the east side of the island. The admission there is only three or four Euros and on a clear day you can see for miles from its vantage point. There is a nice little cafe and shop across the street from the temple with a decent bathroom, as well.

Perdika ("Partridge") is a fishing village at the south end of the island's west coast, a half-hour bus or fifteen-minute taxi ride. Strolling around the town's peninsula gives you lovely views of sea, adjacent islands (including the spectacular, uninhabited Moni), and the volcanic Methana peninsula. A second long point of land, south across the narrow harbor from Perdhika, is deserted except for goats and donkeys (and officially off-limits according to Hellenic Navy signs), but out at the end of it is the world's only seaside, 360-degree camera obscura: wait five minutes for your eyes to adjust, and the whole landscape slowly appears on the round wall, upside down.

Agios Nektarios, a large, elaborate, modern Orthodox church and monastery, lies about halfway between Aegina Town and Agia Marina. Across the road and uphill is the entrance path to Paleochora (Old Town). This is where the island's population retreated from pirates for several hundred years; though it has been deserted since the early 19th century, many of the dozens of churches still standing are maintained by island families. A walk up to the double church on the peak makes a quiet and beautiful hour.

The tallest peak on Aegina, usually called Oros ("mountain"), is 532m. A motorbike will take you about halfway up, and the footpath, fairly well marked by cairns, takes another 30 or 45 minutes. At the top is (of course) a church, and from there you can see 360 degrees of the Saronic Gulf: Sounio, Athens, the Corinth Canal (almost), Methana, Poros.

<h2>Do</h2>
Many tourists come to Aegina for sailing.

</ul>
<h2>Eat</h2>
In Aegina Town, as in all island ports, the waterfront is lined with cafes. The best waterfront taverna may be the one at the north end (from the pier, turn left), called Flisvos. Somewhat hidden in the middle of town is Patitiri, with simple but excellent traditional food. During the summer, Ippocampos (Seahorse) at the south end of town is a one-man gourmet operation, with probably the most extraordinary food on the island.

In Aghia Marina, go to Pita Toms, where soulvakis and gyros are fresh and inexpensive (&lt;abbr title=" €1.60 ≈ US$, JP¥, £"&gt;€1.60&lt;/abbr&gt; ).

Perdhika, at the southwest tip of the island, has a whole row of good tavernas.

<h1>Aeolian Islands</h1>
&lt;templatestyles src="Pagebanner/styles.css"/&gt;

The ♡❤♡Aeolian islands♡❤♡ (&lt;a href="Italian%20phrasebook"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;: ♡❤Isole Eolie♡❤, Sicilian: ♡❤Ìsuli Eoli♡❤, &lt;a href="Greek%20phrasebook"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt;: Αιολίδες Νήσοι), aka ♡❤♡Lipari Islands♡❤♡, are a group of attractive islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea about 25-50 km north of &lt;a href="Sicily"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="Italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;. This diverse group of volcanic islands used to be off the beaten track, but it is becoming more popular and can be very busy during July and August. The islands are inscribed in the &lt;a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20List"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage List&lt;/a&gt;.

<h2>Regions</h2>

 

<h2>Cities</h2>

<h2>Talk</h2>

Although local dialects of Sicilian are spoken among the locals, the traveller will find that standard Italian is also spoken by most people. Those involved in the tourist trade may also speak some English, German, or French. Cellular telephone coverage is dependable in the settled areas, but access to the internet is rare. There are a few internet cafes in Lipari Town.

<h2>Get in</h2>

There are frequent car ferries and much quicker hydrofoils from &lt;a href="Milazzo"&gt;Milazzo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Messina"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="Sicily"&gt;Sicily&lt;/a&gt;, and from &lt;a href="Reggio%20di%20Calabria"&gt;Reggio di Calabria&lt;/a&gt; on the mainland, to and between the islands. Most call first at Lipari, and then proceed to the other islands. Ferries are frequent in summer, with fewer during spring, autumn and winter and a reduced service year-round on Sundays. For timetables see &lt;a href="http%3A//www.siremar.it"&gt;SIREMAR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http%3A//www.usticalines.it"&gt;Ustica Lines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http%3A//www.ngi-spa.it/"&gt;NGI&lt;/a&gt;. Check the timetables in advance, and allow plenty of time for connections, as boats can be early or late.

A few car ferries a week also continue on to &lt;a href="Naples"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href="http%3A//www.snav.it"&gt;SNAV&lt;/a&gt;) and during the summer hydrofoils run from &lt;a href="Naples"&gt;Naples&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Cefal%C3%B9"&gt;Cefalù&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Palermo"&gt;Palermo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Messina"&gt;Messina&lt;/a&gt;.

The Aeolian Islands are quite remote, which is part of their appeal. No air travel is available to the archipelago, except for the very expensive helicopter service which runs during high season from the Catania airport. For more information see &lt;a href="http%3A//www.airpanarea.com/"&gt;Air Panarea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http%3A//www.helijet.it"&gt;HeliJet&lt;/a&gt;. Most international travellers, then, will arrive at the airport of either Palermo or Catania airport in Sicily, or Reggio di Calabria, across the straits of Messina on the mainland.

Although the Reggio airport is relatively near the port, boats from Reggio are infrequent. Likewise, only a few ferries per day run from Palermo during high season, and the airport is far from the city. These ports are best used by the traveller who is already in Italy, as is Naples, a much longer boat trip that is convenient for travelers arriving by plane or train in Naples from points north. For the traveller arriving directly from abroad, numerous budget airlines have routes from around Europe to Catania. From there, one can take the train, or an express bus, to Messina, connecting to a boat; or, at Messina, one can connect to a second train or bus to Milazzo, which has by far the most boat departures. Although it is convenient to change trains in Messina, the Milazzo train station is a few miles from the port. On the other hand, the bus from Catania arrives at the train station, while the bus for Milazzo departs from a separate bus station a few blocks away. Ask for help at the information booth outside the train station. One express bus per day departs from Catania airport for Milazzo, but arrives there so late as to miss the boat for certain of the islands. You may wish to spend the first night in Lipari, with its charming town, and then depart for the outlying islands. As another alternative, the car rental agencies have special deals allowing the traveller the use of a car one-way from Catania to Milazzo - inquire in advance as these deals may not be available without reservations. The car rental agencies in Milazzo are a few blocks from the port. Cars can be left for a few days easily in Milazzo when visiting the islands, just park them in any parking place with blue borders (blue border indicates no parking fee or time limit on parking)

<h2>Get around</h2>

The larger islands, &lt;a href="Lipari"&gt;Lipari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="Vulcano"&gt;Vulcano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Salina"&gt;Salina&lt;/a&gt; have quite good bus services. Timetables are available at the tourist offices in each island's port. Those islands also have scooters for rent, and are the only of the islands with comprehensive systems of roads. &lt;a href="Panarea"&gt;Panarea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Stromboli"&gt;Stromboli&lt;/a&gt; are small enough to have no roads or automobiles to speak of; Panarea in particular is completely accessible by foot. &lt;a href="Alicudi"&gt;Alicudi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="Filicudi"&gt;Filicudi&lt;/a&gt; are so remote that they have little in the way of developed tourist industries or infrastructure. On those islands, transport from the port, and scooter rental, should be arranged with one's inkeeper. Boat rental is also popular for touring the periphery of each island; although the small boats for rent are not adequate for travel between the islands, but are popular for the excursion from Panarea to the islets of Basiluzzo and Drauto.

<h2>See</h2>
&lt;a href="Vulcano"&gt;Vulcano&lt;/a&gt; is the first port of call for ferries from Milazzo. As well as the spectacular view of the narrow channel between this island and neighbouring Lipari, you're also greeted with the strange sight of a stack of sulphurous oozings, right by the harbour, with an accompanying smell! Disembarking, you can follow the road between that stack and a huge red rock, sulphurous fumes hissing out of the side of the pavement, to one of the island's main attractions. Next to the beach, the locals have created a hollow in the volcanic clay that is filled with yellow mud. After bathing in the mud, you can swim in the sea and wash it all off. Swimming here is a very special experience, because the fumaroles extend right out into the sea, bubbling up hot gas and giving the sensation of being in a jacuzzi, in the blue Mediterranean!

The other main attraction on Vulcano is, you guessed it, the volcano! A steep climb from the town, you can walk to the summit of the island for a spectacular view of the other Aeolian Islands. If you have closed footwear, you can traverse the active vents on the north side of the main crater on your way to the top. Here, a great deal of steam and smelly gas is given off, and you can observe large sulphur crystals in the vents. Be careful not to burn your feet on the hot rocks and steam.

&lt;a href="Lipari"&gt;Lipari&lt;/a&gt; is relatively pedestrian in comparison with exotic Vulcano. Fortunately, it has less exotic prices, and the large main town has a nice old quarter and a decent quota of non-tourist shops. Among the attractions on Lipari is the pumice quarry, reached from the main town by an infrequent bus service. This is right by the sea, and has a nice rocky beach where, interestingly, many of the rocks tend to float off into the sea!

&lt;a href="Stromboli"&gt;Stromboli&lt;/a&gt; is the most spectacular of the islands, as it's the only one that is volcanically active. In fact, it's the only volcano in the world that is known to have been continuously active throughout recorded history. The approach by ferry from Lipari takes one past the sheer sides of the island that rise towards the summit crater, which is permanently shrouded in clouds of its own making. Stromboli town has pretty narrow streets and, further from the centre, beautiful black sand beaches in rocky coves. The must-see attraction is the night-time climb up to the crater. The going is tough (you will be climbing approximately 850 m) but you will see an amazing sunset and the eruptions are incredible. The trip is rounded off by running down the volcanic ash slopes, in the dark!

<h2>Do</h2>
Most visitors to Vulcano spend time in the mud baths near the port. Entry is inexpensive and free in the low season. You may find it worthwhile to purchase a token for the shower. The water gives you a powerful sulphurous odor which lasts for a few days or even weeks.

About 20 m from the mudbaths there's also volcanic activity out in the sea. The effect is that the water in the sea is literally boiling.
