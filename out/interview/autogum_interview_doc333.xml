<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process? </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Great communities, like great cities, are built from shared dreams that address shared needs. I have been a Councillor for the last 15 years, and I am proud to have helped guide the growth and improvement of our community. In the last few years, we have seen the neighbourhoods in St. Paul's West increase in recognition, reputation and property value. This has not occurred by chance. I have worked hard to build successful, creative and vibrant relationships amongst local, corporate and government stakeholders in order to stimulate local renewal and make it happen! We are on the cusp of a renaissance on St. Clair that will reap tremendous rewards for small business and residents. Millions of dollars of City investment in street and transit improvements; support for local Business Improvement Areas; the Wychwood Barns Park; the upgrading of our play parks, the Cedarvale Ravine and the Kay Gardner Beltline Park; all this work is making Ward 21 a wonderful place to live and raise families. I have a vision of community and City growth - one that is sustainable, civil and inclusive. I enjoy working with people who have a passion for this community and City. This is why I am involved in the political process.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why do you want to represent this particular ward on council?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> The creativity, passion and positive community spirit of residents and businesses in Ward 21, St. Paul's West, continues to inspire me. It has made my work as city Councillor, a real pleasure. Together, we are transforming our neighbourhood and our City into one that works - because we are addressing our shared needs, hopes and aspirations, in a fair and equitable manner.</p>
