<p>Mottos include "sustainability is security" and "freedom to debate."  I run to help define, popularize and grow the Green Party, to be an advocate for: single-payer health-care, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/renewable%20energy">renewable energy</ref>, increased energy efficiency, rail transport, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic%20farming">organic local agriculture</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigenous%20rights">indigenous rights</ref>, wise water use, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign%20finance%20reform">banning lobbying/bribery</ref>, over-turning the legal fiction that a corporation is a person, and equal media exposure for all political candidates, having open debates between all political parties and beating those "swords into plowshares" by focusing on improving diplomacy, communication and basic physical security in water, food and energy in particular to mitigate the negative effects of global <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate%20change">climate change</ref> and to provide emergency readiness.  Also, I get bored easily and this keeps me busy.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Have you ever run for political office before? (President, senate, congress, city councillor, school trustee... etc.) Have you ever been a member of a political party, other than the one you're currently in?</hi></p>
<p>I ran for president in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20presidential%20election,%202004">2004</ref> and 2008, being one of the four "finalists" at the nominating conventions.  Also, I ran for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</ref> as part of a contested race in the Green Party Primary Election in 2006.  I plan to run for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</ref> in 2010 and I am now taking the steps to begin running for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20presidential%20election,%202012">2012 presidential race</ref>.  I have been a member of both main U.S. parties and I cannot adequately express my disgust for them both.  I encourage people everywhere to register Green, vote Green and support Green Party efforts at achieving and maintaining ballot access within the current hostile political environment.  Ideally, we can together displace one of the two major parties; such is the near-majority level of disapproval of the antiquated mainstream parties and the desire for a true alternative.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Have you ever campaigned for another political candidate?</hi></p>
<p>In <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20presidential%20election,%201996">1996</ref> I helped organize a press conference for then-presidential candidate <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph%20Nader">Ralph Nader</ref>, after having helped support efforts to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft%20(politics)">draft</ref> him as a candidate.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What skills or ideas do you bring from this position, or previous positions, that will benefit the Oval Office?</hi></p>
<p>I believe in the separation of power within government, including economic power.  Due to the influence of money in politics and within government we do not have a political system that works well to advance the needs and concerns of "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/we%20the%20people">we the people</ref>."  There are few, muted voices within our government supporting the dispossessed, the disenfranchised, the "left out," the lower echelon within our socio-economic strata.  Especially now, with high energy costs, questionable food supplies, shredded social safety nets, job loss due to outsourcing and other losses, loss of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil%20liberties">civil liberties</ref> and rights, the consolidation and concealment of governmental power, the "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">fascist</ref>" confluence of military-industrial business with governmental power, threats of unstable weather, retaliation by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism">terrorists</ref> and opportunistic foreign governments following our model it is a good time to not be silent.  I have lived with and among many different cultures, religions and peoples, I have a multi-cultural background and a mixed ancestry, I value art, music and science, I am both intuitive and analytical and I enjoy solving problems.  Our nation would benefit greatly from my services.  Plus, I am not "on the take."</p>
