<p>Frank Klees, as a man of proven integrity, seasoned MPP and a professional politician.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What makes you the most desirable of all candidates running in the riding?</hi></p>
<p>I was nominated by and do represent the Family Coalition Party - the only party, that is committed to protecting life. We do not make promises we do not intend to keep, just to get the votes. Only FCP has a sound program of reforms in all the areas of the public life.  PC and Liberals do not offer anything new - just differ on details, like funding of separate schools.  If people are happy with things as they are, they should vote for the big parties and we will get "the same old" guaranteed.  From what I see, Ontarians are not happy with the government, feel detached and oppressed so much, that some of them do not even want to talk politics.  FCP will bring a long seeked change for the better.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What do you feel are the three most important issues to voters in your riding? Are these the same top three issues that are most important to you? What would you do to address these issues?</hi></p>
<p><list type="ordered"><item>Eradicate poverty, especially child poverty.  Many families are struggling financially and sinking into perpetual debt. The government gladly taxes the low income earners.  People living in poverty should be tax exempt.  FCP would double the tax exemption amount.</item></list></p>
<p><list type="ordered"><item>Give legal protection to the people, who are not yet born and still dwell in their mothers' wombs. These people are future voters, who will be able to vote in 18 years.  I'm sure it's extremely important to them.</item></list></p>
<p><list type="ordered"><item>The health system is in jeopardy.  People do not know what to do to stay healthy, as there are so many contradicting advices.  Even a Health Minister gets sick from time to time, and doctors die from heart attacks and strokes. Clearly most of us do not know what to do. We should focus on prevention and research, instead of throwing money at the symptoms and enriching big pharma.  Also the system needs a redesign.  If you tried the hospital food and experienced how bad it was, it would surprise you how expensive it is. The FCP will propose a system of Medical Savings Accounts (MSA) to increase disease prevention, a responsible use of the system and easier access for those in need.  The FCP will consider a system of health insurance that allows for competition, and increase the quality of delivery.</item></list></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What should be the first order of business in the 39th Legislative Assembly?</hi></p>
<p>Parliament should make sure, that the courts are no longer able to make the law, but only interpret the law in their judicial activities. Parliament  has to have the exclusive right to set the law.</p>
