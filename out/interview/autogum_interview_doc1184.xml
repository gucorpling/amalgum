<p><hi rend="bold">Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process?</hi></p>
<p>At a recent federal election I was so appalled by the available choices that I couldn’t make any.</p>
<p>Since I take my civic responsibility seriously, I decided to get involved.</p>
<p>When I came to Canada, I was simply an anti-communist but as I explored the issues I am interested in, I slowly drifted toward libertarianism. I resisted the label for a long time, but part of my decision to get involved was to embrace it. I consider myself to be a 'social libertarian' akin to Charles Murray. What this means is that my main concern is the damage that the state can cause to society.</p>
<p>I am alarmed by our slow drifting toward socialism and I think I must speak up to warn those who have no idea what’s at the end of the road.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Why did you choose to run in this constituency?</hi></p>
<p>Because I live in it. It is among the most hostile ridings to our ideas, but I am not in this race to win. I am in it to represent an alternative. I am uncompromising in my ideas; I couldn’t possibly compromise on tactics by choosing a riding where I could have hoped for a few more votes.</p>
<p>My riding has a few very distinct neighbourhoods. The one I live in (Roncesvalles village) is in the process of changing from ethnic/polish to yuppie/alternative. People full of misguided middle class guilt and an ear for the siren song of the NDP. Parkdale represents another solid NDP territory.</p>
<p>High Park and Swansea are a little more to the right but still on the left side of middle.</p>
<p>When you see a middle aged WASP man with Rastafarian hairdo and a “Bush is the real terrorist” T-shirt at an all candidates meeting, you know that you are not in libertarian territory.</p>
<p>But as I said, I am here to stand up, not to win.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What prior political experience do you have?</hi></p>
<p>None. In my school years I was part of the communist youth organization leadership on both schools I attended but I really hope that nobody will hold this against me. I hope to have redeemed myself with the 9 months I spent in a communist jail as a political prisoner.</p>
