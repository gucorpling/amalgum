<p><p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">SB</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  I am the only Democrat on the five person board. So the entire board has to take credit of keeping tax increases below 2% a year without going into our fund balance. In fact our fund balance is the best of the other 31 towns and the county of St. Lawrence. We have lowered the cost of health care along with our tax base. Upgraded equipment, put money aside for replacement equipment, made our buildings energy efficient. Then we started at the beginning of each meeting the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge%20of%20Allegiance">Pledge of Allegiance</ref> and a short prayer to the Almighty. Best of all we have no debt.</p></p>

<p><p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">SB</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  This was a strong <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</ref> county when I first became chair. I was able to turn the county around to Democrat, but now it has fallen back to Republican. I started the first resource guide that allowed us to raise funds, obtained a house for the first time ever headquarters. <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton">Hillary Clinton</ref> won her first Senate seat with just 10 counties out of 62 in New York. We were one of those 10 counties when I was chair. I served as chair and was called back after several years to be chair again. I left the party in both a happy, strong and good financial condition.</p></p>

<p><p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">SB</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  I am impressed that you did some investigative work. It is rare today. Good for you. You should go far in this field. The country was just starting to feel the impact of a slowdown. I wanted to speak out as to what I saw and speak to the issues of the day. I learned that it was a closed shop then and has gotten worse both in ability to be recognized and the economic situation.  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAFTA">NAFTA</ref> and all free trade policies are detrimental to our economical health, jobs, income and general well being of the country.  When NAFTA was first proposed I was chair and spoke out against it and was given heat for it. But oh well I swim upstream anyway.</p></p>

<p><p><p><p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">SB</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  I ran in six states total and did the best [in] <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Louisiana">Louisiana</ref>.</p></p></p></p>

<p><p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">SB</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  No I will not join any other party. I like the freedom of being a Democrat. This freedom is not found in other parties.</p></p>
