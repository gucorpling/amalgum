<p><hi rend="bold">Wednesday, March 5, 2014</hi>
In the past few days, tension has been increasing due to conflict between <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ukraine">Ukraine</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Russia">Russian Federation</ref> which has led to the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/France">France</ref> increasing pressure on Russia to remove their troops from <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Crimea">Crimea</ref>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> interviewed specialists in Russian foreign policy and specialists in international law about the legality of Russia's actions and the consequences of any sanctions imposed by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7">G7</ref> nation economies.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Are Russian troop deployments into Ukrainian territory a clear violation of sovereignty?</p>
<p><list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Morris</hi>: Yes.</item></list></p>
<p><list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Burbank</hi>: Yes, the borders of the Ukrainian state were drawn up in 1991 and reinforced by the 1994 Budapest accords.  See the article by Paul Goble on these accords.</item></list></p>
<p><list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Brandist</hi>: It would be hard to describe it otherwise. That said, however, it is quite extraordinary hypocrisy for the US and UK to strike moral poses about this, especially after <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iraq">Iraq</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</ref>. Russia clearly has strategic interests in the region, and there is a large Russian-speaking population in much of Ukraine, a majority in Crimea and an important part of the east of the country, and the arrangement after the collapse of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/USSR">USSR</ref> was clearly fragile, especially when <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</ref> expansion took place. None of this is to excuse Russian actions, but they cannot be understood without focus on the 'great game' of which it is part.</item></list></p>
<p><list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Blank</hi>: By any standard Russia's actions represent a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and integrity, a premeditated break with numerous treaties signed by Russia guaranteeing Ukraine's security, integrity, and sovereignty, and thus <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arseniy%20Yatsenyuk">Premier Yatsenyuk</ref> is right these are acts of war.</item></list></p>
<p><list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Kotsonis</hi>: On the surface it seems so. Mind you, it is complicated because Russia has been given rights to the bases on the Crimea and this may give Russia the pretext for a larger intervention. But it does not seem to be a clear-cut legal case for intervention and everyone understands that this is Russia smarting over the loss of an ally in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovich">Yanukovich</ref> and guarding its own back yard interests.</item></list></p>
