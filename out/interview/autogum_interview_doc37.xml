Saturn to discuss his background, political views, and unorthodox campaign for the Senate. </p>
<p>Invictus, whose name was changed from his birth name to the Latin for "majestic unconquered sun", has received media coverage for previously expressing <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">fascistic</ref> views and participating in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paganism">pagan</ref> rituals. While in law school, he penned an article advocating a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eugenics">eugenics</ref> program, and in 2013, he wrote a "departure memo" renouncing his U.S. citizenship and law license while announcing plans to go into the wilderness until a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil%20war">civil war</ref>.  He returned after making a pilgrimage from Orlando to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</ref>, where he fasted for a week.  Upon his return to Florida, he sacrificed a goat and drank its blood.  Former <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian%20Party%20of%20Florida">Libertarian Party of Florida</ref> chairman <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian%20Wyllie">Adrian Wyllie</ref> resigned his chairmanship in protest of Invictus's candidacy. </p>
<p>Though initially uncontested for the nomination, Invictus has recently received a challenge from information technology specialist Paul Stanton.  Political operative <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Roger_Stone">Roger Stone</ref> opened an exploratory committee to consider running for the nomination but has not shown further interest.  The primary election is to be held August 30.  To qualify for the ballot, a candidate must either pay a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">US$</ref>10,000 fee or collect 100,000 signatures.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">William S. Saturn</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Why did you change your name to Augustus Sol Invictus?</hi></p>
<p><list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Augustus Sol Invictus</hi>: I was given my name in a religious initiation when I was twenty-one. I usually analogize it to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church">Roman Catholics</ref> taking a new name at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation">Confirmation</ref>. No one ever changes their name <hi rend="italic">legally</hi> after such an initiation, as it is usually reserved for religious pursuits. But I changed my name legally to my religious name so that my mundane and religious lives would be one.</item></list></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is your history with electoral politics?  Which political candidates have you previously supported or endorsed?</hi></p>
<p><list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Invictus</hi>: I have no such history, and I have never made an endorsement. I consider myself an outsider. Truth be told, I consider myself a revolutionary more than a politician.</item></list></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WSS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">How do you feel about Republican front-runner <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</ref> and his campaign for president?</hi></p>
<p><list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Invictus</hi>: Donald Trump is a cultural icon, and for that I love him. As for his presidential campaign, I am forced to remain neutral, as I cannot endorse anyone for President without it being thought that I have adopted their platform as my own.</item></list></p>
