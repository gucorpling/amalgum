<p>It has been nearly 27 years since <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole%20(German%20singer)">Nicole</ref>, then a high school student from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarland">Saarland</ref> in extreme western <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</ref>, sang a heartfelt plea for world peace on the stage at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%201982">Eurovision Song Contest</ref> held in Harrogate, North Yorkshire in the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</ref>. That simple message was wrapped with success; she became the first <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Germany">German</ref> in Contest history to take home the grand prize. The song was a brainchild of her former record producer, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph%20Siegel">Ralph Siegel</ref>, and would be their greatest achievement in their nearly three-decade partnership.</p>
<p>Afterward, she was propelled to stardom across <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Europe">Europe</ref> by recording versions of her winning song, "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein%20bißchen%20Frieden">Ein bißchen Frieden</ref>" (<hi rend="italic">A little peace</hi>), in many European languages. To this day, it was the last winning Eurovision song to top the charts in the United Kingdom; it also has the distinction of being the 500th #1 single on the British charts.</p>
<p>This newfound fame brought her music to audiences across Europe, and in time, into <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Asia">Asia</ref> as well. By the end of the 1980s, however, her fame subsided somewhat and she refocused her career domestically. Since 1980, she has released over 30 albums in Germany; her most recent offering, <hi rend="italic">Mitten ins Herz</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Right into your heart</hi>), was accompanied by a three-month "unplugged" tour that ended in the third week of January.</p>
<p>Now off the road, Nicole spoke with <hi rend="italic">Wikinews'</hi> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:Mike_Halterman">Mike Halterman</ref> about her past success, her life and career today, and her overall impressions of the Eurovision Song Contest, both past and present. This is the first in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202009">next contest</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow">Moscow</ref>.</p>
<head id="Early_career">Early career</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Mike Halterman</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> You started out performing at the age of 6. Was this an interest you really wanted to pursue at such a young age? Did you ever feel pressured by your family in any way to succeed musically, or were they very supportive?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Nicole</hi>: Actually, I started out performing at the age of 4. When I got my first applause, it was clear to me what my profession would be, and my family gave me the utmost support.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">MH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> When did you start to consider music as a full-time career?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Nicole</hi>: At the age of 16, after the great success I had with my first record, <hi rend="italic">Flieg nicht so hoch, mein kleiner Freund</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Don't fly so high, my little friend</hi>).</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">MH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold"> You started your partnership with Ralph Siegel back when you were 16. How did he decide to give you a record contract? Did you have any doubts about signing it? </hi></p>
