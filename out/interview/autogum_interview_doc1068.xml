<head>Vivien Goldman: An interview with the Punk Professor</head><p><hi rend="bold">Wednesday, October 3, 2007</hi></p>
<figure rend="Vivien Goldman by David Shankbone.jpg"></figure><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien%20Goldman">Vivien Goldman</ref> recalls with a laugh the day in 1984 when she saw her death, but the laugh fades as she becomes lost in the memory.  She was in Nigeria staying in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fela%20Kuti">Fela Kuti</ref>'s home; she had just arrived hours before and found people sleeping everywhere like house cats when <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu%20Buhari">Muhammadu Buhari</ref>'s army showed up to haul everyone to jail.   Kuti was an opponent of the government who was in jail, and they came to arrest his coterie of supporters.  They grabbed Goldman and were about to throw her in a truck until <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%20Imbert">Pascal Imbert</ref>, Kuti's manager, yelled out, "<hi rend="italic">Leave her alone.  She just arrived from Paris!  She's my wife!  She knows nothing!</hi>  "
<p>Goldman stops for a moment and then smiles plainly. "They thought I was just some stupid woman.... That time sexism worked in my favor."</p>
<p>Vivien Goldman has become a living, teaching testimony of the golden era of punk and reggae.  She is an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjunct%20professor">adjunct professor</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New%20York%20University">New York University</ref> who has taught courses on the music scene she was thrust in the middle of as a young public relations representative for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island%20Records">Island Records</ref>.  She writes a column for the BBC called "Ask the Punk Professor" where she extols the wisdom she gained as a confidant of Bob Marley; as the person who first put <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flava%20Flav">Flava Flav</ref> in video; as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrissie%20Hynde">Chrissie Hynde</ref>'s former roommate; as the woman who worked with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Clash">The Clash</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Slits">The Slits</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Raincoats">The Raincoats</ref>.  </p>
<p>As <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews">Wikinews</ref> reporter <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:David_Shankbone">David Shankbone</ref> found out, Goldman is one of those individuals that when you sit in her presence you realize she simply can not tell you everything she knows or has seen, either to protect the living or to respect the dead.  </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  The first biography of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%20Marley">Bob Marley</ref>, <hi rend="italic">Soul Rebel, Natural Mystic</hi>, was written by you based upon your personal experiences with him, and you have recently written a book about Marley called <hi rend="italic">The Book of Exodus</hi>.  How difficult is it to continue to mine his life?  Is it difficult to come up with new angles?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">VG:</hi>  The original biography was written in a weekend and it was based upon my extensive interviews with him, whereas the <hi rend="italic">Exodus</hi> book took two and a half years.  I must have been a year past deadline, because it kept on growing.  Even I had to acknowledge it was a more mature work.  After I wrote the first one, all these other people came out with books.  I read them, and they were all good in their different ways, but there was a story that had not been told but that I had lived so intensely, a deep story that had shaped my whole life.  It demanded I write a book about it.  Nobody else has the experience, and I still have that <hi rend="italic">oompf</hi>.</p>
