<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Where do you advertise?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  A lot on the web, we've used most of the local city papers, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New%20York%20Press">New York Press</ref></hi>, things like that, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%20Magazine">L Magazine</ref></hi>.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  In the back of the paper?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  Typically in the back of the paper.  Magazines constantly change their policy on it; they want it, they don't want it…</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rebecca:</hi></hi>  Depending on the election year--</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  Who's buying the paper, who's selling the paper.  So it changes, so one year we got to be in the Press, but they have now stopped adult ads.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rebecca:</hi></hi>  Completely.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  So now we'll be in the <hi rend="italic">Voice</hi> for a while.  We're moving more towards the Internet at this point, because the Internet is a much easier, safer way for a person to look at sensitive material and not get caught with it.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  Pursuant to your business question: we only hire nice people.  I don't care if a girl is absolutely exquisite looking--</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rebecca:</hi></hi>  My husband has met beautiful, beautiful girls--</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  --beautiful girls--</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rebecca:</hi></hi>  --and he's in the end, he would say, "Well, I won't hire them."  I'm like, ‘Are you insane?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  I won't hire them.  I hire--</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Why not?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  Because I want someone who's going to treat people nicely and well.  We have--</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  How can you tell whether they will or will not?  Just by talking to them?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  Having been a psychologist for a number of years gives me a leg up on it.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rebecca:</hi></hi>  And he's been right.  And I have made him hire these girls, and ultimately he's been right They've been complete pain in the asses!</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  I also have a profile they fill out for me, a mini-MMPI that I developed, so that I have an idea--Rebecca and I put it together</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rebecca:</hi></hi>  I don't know if you'd like to see one.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  No, no, no.  Just--</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rebecca:</hi></hi>  I could show you.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  So I have a mini-MMPI that I--</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Could I have a sample, not necessarily one that's filled out, but just one that you-- </hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rebecca:</hi></hi>  I'll show you.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  Sure.  The questions are--</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rebecca:</hi></hi>  Be careful.  He'll make you fill one out.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  [<hi rend="italic">laughs</hi>] You'd be scared.  You wouldn't hire me.  Is it only girls you hire?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="bold">Rebecca:</hi></hi>  Yeah.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  [<hi rend="italic">Looking at list of questions</hi>] What would a question like "the greatest woman in the world" reveal to you?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Bill:</hi>  No question would reveal anything independently of all the questions together--</p>
