<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Describe the three most important issues in your campaign.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> The three most important issues in the campaign are:</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Preserving &amp; Enhancing the Quality of Life</hi>: This relates to the fundamentals of we should expect from our local government. Clean and safe streets, a healthy environment, adequate public and green spaces, and controls on development.</p>
<p>As the Councillor for the area I have worked with the community on better road design that would help improve road safety and protect the environment.  I have worked on improving pedestrian safety through increased sidewalks, improvements to pedestrian crossings, and additional traffic lights.  I have helped the community get traffic calming measures installed to curb speeding vehicles near schools and on residential streets.</p>
<p>I have supported the tree protection by-law and the ban on the cosmetic use of pesticides.</p>
<p>I have worked to plant trees along streets and on vacant parcels of City land.  I will continue to do so.</p>
<p>I have fought to maintain mechanical leaf collection in Etobicoke, and for increased street sweeping and litter pick up.</p>
<p>I have supported funds for an additional 250 police officers, and will continue to support ensuring that there are adequate and improved police services in the City.</p>
<p>I have worked to expand and create new local parks.  Dalesford/Winslow Park, Chimes Lane Parkette, Shires Lane Parkette, a new park on Islington Avenue, Michael Power Park.  I have helped to upgrade park facilites such as in Wedgewood Park, Dalesford/Winslow Park, and Kenway Park.  I will be working to create a new park and community recreation centre on the Westwood Theatre Lands.  To create a new park on the Queensway near Zorra Street.  To upgrade playground facilities in Queensland Park, and refurbish the facilities in Queensway Park.</p>
<p>I initiated a new Roof Top Patio Control By-law for Etobicoke to protect residential communities from excessive noise and disruption.  I have spearheaded a crackdown on illegal businesses on The Queensway and strengthening City-wide by-laws to help control them.</p>
