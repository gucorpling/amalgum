<head>Interview with dismissed Ocean Drive columnist Trisha Posner</head><p><hi rend="bold">Saturday, September 22, 2007</hi></p>
<figure rend="Trisha Posner by David Shankbone.jpg"></figure>Critic <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20Fulford">Robert Fulford</ref> wrote of legendary civic preservationist <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane%20Jacobs">Jane Jacobs</ref> that she "came down firmly on the side of spontaneous inventiveness of individuals, as against abstract plans imposed by governments and corporations."  With certain alterations, the same could be said of author and journalist Trisha Posner, who penned the popular <hi rend="italic">Health Watch</hi> column in Miami's <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%20Drive%20(magazine)">Ocean Drive</ref></hi> magazine.  
<p>Posner was fired for expressing her opinion on a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</ref> video about regulations affecting her <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%20Beach">South Beach</ref> neighborhood.  Like many <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urban%20renewal">rejuvenated</ref> communities in the United States, Posner's historic <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%20Drive">south Fifth Street</ref> has become the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribeca">Tribeca</ref> of Miami, a fashionable, trendy nightspot with a maelstrom of growth in hotels, restaurants and boutiques that have out-priced many long-term residents.  </p>
<p>Local activist Frank Del Vecchio asked Posner if she would appear in the eight-minute <hi rend="italic">Close the Loophole</hi> video, directed by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy%20award">Emmy award</ref>-winning documentarian Robyn Symon, to state her belief that a loophole that allows popular local restaurants such as Prime One Twelve and Devito South Beach to exist in her residential neighborhood should be amended to limit the amount of seats in the establishments in proportion to their number of rooms.  Her segment began, "Hi, I'm Trisha Posner. I'm a journalist and columnist for <hi rend="italic">Ocean Drive</hi> magazine. I am married to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald%20Posner">Gerald Posner</ref>, the author."  Within a few hours after her appearance, she was fired by <hi rend="italic">Ocean Drive</hi> publisher Jerry Powers.  </p>
<p>Posner was aghast and bewildered.  Attractive and comely, as a health columnist she is an unlikely candidate as a civic instigator; but those qualities belie Posner's buffalo stance on doing what she feels is right for her community.  "I hate being in the public eye and I prefer to be low key," Posner told Wikinews in an interview.  "To do the  video I was nervous.  Only in person do I feel comfortable."  Wikinews reporter <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:David_Shankbone">David Shankbone</ref> recently spoke with Posner.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  What were the circumstances surrounding your dismissal?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">TP:</hi>  In South Beach and in Miami there are neighborhood associations like South of Fifth Neighborhood Association, which [Posner's husband] Gerald is President of, and they all try to work together to make living in the neighborhood synergized with the nightlife and the restaurants.  This issue involved another, Frank Del Vecchio, President of 301 Ocean Drive condominium association.  Frank asked me to be part of a video against a loophole where restaurants can have so many seats that they effectively become a nightclub.  On the video there are five others besides me.  An entertainer, a school teacher...and then I’m sitting there on a bench.  At about 4:40 we wrapped up and I left.  When I got home there was a phone message from [editor-in-chief] Glenn Albin saying, 'Trisha, Trisha, Jerry is running around the place...' and I thought it was a joke.  I started laughing.  Gerald said he didn’t think it was a joke, but I had not done anything.  Then I received an anonymous e-mail: Jerry Powers had got a phone call from a hotel person that said 'one of your representatives from the magazine is down here bad mouthing nightlife, hotels, etc.'  The magazine's publicist panicked and called Powers, who then runs all the way down to City Hall and asks <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami%20Beach,%20Florida">ex-Mayor</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neisen%20Kasdin">Neisen Kasdin</ref> to let him speak before the City Council.  He says that Trisha was not for him, and that <hi rend="italic">Ocean Drive</hi> is for entertainment and hotels in South Beach.  Then he said I was fired as he left.</p>
