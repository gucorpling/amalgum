<p><hi rend="bold">WN</hi>: In the efforts to secure an end to the conflict between the Ugandan government and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's%20Resistance%20Army">Lord's Resistance Army</ref> (LRA) rebels, LRA leaders have demanded that crimes against humanity charges filed against them by the ICC be dropped, as part of the deal. Is there a tension between ensuring justice for the victims of past crimes and preventing/mitigating future suffering? How can such a tension be resolved?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">LD</hi>: The problem resists easy solution.  Once you indict a head of state as, say, a perpetrator of genocide, it becomes extremely difficult to work to a political solution with that leader.  At the same time, the ICC is a legal institution, not a political device, and it does not take its orders from negotiators or other political actors.  It would be nice to say that the dilemma is false – that perpetrators of atrocities always reveal themselves to be unreliable, treacherous parties to political settlements – though I'm not sure this is correct.  <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Muammar_al-Gaddafi">Qaddafi</ref>, arguably responsible for crimes against humanity, is now the West's poster boy of the rehabilitated strongman.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">WN</hi>: International law tribunals have been criticized for selectively trying certain perpetrators. Does this selectivity make the process any less valid? </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">LD</hi>: Selectivity can be as benign as it is necessary.  All criminal trials are selective inasmuch as only a small percentage of those who break the law ever find themselves in the dock at a criminal trial.  It is well accepted that trials of organized crime figures will invariably focus on the conduct of a few.  Obviously the goal is to go after the leaders of a criminal organization.  The ICC has specifically set itself the goal of going after leaders, not underlings.  Problems arise when selectivity is the consequence not of an effort to conserve prosecutorial resources, but born of a political calculus.  The ICTY, for example, has wisely brought prosecutions against Croats as well as Serbs.  Still, some critics have attacked the ICTY for failing to bring charges against NATO nations for the air war over Kosovo and Serbia in 1999.  I am not convinced of the merits of this specific critique, but all fair-minded persons must agree that international justice binds the strong as well as the weak.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">WN</hi>: The International Criminal Court was set up in part to counter this problem, with a promise for "universal justice" Has this attempt at ensuring fairness worked?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">LD</hi>: By its very terms, the ICC cannot deliver "universal justice," as it has no jurisdiction over crimes committed in a conflict in which neither belligerent is a member of the court.  Also, the hope that the court would bind the strong as well as the weak has obviously been frustrated by the Bush administration's concerted efforts to undermine the fledgling body.  The one ray of hope here is the fact that Bush did not block the referral of the Darfur crimes to the ICC.  The ultimate efficacy and fairness of the ICC will be demonstrated in the years to come.</p>
