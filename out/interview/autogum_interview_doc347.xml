<p>Every day is different, but that’s the basic schedule.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is your main source for political news?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Three weekly newsmagazines:  <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Economist">The Economist</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Nation">The Nation</ref></hi>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science%20(journal)"><hi rend="italic">Science</hi></ref>.   </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is your biggest political concern at the moment?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> In the next 10 years, eliminating governmental deficits, primarily in the United States and in Europe.  In the next 100 years, dealing with the social and economic consequences of the rise in sea level due to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Global_Warming">climatic warming</ref>.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">How would you assess the presidencies of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">George W. Bush</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</ref>?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Bush the Younger was unquestionably the most damaging president since <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">FDR</ref>, perhaps the most damaging of all time:  His "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot%20Act">Patriot Act</ref>" and other security measures trashed the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</ref>, our Constitution.  His deficits have never been equaled.  His foreign military adventures are the longest wars ever fought by our country.  </p>
<p>Obama was dealt a miserable hand, but even so, I’m becoming disappointed.  We still have Bush‘s <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deficit%20spending">deficit spending</ref>.  We still have <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign%20policy%20of%20the%20George%20W.%20Bush%20administration">Bush’s wars</ref>.  We still have Bush’s failure to secure <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%20–%20United%20States%20border">the border with Mexico</ref>.  We still have Bush’s <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/outsourcing">exporting American jobs overseas</ref>.  What is there to like?</p>
<p>Obama did end Bush’s "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%20City%20Policy">global gag rule</ref>," which attempted to prevent family planning agencies all over the world from even discussing abortion.  And he did make a stab at improving medical care.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What are your thoughts on <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin">Sarah Palin</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tea_Party_Movement">Tea Party Movement</ref>?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Palin was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska%20gubernatorial%20election,%202006">given a job</ref> for four years by the voters of Alaska.  When she got bored with it, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resignation%20of%20Sarah%20Palin">she handed the office key</ref> to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean%20Parnell">her lieutenant governor</ref> and walked away.  That’s not responsible behavior.</p>
<p>The Tea Party folks are on the right track in trying to get the federal budget deficit under control.  I fear, though, that they lack the patience and flexibility to do the job gracefully.   And, they’re too easily distracted by unrelated issues.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is your take on the the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health%20Care%20and%20Education%20Reconciliation%20Act%20of%202010">health care bill</ref>?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Obamacare is a step in the right direction, but it leaves intact the private insurance industry, which is a major source of waste.  We need a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Health%20Service%20(England)">public health service</ref>, like the one in England.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What are some of your foreign policy views?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> America first! Our unqualified <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%20–%20United%20States%20relations">support for Israel</ref> is doing us a great deal of damage elsewhere in the world.  We need to stop all aid, both civilian and military, to Israel until Israel abides by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo%20Accords">Oslo Accords</ref>.</p>
<p>We need to stop being the world’s bully and, instead, lead by example:  ratify <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto%20Protocol">Kyoto</ref>, ratify <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention%20on%20the%20Elimination%20of%20All%20Forms%20of%20Discrimination%20Against%20Women">CEDAW</ref>, rein in the international corporations.  </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What historical or contemporary figures do you identify with?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> You know, I think it would be appropriate to name <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter">Jimmy Carter</ref>.  I didn’t always agree with what he did, but I could sympathize with why he did it.  To the extent that any president can be, he was an honest, well-meaning person.  </p>
