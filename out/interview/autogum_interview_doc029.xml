The 501st is a fan group that dresses like the series villains for charitable events, particularly those raising funds for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The new addition to their annual display commanded long lineups throughout the day, from con-goers looking to donate in exchange for a photo-op with the massive, slug-like alien.</p>

<p>As with most major conventions, cosplayers were numerous, ranging from simple outfits that wouldn't raise an eyebrow if worn from day-to-day, to elaborately-created costumes and giant props. Outfits recognized by Wikinews' reporter ranged from classic characters like the 1960s version of Batgirl and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald%20the%20Lucky%20Rabbit">Oswald the Lucky Rabbit</ref>, a character created by Walt Disney in 1927, before Mickey, to 2010s characters from creative works like <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertale">Undertale</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic">Disney Descendants</hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League%20of%20Legends">League of Legends</ref></hi>, and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure%20Time">Adventure Time</ref></hi>. Few characters are too obscure, if they appeal to a fan: the female avatar of “hivemind” character Unity, from a single episode of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick%20and%20Morty">Rick and Morty</ref></hi>, was spotted. One woman “biting” another woman's arm would be cause for concern most places, but at a pop culture convention, it simply means that “Lilo” is re-enacting a scene with “Mertle”, as seen in the film <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo%20and%20Stitch">Lilo and Stitch</ref></hi>.</p>

<p>Wikinews talked with Cheryl, the co-host of the weekly video series "Our Didnee Side", who was dressed as Gadget Hackwrench, a mouse from the 1990s television series <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip%20'n%20Dale:%20Rescue%20Rangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</ref></hi>. Speaking for both of the hosts, she said their passion for Disney has “exploded” since starting the YouTube channel, and that they are both “creators. We can't seem to go a day without making something. We love doing Disney cosplay because it is like a beacon for other people in the fandom to come find us in a sea of other characters.” Conventions like Fan Expo Canada become “a great opportunity to meet like-minded Disney fans, and to possibly escape for the weekend from our 'boring human' lives.”</p>
