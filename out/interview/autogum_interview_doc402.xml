Caroline Weeks, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abi%20Fry">Abi Fry</ref> and Lizzy Carey comprise the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aurora%20borealis">aurora borealis</ref> that backs this haunting, shimmering <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zither">zither</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glockenspiel">glockenspiel</ref> peacock, and the only complaint coming from the audience at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery%20Ballroom%20">Bowery Ballroom</ref> last Tuesday was that they could not camp out all night underneath these celestial bodies.    
<p>We live in the age of the lazy tendency to categorize the work of one artist against another, and Khan has had endless exultations as the next <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Björk">Björk</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate%20Bush">Kate Bush</ref>;  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixousie%20Sioux">Sixousie Sioux</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie%20Nicks">Stevie Nicks</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinead%20O'Connor">Sinead O'Connor</ref>, the list goes on until it is almost meaningless as comparison does little justice to the sound and vision of the band.  "I think Bat For Lashes are beyond a trend or fashion band," said Jefferson Hack, publisher of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazed%20&amp;%20Confused%20(magazine)">Dazed &amp; Confused</ref></hi> magazine. "[Khan] has an ancient power...she is in part shamanic."  She describes her aesthetic as "powerful women with a cosmic edge" as seen in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane%20Birkin">Jane Birkin</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico">Nico</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra">Cleopatra</ref>.  And these women are being heard.  "I love the harpsichord and the sexual ghost voices and bowed saws," said <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiohead">Radiohead</ref>'s <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom%20Yorke">Thom Yorke</ref> of the track <hi rend="italic">Horse and I</hi>. "This song seems to come from the world of Grimm's fairytales."</p>
<p>Bat's debut album, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur%20And%20Gold">Fur And Gold</ref></hi>, was nominated for the 2007 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury%20Prize">Mercury Prize</ref>, and they were seen as the dark horse favorite until it was announced <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaxons">Klaxons</ref> had won.  Even <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladbrokes%20of%20England">Ladbrokes</ref>, the largest gambling company in the United Kingdom, had put their money on Bat for Lashes.  "It was a surprise that Klaxons won," said Khan, "but I think everyone up for the award is brilliant and would have deserved to win."</p>
<p>Natasha recently spoke with <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:David_Shankbone">David Shankbone</ref> about art, transvestism and drug use in the music business.  </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Do you have any favorite books?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">NK:</hi>  [<hi rend="italic">Laughs</hi>]  I'm not the best about finishing books.  What I usually do is I will get into a book for a period of time, and then I will dip into it and get the inspiration and transformation in my mind that I need, and then put it away and come back to it.  But I have a select rotation of cool books, like <hi rend="italic">Women Who Run With the Wolves</hi> by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa%20Pinkola%20Estés">Clarissa Pinkola Estés</ref> and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%20Birds">Little Birds</ref></hi> by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaïs%20Nin">Anaïs Nin</ref>.  Recently, <hi rend="italic">Catching the Big Fish</hi> by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%20Lynch">David Lynch</ref>.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Lynch just came out with a movie last year called <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland%20Empire%20(film)">Inland Empire</ref></hi>.  I <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/John_Vanderslice_plays_New_York_City:_Wikinews_interview">interviewed John Vanderslice</ref> last night at the Bowery Ballroom and he <hi rend="italic">raved</hi> about it!</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">NK:</hi>  I haven't seen it yet!</p>
