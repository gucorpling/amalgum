<p>Heading into its fourth and final season, attendees got a chance to see the season opener of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%20Wars:%20Rebels">Star Wars: Rebels</ref></hi> on Saturday, followed by a panel. The event has had a continuing relationship with the series, screening other episodes previously.

<p>The book <hi rend="italic">Star Wars Made Easy</hi>, targeted to non-fans to get up to speed on the fictional universe's various facts and figures, was ironically launched by DK Canada for a room of fans of the franchise. Author Christian Blauvelt answered questions from the audience on topics like his opinion on Midiclorians — he understands fan contention, but suggested that science and religion can co-exist, like in the real world — quizzed the audience on trivia, and signed copies of his book.</p>
<p>Some panels were quite ahead of the curve: one on <hi rend="italic">Star Wars</hi> costume and prop building discussed building Porgs figures, despite the film <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Last%20Jedi">The Last Jedi</ref></hi> not being released to theatres yet.</p>

<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York%20Regional%20Police">York Regional Police</ref> were at the event with United and Unity, two brightly lit characters of their own creation. The force received funding in 2014 from the Provincial Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy  to create a short film featuring the character United, receiving positive recognition locally. “Our United superhero program is part of our on-going efforts to connect with our community and show police in a different light,” YRP Constable Andy Pattenden told Wikinews. He explains that the officers who developed the project have a background in film-making, and “serve as an opportunity for us to start a conversation with youth and connect with them at a non-traditional level.”</p>
