<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Do you think that conformity is gone?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MM:</hi>  It's on the wane.  I think everyone still goes to the gym, but it's not as obsessive and I think the new people coming up in the gay community are more interested in embracing their <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/effeminacy">feminine sides</ref> and presenting their bodies 'as is.'  The main reason I know this is happening is that I am getting more sexual interest, whereas all through the 1990s I was completely invisible because I wasn't a gym queen.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  You inhabit that partying, gym-fetish world, the one you criticize.  How do you criticize, yet live off of that world?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MM:</hi>  Because I celebrate it more than I criticize it.  I am attracted to people on the edge, the gays, the drag queens, anybody who comes to New York and becomes celebrated for whatever reason they were criticized in their hometown.  The nightclub scene is where all of these diverse people come together and create something celebratory, and I am totally in favor of it.  But while I'm <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, I always feel like the weirdo in the corner because I'm <hi rend="italic">not</hi> doing drugs, I'm <hi rend="italic">not</hi> going to the gym, I'm not doing all the cliched things.  I'm totally able to lash out and say, 'Look at you fools.'</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Were you ever part of that world?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MM:</hi>  No.  I'm too much of a control freak to submit myself to drugs, or I'm too scared. I don't even drink.  I had a sip of vodka last night and...</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  [<hi rend="italic">Laughs</hi>] —you look a little hung today—</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MM:</hi>  [<hi rend="italic">Laughs</hi>] —it does!  Really, it hit me with a wallop because it was my first one in thirteen years and it really reminded me of why I can't do it.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  You recently did a column that opened talking about how gays don't want to bottom anymore; later you talk about Michael Moore's <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko">Sicko</ref></hi> and the problem of hospitals over-medicating their patients.  Do you think that style of mixing glitz and substance reaches people, or do you think they tend to gloss the substantive parts?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">MM:</hi>  I've always mixed a conscience with a lack thereof; I've always put serious issues into the mix of my party-going.  That's just my style, and I think people <hi rend="italic">do</hi> appreciate reading me when they are reading me as a guilty pleasure when they come across some serious discussion of a topic that pushes buttons.  People love it.  I get the most reaction to those.  I got a huge reaction to the bottom thing.  That's not really a serious topic...</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  It seems to be because it's a reaction of a community to a health related topic, since you were saying it was a health consciousness that is causing a dearth of bottoms.  Bare-backing is still the rage.</hi></p>
