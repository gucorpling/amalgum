<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> The freedom and innovation of inventors and the entrepreneurialism of their investors to produce substitute markets, products and/or services to compete with any of the same being seized or monopolized.  </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">In context of government's role, what are your stands on the legality of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incest">incest</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bestiality">bestiality</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Child_pornography">child pornography</ref>?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> As reprehensible as are incest and bestiality, policing them remains a matter of state sovereignty under the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">10th Amendment</ref>. However, allowance of child pornography entails the government's enforcement of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Consitution">5th</ref>, 13th and 14th Amendment violations against children and could therefore be policed by the Federal Government should the States or <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenism">Native Nations</ref> fail to do so.   </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Do you disagree with any parts of the Bill of Rights?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> No.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Should the people of the United States have a right to constitutionally amend the Bill of Rights to increase the power of the federal government and limit individual rights?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Yes, according to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Locke">Locke</ref>, our Founders, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastiat">Bastiat</ref> and the Philosophy of Liberty, no government actions conducted outside the consent of the People are legitimate. The Constitution is our codification of that consent and, as such, it is supreme over all other political ideologies. Of course I would very publicly argue, using the Philosophy of Liberty, for the People to NEVER consider such measures but it is their right to affect them by way of the amendment process. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Should the lives of American citizens be valued above citizens of other nations?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> As it applies to the Natural Rights, those being Life, Liberty and Property, of all People found to be under the jurisdiction of the United States; no. However, as it applies to providing for the common Defense of We the People and the Republic; yes.      </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What are your views on immigration?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> I will fight to eliminate the social <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/welfare%20state">welfare state</ref> and the high taxes required to pay for it, which are chasing our jobs and prosperity overseas. Simultaneously, I will seek from the Congress a very robust and permissive immigration policy to help grow our <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20middle%20class">middle class</ref>, making us more competitive with other emerging markets around the world.</p>
<p>I will deploy the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Marshals%20Service">U.S. Marshals</ref> backed up by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US%20National%20Guard">National Guard</ref> to protect Border State property owners from violent cross-border organized crime enterprises and syndicates. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">When is war necessary?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> When the Lives, Liberty or Property of We the People are being infringed by a foreign entity.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Are you a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11%20Truth%20movement">truther</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack%20Obama%20citizenship%20conspiracy%20theories">birther</ref>, neither or both?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Neither, although I do intend to ensure the highest level of executive and administrative transparency which will do much to resolve the propensity of some towards conspiracy theories, as well as expose potential conspiracies before they can fully develop. Since this <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%20government">transparency</ref> has been sorely lacking from our government of late, I will direct the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</ref> to fully investigate any reasonably perceived recent lapses in the executive oversight of the federal government's activities.</p>
