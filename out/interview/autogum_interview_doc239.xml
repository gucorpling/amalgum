<p><hi rend="bold">Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process? Why did you choose to run in this constituency?</hi></p>
<p>Seven years ago, I had a life-changing experience. I was paralyzed from the Guillain Barre Syndrome   and spent weeks in hospital unable to move around. I've since recovered but those weeks put things in perspective. I had time; I was removed from my daily life, where like many others I was spending my time chasing a dream of a bigger salary, bigger house. I watched TV; I saw programs about the environment and the effects of global warming and decided I should personally do "something" about it. I joined the Green party because the party's platform reflects my own values with its strong concern for the environment. I would like my children and others like them to enjoy clean air, clean land, and clean water and a sustainable future.</p>
<p>I also believe in serving my community. Willowdale is important to me, I have lived in the neighbourhood for seven years, most of the time I've been in Canada. It is place that is welcoming community that represents the best of Toronto. I founded [www.findmore.ca a community neighbourhood website], where I write articles on the environment and social issues and engage with members to form neighbourhood groups to discuss how they impact on local concerns. I am a volunteer coach for my kids’ soccer and ice hockey teams because I believe that involving children in a healthy life style is essential to their life-long well-being.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What prior political experience do you have? What skills and insight can you bring to office, from other non-political positions you may have held?</hi></p>
<p>My grandfather was involved in city politics in Sweden and I learnt from, during my military service in Sweden, I was the union leader of the soldiers rights. I am a resource manager at a Toronto software firm. Coming from the world of project management, I know how to manage, motivate and empower people. My business experience has also taught me, that it’s important to fulfill promises you make to people, a crucial skill for a political representative.</p>
