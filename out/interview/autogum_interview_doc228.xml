<head>CanadaVOTES: Libertarian John Kittridge in St. Paul's</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Monday, October 13, 2008</hi></p>
<p>In an attempt to speak with as many candidates as possible during the 2008 Canadian federal election, Wikinews has talked via email with <hi rend="bold">John Kittredge</hi>. John is a candidate in <hi rend="bold">Toronto, Ontario's St. Paul riding</hi>, running under the <hi rend="bold">Libertarian Party</hi> banner. Libertarians are a minor, registered political party; they are looking to earn their first ever seat in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Incumbent Carolyn Bennett of the Liberals is running against Libertarian Kittridge, Conservative Heather Jewell, New Democrat Anita Agrawal, and Justin Erdman, a Green. Bennett was the Minister of Health under previous Prime Minister Paul Martin's Liberal government. Since it was created in 1935, the riding has been batted about between the Liberals and the now defunct Progessive Conservative party.</p>
<p>The following is an interview with Mr. Kittridge, conducted via email. The interview has had very limited editing, to eliminate in-text mentions of website addresses, but is otherwise left exactly as sent to Wikinews.

<p><hi rend="bold">Why are you running for political office, why at the federal level, why this party, and why in this riding?</hi></p>
<p>The mono-focus of our Party at both the Federal and Provincial level is less—MUCH less—government. I have been a member of various provincial and federal Libertarian Parties for almost 40 years and am committed to the proposition that "less government is better government." I have observed the steady degradation of the Canadian character, the increasing limitation of our independence and the erosion of our economy as a result of inexorable "nanny state" control over the years. I want positive change and a better future with more self-reliance, more opportunity and an option-filled environment for the residents of St Paul, for all Canadians and, as a consequence for myself, my family and especially for my two-year old grandson.</p>
<p>St. Paul's because it is an intensely interesting collection of neighborhoods full of passionate people who care. I respect my constituents and feel every one of them deserves a much better framework in which to express and achieve their potential than the pap offered by the mainline parties to buy their votes. Unfortunately most of them feel that more government, more regulations, more tax spending, more direction and fewer options constitute the solution to any and all of their concerns.</p>
<p>Like other Libertarians, I run to broaden the awareness of the less government option and of its desirability and practicality - also to deepen the debate and stimulate the people I talk with to think about a new way of doing things.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your previous work/volunteer/life experience to serving your constituents?</hi></p>
<p>I ran as a Libertarian in last fall's Ontario Provincial election but had not been particularly active before that other than as a party member. My day job is management consulting. I work in Canada and internationally with large clients, both public and private, to improve their processes and performance. I bring this results-focused, real-world perspective to the less-government debate. In the unlikely event of election, I would bring it to Ottawa - much in need of a house-cleaning and a strong dose of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
