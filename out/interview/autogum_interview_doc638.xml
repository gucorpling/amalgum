<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Capital punishment is a controversial subject as well. How would you handle it?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> I support capital punishment; however something more needs to be done to insure that the wrong person does not die.  More safeguards must be put in place.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">As president, would you try to limit government presence in people's lives?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> Yes;  lower taxes and less government. We need a lot less government in our face; and less taxes to support big government which is way too powerful. I would cut the federal government in many areas.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">How would you handle homosexual marriages?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> This is a state issue and the federal government has no Constitutional right to get involved in this issue.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">How would you handle the environment?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> I would be the best president this nation has had in regards to the environment since President Teddy Roosevelt; I rank him right up their in high regards next to George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Great Men. We can greatly reduce our dependence on foreign gas and oil by 'burning' clean fuel.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What exactly does the Constitution Party stand for?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> The Constitution and the Bill of Rights; go to their web site and read their (our) platform.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Why do you think it is necessary that a third party candidate be voted into the White House this year?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> End the wars, Save Social Security; I am on a Constitution Party national committee dealing with Social Security and our committee has a very good plan to not only save Social Security, but keep it well for 100 years; get it out of the hands of Congress which has robbed it. I will also end the taxation of ALL Social Security benefits for those that are retired and eliminate the earnings requirement. I will also end free trade and bring good quality, high paying jobs back top the USA with good health benefits.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Do you think you have a good shot at winning the Constitution Party nomination? If so, do you think it is really possible to win the general election?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> I will know Saturday the 26th if I win the nomination of the Constitution Party.  As to wining the general election, I'm very sure that I will do far better then we have done in the previous 20 years as a 'third' party.  I'm not only more qualified to be commander in chief then either the Democrat or Republican, but will be far better for the country.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">We haven't seen many Max Riekse billboards, commercials or television appearances. Will we if you win the Constitution Party nomination? Or are you trying to have a more grassroots campaign?</hi></p>
