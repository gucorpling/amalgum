<head>Wikinews interviews organiser of New Zealand's Rock2Wgtn festival Phil Sprey</head><p><hi rend="bold">Wednesday, March 26, 2008</hi></p>
<p>Across <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter">Easter</ref> weekend <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington">Wellington</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</ref> was host to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock2Wgtn">Rock2Wgtn</ref>, an international two-day <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hard%20rock">hard rock</ref> festival. Large crowds showed up at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westpac%20Stadium">Westpac Stadium</ref> to see the various acts. The world has never seen an event of this kind before.</p>
<p>Day one featured three theatrical acts. <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Finland">Finnish</ref> band <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Lordi">Lordi</ref>, known for their monster costumes, opened the night. They were followed by the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">US</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shock%20rock">shock rocker</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%20Cooper">Alice Cooper</ref>, whose themed set included the horror theatrics regularly associated with him and a hanging stunt he recently restarted after a gallows collapse nearly killed him two decades ago. The night was headlined by the distinctively costumed band <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss%20(band)">KISS</ref>, complete with their famed black-and-white makeup.</p>
<p>The first major act on the stage on day two was the American hard rock/<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glam%20metal">glam metal</ref> band <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison%20(band)">Poison</ref>. After Poison, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">British</ref> act <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitesnake">Whitesnake</ref> took to the stage and performed their set to the crowd. British-born American rocker <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</ref>, who, as well as a solo career, fronts the world-famous <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</ref>, was the second night's headline act.</p>
<p>The festival's entertainment did not stop at the six main acts. There was also support performances from three New Zealand bands - The Symphony of Screams, The Valves and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic%20Altar">Sonic Altar</ref>. Their sets were accompanied by a special effects package from award-winning studio <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weta%20Workshops">Weta Workshops</ref>, who are known for their work on movies such as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20film%20trilogy">The Lord of the Rings film trilogy</ref>. This came in the form of 'Drusila the Dragon', which rose up to a height of six foot and wigspan and moved for the audience, shining lasers from its eyes and breathing red smoke. Flame Fire Productions were hired to put on a fire show featuring several dancers alongside the performers. Also performing were six local guitarists and a group of '<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zombie">zombie</ref>' cheerleaders.</p>
<p>Despite the crowds that flocked to the event, however, it has recently become apparent that financial trouble has hit the festival. Although figures remain to be confirmed, an estimated <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NZ$">NZ$</ref>750,000 has been lost.</p>
<p>Wikinews secured an exclusive interview with Phil Sprey of Capital C Concerts, who organised the festival. The entire interview is now available below.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Phil:</hi> Easter in Wellington is normally a quieter place and as we are resident here we were working to not only present a phenomenal experience but to drive short range international tourism and domestic tourism. To do this we needed an impressive line-up and a format that was as much theatrical as it was festival. On a company level we were demonstrating that NZ has the ability to stage big events and have the planning, equipment services etc to deliver. We did this well beyond expectation and every artist management was more than satisfied with the production. We also wanted to brand our name to agents and management around the world - we have done this as well.</p>
