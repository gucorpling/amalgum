<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Tell us about the Molossian culture.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> Well, Molossian culture is a mix of several sources. Above all, we value the lifestyle of the western U.S., especially as it pertains to living in a wide-open place such as we do. Life here is fairly relaxed and easygoing, and we do most things together as a nation and as a family. In addition, we have absorbed elements of other cultures.  The town of Steinsdorf on the Molossia Railroad is, of course, German. Our National Hero, Emperor Norton, comes from San Francisco. Cookie Dough, our National Treat, is adopted from the United Provinces of Utopia, a micronation with whom we once associated.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">How are Molossia's relations with other micronations?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> We maintain friendly, informal relations with just about every micronation.  Our hand is always outstretched in friendship. With some nations we are particularly close, such as with TorHavn and Vikesland, due to the long and positive relationship that we have had. We count ourselves lucky to have good friends among many other micronations and micronationalists, from all over the world.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">The land claimed by Molossia is also claimed by the United States. How are relations between your country and the U.S.? Have there been any altercations? Or do you generally leave each other alone?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> No, there haven't been any altercations between Molossia and the US.  We generally ignore each other. We can't really live without the US, though, since they provide a significant amount of our consumer goods, Molossia being rather resource-poor. And as long as we don't do anything objectionable, they leave us alone.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Besides the League of Small Nations, a nearly defunct association devoted to the prosperity of all land-claiming micronations, does Molossia belong to any international organizations?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> Actually, no we don't, although we certainly have over the years, especially league of Secessionist States (LoSS), although we withdrew from that organization years ago. Incidentally, the League of Small nations is in the process of being resurrected, with an eye toward increased intermicronational activities, to possibly include supporting a charity.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Can one become a citizen of Molossia? Is honorary citizenship granted?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Presdient Baugh:</hi> Well, Molossian citizenship is only extended to actual, physical residents of Molossia, and we are not accepting any immigrants at this time. There just isn't room. Honorary citizenship is indeed granted, generally to those individuals that have performed some special service to Molossia, and have thus earned our gratitude.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Are Molossians dual U.S. citizens? Do you pay U.S. taxes?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Presdient Baugh:</hi> Yes, all Molossians are dual US citizens.  Most Molossians actually work in the US and live in Molossia, largely due to our small size and lack of resources. And no, as a sovereign nation, we do not pay taxes to the US. However, we contribute an equivalent amount to the US in Foreign Aid, in the hopes that they will someday fix their roads!</p>
