<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  You said seventh and eighth grade.  Were you always listening to people like Bowie or bands like the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Velvet%20Underground">Velvets</ref>, or did you have an Eddie Murphy <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party%20All%20The%20Time">My Girl Wants to Party All the Time</ref></hi> phase?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JV:</hi>  The thing for me that was the uncool music, I had an older brother who was really into <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive%20rock">prog music</ref>, so it was like <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentle%20Giant">Gentle Giant</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes%20(band)">Yes</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%20Crimson">King Crimson</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis%20(band)">Genesis</ref>.  All the new Genesis that was happening at the time was mind-blowing.  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</ref>'s solo record...we had every single solo record, like the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike%20Rutherford">Mike Rutherford</ref> solo record.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Do you shun that music now or is it still a part of you?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JV:</hi>  Oh no, I appreciate all music.  I'm an anti-snob.  Last night when I was going to sleep I was watching <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean's%20Thirteen">Ocean's Thirteen</ref></hi> on my computer.  It's not like I always need to watch some super-fragmented, fucked-up art movie like <hi rend="italic">Inland Empire</hi>.  It's part of how I relate to the audience.  We end every night by going out into the audience and playing acoustically, directly, right in front of the audience, six inches awayâ€”that is part of my philosophy.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Do you think New York or San Francisco suffers from artistic elitism more?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JV:</hi>  I think because of the Internet that there is less and less elitism; everyone is into some little superstar on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">YouTube</ref> and everyone can now appreciate now <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</ref>.  There is no need for factions.  There is too much information, and I think the idea has broken down that some people...I mean, when was the last time you met someone who was into <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ska">ska</ref>, or into <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punk%20rock">punk</ref>, and they dressed the part?  I don't meet those people anymore.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Everything is fusion now, like cuisine.  It's hard to find a purely French or purely Vietnamese restaurant.  </hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JV:</hi>  Exactly!  When I was in high school there were factions.  I remember the guys who listened to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%20Flag">Black Flag</ref>.  They looked the part!  Like they were in theater.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  You still find some <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo">emos</ref>.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">JV:</hi>  Yes, I believe it.  But even emo kids, compared to their older brethren, are so open-minded.  I opened up for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny%20Day%20Real%20Estate">Sunny Day Real Estate</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro%20the%20Lion">Pedro the Lion</ref>, and I did not find their fans to be the cliquish people that I feared, because I was never playing or marketed in the emo genre.  I would say it's because of the Internet.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  You could clearly create music that is more mainstream pop and be successful with it, but you choose a lot of very personal and political themes for your music.  Are you ever tempted to put out a studio album geared toward the charts just to make some cash?</hi></p>
