<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why do you want to represent your ward on council?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I feel we need a change in our ward. We have had the same councillor for the last twenty years. Some of the outcomes of the councillors decisions are evident today for lack of long-term thinking.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Of the decisions made by council since the last election, which one would you have changed, and why?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Consideration for taxpayers financially and environmentally.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> How are you currently involved in the community?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I live, work and volunteer in the community. I am a mentor for Leadership Peel.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What qualities or experiences do you possess, that make you more desirable than the incumbent?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I have worked for the Region of Peel. I would offer an insiders look to what goes on in the Region of Peel. I am open minded, energetic and a team player. I like challenges and tend to think outside the box for solutions to problems.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Much of Brampton's existing council is quite seasoned in the civic political process. What could you bring to the table as a "rookie", above and beyond the current roster of councillors?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> A new approach would be welcomed on this Ward. The councillor in this ward has been very comfortable in his views and is not listening to his constituents. The last time I spoke to him on the issue of taxes and the waste of money at the Region, he was rude and verbally abusive on the phone. This is not acceptable in our elected representative. A cooperative approach is more acceptable.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> List the three most important issues in your campaign.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Urban growth, taxes, and gridlock.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What one election issue do you feel is most relevant to your ward in this election?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> To do what is best for the community.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi>  The Rose Theatre recently launched. What are your thoughts on this facility? Have you had a chance to tour it yet?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Time is tell if this was a good idea or not. I have not had an opportunity to see the facility, but I am sure I will.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi>  The province has strongly encouraged the development of high-density residences near the downtown. Do these buildings fit in with your vision of the downtown? How much say should other levels of government have in urban planning?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> The governments should work together for what is best for the community.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> How do you feel about Brampton's rate of expansion? Council recently capped the annual amount of new development; do you agree completely with this decision, would you have slowed development even further, or not have imposed a cap at all?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> We have to consider environmental issues and services have to be in place before any more development happens. Slowly down the development is a good idea. It is best to catch up  before anymore developments happens. The land will be there, what is the hurry? There is no accountable from the councillors whom lacked in long term planning.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why should businesses be attracted to locating in Brampton?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Brampton is still small community with much growth potential. It has something for everyone.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> How could Brampton further itself in attracting corporate investment?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Dealing with issues in a professional matter and offering solutions.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I would like to some changes for the future of Brampton.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What does Brampton mean to you?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I would like to see a community that is a healthy environment to live in.</p>
