 This article mentions the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</ref>, one of its projects, or people related to it. <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> is a project of the Wikimedia Foundation.
<p>Four years ago, on February 9, a major Polish newspaper, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazeta%20Wyborcza">Gazeta Wyborcza</ref></hi> published a report detailing a hoax in Polish Wikipedia entitled <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk%20Batuta%20hoax">Henryk Batuta</ref>. The author of the report was Konrad Godlewski; several weeks later, Godlewski began editing <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pl:Strona_główna">Polish Wikipedia</ref>. The results of his work include one featured article – <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pl:Pismo%20chińskie">pismo chińskie</ref> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%20language">Polish</ref> for "Chinese character") – as well as various articles relating to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">China</ref>.</p>
<p>During our interview, Godlewski discusses memes, hoaxes, and the <hi rend="italic">Batuta Army</hi> – the creators of the hoax his paper reported on. From February this year, a special project on the Polish Wikipedia, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pl:Wikipedia:BATUTA">BATUTA</ref>, saw a makeshift taskforce work on improving the quality of content. BATUTA stands for "Bezwzględna Akcja Troskliwego Uźródławiania Tysięcy artykłów", roughly translated as "Ruthless Action of Carefully Adding References to Thousands of Articles".</p>

<p>((Wikinews))<hi rend="bold">  You are the author of the first news story about the Henryk Batuta hoax, uncovered four years ago in the Polish Wikipedia. Do you remember when did the authors of the hoax first come to you? Was it just before the publication or earlier? The hoax was uncovered on January 20 and the story was published on February 9, so there was a period of time between those two dates... </hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Konrad Godlewski</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> I found them myself. Accidentally. I was looking for new, interesting stories about the Internet. My newspaper colleague Robert Sankowski told me he had heard somewhere about a friend of a friend who had been doing some huge scam in Wikipedia. Step by step, I had traced that person. This was a few months before the publication, back in late 2005. A representative from Batuta's Army asked me to hold on with publication, even though the article had already been visible in Wikipedia for many months.</p>
<p>((WN))<hi rend="bold"> Did you follow the process of deletion of the article?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">KG</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Yes, for the last few days. The Army from the very beginning wanted to test Wikipedia's defense mechanisms. It was then when I had a meeting with them and they told me about their views. They knew their hoax was nearing its end and they wanted to close it somehow. </p>
<p>((WN))<hi rend="bold"> In your story you wrote they wanted to show how thoughtless the people of Warsaw were when it came to names of streets and neighborhoods. Now it turns out it was more about Wikipedia and its mechanisms. </hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">KG</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> It was about a number of things at the same time. It was easy to notice the hoax was created by really smart people. Testing Wikipedia was one of the aspects of this entire thing.</p>
