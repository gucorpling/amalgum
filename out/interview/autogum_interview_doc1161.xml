<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Describe the three most important issues in your campaign.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Crime, Market Value Assessments, traffic Isseues anda pedesstrian</p>
<p>Friendly Community</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What one election issue do you feel is most relevant to your ward in this election?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Market Value Assessments I am determined to address concerns over the recent Realty Tax Assessments  and increases. The provincial government has recognized that MPAC is not fair and is not working properly. It is now willing to review the process. This re-definition will require vision, common sense and ingenuity.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I have been a resident in Ward 16 and operated my own business at 1175 Avenue Road for over 40 years. I have always believed that it is important to give of my time and energy to my community. As a member and chairperson of the Avenue Road Business Association, I have also been involved with business development in the area for over 20 years. My children grew up and attended elementary and secondary schools in the area. As I have watched the neighbourhoods change across the ward, I have shared concerns with my neighbours and business colleagues over issues that can be dealt with in the proper way to the benefit of all the people living here. I passionately care about my city and my ward. Years ago, I ran for council because of my love for and pride in this community, that has not only given me my livelihood, but also a sense of belonging. As a caring resident and business owner, I believe that I have a solid and well founded understanding of the issues and concerns of this Ward.</p>
<p>I am committed to INTEGRITY, ACCOUNTABILITY and RESPONSIBLE REPRESENTATION.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why do you want to represent this particular ward on council?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> The solutions to serious issues should be decided by the community, not by self-appointed individuals, small or special interest groups, politicians or corporations who maintain their own personal or corporate agendas.</p>
<p>No one interested party should possess the power of representation. The community as a whole must be respected.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> How are you currently involved in the community?</p>

<head id="Yigal_Rifkind">Yigal Rifkind</head>
<p>27-year-old <hi rend="bold">Yigal Rifkind</hi> is a lawyer.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Describe the three most important issues in your campaign.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi></p>
<p>1. Revitalization of the Bathurst Corridor: While Yonge St. has seen much of the economic boom of Toronto in the past forty years, Bathurst has long since lagged behind. It is time to bring new insights into the issues that affect the majority of our constituents. It is time to change City By-Laws regarding economic development on the Bathurst corridor. It is time for new thinking.</p>
<p>2. Transportation: The TTC currently runs at %120 capacity, and while Toronto continues to grow, new subway lines have not opened up. In fact the opposite has happened (see the shelving of the Eglinton Subway lines in 1995 after digging had already begun</p>
<p>3. Crime and Violence: We need increased police presence in the Lawrence and Bathurst Area as it has been the scene of a number of violent and non-violent crime.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi>What one election issue do you feel is most relevant to your ward in this election?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Transportation, Toronto will keep getting more and more congested (especially because of the Street Car lane only on St. Claire).(sic) Something must be done.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process? </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I felt that the transportation issue was not being addressed.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why do you want to represent this particular ward on council?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I have lived the majority of my life in this neighborhood, and have taken an active interest in this community for many years. From attending Forest Hill Collegiate, to attending the Sharrei Shomayim Synagogue at Glencairn and Bathurst, to opening my own law firm at Eglinton and Bathurst, I have had a close relationship with the area in which I am now running for City Councilor.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> How are you currently involved in the community?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I am on a community Baseball, Basketball and soccer team, I work with the Out of the Cold Program for the Community and the majority of my legal aid clientelle all come from my community.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What does Toronto mean to you? </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I grew up here, Toronto is the greatest city in the world.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Which council decision (since the 2003 election) do you feel the city/your ward should be most proud of, and which was least desirable?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> The least desirable was Karen Stintz support of a by-law which would allow Police Officers to not wear name tags (which prevents accountability). The best was a vote against an increase in residential property tax (which passed anyway).</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> If you were elected as a "rookie" councillor, What would you bring to the table beyond the incumbent? </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> A desire to execute different things. A subways system going East West along Eglinton would be the best thing that the City Council could do for this city.</p>
