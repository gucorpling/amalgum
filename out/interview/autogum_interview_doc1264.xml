<head id="Interview">Interview</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> List the three most important issues in your campaign.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Getting Brampton to a better balance between Residential and Commercial interests within the city, to help create a greater corporate tax base and more sustainable civic model. A transportation and road system that works, allowing shorter commutes, less environmental impact and greater opportunities for families to share time together. Facilities and recreational services more in line with demands in our area, particularly Ward 10.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What one election issue do you feel is most relevant to your ward in this election?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> Holding the line on property tax increases. The city has already declared 2007 to be a difficult budget year and we must be very aggressive in finding ways to curb our ballooning tax bill.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> What qualities or experiences do you possess, that make you more desirable than the incumbent? </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> My international experience has allowed me a greater understanding of how different cultures deal with the day to day and universal challenges all people face. This has allowed me to become a very flexible and open minded thinker, and I believe I have great strength in being able to communicate and build bridges between differing  beliefs and ideas. Also I will be committed to public service and my constituents full time, and have a passion and energy for helping people reach positive, effective resolutions to their concerns.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Why do you want to represent your ward on council?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> I was born and raised in Bramalea, and remember the land my home stands on as open farmers fields and rivers.At the same time I remember a city that had a plan of controlled,managed growth, a huge sense of community and bursting with civic pride. I believe we can return to this, despite our rapid expansion, by injecting our council with new vision and passion for our city while remembering that from the past which makes our city great.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Q:</hi> Of the decisions made by council since the last election, which one would you have changed, and why?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">A:</hi> The Master plan to develop Ching Park has been delayed and rewritten several times, and each succeeded report and consultation costs taxpayers hundreds of thousands in wasted time and construction costs. An investment in this park with a bit of progressive thinking towards the activities that can take place there and the way in which the park is managed is of huge benefit to the entire east side of Brampton, and additional delays and toe-dragging on the issue is only adding expense and problems to the issue.</p>
