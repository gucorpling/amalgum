<p>
<hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Ryan O'Sullivan</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  My name is Ryan O' Sullivan. I am a comic book writer from the UK. I have written books such as <hi rend="italic">Void Trip</hi> for Image Comics, <hi rend="italic">Fearscape</hi> for Vault Comics, as well as a lot of video game-based comics, like <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark%20Souls">Dark Souls</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Evil%20Within">The Evil Within</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer%2040,000">Warhammer 40,000</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic">Eisenhorn</hi>. So that's me in a nutshell.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">A</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  How old are you, and when did you start writing comics?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">ROS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  I am in my 30s, and I started writing comics, ah, well I don't know, I have been writing all my life, but I have done it professionally for, I'll say, two years now. Maybe three.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">A</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  How was your first job like?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">ROS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  My first â€” my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> job? Oh boy! [Laughs] That was um, it was interesting. So the first comic that I did was called <hi rend="italic">Turncoat</hi>, and that was purely online. So that everyday, we'd put another page of the comic out. And that's how I got known because people go online, they'd read the comic, and then after a certain amount of time, we'd collect it all together in a big comic, and they say that the first time you do a comic, you should make it small, you do a few pages just to learn it. But for mine, I did it for a hundred and sixty four pages  And I'm thrown in at the deep end, and somehow I managed to swim. But it was, it was pretty stressful, but was very fun[?].</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">A</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Well, so how many companies have you worked with?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">ROS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Oh! Um... I would say around half a dozen, at a guess [...] Image Comics, I have worked with Vault Comics, I've worked with T-Pub: that's a small UK publisher. I've worked with Titan Comics. And what's interesting is with the video game comics, that means I've worked with a lot of other companies as well, like video game companies, so, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda%20Softworks">Bethesda</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEGA">SEGA</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relic%20Entertainment">Relic</ref>. I feel I'm missing people out now, just 'cause it's quite a lot. But yeah, it's been a lot of people. But I would say, of them all, if I could talk to fourteen-year-old Ryan, and tell him what his future would be like, the thing that might excite him the most is the fact that I wrote a comic for Warhammer and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games%20Workshop">Games Workshop</ref>, because that's what was my jam as a kid.</p>
