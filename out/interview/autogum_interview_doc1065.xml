<p><hi rend="bold">What makes you the most desirable of all candidates running in the riding?</hi></p>
<p>For 17 years, we have had an NDP representative who has sat in the opposition backbenches for the most part. This has meant that the voices of Trinity-Spadina residents has been soft, and getting real action to improve their lives locally has been the unfortunate result. Together with a John Tory government, I will provide a voice within a governing body to ensure that Trinity-Spadina’s needs and concerns are finally addressed adequately and appropriately. Knowing Mr. Tory, who is a lifelong Torontonian, this partnership will be a prosperous one for this riding. Our party’s leader believes that your word isn’t just important – it’s EVERYTHING.  I proudly share that principle, and I know the residents of Trinity-Spadina share it as well.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What do you feel are the three most important issues to voters in your riding? Are these the same top three issues that are most important to you? What would you do to address these issues?</hi></p>
<p>As the only candidate in the three major parties to actually live in Trinity-Spadina, I share the sentiments of my fellow Trinity-Spadina residents in pointing out these three issues in particular:</p>
<p><list type="ordered"><item>Toronto’s fiscal situation.  Currently, Toronto is having financial issues and the City Council is looking to implement taxation powers granted to them under the City of Toronto Act, which will look to pay for its shortfall by reaching into the pockets of hardworking Torontonians. I feel like there’s enough money coming out of their pockets already. John Tory will ensure that the city is spending their money efficiently, and will then operate under the theme that property tax money should be used primarily for LOCAL programs. This means that we will look to begin uploading social services following a provincial-municipal review that will be ready in time for Toronto’s next budget and a PC government’s first budget.  Additionally, a John Tory government will put all CA$1.1-billion in Gas Tax revenues into Transportation, including $800-million in Public Transit---$150-million in the first year, with much of that going to the GTA.</item></list></p>
<p><list type="ordered"><item>Taxes.  In addition to the local taxes that Toronto residents fear will be coming down the pipes, they are suffering immeasurably from the rapidly escalating property taxes they are faced with. Some property assessments have gone up as high as 150%, leaving people on fixed incomes, particularly seniors, struggling to face this challenge and often deciding to sell the home they’ve lived in for years. John Tory doesn’t feel this is fair or necessary, and that’s why we are introducing a 5% cap on rising assessments per year, so people can budget for marginal increases instead of a massive hike out of nowhere. And of course, we will get rid of Dalton McGuinty’s #1 broken promise, the regressive health tax, beginning immediately in our first year by taking it completely away from those that it hits hardest --- people earning less than $30,000 per year.</item></list></p>
