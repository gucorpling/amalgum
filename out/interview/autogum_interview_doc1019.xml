<head>Wikinews interviews John Taylor Bowles, National Socialist Order of America candidate for US President</head><p><hi rend="bold">Tuesday, February 19, 2008</hi></p>
<p>While nearly all cover of the 2008 Presidential election has focused on the Democratic and Republican candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third party candidates. These parties represent a variety of views that may not be acknowledged by the major party platforms.</p>
<p>As a non-partisan news source, Wikinews has impartially reached out to these candidates, throughout the campaign. The most recent of our interviews is <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurens,%20South%20Carolina">Laurens, South Carolina</ref>'s <hi rend="bold">John Taylor Bowles</hi>. Mr. Bowles is running with the endorsement of the National Socialist Order of America, a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Minnesota">Minnesota</ref>-based Neo-Nazi party created after a recent rift in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Socialist%20Movement%20(United%20States)">National Socialist Movement</ref>.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Why do you want to be President?</hi></p>
<p>I am running as "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%20nationalism">The White People's Candidate</ref>" for President of the USA in 2008 because I believe that America has changed for the worse because the once-dominate White European-American is being reduced to second-class citizen status and losing political power. Much of the present American Southwest is reverting to a Spanish speaking Mexican culture, with Puerto Ricans breeding faster than Blacks in New York City, and Cuban refugees still crowding into Florida it is possible that North America may soon look like South America. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%20American">White Americans</ref> need to start voting as a bloc and not as individuals if they are to have an effective voice in government or America will turn into a third world country.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Have you ever run for political office before?</hi></p>
<p>Yes, in 1984, I ran as a Baltimore City convention delegate to the Republican Party Convention. In 1983, I ran for the Baltimore City Republican Party Steering Committee and came in fourth out of five candidates.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Have you ever been a member of a political party, other than the one you're currently in?</hi></p>
<p>Yes, I was an official supporter of the National Socialist White People’s Party (currently known as the NEW ORDER) from 1974 through 2004. In 2004, I switched to the National Socialist Movement (NSM) and served as its National Election Director and held the rank of Captain until October 19, 2007, when the National Socialist Movement officially split because NSM Commander Jeff Schoep wasn’t supporting my candidacy and was sabotaging the election campaign, plus displaying bad character that was becoming known publicly. Honorable NSM members left and formed the National Socialist Order of America (nsoa88.com). I currently serve as the National Election Director for the National Socialist Order of America and its 2008 Presidential candidate as well.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Have you ever campaigned for another political candidate?</hi></p>
<p>Yes, in 1975, I served as campaign manager and treasurer to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore%20City%20Council">Baltimore City Council</ref> candidate Wolfgang Schrodt. Mr. Schrodt was the first National Socialist (NAZI) candidate to win a primary election in the USA and enter an American general election. He lost the election but received 12% of the White vote.</p>
