<figure><caption>Wikinews</caption></figure><p> When did you decide you wanted to write comics?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Sailesh Gopalan</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Um, I decided around three days before I started making Brown Paperbag [comics]. It was on a complete whim, I just wanted to start, I just wanted to try out something new. I was reading this webcomic last year in June. And it is called <hi rend="italic">Blue Chair</hi> by Shen and I decided, you know, might as well try making my own webcomic and that is actually when I got into it.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Why did you name it "Brown Paperbag"?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">SG</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  So, brown is a colour we associate with with Indians, and, on top of that, in these old cartoons, people used to put this brown paper bag on the top of their head with two eye holes and that symbolises shame or embarrassment, which is an overarching theme all over my comics.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  How much time do you take to write a comic?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">SG</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  Comic typically takes around three hours. From idea to the final output. Three, three and half hours.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  I have read your comics and most of them are related to satire, but you never entered into politics. Why is that so?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">SG</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  So, the thing is, most of the comics that I have read that are form Indians that are in newspapers are all political and not enough importance has been given to just Indian daily lives, just the families and how they interact with society. So I have decided to stay away from politics in this comic just because I am not trying to send a message across, I am just trying to appeal to people's nostalgia, make them remember something that they experienced and just relate to it.</p>
