<p><hi rend="bold">Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process? Why did you choose to run in this constituency?</hi></p>
<p>My decision to run as a candidate is for the same reasons as some many people call Windsor-Tecumseh their home – because I love my community and I care about our future.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What prior political experience do you have? What skills and insight can you bring to office, from other non-political positions you may have held?</hi></p>
<p>Born and raised in Windsor, I has studied at the University of Windsor, University of Western Ontario, and St. Clair College. While at the University of Windsor, I was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Student's Alliance as well as the Finance Committee. I also served on the President’s Advisory Council, on the University of Windsor Human Rights Panel, and as a member of the Special Needs Advisory Committee.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Which of your competitors do you expect to pose the biggest challenge to your candidacy? Why? What makes you the most desirable of all candidates running in the riding?</hi></p>
<p>Residents are telling me that our current representation is not listening to us. As a voter in this riding too, I agree. Any politician can make promises. It takes a special individual to follow-through. I have outlined a Follow-Through Plan for Windsor-Tecumseh, which will ensure that I will be accountable to you. Please visit my website or call my campaign office for full details on this plan.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What do you feel are the three most important issues to voters in your riding? Are these the same top three issues that are most important to you? What would you do to address these issues?</hi></p>
<p><list type="unordered"><item>Accountability in representation - MPPs should be accountable to their constituents and should represent their wishes</item>
<item>Jobs and the economy - the need for new sustainable jobs and policies to encourage growth</item>
<item>Border crossing - the need to take a common sense approach towards a full tunneling solution</item></list></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What should be the first order of business in the 39th Legislative Assembly?</hi></p>
<p>Addressing the crisis with jobs and the economy in Ontario.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Are the property taxes in your riding at a fair level for the amount of services received in the municipality?</hi></p>
<p>No they are not. I will work to make changes to the current property assessment process and fight to replace the existing system with a new Location Value Tax system that is fair for everyone.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">How can the province lead the way in stimulating job creation?</hi></p>
<p>First, create a plan. Second, follow-through with a sound plan.</p>
<p>As MPP, my follow-through plan includes tirelessly working towards sustainable job growth, and doing so immediately, for the 1 in 10 unemployed people in our riding. I will work hard to create common sense solutions with the private sector along with the creation of sound public policies ensuring the creation of sustainable jobs and the building of a brighter tomorrow for Windsor/Essex County.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What are your views on the mixed member proportional representation (MMP) referendum?</hi></p>
<p>I have not come to a personal decision on how I vote. As a candidate, I feel it inappropriate to take a public position. This is a decision of all Ontarians, and I respect our choice to choose together without any political interference.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What role, if any, does “new media” play in your campaign, and the campaign of your party? (websites, blogs, Facebook, YouTube videos, etc) Do you view it as beneficial, or a challenge?</hi></p>
<p>Website is a huge part of my campaign. It allows me to get my message to all the residents of my riding, but also to hear from them on the issues that are close to their heart. I have a campaign Facebook group as well as our campaign events listed as Facebook events. All these are benefits to my campaign and to the greater good for voters.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Of the decisions made by Ontario's 38th Legislative Assembly, which was the most beneficial to your this electoral district? To the province as a whole? Which was least beneficial, or even harmful, to your this riding? To the province as a whole?</hi></p>
<p>This last Parliament was treated by the McGuinty government as a place to break promises. They did more harm to the public’s perception of politicians as far back as I can recall.</p>
