<p><hi rend="bold">Why have you chosen to involve yourself in the political process? Why did you choose to run in this constituency?</hi></p>
<p>I have Three children who will be left with the debt of our current government mismanagement. I live in this riding and believe in the responsibility of membership and elections are the point of decision for change.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What prior political experience do you have? What skills and insight can you bring to office, from other non-political positions you may have held?</hi></p>
<p>I have studied the Objectivist Philosophy and Personal Empowerment. I am a student of life and know that any freedom has the responsibility included.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Which of your competitors do you expect to pose the biggest challenge to your candidacy? Why?</hi></p>
<p>I have entered this election to present myself as a Leader, the other candidates are their own challenge to prove themselves worthy of Leadership.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What makes you the most desirable of all candidates running in the riding?</hi></p>
<p>I present an other point of view to seek change in Government Responsibility; Government is Responsible to Military, Police and Justice. Welfare of the people is the individuals responsibility. Faith is the individuals responsibility. Roads, Schools, Health, Wealth, Wisdom... individuals responsibility.</p>
<p>Government needs to do the responsible monopoly they have been elected to have.</p>
<p>The members of this province need to control the Government and hold the MPP's responsible to protect our right to own property, seek prosperity and behavior toward an other, by law.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What do you feel are the three most important issues to voters in your riding? Are these the same top three issues that are most important to you? What would you do to address these issues?</hi></p>
<p>Repeat of previous Answer.</p>
<p>I present an other point of view to seek change in Government Responsibility; Government is Responsible to Military, Police and Justice. Welfare of the people is the individuals responsibility. Faith is the individuals responsibility. Roads, Schools, Health, Wealth, Wisdom... individuals responsibility. Government needs to do the responsible monopoly they have been elected to have.</p>
<p>The members of this province need to control the Government and hold the MPP's responsible to protect our right to own property, seek prosperity and behavior toward an other, by law.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What should be the first order of business in the 39th Legislative Assembly?</hi></p>
<p>Reform Government responsibilities, holding a MPP accountable to their actions. A crime is a crime. To mismanage the public authorities, mis-use of funds, deception, abuse of office... the position of Office is accountable as if they were a share holder in a Corporation. Because that is the position the MPP holds.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Are the property taxes in your riding at a fair level for the amount of services received in the municipality?</hi></p>
<p>Taxation is theft at this point in time. When our taxes are used to build anything that would be sold to private interests, that is theft of our money. I do not need a Sky Dome, Toll road Hospital Built by my taxes. I could have become a share holder in a venture to build these structures, I would have gain or lost in that venture, as share holders do. I would not have had to experience the theft of my money without recourse.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">How can the province lead the way in stimulating job creation?</hi></p>
<p>Let the free market develop itself. Create free-trade between provinces, countries, etc.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What are your views on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed%20member%20proportional%20representation">mixed member proportional representation</ref> (MMP) referendum?</hi></p>
<p>The more voices heard the greater the democracy.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What role, if any, does “new media” play in your campaign, and the campaign of your party? (websites, blogs, Facebook, YouTube videos, etc) Do you view it as beneficial, or a challenge?</hi></p>
<p>The more voices heard the greater the democracy.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Of the decisions made by Ontario's 38th Legislative Assembly, which was the most beneficial to your this electoral district? To the province as a whole? Which was least beneficial, or even harmful, to your this riding? To the province as a whole?</hi></p>
<p>I can not speak to your question, without a specific reference to an issue.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">My Name is Mark Scott,</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">I  am your Libertarian Choice for Creative Warrior</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">in this Election and Referendum</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">A caring Force for Change    is Vital to your Future,</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Current Government has an Agenda of</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Confusion and Control.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Confusion of the important issues and Control of your Liberty</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Faith is a Personal Choice      Politics are a Personal Choice</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Libertarian Policy is Personal Responsibility,</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Personal Commitment and Personal Choice.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Government is only  Responsible to Protect</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">our Property and Right to Prosper</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Prime Directive of Government   is Military,  Police, and Justice</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Your Vote is Important,   One Vote,   Your Vote,</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Will make a Change for Better Government</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">My name is Mark Scott,</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">I support The Libertarian Choice in Toronto-Danforth</hi></p>
