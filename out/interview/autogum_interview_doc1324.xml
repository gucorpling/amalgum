Bush</ref>, George W. Bush, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ron_Paul">Ron Paul</ref>. Earlier on in my adult life, my political activities were limited to voting for the same party candidates as had my parents. However, as I began to read the Constitution thoroughly, and in the wake of its many abuses perpetrated by those same candidates, I began looking for others who espoused to strictly follow the Constitution as well as the Founders' Philosophies which underlie it. </p>
<p>This pursuit led me to Ron Paul and the discovery of Libertarianism. I will never again vote for any candidate based upon their party affiliation. What will now and forever dominate my decision is a candidate's demonstrated commitment to the Constitution and the Philosophy of Liberty.  </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Have you run for public office previously?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Yes, I was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%20in%20Oklahoma,%202010#Congressional_District_4">U.S. Congressional Candidate from Oklahoma's 4th District</ref>. Due to no <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ballot%20access">ballot access</ref> in Oklahoma for Libertarian Party Candidates at that time, I ran as a "Ron Paul" Libertarian <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</ref>. Though Ron himself has a policy of non-endorsement of GOP [<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican</ref>] primary challengers against GOP incumbents, I was able to secure the endorsement of Senator <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand%20Paul">Rand Paul</ref> for my congressional campaign.   </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WS</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Why did you choose to run as a Libertarian?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">RH</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Because no other party so ardently champions the Philosophy of Liberty over <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism">Socialism</ref> and Constitutional Governance over Tyranny. Were they alive today, every single one of the Founders would be Libertarians. Since that age, each new generation's battle to tear down the scourges of racism, sexism, classism, bigotry, political persecution and/or religious intolerance, has been made possible by appeal to the principles espoused in the Constitution even if the people who ratified it were limited by the tolerance levels of their own generation. </p>
<p>Thus has the time come for candidates running on our Founders' Platform to rise up, proud of the political lineage whose generations' long aim has been the complete equality of the body politic, yet humble and weary of how prejudice undermines that legacy as well as the Philosophy of Liberty itself. Giving in to socialism will not erase the moral mistakes of the past, but it will return our children to the states of slavery and involuntary servitude against which we have so long struggled. </p>
