<p>Over the past week, diplomatic actions have averted — or, at least delayed — military strikes on <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Syria">Syria</ref> by the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref>. <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> sought input from a range of international experts on the situation; and, the tensions caused by <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</ref>'s support for the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad">al-Assad</ref> regime despite its apparent use of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Chemical_weapons">chemical weapons</ref>.</p>

<p>Tensions in the country increased dramatically, late August when it was reported between 100 and 1,300 people were killed in an alleged chemical attack. Many of those killed appeared to be children, with some of the pictures and video coming out of the country showing — according to witnesses — those who died from apparent suffocation; some foaming at the mouth, others having convulsions.</p>
<p>Amongst Syria's few remaining allies, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iran">Iran</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">China</ref>, and Russia continue to oppose calls for military intervention. In an effort to provide a better-understanding of the reasoning behind their ongoing support, the following people were posed a range of questions.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Wikinews</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi>  There are suggestions China wants to maintain its financial ties with Syria as its third largest importer in 2010. Would you agree with this?</p>
<p><list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Brown</hi>: I don't think that is China's key priority. China has a massive economy, and Syria is a very minor player in this. It has some, but not much, energy from Syria. Its real concerns in the current conflict are for stability, and geopolitical.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold">Farhi</hi>: China's conduct in Syria has been similar to its conduct elsewhere. It has given support to Russia in international forum such as the UNSC [<hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">United Nations Security Council</ref></hi>] and has acted opportunistically wherever its economic interest could be pursued. But, Syria is really not an area of interest for China. Its actions and support for the Russian position is derived from its general concerns regarding American imperialism and unilateralism.</item>
<item><hi rend="bold">Mitter</hi>: China will want, in general, to maintain financial ties with Syria as it does with many countries.  China's general position is that internal politics of countries should not interfere with economic ties.</item></list></p>
