<head>Wikinews holds a follow-up interview with Kevin Baugh, president of the Republic of Molossia</head><p><hi rend="bold">Thursday, May 1, 2008</hi></p>
<p>In March, Wikinews reporter Joseph Ford held an exclusive interview with Kevin Baugh, president of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic%20of%20Molossia">Republic of Molossia</ref>, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micronation">micronation</ref> located near <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton">Dayton</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada">Nevada</ref>. Due to the interest the article gained, both online and off, a follow-up interview was held this week. </p>
<p>Molossia's capital city, Espera, is situated on little over an acre of land in Western Nevada, within driving distance of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno">Reno</ref>. Another territory, Desert Homestead Province, is located in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern%20California">Southern California</ref>. Unlike most of today's micronations, Molossia allows visitors and has its own economy. It also has its own time zone and holidays as well as a few tourist attractions.</p>
<p>When asked about the culture of his country Baugh replied, "Molossian culture is a mix of several sources. Above all, we value the lifestyle of the western U.S., especially as it pertains to living in a wide-open place such as we do. Life here is fairly relaxed and easygoing."</p>
<p>He also said that Molossia and the United States "generally ignore each other" and that there haven't been "any altercations" between the two, despite claiming each other's land. He went on to tell us much more about his tiny nation, which can be read in the interview below.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> Molossia is located in Western Nevada, about 35 miles southeast of Reno, Nevada.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> The portion of Molossia in Western Nevada is about 1.3 acres in size, with another five acres in our other province, Desert Homestead, in Southern California. In both cases, the terrain is desert, high desert with sagebrush and pinion trees in Nevada, and low desert with creosote and yucca in California.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Tell us about your country's history.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> Molossia was founded in 1977, when my best friend James and I saw the movie, <hi rend="italic">The Mouse that Roared</hi>. We were quite taken by the idea of a tiny country accomplishing such amazing and amusing things, and decided to start our own nation. James was the King, and I was the Prime Minister. Time passed and James moved on, but I stayed with the idea, and carried it along with me everywhere I went until we settled here in Nevada. Having actual land really made the dream come alive, and ten years ago I raised the Molossian flag for the first time over our sovereign territory. Since then we have worked to build a great, albeit tiny, nation here in the desert. We founded the Intermicronational Olympic Games in 2000, a tradition that has carried on since. We started the first Intermicronational Exposition, and also created the Norton Awards for Excellence in Micronationalism. That's just a snap shot of what has been a very interesting decade.</p>
