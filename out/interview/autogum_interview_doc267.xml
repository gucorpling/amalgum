<p><hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews">Wikinews</ref></hi> interviewed <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">US</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom%20of%20speech">free speech</ref> lawyer <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc%20Randazza">Marc Randazza</ref>, on his defense of a <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/parody">parody</ref> website which satirizes American political commentator <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn%20Beck">Glenn Beck</ref>. <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Florida">Florida</ref> resident Isaac Eiland-Hall created the website in September, and it asserts Beck uses questionable tactics "to spread lies and misinformation". </p>
<p>The case <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck%20v.%20Eiland-Hall">Beck v. Eiland-Hall</ref></hi> is currently before the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%20Intellectual%20Property%20Organization">World Intellectual Property Organization</ref> (WIPO) in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva">Geneva</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</ref>. <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> previously reported on the case, in an article earlier this month, "<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US_free_speech_lawyer_defends_satire_of_Glenn_Beck">US free speech lawyer defends satire of Glenn Beck</ref>".</p>

<p>The Eiland-Hall's website is located at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domain%20name">domain</ref> "www.GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com". Its premise is derived from a joke statement made by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert%20Gottfried">Gilbert Gottfried</ref> about fellow comedian <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%20Saget">Bob Saget</ref>.</p>

<p>Users of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</ref> discussion community <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fark">Fark</ref> first applied the joke to Beck, and it then became popular on several social media sites.</p>
<p>Eiland-Hall saw the discussion on Fark, and created a website about it. The website asserts it does not believe the rumors to be true, commenting, "[b]ut we think Glenn Beck definitely uses tactics like this to spread lies and misinformation." In an interview with <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%20Technica">Ars Technica</ref></hi>, Eiland-Hall said the website was "using Beck's tactics against him". The website was created on September 1, and just two days later attorneys for Beck's company <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury%20Radio%20Arts">Mercury Radio Arts</ref> took action. Beck's lawyers sent letters to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain%20name%20registrar">domain name registrar</ref> where they referred to the domain name itself as "defamatory", but failed to get the site removed.</p>
<p>Beck filed a formal complaint with the Switzerland-based agency of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</ref>, WIPO, who operate under regulations laid out by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Corporation%20for%20Assigned%20Names%20and%20Numbers">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</ref>. Beck asserts the website's usage is libelous, bad faith, and could befuddle potential consumers. Beck's complaint was filed under the process called the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform%20Domain%20Name%20Dispute%20Resolution%20Policy">Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</ref>. This policy allows trademark owners to begin an administrative action by complaining that a certain domain registration is in "bad faith". Beck argues the site should be shut down because it is an infringment upon his trademark in his own name, "Glenn Beck".</p>

<p>Eiland-Hall retained Randazza as his attorney after receiving threatening letters from legal representatives of Beck. Randazza replied to WIPO on the 28th of last month, contending the site is "protected political speech", due to it's "satirical political humor". Randazza stated, "[e]ven an imbecile would look at this Web site and know that itâ€™s a parody." In his legal brief, Randazza compared the website to other <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20meme">Internet memes</ref>, such as "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All%20your%20base%20are%20belong%20to%20us">All your base are belong to us</ref>" and video parodies of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Germany">German</ref> film <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downfall%20(film)">Downfall</ref></hi>.</p>
