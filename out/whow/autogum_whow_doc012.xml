<head>Steps</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Visit your local library often. The library is the heart of a true Bookworm's soul! Spend your leisure time visiting the library and pick up some books that you find interesting or have been acclaimed online, on the grapevine or in book reviews. If you don't like the sound of the book, it doesn't matter! You can always buy or borrow a different one. <figure rend="Be a Book Worm Step 1.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Once you've found your section, just browse through it and pick out a few books you think are interesting. Go take a seat and read the first couple pages. If you think it's the perfect book, check it out and go home. <figure rend="Be a Book Worm Step 2.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Buy, or acquire, a lot of books! Ever heard the saying, "Never judge a book by its cover"? There are many online and retail book-stores, which hold mind-boggling selections of books. Scan through a couple, and buy ones you think are interesting. <figure rend="Be a Book Worm Step 3.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Carry/read books wherever you go. Sure, your friends might think this is pretty dumb, but if you <hi rend="italic">love</hi> books, read them a lot without worrying about others' disapproval. <figure rend="Be a Book Worm Step 4.jpg"></figure>
<list type="unordered"><item>Bookworms not only collect books that they are going to read in the future, but also keep books they have already read by their beds. In order for the book you chose to be a book you can snuggle up with you have to check these things over. Is the book in my preferred genre / style? Is it too hard / easy? Do I like the first part of the chapter? After you check these things over and they're all answered positively you are now a bookworm with the book you've chosen (not that you should stop with just this book, of course).</item></list></item>
<item>Find someone who loves books and literature as much as you do. Try making or joining a book club. Did you know that there are many online book clubs to join for free and make new friends and acquaintances? Try Goodreads, a social bibliophile website. <figure rend="Be a Book Worm Step 5.jpg"></figure></item>
