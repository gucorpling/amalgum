<list type="ordered"><item>Visit during the right season. Although Maldives enjoys golden sunny weather all year round, it is best to visit between the months of December and April. During this period the weather is pleasant and the rains are fewer than in the months that follow. However, the prices of the hotels will be substantially higher during this peak period, and it can be hard to find an available room if you don't plan your vacation early. <figure rend="Go Parasailing in Maldives Step 1.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Book in advance. Just as much as it will be hard for you to find accommodation in the beautiful Maldives during the peak season, the many activities offered by the various water sport centers and hotels will also be full if you make last-minute plans to visit the country. To avoid this, plan your accommodations and activities early, and contact the various service providers well in advance of your trip. This will provide you with the most options for your parasailing trip, so that it can be the best trip possible. <figure rend="Go Parasailing in Maldives Step 2.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Check if you need any training. The parasailing experience is one of the safest and most exiting water sports. But you will need to consider your skill levels before heading out on the water for the first time. Especially if you go with an experienced and reputable guide, you will not need a lot of training, but clarifying your experience and training levels with the operators prior to going parasailing will help guarantee your safety and comfort throughout the trip. If you are a first-timer for parasailing, these concerns will be especially important, so talk to the hotel or your chosen water sport centers to make sure you receive the proper guidance and training. <figure rend="Go Parasailing in Maldives Step 3.jpg"></figure></item>
