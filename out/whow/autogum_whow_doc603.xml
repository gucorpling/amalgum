<head>Find Your Calling in Life</head><p>We all search for our calling, even though we speak it in It our heads we are still looking for it. It may be different for us all. It could be loosing weight for one and maybe gaining it after some terrible disease for another. I may be being a motivational speaker for one and practising meditation in an alone place for another. Here you will get a little direction to what your must do, to find yours.</p>
<head>Steps</head>
<head>Look into the mirror.</head>
<list type="ordered"><item><list type="unordered"><item>Look into the mirror and you will see someone who has come here for a purpose.</item>

<head>Pick up a diary.</head>
<list type="ordered"><item><list type="unordered"><item>Leave the initial few pages blank and write down point by point, all you want to "BE".</item>
<item>All you want toÂ have may have a very long list but all you want to be would sum up in around 2 pages.</item>
<item>You might want to be funny, charming, loved, confidant, intelligent, puntual, preety, stylish, polite, fit, brave.</item>
<item>Not everybody wants the same things.</item>
<item>Keep this list safe, because now you have met yourself and expressed what you want to be.</item></list></item></list>
<head>Start planning out.</head>
<list type="ordered"><item><list type="unordered"><item>These diaries are going to be your friend for life if you let them be.</item>
<item>You now have an idea of what you want to become, so start looking up in books, internet, right people from whom you will get ideas so that you can map out your day in such a manner that you start to approach your targets in small but meaningful steps each day.</item>
<item>Once you are done with the plan execute it for a week.</item>
<item>See how it goes, then make the necessary changes.</item>
