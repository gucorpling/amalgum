<head>Biography</head>
<p>Mohammad Beg is first mentioned in 1643, when he was appointed as the city prefect of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Julfa">New Julfa</ref>, a quarter in the Safavid capital of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan">Isfahan</ref>, which was populated by Armenians. During this period, Mohammad Beg was supported by another officer of Armenian origin named <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahverdi_Khan_(Armenian)">Allahverdi Khan</ref> (not be confused with the powerful military officer <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahverdi_Khan">Allahverdi Khan</ref>, who was of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgians_in_Iran">Georgian</ref> origin).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee201151-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>In 1646, Mohammad Beg was appointed as the port-master/harbourmaster (<hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbandar">shahbandar</ref></hi>) of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_Abbas">Bandar Abbas</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee201146-1">[1]</ref> Two years later, he  was appointed as the "controller of assay" (<hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu'ayyir_al-Mamalik">mu'ayyir al-mamalik</ref></hi>).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewman200871-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee201146-1">[1]</ref> With the help of Allahverdi Khan, Mohammad Beg became the steward of the royal household (<hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazer-e_Boyutat">nazer-e boyutat</ref></hi>) in 1651, thus succeeding <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Ali_Beg">Mohammad Ali Beg</ref>. One year later, Mohammad Beg was appointed as the governor of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohgiluyeh_and_Boyer-Ahmad_Province">Kohgiluyeh</ref>. However, during the same year, Mohammad Beg's relations with Allahverdi Khan became bad, and the two became rivals.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee201146-1">[1]</ref> In 1654, Mohammad Beg was appointed by shah <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_II_of_Persia">Abbas II</ref> as his grand vizier. One of his first acts was dismissing the Georgian prefect of Isfahan, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsadan_Gorgijanidze">Parsadan Gorgijanidze</ref>, due to his unpopularity among the inhabitants of the city.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewman200885-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee201150-6">[6]</ref> Mohammad Beg also had the empire more centralized by converting more land into the crown domain (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamadan">Hamadan</ref> in 1654, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardabil">Ardabil</ref> in 1656/7, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semnan,_Iran">Semnan</ref> in 1656/7 and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerman">Kerman</ref> in 1658).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBabaie200471-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee201147-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewman2008213-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>In 1661, Mohammad Beg, after having failed to diminish the power of his rivals, was forced to resign from the grand vizier office.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBabaie200472-10">[10]</ref> He was then exiled to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qom">Qom</ref>. In 1672, shah <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_I_of_Persia">Suleiman I</ref> (r. 1666–1694) offered Mohammad Beg to become grand vizier once again, which he agreed to, but while on his way to Isfahan, he died. According to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people">French</ref> traveler <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Chardin">Jean Chardin</ref>, Mohammad Beg had been poisoned by Suleiman's grand vizier <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaykh_Ali_Khan_Zangana">Shaykh Ali Khan Zangana</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee201152-11">[11]</ref></p>
