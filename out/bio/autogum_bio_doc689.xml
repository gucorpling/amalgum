<head>Alexander de Waghorn</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Alexander de Waghorn</hi> (d. 1416 × 1418), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Ross_(Scotland)">Bishop of Ross</ref>, bears a surname that may suggest an origin in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow">Glasgow</ref> area of southern <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scotland</ref>, though there are other possibilities.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>His pre-episcopal life is not very well documented, but when he was provided to the bishopric of Ross in 1398, he already possessed a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelorate">Bachelorate</ref> in Decrees (i.e. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law">canon law</ref>) and bore the title <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Ross">Archdeacon of Ross</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> It is not known for how long he had held the latter title, but it could have been as early as August 1376, when the last known archdeacon <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Man">Alexander Man</ref> was made <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Caithness">Bishop of Caithness</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>It was on 17 August 1398, that <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon_Pope_Benedict_XIII">Avignon Pope Benedict XIII</ref> provided Waghorn to the vacant <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Ross_(Scotland)">diocese of Ross</ref>; the papal mandate of provision informs us that Alexander had been elected by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_chapter">cathedral chapter</ref> to the vacant see, but that because the Pope had previously reserved the see for his own appointment, declared the election invalid, but "to prevent a long and harmful vacancy" he nevertheless provided Waghorn as bishop.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>There is a papal mandate, dated 4 May 1404, in which three churchmen are told to confirm one clerk named William <hi rend="italic">de Tayn</hi> ("of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tain">Tain</ref>") as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor">Chancellor</ref> of Ross because William de Tayn "doubted the validity of his presentation and institution by Alexander, bishop of Ross".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> A similar mandate for confirmation, this time issued to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Moray">Bishop of Moray</ref> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_de_Lichton">Henry de Lichton</ref>) and dated 16 August 1417, was as a result of similar concerns, this time in relation to one John de Kylwos, regarding Kylwos' exchange of the Ross subdeanery for the treasurership, an exchange authorised by Bishop Alexander.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>On 30 June 1407, a papal mandate was issued to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunkeld">Bishop of Dunkeld</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Caithness">Bishop of Caithness</ref> to receive Alexander's oath of fealty to the papal see, and to ensure that a copy of the oath was sent to the papal court by letters patent under Alexander's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(device)">seal</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> This is somewhat of a long period since his provision, and may be explained if some of the secular authorities were opposing his provision.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-562-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>At this time, there was a power struggle over the province of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross,_Scotland">Ross</ref>, the notable participants being <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Leslie,_Earl_of_Ross">Alexander Leslie, Earl of Ross</ref>, and ally to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stewart,_Duke_of_Albany">Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany</ref>; <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_of_Islay,_Lord_of_the_Isles">Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles</ref>, a magnate based on the western coast who was pressing his own claim to the earldom; and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stewart,_Earl_of_Buchan">Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan</ref>, husband of the deceased Countess of Ross, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemia_I,_Countess_of_Ross">Euphemia I</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-562-8">[8]</ref> It is possible that Waghorn was a protégé of one of these men, and if he was, the most likely candidate is the Earl of Buchan, namely because he is found witnessing a number of charters of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Douglas,_Countess_of_Mar">Isabella, Countess of Mar</ref>, wife of Buchan's illegitimate son, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stewart,_Earl_of_Mar">Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-562-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>Bishop Alexander witnessed, at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kildrummy_Castle">Kildrummy Castle</ref> in 1404, Isabella's deed handing over her rights to Buchan's son.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-562-8">[8]</ref> He was at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Scotland">Perth</ref> on 18 July 1408, where he attended an ecclesiastical council and witnessed a deed.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-562-8">[8]</ref> He can be found at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews">St Andrews</ref> on 4 and 6 February  1414, attending the ceremonies celebrating the receipt of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_bull">papal bull</ref> which authorised the founding of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_St_Andrews">University of St Andrews</ref>; Bishop Alexander made a sermon on 6 February.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> He is found for the last time at Perth on 17 March 1416, witnessing a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transumpt">transumpt</ref> made by an ecclesiastical council.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-562-8">[8]</ref> It is not known when he died, but the earliest secure date is 14 February 1418.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
