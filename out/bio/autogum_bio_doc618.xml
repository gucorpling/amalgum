The Karamanid ruler, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaattin_Ali_of_Karaman">Aleddin</ref> (r.1361–1398), offered peace, but Çandarlızade Ali advised the Sultan to press on, until securing Aleddin's complete submission.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtçıl2017-2">[2]</ref> In the next year, 1388/9, he <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian-Ottoman_Wars#The_campaign_of_1388">led operations</ref> against the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bulgarian_Empire">Bulgarian</ref> tsar <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Shishman_of_Bulgaria">Ivan Shisman</ref> (r.1371–1395).

<head>Under Süleyman Çelebi</head>

<p>On 26 July 1402, in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ankara">Battle of Ankara</ref>, Bayezid I was defeated and captured by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur">Timur</ref>. This momentous event overturned the balance of power in the region, as  the Ottoman domains in Anatolia were divided by Timur, who restored many of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_beyliks">Anatolian beyliks</ref> previously absorbed by Bayezid. Timur did not interfere with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans">Balkans</ref>, however, where the Ottoman conquest was also far advanced.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKastritsis20071–2-3">[3]</ref> Ali helped save Bayezid's oldest son, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Süleyman_Çelebi">Süleyman Çelebi</ref>, from capture, and escorted him to the Ottoman capital <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursa">Bursa</ref>, and then to the Ottomans' European capital, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrianople">Adrianople</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMantran1960394-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>He continued serving Süleyman Çelebi as Grand Vizier during the early stages of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Interregnum">Ottoman Interregnum</ref> civil war, and was likely responsible for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Gallipoli">Treaty of Gallipoli</ref> with the Christian powers of the region in early 1403, which preserved most of the Ottoman conquests in the Balkans.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMantran1960394-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtçıl2017-2">[2]</ref> During Süleyman Çelebi's campaign into Anatolia in 1403–1404, against his younger brother <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_Çelebi">Mehmed Çelebi</ref> (the future Mehmed I, r.1413–1421),<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKastritsis2007111–118-4">[4]</ref> Ali is said to have been responsible for the peaceful surrender of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara">Ankara</ref>, by forging letters from Mehmed to the city's garrison.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtçıl2017-2">[2]</ref> He died in Ankara in December 1406.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMantran1960394-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtçıl2017-2">[2]</ref> He was buried in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeşil_Mosque_of_Iznik">Yeşil Mosque</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iznik">Iznik</ref>, which his father had begun and which he completed.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtçıl2017-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>His loss deprived Süleyman of a capable minister, helping to bring about his downfall in 1410.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMantran1960394-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Legacy</head>
<p>As Grand Vizier, Çandarlızade Ali contributed to the gradual development of the Ottoman state's administration. Notably he codified the responsibilities of the <hi rend="italic">kadı</hi>s and arranged for them to charge fees for their services instead of receiving a fixed salary. He founded the corps of palace pages (<hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iç_oğlan">iç oğlan</ref></hi>), which would provide the military and administrative elite of the empire, and enhanced the prestige of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizier">viziers</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMantran1960394-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtçıl2017-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Ottoman chroniclers present a very negative picture of Çandarlızade Ali, accusing him of being a drunkard and a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedophile">paedophile</ref>, and of inducing both Bayezid and Süleyman to follow his debauched lifestyle. Likewise the chroniclers claim that he was unpopular both among the administration and the common people.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMantran1960394-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtçıl2017-2">[2]</ref> These accusations should be treated with caution, however, as they were circulated by his rivals and enemies, particularly the partisans of Mehmed I, who emerged victorious in the civil war.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtçıl2017-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Apart from the Yeşil Mosque in Iznik, Ali founded a small mosque (<hi rend="italic">mesjid</hi>) and a <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanqah">tekke</ref></hi> in Bursa, where a quarter bore his name.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMantran1960394-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAtçıl2017-2">[2]</ref></p>
