<head>Description</head>
<p>The badly decomposed remains were found by a "stone mason" alongside a river, near a highway in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_County,_Pennsylvania">Perry County, Pennsylvania</ref>, near <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Township,_Perry_County,_Pennsylvania">Watts Township</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ties-1">[1]</ref> The remains were mostly skeletonized and the estimated time of death was months before, perhaps as early as Autumn of 1978.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namus-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-doe-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>The decedent is believed to have been between 15 and 30 years old, although she may have been as old as 38.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namus-4">[4]</ref>
She was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_American">white</ref>, had straight, shoulder-length <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blond">blond</ref> or light <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_hair">brown hair</ref> and was between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-girl-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-doe-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>She had received <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry">dental care</ref> during her life, as a back tooth had been removed four or five years prior to her death. She also had <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_filling">teeth fillings</ref>. One tooth, which was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)">molar</ref>, had not yet erupted.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-doe-7">[7]</ref> Her teeth showed no evidence of crowding. Despite that her teeth appeared to have had some dental work, it is not known if she had ever had braces.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-suspicious-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Prior to her death, she had suffered a fractured <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib">rib</ref>, which had healed.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NCMEC-6">[6]</ref> Just before her death, she may have returned to Pennsylvania after having spent several months in the southwestern United States.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> Recent analysis of the decedent's bones indicated that she had spent a long time living in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwest">Midwest</ref> or in Canada, near the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes">Great Lakes</ref>, when she was an adolescent.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NCMEC-6">[6]</ref></p>
<head>Belongings</head>
<figure><caption>Jewelry worn by Perry County Jane Doe.</caption></figure>
<p>Perry County Jane Doe wore several pieces of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewelry">jewelry</ref>. She was wearing two <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_silver">sterling silver</ref> rings with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turquoise">turquoise</ref> stones, one of which also contained <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyx">onyx</ref> pieces that are believed to have originated in the Southwest, possibly having been made by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo_people">Navajo</ref> or <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuni_people">Zuni</ref> Indians inhabiting that area.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> She also had a chain bracelet on her right arm and a turquoise necklace and earrings.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-suspicious-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NCMEC-6">[6]</ref> The jewelry led authorities to believe the victim had ties to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona">Arizona</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico">New Mexico</ref> or a similar region.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ties-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>She wore a tan jacket, white boots with silver buckles, green and white socks, and blue slacks.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fbi-10">[10]</ref> The slacks were described as having been made from knitted wool which contained strands of red thread.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-suspicious-2">[2]</ref> She was wearing two <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_(clothing)">tops</ref>, which consisted of a white shirt and a blue <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeveless_shirt">tank top</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-suspicious-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namus-4">[4]</ref></p>
<head>Investigation</head>
<p>The victim had been buried shortly after her discovery, but was exhumed in 2008, following the reopening of her case.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ties-1">[1]</ref> Her <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling">DNA</ref> and dental records were recorded and are on file. Because of the condition of her remains, no fingerprints and no cause of death could be confirmed.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namus-4">[4]</ref> An initial examination of her teeth indicated that she had had three teeth extracted, but this was later disproved.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-suspicious-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namus-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-doe-7">[7]</ref> Despite the fact that these characteristics have been entered into national databases, there have been no matches with missing persons.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ties-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>About sixty possible identities for her have been ruled out.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-girl-3">[3]</ref> Her face was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_facial_reconstruction">reconstructed</ref> twice by professionals. A sketch by Barbara Martin-Bailey was drawn in 2009, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created a three-dimensional rendering by digitally adding layers of muscles and skin to a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan">CT scan</ref> of her skull, which was released in 2013. A revised image was later released in 2018.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NCMEC-6">[6]</ref></p>
