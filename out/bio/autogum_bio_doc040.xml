Following this appearance Rose claimed she was the victim of a hate campaign, which resulted in her landlord evicting her and having to move to London. Rose claimed: "What other reason would it be apart from my profession? I don't do any harm, I don't make noise and I am just normal."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Exeter-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> In 2015 she appeared on an edition of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two">BBC Two</ref>'s <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Politics">The Daily Politics</ref></hi> in which she argued for the decriminalisation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothel">brothels</ref> in the United Kingdom.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> In 2017 she took part in <hi rend="italic">Things Sex Workers are Tired of Hearing</hi>, a sketch for the online BBC channel <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Three_(online)">BBC Three</ref>, believing it would help viewers understand the reality of being a sex worker. However, the programme led to criticism from some viewers, who accused Rose of "glamourizing" her profession. It also led to accusations on social media against Rose's partner, a builder and author of erotic literature, that he was profiting from her earnings. Rose and her partner both refuted these allegations.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
