<p><hi rend="bold">Thomas Langton</hi> (died 27 January 1501) was chaplain to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England">King Edward IV</ref>, before becoming successively <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_St_David's">Bishop of St David's</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury">Archbishop-elect of Canterbury</ref>.</p>
<head>Early life</head>
<p>Langton was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appleby-in-Westmorland">Appleby-in-Westmorland</ref>, and educated by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelites">Carmelite</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friar">friars</ref> there. He <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriculation">matriculated</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_College,_Oxford">Queen's College, Oxford</ref>, but soon removed to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge">Cambridge</ref>, probably to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Hall,_Cambridge">Clare Hall</ref>, on account of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_(disease)">plague</ref>. In 1461 he was elected <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow">fellow</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_College,_Cambridge">Pembroke Hall</ref>, serving as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proctor">proctor</ref> in 1462. While at Cambridge he took both degrees in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law">canon law</ref>, and was afterwards incorporated in them at Oxford. In 1464 he left the university, and some time before 1476 was made chaplain to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England">King Edward IV</ref>. Langton was in high favour with the king, who trusted him much, and sent him on various important <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission">embassies</ref>. In 1467 he went as ambassador to France, and as king's chaplain was sent to treat with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon">Ferdinand II, king of Aragon</ref>, on 24 November 1476. He visited France again on diplomatic business on 30 November 1477, and on 11 August 1478, to conclude the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement">espousals</ref> of Edward's daughter <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_York">Elizabeth</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_France">Charles</ref>, son of the French king. Two years later he was sent to demand the fulfilment of this marriage treaty, but the prince, now <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_France">Charles VIII, king of France</ref>, refused to carry it out, and the match was broken off.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-dnbthomaslangton-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Career</head>
<p>Meanwhile, Langton received much ecclesiastical preferment. In 1478 he was made treasurer of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter_Cathedral">Exeter</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prebendary">prebendary</ref> of St. Decuman's, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Cathedral">Wells Cathedral</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> and about the same time master of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_St._Julien,_Southampton">St. Julian's Hospital, Southampton</ref>, a post which he still retained twenty years later. He was presented on 1 July 1480 to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Hallows_Bread_Street">All Hallows Church, Bread Street</ref>, and on 14 May 1482 to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Hallows_Lombard_Street">All Hallows, Lombard Street</ref>, City of London, also becoming prebendary of North Kelsey, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Cathedral">Lincoln Cathedral</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> in the next year. Probably by the favour of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_V_of_England">King Edward V</ref>, who granted him the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporalities">temporalities</ref> of the see on 21 May, Langton was advanced in 1483 to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_St_David's">bishopric of St. Davids</ref>;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrydeGreenwayPorterRoy1986298-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_bull">papal bull</ref> confirming the election is dated 4 July,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrydeGreenwayPorterRoy1986298-5">[5]</ref> and he was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecration">consecrated</ref> in August or September.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrydeGreenwayPorterRoy1986298-5">[5]</ref> Langton's prosperity did not decline with Edward V's deposition. He was sent on an embassy to Rome and to France by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_of_England">King Richard III</ref>, who <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(ecclesiastical)">translated</ref> him to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Salisbury">bishopric of Salisbury</ref> by papal bull dated 8 February 1485.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrydeGreenwayPorterRoy1986271-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> Langton was also elected provost of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_College,_Oxford">Queen's College, Oxford</ref>, on 6 December 1487, a post which he seems to have retained till 1495. He was a considerable <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefactor_(law)">benefactor</ref> to the college, where he built some new sets of rooms and enlarged the provost's lodgings. In 1493 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England">King Henry VII</ref> transferred him from Salisbury to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester">Winchester</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrydeGreenwayPorterRoy1986277-9">[9]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_see">see</ref> which had been vacant over a year. During the seven years that he was bishop of Winchester Langton started a school in the precincts of the palace, where he had youths trained in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar">grammar</ref> and music. He was a good musician himself, used to examine the scholars in person, and encourage them by good words and small rewards. Finally, a proof of his ever-increasing popularity, Langton was elected <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</ref> on 22 January 1501,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrydeGreenwayPorterRoy1986234-11">[11]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> but died of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_(disease)">plague</ref> on the 27th,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFrydeGreenwayPorterRoy1986234-11">[11]</ref> before the confirmation of the deed. He was buried in a marble tomb within 'a very fair chapel' which he had built south of the lady-chapel in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-dnbthomaslangton-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Death</head>
<p>Before his death he had given 10 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(currency)">pounds</ref> towards the erection of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_St_Mary_the_Great,_Cambridge">Great St. Mary's Church, Cambridge</ref>, and in 1497 a drinking-cup, weighing 67 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ounce">ounces</ref>, called the 'Anathema Cup,' to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_College,_Cambridge">Pembroke Hall</ref>. This is the oldest extant <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanap">hanap</ref> or covered cup that is <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallmark">hall-marked</ref>. By his <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_(law)">will</ref>, dated 16 January 1501, Langton left large sums of money to the priests of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Hall,_Cambridge">Clare Hall, Cambridge</ref>, money and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestment">vestments</ref> to the fellows and priests of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_College,_Oxford">Queen's College, Oxford</ref>, besides legacies to the friars at both universities, and to the Carmelites at Appleby-in-Westmorland. To his sister and her husband, Rowland Machel, lands (probably the family estates) in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmorland">Westmorland</ref> and two hundred <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_(money)">marks</ref> were bequeathed. An annual pension of eight marks was set aside to maintain a chapel at Appleby-in-Westmorland for a hundred years to pray for the souls of Langton, his parents, and all the faithful deceased at Appleby-in-Westmorland.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-dnbthomaslangton-1">[1]</ref></p>
