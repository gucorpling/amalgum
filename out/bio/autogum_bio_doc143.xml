<head>Philosophical work</head>
<p>In his early work, Boghossian was a trenchant critic of naturalistic theories of content.</p>
<p>Much of his later work, including his book <hi rend="italic">Fear of Knowledge,</hi> criticizes various forms of relativism, especially <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_relativism">epistemic relativism</ref>, which claims that knowledge and reason are fundamentally cultural or subjective rather than objective.</p>
<p>In his article 'Blind Reasoning', Boghossian argues that we are blind to our reasons for justifying our methods of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference">inference</ref> (the epitome of a method of inference is taken to be <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens">modus ponens</ref></hi>.) Rejecting both Simple Inferential Externalism for its inconsistency and Simple Inferential Internalism because it is difficult to accept, he opts for a third and new form of "rational insight".  This paper, in conjunction with an ongoing correspondence between Boghossian and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crispin_Wright">Crispin Wright</ref>, is part of a project to defend against epistemic relativism.</p>
