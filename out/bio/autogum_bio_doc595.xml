<p><hi rend="bold">Colard Mansion</hi> (or <hi rend="bold">Colart</hi>, before 1440 – after May 1484) was a 15th-century <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders">Flemish</ref> scribe and printer who worked together with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Caxton">William Caxton</ref>. He is known as the first printer of a book with copper <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraving">engravings</ref>, and as the printer of the first books in English and French.</p>
<head>Biography</head>
<p>Colard Mansion was a central figure in the early printing industry in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges">Bruges</ref>. He was active as early as 1454 as a bookseller, and was also active as a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe">scribe</ref>, translator and contractor for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript">manuscripts</ref>, which meant entering into contracts with the clients, and organizing and sub-contracting the elements such as scribing, decorating and binding.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> From 1474 until 1476 he worked together with the early English printer <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Caxton">William Caxton</ref>, and he continued the company on his own afterwards. Caxton probably learned the art of printing from Mansion,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> and it was from Mansion's press that the first books printed in English (<hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recuyell_of_the_Historyes_of_Troye">Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye</ref></hi>) and French came.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> He moved to the Burg, the commercial heart of Bruges at the time, in 1478. Mansion suffered heavily under the economic crisis in Bruges in the 1480s, and only one work was printed after the death of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Burgundy">Mary of Burgundy</ref> in 1482. Nothing is known with certainty about his life after 1484, although he may have moved to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picardy">Picardy</ref>.</p>
<head>Work</head>
<p>Mansion sold <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript">illuminated manuscripts</ref> to the aristocracy, and luxurious <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incunabulum">incunabula</ref> to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</ref>, but he was one of the first to also publish smaller and cheaper books of only twenty to thirty pages, mainly in French. Nowadays, 25 editions of incunabula by Mansion alone are known, making him the most prolific of Bruges' early printers. Only two of these are in Latin, all others are in French, many of them first editions. Customers of Mansion include <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Croÿ,_prince_of_Chimay">Charles de Croÿ, prince of Chimay</ref>, and Marie, the widow of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Luxembourg,_Count_of_Saint-Pol">Louis de Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol</ref>. Mansion has been called the first printer of luxury books.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>He collaborated with major manuscript illuminators, such as the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Dresden_Prayer_Book">Master of the Dresden Prayer Book</ref>, who were fast losing work to printing, or copyists of their work.  In fact only two of his books are illustrated, the influential <hi rend="italic">Ovide Moralisé</hi> with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodcut">woodcuts</ref>, and a French translation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boccaccio">Boccaccio</ref>'s <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Casibus_Virorum_Illustrium">De Casibus Virorum Illustrium</ref></hi>, the first book to be illustrated with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraving">engravings</ref>, some of which have been claimed to be the work of the Dresden Prayer Book Master and other identified illuminators in the circle of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Anthony_of_Burgundy">Master of Anthony of Burgundy</ref>.  As <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intaglio_(sculpture)">intaglio</ref> prints, the nine engravings had to be printed separately from the relief text and then pasted in, and only three copies are known with the engravings.  More copies are known without the engravings, several of which contain illuminations instead.  It has been suggested that this was Mansion's original intention (other incunabula left spaces for manual illustration), but that this hybrid product did not attract the wealthy buyers of illuminations, so the engravings were an afterthought, aimed at a less exclusive market.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> Mansion is also known as the translator of at least five texts from Latin to French, including <hi rend="italic">Le dialogue des créatures</hi>, printed by Dutch <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Leeu">Gerard Leeu</ref> in 1482.</p>

<p>Incunabula by Mansion are scattered throughout collections mainly in Western Europe.
