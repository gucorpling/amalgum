<head>Life</head>
<p>Andrea was a member of the Albanian Gropa family. His ancestor <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gropa">Paul Gropa</ref> was acknowledged by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_Naples">Charles I of Naples</ref> in 1273: "nobili viro sevasto Paulo Gropa »casalia Radicis maioris et Radicis minons, пeс non Cobocheste, Zuadigorica, Sirclani et <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krujë">Craye</ref>, Zessizan sitam in valle de Ebu".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> During the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Empire">Serbian expansion in Macedonia</ref>, the Gropa also moved towards the south, becoming neighbours with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianiti_family">Arianiti</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spata_family">Spata</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Sufflay145-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>After <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Dušan">Emperor Dušan</ref>'s death (1355), Gropa was a local ruler in the district of Ohrid.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Soulis142-6">[6]</ref> Prior to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Maritsa">Battle of Maritsa</ref>, Gropa was a vassal to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrnjavčević_family">Mrnjavčević family</ref>;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> The <hi rend="italic">King of Serbia</hi> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vukašin_Mrnjavčević">Vukašin Mrnjavčević</ref> (r. 1365 – died 1371), held Western Macedonia as a co-ruler to Emperor <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Uroš_V_of_Serbia">Stephen Uroš V of Serbia</ref> (r. 1355 – died 1371).</p>
<p>After the death of King Vukašin and his brother <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jovan_Uglješa">Jovan Uglješa</ref> at the Battle of Maritsa against the Ottomans in 1371, and the subsequent death of the Emperor, there was a crisis in appointing the successor of the throne. Vukašin's son, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Marko">Marko</ref>, did not have the power to unite his lords, and only retained nominal rule over the area from his base at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prilep">Prilep</ref>.</p>
<p>After Maritsa, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejanović_noble_family">Dejanovići</ref> became Ottoman vassals.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> By 1377, Vuk Branković extended his rule over Skopje, and Gropa is mentioned as lord of Ohrid.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> Bogdan, Gropa and Marko, and the rest of the rulers in Western Macedonia became vassals to Murad I.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Soulis100-11">[11]</ref> The vassals had to pay tribute to the Ottoman sultan and supply troops in case of war.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Soulis100-11">[11]</ref></p>

<p>According to the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzaka_chronicles">Muzaka chronicles</ref></hi>, Gropa joined <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_II_Muzaka">Andrea II Muzaka</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balšić_noble_family">Balšić family</ref> against Marko; He gained <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostur">Kostur</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debar">Debar</ref>, and became semi-independent from Marko.</p>
<p>Gropa also minted coins,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> findings dating to c. 1377 – c. 1385,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> inscribed in Old Serbian with his title as <hi rend="italic">župan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gospodar</hi>, with his signature as "Po milosti Božijoj župan Gropa".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Stanojevic213-12">[12]</ref> He was the last Christian ruler of Ohrid before the Ottoman conquest.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> His signature is found in the scriptorium of the Church of St. Sofia in Ohrid.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>The date of his death is unknown, the <hi rend="italic">Muzaka chronicles</hi> says there were no descendants and that his lands were assigned to the Muzaka family after his death, however, the most probable is that they were given to Marko.</p>
