<p><hi rend="bold">Richard Orsini</hi> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language">Italian</ref>: <hi lang="it" rend="italic">Riccardo Orsini</hi>) was the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_palatine_of_Cephalonia_and_Zakynthos">Count Palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos</ref> from before 1260 to his death in 1303/4, and also Captain-General of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfu">Corfu</ref> in 1286–90, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_Gravina">Count of Gravina</ref> in 1284–91. He also served as the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capetian_House_of_Anjou">Angevin</ref> <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailli">bailli</ref></hi> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Achaea">Principality of Achaea</ref> from 1297 to 1300.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-PLP-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Biography</head>
<p>Richard is generally thought to be the son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Orsini">Matthew Orsini</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_palatine_of_Cephalonia_and_Zakynthos">Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos</ref>, and a daughter of the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastokrator">sebastokrator</ref></hi> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Komnenos_Doukas">John Komnenos Doukas</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bon706-2">[2]</ref> However, given the long period between the beginning of Matthew's reign in the first years of the 13th century and the attested date of Richard's death, it is possible that another character is to be intercalated between Matthew and Richard, perhaps the "count Theodore" referred to in a document from 1264 (possibly Matthew's son and Richard's father).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>It is unclear when exactly Richard became Count palatine; he is not specifically recorded by name in a document until 1264.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Nicol36-4">[4]</ref> However, according to the testimony of the later chronicler <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marino_Sanuto_the_Elder">Marino Sanudo Torcello</ref>, he was still a minor around 1262, when <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II_of_Villehardouin">William II of Villehardouin</ref> assumed the regency for the county after his return from Byzantine captivity.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> Some authors date his accession as early as 1238,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-PLP-1">[1]</ref> the date of the last document referring to Matthew Orsini, often assumed as the date of his death. If so, Richard was then perhaps the "Count of Cephalonia" referred to in a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice">Venetian</ref> attempt to form an alliance of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankokratia">Frankish rulers</ref> of Greece in aid of the beleaguered <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Empire_of_Constantinople">Latin Empire of Constantinople</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Already since his father's time, the county palatine was a vassal of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Achaea">Principality of Achaea</ref>, and through it, after the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Viterbo">Treaty of Viterbo</ref>, of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples">Kingdom of Naples</ref>. In this capacity he also held the post of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain-General">Captain-General</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfu">Corfu</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butrint">Butrint</ref> on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania">Albanian</ref> shore in 1286–90.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-PLP-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Nicol36-4">[4]</ref> In 1291/92, he participated with 100 knights in a campaign to aid the ruler of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotate_of_Epirus">Epirus</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros_I_Komnenos_Doukas">Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas</ref>, against the Byzantines who were besieging <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannina">Ioannina</ref>, along with 400–500 cavalry from Achaea under <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_III_of_Saint_Omer">Nicholas III of Saint Omer</ref>. In exchange, Nikephoros sent his daughter, Maria, as a hostage to Cephalonia. After the Byzantines were repelled, she was wed to Richard's son and heir, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_I_Orsini">John I Orsini</ref>. This aroused the indignation of Nikephoros, who had not been consulted, and who was not mollified until 1295, when the young couple came to live at his court.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-PLP-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>Following the death of the Prince of Achaea, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florent_of_Hainaut">Florent of Hainaut</ref>, his <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widow">widow</ref>, Princess <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_of_Villehardouin">Isabella of Villehardouin</ref> appointed Richard to rule in her stead as <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailli">bailli</ref></hi> and withdrew to the castle of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamata">Kalamata</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> His tenure appears to have been peaceful as regards the conflict with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Greeks">Byzantine Greeks</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystras">Mystras</ref>, but the issue of the succession remained open as Isabella had but one daughter, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_of_Hainaut">Matilda of Hainaut</ref> (born 1293). On the suggestion of Richard Orsini, the young heiress of Achaea was engaged to the young <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Athens">Duke of Athens</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_II_de_la_Roche">Guy II de la Roche</ref>. Their marriage took place in 1305.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> Richard kept his post until 1300, when he was replaced by Nicholas III of Saint Omer, at the advice of chancellor <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_of_Kalamata">Benjamin of Kalamata</ref>. This began a period of rivalry between Richard and Benjamin; in 1303, Richard's friends at court persuaded Prince <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_I_of_Piedmont">Philip of Savoy</ref> to detain Benjamin, who was released after paying 20,000 <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpyron">hyperpyra</ref></hi> as ransom. In turn, Benjamin gained the ear of the Prince, and forced Richard to give up the same sum in exchange for possession of half a village, which returned to the princely domain following Richard's death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>Richard was killed in 1303 or 1304 by one of his own knights, a man named Lion.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bon_1969,_p._176-13">[13]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
<head>Family</head>
<p>Richard married twice: his first wife is unknown, and his second, in 1299, was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_Villehardouin">Margaret of Villehardouin</ref>, sister of Princess Isabella. From the first marriage, he had four children: a son, John I Orsini, and three daughters.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-PLP-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bon706-2">[2]</ref> His three daughters all married into the high nobility of Achaea: one, Guillerme, married the Grand Constable <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chauderon">John Chauderon</ref>, who died in 1294, and after that Nicholas III of Saint Omer; the second married <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Durnay">John of Durnay</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_of_Gritzena">Baron of Gritzena</ref>; and the third married <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engilbert_of_Liederkerque">Engilbert of Liederkerque</ref>, a nephew of the Prince <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florent_of_Hainaut">Florent of Hainaut</ref>, who succeeded Chauderon as Constable.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> From the second marriage, Richard had a daughter, but she died as an infant.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bon_1969,_p._176-13">[13]</ref></p>
