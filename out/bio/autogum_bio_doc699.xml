<p>Antonio, who styled himself as "lord of Athens, Thebes, of all the duchy and its dependencies", was the longest-ruling medieval monarch of Athen.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESetton1975268-24">[24]</ref> Athens revived during his rule, because he preferred it to Thebes (which had been the capital of the duchy for decades).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994435-10">[10]</ref> In 1410, he joined the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Turks">Ottoman Turks</ref> to devastate Venetian <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauplia">Nauplia</ref>. In 1419, a peace between the Turks and Venice called on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_I">Mehmed I</ref> to ask Antonio to cease harassing the Venetians. In 1423, he was at war with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_II_Palaeologus">Theodore II</ref> of Morea and occupied <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth">Corinth</ref>.</p>
<p>Antonio never forgot his <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence">Florentine</ref> roots and he strove to make Athens a capital of culture: by renewing the monuments, by patronising letters, and encouraging chivalry. On 7 August 1422, he conceded privileges to Florentine merchants in Athens. In that year, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_V_of_Aragon">Alfonso V of Aragon</ref> asserted his claim by appointing Tommaso Beraldo, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_people">Catalan</ref>, duke. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Acciaioli">Giovanni Acciaioli</ref>, Antonio's uncle and archbishop of Thebes, who was then in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome">Rome</ref>, was sent to Venice to appeal the appointment of Tommaso to the senate there, but the pleas were ignored.</p>
<p>Antonio died still in power in January 1435 without legitimate children and his succession to the duchy was disputed between his nephews <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerio_II_Acciaioli">Nerio II</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_II_Acciaioli">Antonio II</ref>, and his widow (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Melissene">Maria Melissene</ref>?).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-25">[25]</ref></p>
