<head>Identity</head>
<p>As with many medieval composers, there is some confusion as to Alanus's identity.

The composer of <hi rend="italic">Sub Arturo plebs</hi>, is identified as Jo.Alani and referring to J.Alani Minimus.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Grove,_Johannes_Alanus-1">[1]</ref> He has been identified with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominus_(title)">Dominus</ref> Johannes Aleyn (or John Aleyn), who was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain">chaplain</ref> for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel">chapel</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III_of_England">Edward III of England</ref> and later <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest)">Canon</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George's_Chapel_at_Windsor_Castle">St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle</ref> from 1362 until his death in 1373.

The "triplum", or third voice, is on a text which names 14 musicians. These mentions, in some cases, are the sole extant references to these active musicians.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Trowell">Brian Trowell</ref> has identified many of those named with royal households. There has been significant debate as to the dating of this motet. The earliest dating assumes that it was written for the 1349 founding of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Garter">Order of the Garter</ref>, this date suggested by Trowell. Roger Bowers suggests that the list of musicians includes musicians who were no longer active at the time of the writing. Margaret Bent and others argue for a later date because of the style of the music itself, which includes a complex structure with three levels of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminution">diminution</ref> and rhythmic overlapping. This later dating, however, does not fall in with the theory that the composer is the same as the chaplain Johannes Aleyn. A certain date earlier than 1370 for this work would lead to a change in accepted ideas about the mid-14th-century style.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Grove,_Johannes_Alanus-1">[1]</ref></p>
