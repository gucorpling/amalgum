He reigned briefly from June 26, 1409, to his death in 1410 and is officially regarded by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">Catholic Church</ref> as an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope">antipope</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Savage-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Life</head>
<p>Alexander V was born near present-day <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapoli,_Crete">Neapoli</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete">Crete</ref>, then part of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice">Republic of Venice</ref>, in 1339.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Gracia506-1">[1]</ref> He was baptised Pietro Filargo, but is often known by the names Pietro di Candia and Peter Philarges.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Gracia506-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>He entered the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan_order">Franciscan order</ref>, and his abilities were such that he was sent to study at the universities of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University">Oxford</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris">Paris</ref>. While he was in Paris the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Schism">Western Schism</ref> occurred; Philarges supported <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Urban_VI">Pope Urban VI</ref> (1378–89). He returned to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy">Lombardy</ref>, where, thanks to the favour of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giangaleazzo_Visconti">Giangaleazzo Visconti</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Milan">Duke of Milan</ref>, he became bishop, first of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piacenza">Piacenza</ref> (1386), then of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicenza">Vicenza</ref> (1387), then of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novara">Novara</ref> (1389), and finally <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Milan">Archbishop of Milan</ref> (1402).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Catholic-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>On being created <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholicism)">cardinal</ref> by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_VII">Pope Innocent VII</ref> (1404–1406) in 1405, he devoted all his energies to the reunion of the Church, in spite of the two rival popes. He was one of the promoters of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Pisa">Council of Pisa</ref> and his political maneuvers incurred the displeasure of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XII">Pope Gregory XII</ref> (1406–1415), who ordered Philarges deprived of both his dignities as archbishop and cardinal.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Catholic-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>At the Council of Pisa (from March 25, 1409), the assembled cardinals chose Philarges as the new <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelate">prelate</ref> for a chair they presumed was vacant. He was crowned on June 26, 1409, as Alexander V, making him in reality the third rival pontiff. Following his election, most polities in Europe recognised him as the true pontiff with the exceptions of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aragon">Kingdom of Aragon</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland">Scotland</ref>, which remained loyal to the Avignon pope, and various Italian states, which adhered to the Roman pope.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>During his ten-month reign, Alexander V's aim was to extend his obedience with the assistance of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">France</ref>, and, notably, of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Louis_II_of_Anjou">Duke Louis II of Anjou</ref>, upon whom he conferred the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture">investiture</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sicily">Kingdom of Sicily</ref>, having removed it from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladislaus_of_Naples">Ladislaus of Naples</ref>. He proclaimed and promised rather than effected a certain number of reforms: the abandonment of the rights of "spoils" and "procurations", and the re-establishment of the system of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_election">canonical election</ref> in the cathedral churches and principal monasteries.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB1911-5">[5]</ref> He also gave out papal favours with a lavish hand, from which the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendicant_order">mendicant orders</ref> benefitted especially.</p>
<p>Alexander V suddenly died while he was with Cardinal Baldassare Cossa at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna">Bologna</ref>, on the night of 3–4 May 1410. His remains were placed in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francesco_(Bologna)">the church of St. Francis</ref> at Bologna. A rumour, though now considered false, spread that he had been poisoned by Cossa, who succeeded him as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope_John_XXIII">John XXIII</ref> (1410–1415).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Savage-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Legacy</head>
<p>The "Popes'" drinking society at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyfriars,_Oxford">Greyfriars</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford">Oxford</ref>, is traditionally held to have been founded by Philarges during his time at the university. With the closure of Greyfriars in 2008, the society is now populated mainly by students of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent's_Park_College,_Oxford">Regent's Park College, Oxford</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>Alexander V is still numbered with subsequent popes since his official status as an antipope was not asserted until the 20th century. Because of this <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Borgia">Rodrigo Borgia</ref> took the name <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI">Pope Alexander VI</ref> in 1492.</p>
