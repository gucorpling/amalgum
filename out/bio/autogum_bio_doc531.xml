<head>Biography</head>
<figure><caption><hi rend="italic">Tobias and the Angel</hi>, Antonio del Pollaiolo</caption></figure>
<p>He was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence">Florence</ref>. His brother, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_del_Pollaiuolo">Piero</ref>, was also an artist, and the two frequently worked together. Their work shows both <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classicism">classical</ref> influences and an interest in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_anatomy">human anatomy</ref>; reportedly, the brothers carried out <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissection">dissections</ref> to improve their knowledge of the subject. They took their nickname from the trade of their father, who in fact sold poultry (<hi rend="italic">pollaio</hi> meaning "hen coop" in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language">Italian</ref>). Antonio's first studies of goldsmithing and metalworking were under either his father or <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_del_Castagno">Andrea del Castagno</ref>: the latter probably taught him also in painting. Other sources relate that he worked in the Florence workshop of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartoluccio_di_Michele">Bartoluccio di Michele</ref>, where <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Ghiberti">Lorenzo Ghiberti</ref> also received his training.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> During this time, he also took an interest in engraving.</p>
<p>Some of Pollaiuolo's painting exhibits strong brutality, of which the characteristics can be studied in his portrayal of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Sebastian">Saint Sebastian</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB1911-4">[4]</ref> painted in 1473–1475 for the Pucci Chapel of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_SS._Annunziata,_Florence">SS. Annunziata</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence">Florence</ref>. However, in contrast, his female portraits exhibit a calmness and a meticulous attention to detail of fashion, as was the norm in late 15th century portraiture.</p>
<p>He achieved his greatest successes as a sculptor and metal-worker. The exact ascription of his works is doubtful, as his brother Piero did much in collaboration with him.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB1911-4">[4]</ref>  The fifteenth-century addition of the infant twins <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_and_Remus">Romulus and Remus</ref> to an existing bronze sculpture of the Ancient Roman mythological <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Wolf">she-wolf</ref> who nursed them has been attributed by some to him.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>He only produced one surviving <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraving">engraving</ref>, the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Nudes_(engraving)">Battle of the Nude Men</ref></hi>, but both in its size and sophistication this took the Italian <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_master_print">print</ref> to new levels, and remains one of the most famous prints of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>In 1484 Antonio took up his residence in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome">Rome</ref>, where he executed the tomb of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Sixtus_IV">Pope Sixtus IV</ref>, now in the Museum of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Peter's_Basilica">St. Peter's</ref> (finished in 1493), a composition in which he again manifested the quality of exaggeration in the anatomical features of the figures. In 1496 he went to Florence in order to put the finishing touches to the work already begun in the sacristy of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Spirito,_Florence">Santo Spirito</ref>.
He died in Rome as a rich man, having just finished his mausoleum of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_VIII">Pope Innocent VIII</ref>, also in St. Peter's, and was buried in the church of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pietro_in_Vincoli">San Pietro in Vincoli</ref>, where a monument was raised to him near that of his brother.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB1911-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>His main contribution to Florentine painting lay in his analysis of the human body in movement or under conditions of strain, but he is also important for his pioneering interest in landscape. His students included <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_Botticelli">Sandro Botticelli</ref>.</p>
