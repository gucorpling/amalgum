<p><hi rend="bold">Lady of the Dunes</hi> (also known as <hi rend="bold">Lady in the Dunes</hi>) is the nickname for an unidentified woman discovered on July 26, 1974 in the Race Point Dunes, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincetown,_Massachusetts">Provincetown, Massachusetts</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cape-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-boston-3">[3]</ref> Her body was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhumation">exhumed</ref> in 1980, 2000, and 2013<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-de-4">[4]</ref> in efforts to identify her and her murderer; to date, these efforts have been unsuccessful.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-herald1-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-wicked-7">[7]</ref> The case was featured on the television series <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haunting_Evidence">Haunting Evidence</ref></hi> in 2006.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<head>Discovery</head>
<figure><caption>The body of the victim upon her discovery</caption></figure>
<p>A teenage girl found the woman's body July 26, 1974.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Lopata-9">[9]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namus-10">[10]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-globe-11">[11]</ref> The remains were just yards away from a road, and had a significant amount of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect">insect</ref> activity.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Lopata-9">[9]</ref> Two sets of footprints led to the body, and tire tracks were found 50 yards (46m) from the scene.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-globe-11">[11]</ref> The woman may have died two weeks before her body was found.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Skeleton_Crew_book-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>The victim was face-down on half of a beach <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanket">blanket</ref>. There was no sign of a struggle; police theorized she either knew her killer or had been asleep when she died. A blue bandanna and pair of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrangler_(brand)">Wrangler</ref> jeans were under her head.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Doe_Network_Casefile-13">[13]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-boston-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-who-14">[14]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-herald2-15">[15]</ref> She had long <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_(color)">auburn</ref> or red hair, pulled back into a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponytail">ponytail</ref> with a gold-flecked elastic band. Her toenails were painted pink.</p>
<p>Police determined the woman was approximately 5feet 6inches (168cm) tall (initially believed to have been 5'8"<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-chief-16">[16]</ref>), weighed 145 pounds (66kg), and had an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsperson">athletic</ref> build.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ma-17">[17]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cold-18">[18]</ref> She also had dental work – including crowns – worth $5,000-$10,000; dentists call it the "New York style" of dental work. Several of her teeth had been removed.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Doe_Network_Casefile-13">[13]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-boston-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-chief-16">[16]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ellement-19">[19]</ref> One hand and one forearm were missing. Most sources say she was between 25 and 40 years old. However, she could have been as young as 20 or as old as 49.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-network-20">[20]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namus-10">[10]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-far-21">[21]</ref></p>
<p>The woman was nearly <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapitation">decapitated</ref>, possibly from strangulation; one side of her head had been crushed with (possibly) a military-entrenching type of tool. This head injury was what killed her.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Doe_Network_Casefile-13">[13]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ellement-19">[19]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-live-22">[22]</ref> There were also signs of sexual assault, likely postmortem.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Doe_Network_Casefile-13">[13]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-wicked-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-chief-16">[16]</ref></p>
<p>Some investigators feel the missing teeth, hands, and forearm indicate the killer wanted to hide either the victim's identity or their own.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-second-23">[23]</ref></p>
<p>The woman was buried in October 1974 after the case went cold.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-globe-11">[11]</ref> In 2014, one of the case investigators raised funds for a new casket, because the original thin metal casket was rusted and deteriorated.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Lopata-9">[9]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-far-21">[21]</ref></p>
<head>Investigation</head>
<figure><caption>Other depictions of the victim, created between 1979 and 2006</caption></figure>
<p>Police pored through thousands of missing-person cases and a list of approved vehicles driven through the area; no matches were found. At the scene, the sand and beach blanket were not disturbed.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Doe_Network_Casefile-13">[13]</ref> No other evidence was found (besides the jeans, bandanna, blanket and ponytail holder) despite extensive searches of the surrounding dunes.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-globe-11">[11]</ref></p>
<p>The first facial reconstruction of the woman was created with clay in 1979.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-chief-16">[16]</ref> Her remains were exhumed in 1980 for examination; no new clues were uncovered (although the skull was not buried at the time).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-chief-16">[16]</ref> The body was exhumed again in March 2000 for DNA.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-second-23">[23]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-24">[24]</ref> In May 2010, her skull was placed through a CT scanner that generated images that were then used by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Center_for_Missing_and_Exploited_Children">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</ref> for another reconstruction.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-25">[25]</ref></p>
<head>Leads</head>
<p>In 1987, a Canadian woman told a friend that she saw her father strangle a woman in Massachusetts around 1972. Police attempted to locate the woman but were unsuccessful. Another woman told police the reconstruction of the victim looked like her sister, who disappeared in Boston in 1974.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-chief-16">[16]</ref></p>
<p>Investigators also followed a lead involving Rory Gene Kesinger, who would have been 25 years old at the time of the murder (she broke out of jail in 1973). Authorities saw a resemblance between Kesinger and the victim.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-second-23">[23]</ref> However, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</ref> from Kesinger's mother did not match the victim.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cape-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-herald2-15">[15]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fox-26">[26]</ref></p>
<p>Two other missing women, Francis Ewalt of Montana and Vicke Lamberton of Massachusetts have also been ruled out.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namus-10">[10]</ref></p>
<head><hi rend="italic">Jaws</hi> film extra possibility</head>
<p>
In August 2015, speculation arose that Lady of the Dunes may have been an extra in the 1975 film <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)">Jaws</ref></hi> (filmed in Massachusetts in 1974). <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hill_(writer)">Joe Hill</ref>, the son of horror author <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King">Stephen King</ref>, brought this to police attention. Hill had learned of the case after reading <hi rend="italic">The Skeleton Crew: How Amateur Sleuths are Solving America's Coldest Cases</hi> just weeks before. Hill told an FBI investigator that during the film's "July 4th Crowd Arrives" sequence, he saw a woman resembling reconstructions of the victim. She is wearing a blue bandana and jeans, similar to those found with the body.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-AV_Club-27">[27]</ref></p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)">Jaws</ref></hi> was shot between May and October 1974. Principal photography was mainly in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menemsha">Menemsha</ref> on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha's_Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</ref>, about 100 miles (160km) south of Provincetown.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-AV_Club-27">[27]</ref></p>
<p>Although a lead investigator has noted interest in this, others have described it as "far-fetched" and "wild speculation."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sleuth-28">[28]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-29">[29]</ref></p>
<head>Suspects</head>
<figure><caption>Bulger's mugshot at Alcatraz (1959; age 30).</caption></figure>
<figure><caption>Additional reconstruction, depicting the victim with and without freckles</caption></figure>
<p>In 1981, investigators learned a woman who resembled the victim was seen with mobster <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitey_Bulger">Whitey Bulger</ref> around the time the woman presumably died.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cape-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-boston-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cold-18">[18]</ref> Bulger was known for removing his victims' teeth. A link to Bulger has not been proven, and he was murdered in prison in 2018.</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Costa">Tony Costa</ref>, a serial killer in the area, was an initial suspect, but later eliminated.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Lopata-9">[9]</ref> Costa died on May 12, 1974.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-30">[30]</ref> The victim was found in July 1974.</p>
<head>Hadden Clark confession</head>
<p>Serial killer <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadden_Clark">Hadden Clark</ref> confessed to the murder, stating "I could have told the police what her name was, but after they beat the shit out of me, I wasn't going to tell them shit.... This murder is still unsolved and what the police are looking for is in my grandfather's garden." Authorities say Clark suffers from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_schizophrenia">paranoid schizophrenia</ref>, a condition which may lead someone to confess falsely to crimes.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-havill-31">[31]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-second-23">[23]</ref></p>
<p>In 2004, Clark sent a letter to a friend stating that he had killed a woman on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod,_Massachusetts">Cape Cod, Massachusetts</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-32">[32]</ref> He also sent two drawings: one of a handless, naked woman sprawled on her stomach, and another of a map pointing to where the body was found.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-havill-31">[31]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-dv-33">[33]</ref></p>
<p>In April 2000, Clark led police to a spot where he claimed he had buried two victims 20 years before. He also stated that he had murdered several others in various states between the 1970s and the 1990s.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-havill-31">[31]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-dv-33">[33]</ref></p>
