<head>Lordship of Zeta</head>
<p>Until 1395 Koja Zaharia was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castellan">castellan</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(castle)">Sati</ref>, which belonged to a fief of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Balšić">Konstantin Balšić</ref> and was part of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordship_of_Zeta">Lordship of Zeta</ref> under <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Đurađ_II_Balšić">Đurađ II Balšić</ref>. In 1395 Balšić ceded Sati (with Dagnum) together with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shkodër">Scutari</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivast">Drivast</ref> to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Republic">Venetian Republic</ref> (in order to create a buffer zone between his Zeta and the Ottoman Empire), but Zaharia refused to allow the Venetians to take control over Sati.</p>
<head>Ottoman Empire</head>
<p>When Koja captured the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagnum">castle of Dagnum</ref> in 1396 he proclaimed himself the Lord of Sati and Dagnum <hi rend="italic">("dominus Sabatensis et Dagnensis")</hi><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> and from there he ruled the territory around it as an Ottoman vassal. In October 1400 Koja proposed to the Venetians to simulate a battle in which he and his cousin <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhimitër_Jonima">Dhimitër Jonima</ref> would pretend to lose their possessions to the Venetians, in exchange for provision of 500 ducats annually. The Venetians did not promptly respond and Koja returned to the sultan.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> In 1402, together with other Albanian noblemen, he fought alongside <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayezid_I">Bayezid I</ref> forces, in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ankara">Battle of Ankara</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>

<p>Around 1412, Koja's daughter Bolja married <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balša_III">Balša III</ref> and in return Balša III allowed him to administer <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budva">Budva</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> At that time Koja's other daughter was already married to a member of Đuraševići who held the most distinguished position in Balša's court.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-17">[17]</ref> To bring Koja even closer, Balša appointed him as castellan of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budva">Budva</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> After the death of Balša III (28 April 1421), Koja's daughter Bolja together with her two daughters<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-19">[19]</ref> returned to her family in Dagnum.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> Koja Zaharia supported Serbian despot <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Lazarević">Stefan Lazarević</ref> until he was defeated by Venice in December 1422.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-21">[21]</ref> Although Venetian <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral">admiral</ref> Francesco Bembo offered money to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjon_Kastrioti">Gjon Kastrioti</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukagjini_family">Dukagjins</ref> and to Koja Zaharija in April 1423 to join the Venetian forces against the Serbian Despotate (offering 200 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducats">ducats</ref> to Koja Zaharia), they refused.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-22">[22]</ref> In one period Serbian despot <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Lazarević">Stefan Lazarević</ref> intended to financially destroy Koja Zaharia and ordered Ragusan traders to avoid paying taxes to Koja and to travel to Serbia via <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lezhe">Lezhe</ref> not through Koja's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagnum">Dagnum</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-23">[23]</ref></p>
