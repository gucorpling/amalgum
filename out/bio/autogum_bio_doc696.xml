<head>Antoine de la Sale</head><figure><caption>Frontispiece of an 1830 edition of <hi rend="italic">Little John of Saintré</hi>, showing a fictitious author's portrait</caption></figure>
<p><hi rend="bold">Antoine de la Sale</hi> (also <hi rend="italic">la Salle</hi>, <hi rend="italic">de Lasalle</hi>; 1385/86–1460/61) was a French courtier, educator and writer.
He participated in a number of military campaigns in his youth and he only began writing when he had reached middle age, in the late 1430s.
He lived in Italy at the time, but returned to France in the 1440s, where he acted as umpire in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_tournament">tournaments</ref>, and he wrote a treatise on the history of the knightly tournament in 1459.
He became the tutor of the sons of  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Luxembourg,_Count_of_Saint-Pol">Louis de Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol</ref>, to whom he dedicated a moral work in 1451.
His most successful work was <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_John_of_Saintré">Little John of Saintré</ref></hi>, written in 1456, when he was reaching the age of seventy.</p>
<head>Biography</head>
<p>He was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provence">Provence</ref>, probably at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arles">Arles</ref>, the illegitimate son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardon_de_la_Salle">Bernardon de la Salle</ref>, a celebrated <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gascony">Gascon</ref> mercenary, mentioned in <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froissart's_Chronicles">Froissart's Chronicles</ref>.</hi> His mother was a peasant, Perrinette Damendel.</p>
<p>In 1402 Antoine entered the court of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valois_House_of_Anjou">third Angevin dynasty</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjou">Anjou</ref>, probably as a page.
In 1407 he was at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messina">Messina</ref> with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_II,_Duke_of_Bourbon">Louis II, Duke of Bourbon</ref>, who had gone there to enforce his claim to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sicily">kingdom of Sicily</ref>. The next years he perhaps spent in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Brabant">Brabant</ref>, for he was present at two <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_(medieval)">tournaments</ref> given at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels">Brussels</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent">Ghent</ref>.
In 1415 he took part in the successful expedition by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_I_of_Portugal">John I of Portugal</ref> against the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors">Moors</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta">Ceuta</ref>.
In 1420 he accompanied the 17-year-old <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_III_of_Anjou">Louis III of Anjou</ref> in his attempt to assert his claim as King of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples">Naples</ref>.</p>
<p>He travelled from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcia">Norcia</ref> to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monti_Sibillini">Monti Sibillini</ref> and the neighboring <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilate's_Lake">Pilate's Lake</ref> (the final resting place of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontius_Pilate">Pontius Pilate</ref>, according to local legend). The story of his adventures on this trip and of the local legends and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibyl's_grotto">Sibyl's grotto</ref> form a chapter of <hi rend="italic">La Salade</hi>, which also has a map of the ascent from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montemonaco">Montemonaco</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBryant1911-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>In 1426 La Sale probably returned with Louis III of Anjou, who was also <hi rend="italic">comte de <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provence">Provence</ref></hi>, to Provence, where he was acting as <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viguerie">viguier</ref></hi> of Arles in 1429.
In 1434 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_of_Anjou">René of Anjou</ref>, Louis's successor, made La Sale tutor to his son, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II,_Duke_of_Lorraine">John II, Duke of Lorraine</ref> (also known as the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Calabria">Duke of Calabria</ref>), to whom he dedicated, between the years 1438 and 1447, his <hi rend="italic">La Salade</hi>, a textbook of the studies necessary for a prince. The title is of course a play on his own name, but he explains it as being due to the diverse subject matter of the book: a salad is composed "of many good herbs."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBryant1911-1">[1]</ref> The work covered geography, history, protocol and military tactics. One complete original copy has survived,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> and two early printed editions.
It includes <hi rend="italic">Queen Sibyl's Paradise</hi> (<hi rend="italic"><hi lang="fr" rend="italic">Le Paradis de la reine Sibylle</hi></hi>),<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> and <hi rend="italic">Trip to the Lipari Isles</hi> (<hi rend="italic"><hi lang="fr" rend="italic">Excursion aux Îles Lipari</hi></hi>), but these have often been edited separately.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>In 1439 he was again in Italy in charge of the castle of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capua">Capua</ref>, with John II and his young wife, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_de_Bourbon_(1428–1448)">Marie de Bourbon</ref>, when the place was besieged by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_V_of_Aragon">king of Aragon</ref>. La Sale married Lione de la Sellana de Brusa in the same year. He was about fifty-three; she was fifteen. René abandoned Naples in 1442, and Antoine no doubt returned to France about the same time. His advice was sought at the tournaments which celebrated the marriage of the unfortunate <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_Anjou">Margaret of Anjou</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy,_France">Nancy</ref> in 1445; and in 1446, at a similar display at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saumur">Saumur</ref>, he was one of the umpires.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBryant1911-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>La Sale's pupil was now twenty years of age, and after forty years' service to the house of Anjou, La Sale left it to  become tutor to the sons of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Luxembourg,_Count_of_Saint-Pol">Louis de Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol</ref>, who took him to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conty_of_Flanders">Flanders</ref> and presented him at the court of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_le_Bon">Philippe le Bon</ref>, duke of Burgundy. For his new pupils he wrote at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatelet-sur-Oise">Chatelet-sur-Oise</ref>, in 1451, a moral work entitled <hi rend="italic">La Salle</hi>. He followed his patron to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genappe">Genappe</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Brabant">Brabant</ref> when the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dauphin_of_France">Dauphin</ref> (afterwards <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XI_of_France">Louis XI</ref>) took refuge at the Burgundian court.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBryant1911-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>During the last decade of his life, la Sale becomes productive as a writer, publishing his most famous work, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_John_of_Saintré">Little John of Saintré</ref></hi> in 1456,  a consolatory epistle <hi rend="italic">Reconfort a Madame de Neufville</hi> in 1458 and his tournament book <hi rend="italic">Des anciens tournois et faictz d'armes</hi> in 1459.    <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_Nouvelles_nouvelles">Cent Nouvelles nouvelles</ref></hi>, a collection of licentious stories supposed to be narrated by various persons at the court of Philippe le Bon, was apparently collected or edited by him.  A completed copy of this was presented to the Duke of Burgundy at Dijon in 1462. If then La Sale was the author, he probably was still living; otherwise the last mention of him is in 1461.</p>
