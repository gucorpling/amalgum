<head>Andrew Stewart (bishop of Caithness, died 1541)</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Andrew Stewart</hi> (died 1541) was a 16th-century Scottish noble and cleric. He was the legitimate<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stewart,_1st_Earl_of_Atholl">John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Sinclair">Eleanor Sinclair</ref>, daughter of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sinclair,_1st_Earl_of_Caithness">William Sinclair, Earl of Orkney</ref>. His paternal grandmother was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Beaufort,_Queen_of_Scotland">Joan Beaufort</ref>, former <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Queens_of_Scotland">queen-consort of Scotland</ref> (to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_Scotland">James I</ref>).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> Andrew chose an ecclesiastical career, held a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonry">canonry</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkeld_Cathedral">Dunkeld Cathedral</ref> and was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)">rector</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blair_Atholl">Blair</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parish_church">parish church</ref> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkeld">Dunkeld</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese">diocese</ref>),<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowdeb-248-3">[3]</ref> a church under the control of the earls of Atholl.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>After the death in January 1515 of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brown_(bishop_of_Dunkeld)">George Brown</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunkeld">Bishop of Dunkeld</ref>, a new bishop was needed for that <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese">bishopric</ref>. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Tudor">Queen Margaret</ref>, husband of the recently deceased <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_IV_of_Scotland">James IV</ref> and mother of the young <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V_of_Scotland">James V</ref>, backed to succeed Brown one <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Douglas">Gavin Douglas</ref>, a poet and cleric who was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provost_(religion)">Provost</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Giles_Cathedral">St Giles church</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> He was the uncle of the queen's new husband, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Douglas,_6th_Earl_of_Angus">Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bawcutt-ODNB-6">[6]</ref> The queen had put him forward on 20 January 1515, just a few days after Brown's death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bawcutt-ODNB-6">[6]</ref> Douglas had lately missed out on the position of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_St_Andrews">Archbishop of St Andrews</ref>, and so this was in some way intended as compensation.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> Douglas had a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proctor">proctor</ref> pay 450 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florin_(Italian_coin)">florins</ref> to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_see">Papal see</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_X">Pope Leo X</ref> confirmed his position on 25 May.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Andrew Stewart's brother John Stewart, 2nd <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Atholl">Earl of Atholl</ref>, pressured the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_(religion)">chapter</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkeld_Cathedral">Dunkeld Cathedral</ref> to elect Andrew to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_see">see</ref> instead of Douglas. Alexander Myln, in his 16th century <hi rend="italic">Vitae Dunkeldensis ecclesiae episcoporum</hi> ("Lives of the Bishops of Dunkeld"), related that after hearing news of Bishop Brown's death, Atholl visited Dunkeld and requested that his brother be made bishop.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> As many of the canons were either related by blood to Atholl, or else held lands under Atholl's power, the pressure was significant and Andrew Stewart was accordingly elected to the see.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-82-10">[10]</ref> A letter was sent to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stewart,_Duke_of_Albany">John Stewart, Duke of Albany</ref>, Governor of Scotland and guardian of the young <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V_of_Scotland">James V of Scotland</ref>; Albany was in France and refused to deal with the disposal of any bishopric until his return to the country.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-82-10">[10]</ref> When Albany returned in May (still 1515), he subverted Queen Margaret, confirmed the appointment of Andrew and compelled the chapter of Dunkeld to hand over the temporalities of the see.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> In July, the Queen agreed to Andrew Stewart's appointment and Albany  imprisoned Douglas for breaking the laws of the kingdom, that is, on account of his purchase of the bishopric at Rome.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>However, Andrew Stewart failed to secure confirmation from the Papacy. Albany gave up his support for Andrew and released Douglas from imprisonment; in September 1516, he agreed to Douglas' accession to the see of Dunkeld.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bawcutt-ODNB-6">[6]</ref> Douglas was consecrated on 21 September 1516.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> On 24 July 1517, Albany wrote to the Pope requesting that Andrew Stewart be given the now vacant <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Caithness">see of Caithness</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowdeb-248-3">[3]</ref> The Pope agreed, and on 14 December 1517, Andrew Stewart became <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Caithness">Bishop of Caithness</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> Thereafter, the sources leave almost no information about Stewart, and his 24-year rule of the diocese of Caithness goes largely undocumented, save only the occasional appearance, such as his attendance at parliament on 10 December 1540.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> He died <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestate">intestate</ref> some short time before 9 August 1541.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref></p>
