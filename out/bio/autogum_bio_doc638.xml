<p>In the first half of the 14th century, mercenaries, raiders and migrants flooded into Greece (1325 and 1334 raids into Thessaly). These were known in Greek as <hi rend="italic">Albanians</hi>, from their area of origin, but they also included <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlachs">Vlachs</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHammond197657-6">[6]</ref> In 1358, Albanians and Vlachs overran Epirus, Acarnania and Aetolia, and subsequently established two principalities under their leaders, John Spata and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Losha">Peter Losha</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHammond197659-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikephoros_II_Orsini">Nikephoros II Orsini</ref> launched a campaign against the invading Albanians,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994348-9">[9]</ref> and also faced with the threat of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radoslav_Hlapen">Radoslav Hlapen</ref> to the north, he negotiated with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Uroš">Simeon Uroš</ref>, presumably to prevent Simeon's Albanian allies from supporting the Albanians in Epirus.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994348-9">[9]</ref> The negotiations were thwarted by Nikephoros' death fighting the Albanians <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Achelous_(1359)">at Acheloos (1359)</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994348–349-10">[10]</ref></p>

<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Uroš">Simeon Uroš</ref>, the titular Serbian Emperor, recognized John Spata as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despot_(court_title)">Despot</ref> and ruler of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetolia">Aetolia</ref> in the early 1360s.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref></p>
<head>1371–80</head>
<p>The Despot of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioannina">Ioannina</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Preljubović">Thomas Preljubović</ref>, had betrothed his daughter to Losha's son in 1370, satisfying the Albanians and ending the conflict between them.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicol1984146-12">[12]</ref> In 1374, however, Peter Losha died of the plague in Arta, after which John Spata took the city. At this time he was not bound by agreement to Thomas, and so he laid siege to Ioannina and ravaged the countryside. Thomas brought peace when he betrothed his sister Helena to John Spata the following year.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicol1984146-12">[12]</ref> Attacks on Ioannina continued, however, by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malakasioi">Malakasioi</ref>, who were defeated twice by Thomas in 1377 and 1379.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicol1984146-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>In 1376 or 1377, Spata conquered <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafpaktos">Nafpaktos</ref>; by this time he controlled Arta and much of southern Epirus and Acarnania.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994401-13">[13]</ref> The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Achaea">Achaean</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller">Knights Hospitallers</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Fernández_de_Heredia">Juan Fernández de Heredia</ref> began their invasion of Epirus, moving onto John Spata, capturing Nafpaktos, and then <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vonitsa">Vonitsa</ref> in Acarnania (April 1378). However, Spata managed to capture Heredia, ending their campaign; he was again master of Nafpaktos by 1380.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994401-13">[13]</ref> In May 1379, John Spata again devastated the countryside of Ioannina.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENicol1984147-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>In 1380, Thomas made an offensive with the help of Turks reaching up to the upper <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamas_River">Kalamas River</ref>, where however, the Albanians and particularly the Vlach Mazarakioi held firm.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHammond197659-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>1381–99</head>
<p>In 1385 Thomas Preljubović was killed by some of his bodyguards.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHammond197659-1">[1]</ref> John attacked Ioannina, but was unsuccessful in cracking the defense set up by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esau_de'_Buondelmonti">Esau de' Buondelmonti</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994355-15">[15]</ref> The two made peace, but soon returned to conflict.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994355-15">[15]</ref> In 1386, Esau gained Ottoman military help.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994355-15">[15]</ref> The Ottomans were, after the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kosovo">Battle of Kosovo</ref> (1389), unable to assist Esau, thus, the Albanians seized the opportunity and raided the environs of Ioannina in the summer.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994355-15">[15]</ref> The Malakasioi then raided into the territory, after which they concluded alliance with Spata.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994355-15">[15]</ref> Esau then allied himself with the caesar of Thessaly (either Alexios Angelos or Manuel), who defeated the Albanians, presumably Spata and the Malakasioi, later that year.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994355-15">[15]</ref></p>
<p>In 1396, Esau married John Spata's daughter, Irene.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFine1994355-15">[15]</ref></p>
<p>Spata died on 29 October 1399, under the continuous pressure of Preljubović and Tocco, whose son would become the next despot of Epirus.</p>

<p>His genealogical tree is not well documented. It was first outlined by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Hopf">Karl Hopf</ref> in his Chroniques Greco-Romanes (p.531) and by K. Sathas in the 19th century but a newer study finds that those works have many mistakes and gaps.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> Hopf's genealogy of the Spata family is "altogether inaccurate".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Luttrell-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>G. Schiró studied the genealogy of Spata based on the original sources, i.e. the "Chronicle of Ioannina" and the "Chronicle of Tocco", but also on the Venetian archives. He proposed that Pietro Bua had not only three sons but four and that John had only daughters. His daughter Irene married three times. He believes that the family was extinct with the death of Yaqub in 1416. Other people, mainly condottieri, with the name "Bua" are not blood relatives of this family but this name was used by many as first name since it became famous.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-19">[19]</ref></p>
