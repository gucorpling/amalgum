<p><hi rend="bold">Gul Rahman</hi> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashto_language">Pashto</ref>: ګل رحمان‎; died 20 November 2002) was an Afghan man, suspected by the United States of being a militant, who was a victim of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture">torture</ref>. He died in a secret <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA">CIA</ref> prison, or <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_site">black site</ref>, located in northern <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul">Kabul</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</ref> and known as the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Pit">Salt Pit</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NationalJournal2014-12-10-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Yahoo-2010-04-06-2">[2]</ref> He had been captured October 29, 2002.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NewYorker-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-CbsNews-2010-04-06-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>His name was kept secret by the United States for more than seven years although his death was announced. In 2010 the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press">Associated Press</ref> reported that before his death he was left half-stripped and chained against a concrete wall on a night when the temperature was close to freezing.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NewYorker-3">[3]</ref> The United States government did not notify his family (wife and four daughters) of his death, according to the report.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NewYorker-3">[3]</ref></p>
<head>Capture and death</head>
<p>Gul Rahman was captured and arrested on 29 October 2002 during a joint operation by U.S. agents and Pakistani security forces against <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezb-e-Islami_Gulbuddin">Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-MSNBC-5">[5]</ref> He was reportedly arrested with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician">physician</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghairat_Baheer">Ghairat Baheer</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son-in-law">son-in-law</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord">warlord</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulbuddin_Hekmatyar">Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</ref>, who led the insurgent faction <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezb-e-Islami">Hezb-e-Islami</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-MSNBC-5">[5]</ref> Rahman had traveled from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar">Peshawar</ref> to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad">Islamabad</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan">Pakistan</ref> for a medical checkup when he was arrested at the home of Ghairat Baheer, and subsequently flown by the CIA to Afghanistan.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-MSNBC-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>U.S. officials claim Rahman was "violently uncooperative" while in custody at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Pit">Salt Pit</ref>, the CIA code name for an abandoned brick factory that had been turned into a CIA <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_site">black site</ref> or covert interrogation center,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-MSNBC-5">[5]</ref> including threatening to kill his guards – who responded by beating him.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-MSNBC-5">[5]</ref> Rahman was also subjected to "48 hours of sleep deprivation, auditory overload, total darkness, isolation, a cold shower and rough treatment". Gul Rahman reportedly died on 20 November 2002 after being stripped naked from the waist down and shackled to a cold cement wall in the Salt Pit, where temperatures were approximately 36°F (2°C).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-CbsNews-2010-04-06-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>This technique of shackling is known as "short-chaining." The detainee is  shackled "in a short chain position, which prevents prisoners from standing upright." A CIA pathologist reported that  Rahman likely froze to death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>His death prompted an internal CIA review and the development of improved guidance.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-MSNBC-5">[5]</ref> No one was ever charged in his death.</p>
