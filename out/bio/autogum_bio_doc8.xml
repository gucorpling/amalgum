<head>Department of Homeland Security</head>
<head>Chief of U.S. Border Patrol</head>
<figure><caption>Morgan in September 2016</caption></figure>
<p>In June 2016, he was named as the next chief of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Border_Patrol">U.S. Border Patrol</ref> by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama">Obama administration</ref>, and took command in July.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> Morgan was the first Chief of the Border Patrol to come from outside the agency, and was intended to be a reformer and increase accountability.  The appointment was opposed by the Border Patrol's union, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Border_Patrol_Council">National Border Patrol Council</ref>.  His decision to wear the Border Patrol uniform was met with some opposition, as he had never been a Border Patrol officer.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:4-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>On December 1, 2016, Morgan stated in a Senate hearing that he supported a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which was met with strenuous criticism from the National Border Patrol Council.  Morgan subsequently clarified that he did not support "blanket amnesty".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:3-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>On January 26, 2017, just days after President Donald Trump took office, he was forced to resign.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:3-6">[6]</ref>  He had reportedly desired to stay in his post during the Trump administration, internally criticizing the immigration enforcement policies of the Obama administration after the election.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<head>Gap in government service</head>
<p>In January 2019, Morgan said that he could determine if an unaccompanied minor would become a member of MS-13, a transnational crime gang known for gruesome violence, just by looking at their eyes.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-9">[9]</ref></p>
<head>Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement</head>
<p>At the end of April 2019, it was reported that Trump was considering Morgan to take over as head of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</ref>. The agency's former acting director, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Vitiello">Ronald Vitiello</ref>, resigned earlier in April after Trump pulled his nomination for the director's job, telling reporters that he wanted to go with someone "tougher" instead.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
<p>On May 5, Trump announced on Twitter that he had chosen Morgan to become the next director of ICE.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> The <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> reported that the announcement "caught White House aides and Homeland Security officials by surprise. They had not been informed Morgan was Trump’s choice, and at ICE, senior leaders learned of the decision from the president’s tweet, according to two senior administration officials."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Albence">Matthew Albence</ref>, who had been acting director of ICE since April 2019 and was previously acting deputy director of the agency, continued in that role until Morgan was formally named acting director on May 28, 2019.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>He was formally appointed to a newly-created position as Principal Deputy Director that outranked the preexisting Deputy Director position.  This was criticized as avoiding Senate scrutiny for this position through the normal confirmation process.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref></p>
<head>Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner</head>
<p>On June 27, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Morgan would become the acting commissioner of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</ref>, replacing <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_P._Sanders">John Sanders</ref>, who had announced his resignation.  On July 5, 2019, Morgan became acting commissioner.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-17">[17]</ref>  His formal appointment was as Chief Operating Officer of the agency.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref></p>
