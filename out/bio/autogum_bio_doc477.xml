He was of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_(region_of_Italy)">Emilian</ref> school, and was part of the team of artists called the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Fontainebleau">School of Fontainebleau</ref> that introduced the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italianate_Renaissance">Italianate Renaissance</ref> to France.

<head>Biography</head>
<p>Niccolò dell'Abbate was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modena">Modena</ref>, the son of a violinist.</p>
<p>He trained together with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Fontana_(painter)">Alberto Fontana</ref> in the studio of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Begarelli">Antonio Begarelli</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB-1">[1]</ref> a local Modenese sculptor; early influences included <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Ferrara">Ferrarese painters</ref> such as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Garofalo">Garofalo</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosso_Dossi">Dosso Dossi</ref>. He specialized in long friezes with secular and mythological subjects, including for the <hi rend="italic">Palazzo dei Beccherie</hi> (1537); in various rooms of the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocca_dei_Boiardo">Rocca di Scandiano</ref></hi> owned by the counts Boiardo he created 12 frescoes, one for each book of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid">The Aenid</ref></hi>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-gil-2">[2]</ref> and notably a courtly ceiling <hi rend="italic">Concert</hi> composed of a ring of young musicians seen in perspective, <hi rend="italic">Sotto in Su</hi> (early 1540s), and the Hercules Room in the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocca_Meli_Lupi,_Soragna">Rocca Meli Lupi</ref></hi> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soragna">Soragna</ref> (c. 1540–43), and possibly the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loggia">loggia</ref> frescoes removed from Palazzo Casotti at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia">Reggio Emilia</ref>.</p>
<p>His style was modified by exposure to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correggio">Correggio</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigianino">Parmigianino</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[nb 1]</ref> when he moved to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna">Bologna</ref> in 1547. In Bologna, most of his  painting depicted elaborate landscapes and aristocratic genre scenes of hunting and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtly_love">courtly loves</ref>, often paralleled in mythologic narratives. It was during this time that he decorated the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Poggi">Palazzo Poggi</ref></hi>, and executed a cycle of frescoes illustrating <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Furioso">Orlando Furioso</ref></hi>  in the ducal palace at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassuolo">Sassuolo</ref>, near Modena.  Bologna is also the location of his illustrations for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariosto">Ariosto</ref>'s <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Furioso">Orlando Furioso</ref></hi>, and where he was celebrated in a sonnet which compares him to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael">Raphael</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titian">Titian</ref> among others.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-gil-2">[2]</ref> One of his early pieces that cemented his reputation was the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyrdom_of_St._Peter_and_St._Paul">Martyrdom of St. Peter and St. Paul</ref></hi>, in the church of the abbey of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Pietro,_Modena">San Pietro</ref>, Modena.</p>
<p>He spent 1548 through 1552 in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna">Bologna</ref>, where he gained influence from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correggio">Correggio</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigianino">Parmigianino</ref>. His surviving stucco-surface landscape in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Poggi">Palazzo dell'Università</ref> shows his maturing style.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>In 1552, Niccolò moved to France, where he worked at the royal <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Château_de_Fontainebleau">Château de Fontainebleau</ref> as a member of the decorating team under the direction of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Primaticcio">Francesco Primaticcio</ref>. Within two years of his arrival he was drawing a project for a decor commemorating <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_de_Montmorency">Anne de Montmorency</ref> (preparatory drawing at the Louvre). In Paris, he frescoed the chapel ceiling in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hôtel_de_Guise">Hôtel de Guise</ref> (destroyed), following Primaticcio's designs. He also executed private commissions for portable canvases of mythological subjects sited in landscapes. He designed a series of tapestries titles <hi rend="italic">Les Mois Arabesques</hi>, some of which were used by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limoges_enamel">painted enamel industry of Limoges</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB-1">[1]</ref> Much of his output reflected an often overlooked function of artists of the time: the ephemeral festive decorations erected to celebrate special occasions in the court circle, for example, the decorations for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_entry">triumphal entry</ref> into Paris staged for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IX_of_France">Charles IX</ref> and his bride <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_of_Austria,_Queen_of_France">Elisabeth of Austria</ref>. His final pieces, in 1571, were 16 murals which were done with the assistance of his son <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Camillo_(painter)">Giulio Camillo</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB-1">[1]</ref> That year, Niccolò died in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</ref>, France.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Niccolò's great-nephew, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ercole_Abbate">Ercole Abbate</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modena">Modena</ref> (1573-1613), was one of his pupils.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[4]</ref></p>
<head>Works</head>
<p>Niccolò is best known for his mythological landscape subjects, which introduced the Flemish <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_landscape">world landscape</ref> into French art, such as the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus">Orpheus</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_with_the_Death_of_Eurydice">Landscape with the Death of Eurydice</ref></hi> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery,_London">National Gallery, London</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[5]</ref> and the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_of_Prosperine">Rape of Prosperine</ref></hi> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre">Louvre</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[6]</ref> and for his profuse and elegant drawings.  Not many of his frescoes have survived; however the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre">Louvre</ref> does have a collection of his drawings.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[7]</ref> Many of his canvasses were burnt in 1643, by the Austrian regent, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Austria">Anne</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB-1">[1]</ref> Some of his landscapes for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IX_of_France">Charles IX</ref> were influential for the 17th century painters <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Lorrain">Claude Lorrain</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Poussin">Nicolas Poussin</ref>.</p>
