<head>Background</head>
<p>Earlier in his career, he served as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapıcıbaşı">kapıcıbaşı</ref> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_ceremonies">master of ceremonies</ref>) for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_sultan">Ottoman sultan</ref>. He became a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizier">vizier</ref> in 1782.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sicilli-53-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Governorship of Aleppo</head>
<p>Abdi Pasha was appointed as the governor of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_Eyalet">Aleppo Eyalet</ref> by the sultan in 1784.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sicilli-53-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SluglettWeber2010-2">[2]</ref> Upon taking office, his militias killed several <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janissaries">Janissaries</ref>. He then had the leaders of Aleppo's Christian communities arrested and ordered them to wear special clothing, only reversing this upon receiving a heavy fee from them.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SluglettWeber2010-2">[2]</ref> The local Janissaries began to fight back and barricaded Abdi Pasha in the governor's palace, which he was only able to leave through the mediation of his <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadı">kadı</ref> (judge). He was then expelled from Aleppo, going to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakka_Eyalet">Rakka</ref> (modern <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raqqa">Raqqa</ref>, Syria), where he soon became governor.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SluglettWeber2010-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ulker1994-4">[4]</ref> Aleppo would remain without a governor for just over a year after his expulsion.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SluglettWeber2010-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Campaign in Egypt</head>
<p>In 1786, while Abdi Pasha was the governor of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyarbekir_Eyalet">Diyarbekir Eyalet</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapudan_Pasha">Kapudan Pasha</ref> (grand admiral of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Navy">Ottoman Navy</ref>) <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezayirli_Gazi_Hasan_Pasha">Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha</ref> was ordered by the sultan <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdülhamid_I">Abdülhamid I</ref> to take troops to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_Eyalet">Egypt</ref> and drive out the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk">Mamluk</ref> emirs led by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Bey_(Mamluk)">Ibrahim Bey (Mamluk)</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murad_Bey">Murad Bey</ref>, who had become <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> rulers of the province, frequently deposing the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_governor_of_Egypt">Ottoman governors</ref> at their pleasure.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/181-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>As grand admiral Hasan Pasha moved towards Egypt, Abdi Pasha and his troops joined him. While waiting for the emirs to appear in order to engage them in battle on 24 October 1786, the news reached Abdi Pasha that the sultan had appointed him to be the governor of Egypt.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/216–217-6">[6]</ref> However, Abdi Pasha wished to continue commanding his troops, so he told grand admiral Hasan Pasha that he could not take office until the Mamluks had been defeated and set out with his army to find them, leaving Hasan Pasha to continue being the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> governor.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/216–217-6">[6]</ref> Soon, his troops located the Mamluk emirs and defeated them in battle, causing celebration in Egypt.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/216–217-6">[6]</ref></p>
<head>Governorship of Egypt</head>
<p>After the Mamluk emirs were defeated, which would prove to be temporary, Abdi Pasha entered the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Citadel">Cairo Citadel</ref> and took office as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ottoman_governors_of_Egypt">governor of Egypt</ref> on 30 April 1787<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/231-7">[7]</ref> while the pro-Ottoman Mamluk Emir <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Bey">Ismail Bey</ref> became <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaykh_al-Balad">Shaykh al-Balad</ref> (civil governor) and de facto ruler.</p>
<p>On 2 December 1788, a courier arrived from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul">Istanbul</ref>, the Ottoman capital, that Abdi Pasha had been replaced as governor by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Pasha_(Tripolitanian)">Ismail Pasha the Tripolitanian</ref>, the former <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kethüda">kethüda</ref></hi> (deputy or assistant) of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapudan_Pasha">Kapudan Pasha</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezayirli_Gazi_Hasan_Pasha">Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/286–287-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sicilli829-9">[9]</ref> When the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk">Mamluk</ref> emirs, who had secured a negotiation with Abdi Pasha as to their power, found out that he had been replaced by Ismail Pasha, they refused to honor the deal.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/286–287-8">[8]</ref> Abdi Pasha, angry over his dismissal and this turn of events, sent agents to Istanbul to persuade the sultan to reappoint him as governor.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/289-10">[10]</ref> This was successful, and within a month, on 3 January 1789, news arrived that Abdi Pasha had been reappointed the governor of Egypt and that he should drive the Mamluk emirs out of southern (Upper) Egypt.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/289-10">[10]</ref></p>
<p>However, less than a month later, on 30 January 1789, messengers from Istanbul appeared carrying an order for the re-dismissal of Abdi Pasha and the reappointment of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Pasha_(Tripolitanian)">Ismail Pasha</ref>, this being the result of the persuasions of Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha, Ismail Pasha's former superior and friend, who had undone what Abdi Pasha's agents had done to have him reappointed.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/289-10">[10]</ref> Now governor again, Ismail Pasha had Abdi Pasha's accounts audited and found that he owed money to the provincial treasury, which Abdi Pasha negotiated to half of the original amount. He paid the sum and prepared to leave Cairo.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/291-11">[11]</ref></p>
<p>Abdi Pasha left Egypt on 30 March 1789, headed for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyarbekir_Eyalet">Diyarbekir</ref> (modern <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyarbakır">Diyarbakır</ref>), in order to gather troops to fight against the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire">Russian Empire</ref> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1787–92)">Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-JabartiPhilipp1994-2/292-12">[12]</ref></p>
<head>Death</head>
<p>After gathering troops for the war with Russia, he traveled to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo">Aleppo</ref> that same month (March) and died there in April.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sicilli-53-1">[1]</ref></p>
