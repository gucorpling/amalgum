<head>Life</head>
<p>Nicholas was the son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bela_of_Saint_Omer">Bela of Saint Omer</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonne_de_la_Roche">Bonne de la Roche</ref>, sister of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Athens">Lord of Athens and Thebes</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_I_de_la_Roche">Guy I de la Roche</ref>. Upon their marriage, in 1240, Guy gave Bela the lordship over half of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebes,_Greece">Thebes</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Along with his brothers, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otho_of_Saint_Omer">Otho</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Saint_Omer">John</ref>, he participated in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Euboeote_Succession">War of the Euboeote Succession</ref> in the ranks of the coalition of most of the princes of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankish_Greece">Frankish Greece</ref>, who opposed the expansionist policies of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Achaea">Prince of Achaea</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II_of_Villehardouin">William II of Villehardouin</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-PLP-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> In 1273, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_Naples">Charles I of Naples</ref> sent him as his envoy to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bulgarian_Empire">Bulgarian</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Serbia_(medieval)">Serbian</ref> courts, but he soon fell into disfavour with Charles, and was forced to exchange his holdings in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morea">Morea</ref> with others in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily">Sicily</ref>, under Charles' immediate control. His position and domains were not restored until after the death of Charles I in 1285.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-PLP-2">[2]</ref> During this time, Nicholas often resided in Italy, where Charles used him and other visiting Moreote barons as counsellors on the affairs of the Principality.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref>\</p>

<p>In 1287, the Neapolitan regent <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_II,_Count_of_Artois">Robert of Artois</ref> named him the Angevins' representative governor (<hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailli">bailli</ref></hi>) in the Principality of Achaea,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-PLP-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> in succession of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_I_de_la_Roche">William I of Athens</ref>, who had just died and whose heir, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_II_de_la_Roche">Guy II</ref>, was still under-age. At the time, Nicholas was the second richest and most influential baron living in the Latin East after Guy.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Crusades261-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bon159-7">[7]</ref> He continued William's policy of fortification of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenia">Messenia</ref> and built the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Navarino_castle">castle at Navarino</ref> and a smaller fortress at Maniatochori near <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoni,_Messenia">Modon</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Crusades261-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bon159-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EHW-8">[8]</ref> His regime was remembered for its peace and prosperity: according to the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_Morea">Chronicle of Morea</ref></hi>, "He governed with nobility and wisdom, and kept the country at peace". He was succeeded in 1289 by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_of_Vostitsa">Baron of Vostitsa</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_de_Charpigny">Guy de Charpigny</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Crusades261-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Nicholas married twice, both times to rich heiresses. His first wife was Mary of Antioch, daughter of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemond_VI_of_Antioch">Bohemond VI of Antioch</ref>, and his second, ca. 1280, was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Komnene_Doukaina">Anna</ref>, daughter of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_II_Komnenos_Doukas">Michael II Komnenos Doukas</ref> and widow of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II_of_Villehardouin">William II of Villehardouin</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-PLP-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Crusades261-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> With financial aid from Mary of Antioch, Nicholas built the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_Saint_Omer">Castle of Saint Omer</ref> (in Greek Σανταμέρι, Santameri) in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmea">Cadmea</ref>, the ancient <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis">acropolis</ref> of Thebes, which is much praised by the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of the Morea</hi> as being the strongest and most beautiful in Greece. It was richly furnished and decorated with frescoes depicting his ancestors' exploits in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land">Holy Land</ref>. Today, only a tower survives.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EHW-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> Anna on the other hand, as Princess-dowager, brought with her a considerable property, including the castles of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamata">Kalamata</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlemoutsi">Chlemoutsi</ref>, comprising "some of the most fertile lands and the strongest fortress in the Morea", according to A. Bon. This worried King Charles, who was loath to cede these territories to an already very powerful and wealthy subject; in the event, they were exchanged in September 1281 with half the domains of the recently deceased <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_of_Veroli">Leonard of Veroli</ref>, comprising estates in both the Morea (in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elis">Elis</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenia">Messenia</ref>) and Italy.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref></p>
<p>Both his marriages were childless, and on his death in 1294, he was succeeded by his younger brother <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otho_of_Saint_Omer">Otho</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EHW-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>
