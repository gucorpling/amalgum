<head>Eglantine Wallace</head><p>
<hi rend="bold">Eglantine Wallace, Lady Wallace</hi> (<hi rend="italic">née</hi> Maxwell; died 28 March 1803), was an 18th-century Scottish author. She was the younger sister of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Gordon,_Duchess_of_Gordon">Jane Gordon, Duchess of Gordon</ref>.</p>
<head>Biography</head>
<p>Eglantine was the youngest daughter of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Maxwell,_3rd_Baronet">Sir William Maxwell, 3rd Baronet</ref>, of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monreith">Monreith</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigtownshire">Wigtownshire</ref>. A boisterous <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hoyden">hoyden</ref> in her youth, and a woman of violent temper in her maturer years, she was married on 4 September 1770 to Thomas Dunlop, son of John Dunlop of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunlop,_East_Ayrshire">Dunlop</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Dunlop">Frances Anna Wallace</ref>, the daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Wallace (1702–1770) of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigie_Castle,_Ayrshire">Craigie</ref>, fifth and last <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_baronets">baronet</ref>.</p>
<p>On his grandfather's death in 1770, her husband inherited Craigie, took the surname Wallace, and assumed the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(manner_of_address)">style</ref> of a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baronet">baronet</ref>; however, the property was deeply indebted, and in 1783 he was obliged to sell all that remained of Craigie. It would seem to have been shortly after this that Eglantine obtained a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_separation">legal separation</ref>, on the ground, it is said, of her husband's cruelty. It is probable that the quarrel was due to pecuniary embarrassment.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTELaughton189997,_98-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>A little later Lady Wallace was herself summoned for assaulting a woman—apparently a humble companion—and was directed by the magistrate to compound the matter. Leaving <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh</ref>, she seems to have settled in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</ref>, but upon her play <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Whim">The Whim</ref></hi> (1795) being prohibited the stage by the licenser, she left England in disgust. In October 1789 she was arrested at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris</ref> as an English agent, and narrowly escaped with her life. In 1792 she was in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels">Brussels</ref>. There she contracted a friendship with General <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_François_Dumouriez">Charles François Dumouriez</ref>, whom in 1793 she entertained in London, where she seems to have been well received in society.</p>
<p>She died at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich">Munich</ref> on 28 March 1803, leaving two sons, the elder of whom was General [Sir] <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alexander_Wallace_(British_Army_officer)">John Alexander Dunlop Agnew Wallace</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTELaughton189998-2">[2]</ref></p>
