<p><hi rend="bold">Dúghall of Lorne</hi> [or <hi rend="bold">de Ergadia</hi>] (died  1403) was a late 14th century and early 15th century <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelate">prelate</ref> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</ref>. Probably a MacDúghaill (MacDougall) from the province of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne,_Scotland">Lorne</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll">Argyll</ref>, he appears to have studied at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford">University of Oxford</ref> before returning to Scotland for an ecclesiastical and administrative career.

<head>Biography</head>
<head>Background and early career</head>
<p>Dúghall was from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Argyll">diocese of Argyll</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-359-1">[1]</ref> His surname is given variously as <hi rend="italic">de Lorne</hi> (of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorne,_Scotland">Lorne</ref>) or as <hi rend="italic">de Ergadia</hi> (of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll">Argyll</ref>), the surnames used by the higher-ranking members of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacDougall">MacDúghaill kindred</ref> and the old <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_Argyll">lords of Argyll</ref>; he was certainly a kinsman of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gallda_MacDougall">John Gallda</ref>, the MacDúghaill Lord of Argyll who died sometime between 1371 and 1388.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-359-1">[1]</ref> He was misidentified in Wood's <hi rend="italic">Peerage</hi> (and those using that work thereafter) as a son of Sir John Drummond of Stobhall, the ballie of the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abthen">abthen</ref></hi> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dull,_Perth_and_Kinross">Dull</ref>; this would have made him a brother of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabella_Drummond">Anabella Drummond</ref>, wife and queen to King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_III_of_Scotland">Robert III of Scotland</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> He is styled <hi rend="italic">Petri</hi> in a few sources, meaning perhaps that his father's name was Peadar (or Peter), though this is far from certain as that name was unusual at the time anywhere in Scotland.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-359-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>On 30 March 1364 Dúghall was granted a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-conduct">safe-conduct</ref> by the English crown to come study at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford">University of Oxford</ref> for two years; it was later related in a document dating to June 1380 that he had studied both <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law">canon law</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law">Roman law</ref> for three years.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> Dúghall is found holding the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parish_church">parish church</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilmore,_Argyll_and_Bute">Kilmore</ref> on 12 October 1371; this church was in the patronage of John Gallda.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-359-1">[1]</ref> As there was a perpetual <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicar">vicar</ref> at the time, Kilmore must have been held without cure, i.e. allowing Dúghall to enjoy the revenues without having any pastoral obligations in the parish.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> Kilmore seems to have been turned into a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prebend">prebend</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lismore_Cathedral">Lismore Cathedral</ref> by the end of the decade, and Dúghall is found as a canon and prebendary of the diocese of Argyll by 11 March 1380.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-359-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>The papal bull confirming the erection of this new prebend did not come however until 5 May that year, shortly before Dúghall became bishop of the neighbouring <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Dunblane">diocese of Dunblane</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> This letter stated that Dúghall "also holds a canonry and prebend in the diocese of Dunkeld".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> Dúghall can be found holding a canonry and prebend in the diocese of Dunblane as early as 23 November 1375, a prebend he held in plurality with Kilmore in Argyll.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-359-1">[1]</ref> On 11 March 1380 he was provided to yet another benefice in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_St_Andrews">diocese of St Andrews</ref>, and then to another prebend and canonry in the diocese of Dunblane.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-359-1">[1]</ref> By 1380, he was the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary">secretary</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain">chaplain</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stewart,_Earl_of_Fife">Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife</ref> (later <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Albany">Duke of Albany</ref>), son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Robert_II_of_Scotland">King Robert II of Scotland</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-359-1">[1]</ref> At <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon">Avignon</ref> on 2 June 1380, he presented a roll of petitions on the Fife's behalf to the pope.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-359-1">[1]</ref></p>

<p>On 12 September, while still at Avignon, he was provided by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon_Pope_Clement_VII">Pope Clement VII</ref> to the bishopric of Dunblane;  this provision apparently followed an earlier election.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> He had almost certainly received consecration by 11 October but his consecration had certainly occurred by 13 February 1381.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> On the latter date he was back in the Kingdom of Scotland, witnessing a charter of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stewart,_Earl_of_Strathearn">David Stewart, Earl of Strathearn</ref>, brother of the earl of Fife.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>Thereafter notice of Bishop Dúghall in the surviving sources is limited. He is next found on 1 October 1392 witnessing two charters of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemia_I,_Countess_of_Ross">Euphemia I, Countess of Ross</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling">Stirling</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_burgh">royal burgh</ref> on the edges of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menteith">Menteith</ref> and the diocese of Dunblane.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-360-10">[10]</ref> A papal mandate of 27 October 1394 provided one Dómhnall <hi rend="italic">de Bute</hi> as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(religion)">Dean</ref> of Dunblane, annulling Bishop Dúghall's own provision of Dómhnall made "in ignorance of the reservation" earlier made by the pope.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> On 4 September 1395 the bishop is mentioned in a papal document concerning the succession to one of the churches in his diocese.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> In 1396, it is known that he travelled to Avignon once again; a roll of petitions presented by Dúghall on behalf of 20 Scottish people and 3 continental Europeans was granted by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon_Pope_Benedict_XIII">Pope Benedict XIII</ref> on 1 August 1396.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-360-10">[10]</ref></p>
<p>The last ever notice of Dúghall occurs in a charter of the lord of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byres">Byres</ref>, wherein Dúghall appears along with the Duke of Albany and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Trail">Walter Trail</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_St_Andrews">Bishop of St Andrews</ref>; the charter can be dated between 1398 (creation of the Duchy of Albany) and 1401 (the death of Walter Trail).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-360-10">[10]</ref> It is not known for certain that he is death until 10 September 1403, when his successor <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fionnlagh_MacCailein">Fionnlagh MacCailein</ref> was provided as the new Bishop of Dunblane.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> It is likely his death occurred not long before the last date.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Watt-360-10">[10]</ref> A papal letter of 27 April 1413 claimed that he had granted a dispensation in order to allow Elizabeth de Danielston to marry Robert de Maxwell.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> There are indications that Bishop Dúghall may have increased the number of canons at Dunblane Cathedral, but this is very far from certain.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref></p>
