<head>Foreign affairs</head>
<p>The main concern of Alexander the Good was to defend the country in wars against superior armies. In order to do that, he forged a system of alliances with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallachia">Wallachia</ref> and Poland, generally against <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hungary">Hungary</ref> (although he had been backed to the throne by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Sigismund of Hungary</ref>). In 1402, he was sworn <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassal">vassal</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogaila">Jogaila</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Polish_monarchs">King of Poland</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-isbn0-8179-9791-1-3">[3]</ref> The treaty was renewed in 1404, 1407, 1411 and 1415. </p>

<p>Alexander participated in two battles against the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutonic_Knights">Teutonic Knights</ref>: in 1410 at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Grunwald">Grunwald</ref> and in 1422 at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Marienburg_(1410)">Marienburg</ref>.

<p>Due to a territorial claim of Poland and the previous failure of the Polish king to fulfill his part of the vassality treaty during an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman</ref> attack in 1420, Alexander launched an attack on Poland during the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Civil_War_(1431–1435)">Lithuanian Civil War (1431–1435)</ref>. The attack ended with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Suceava">Treaty of Suceava</ref> on November 18, 1431.</p>
