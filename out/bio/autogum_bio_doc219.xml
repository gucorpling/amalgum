<head>Biography</head>
<p>Jan was born in 1740 or 1754 as the son of Jakub Suchorzewski and Jadwiga Zajączek.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SW-3">[3]</ref> Around 1770 he married Joanna  Przyjemska; they had three children.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SW-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>During the Great Sejm Suchorzewski was at first a supporter of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic_Party">Patriotic Party</ref>; in particular he supported the enlargement of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</ref>'s army.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-RabowiczMaksimowicz1998-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bartoszewicz1891-32-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Korzon1897-6">[6]</ref> In 1789 he published a brochure on the cities and law (<hi rend="italic">Basics of urban laws</hi> - <hi rend="italic">Zasady praw miejskich</hi>).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Orgelbrand1903-7">[7]</ref> However, he eventually switched sides and joined the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetman_Party">Hetman Party</ref> opposed to the reforms.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Jezierski2005-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-RabowiczMaksimowicz1998-4">[4]</ref> Around 18 January 1791 he criticized the recently premiered <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Deputy">The Return of the Deputy</ref></hi> (<hi rend="italic">Powrót posła</hi>) comedy of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Ursyn_Niemcewicz">Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz</ref> for its political content; his critique was not well received and he was ridiculed for it, losing prestige.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Senelick1991-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Meer2002-9">[9]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bartoszewicz1891-241-10">[10]</ref> Despite his opposition of many reforms, he nonetheless played a major, if perhaps not necessarily intentional,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bartoszewicz1891-233-11">[11]</ref> role in the passage of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Royal_Cities_Act">Free Royal Cities Act</ref> in April 1791, as his rather unexpected involvement in the discussion boosted the supporters of the act and eased its passing.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Smoleński1919-12">[12]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bartoszewicz1891-83-13">[13]</ref> For that, the king rewarded him with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Saint_Stanislaus">Order of Saint Stanislaus</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bartoszewicz1891-241-10">[10]</ref></p>
<p>Suchorzewski unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the king from signing the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_3_May">Constitution of 3 May</ref>, blocking his way and threatening to kill his own son to save him from the "slavery of the Constitution".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-mr-14">[14]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-biul-15">[15]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bartoszewicz1891-290-16">[16]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#endnote_bnone">[b]</ref> In this way he repeated, in an infamous, or tragicomic way, the gesture of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Rejtan">Tadeusz Rejtan</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Derdej2008-17">[17]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bartoszewicz1891-303-18">[18]</ref> This incident was immortalized on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Matejko">Jan Matejko</ref>'s painting <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_May_3,_1791_(painting)">Constitution of May 3, 1791</ref></hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-mr-14">[14]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-biul-15">[15]</ref> From Suchorzewski's pocket, a deck of cards has fallen out, an allusion to the way he was bribed by the Hetman Party leaders, Russian ambassador <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Magnus_von_Stackelberg_(ambassador)">Otto Magnus von Stackelberg</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetman">hetman</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciszek_Branicki">Branicki</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-mr-14">[14]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-mr-14">[14]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-biul-15">[15]</ref> Later, he would publish a critique of the constitution in the brochure <hi rend="italic">Uwagi nad konstytucją polską 3 maja 1791</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Notes on the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791</hi>)<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Orgelbrand1903-7">[7]</ref> and <hi rend="italic">Odezwa do narodu wraz z protestacyją dla Śladu Gwałtu i Przemocy, do której prawie w całym Sejmie zbliżano, a w dniu 3 maja 1791 dokonano</hi> (<hi rend="italic">A Declaration to the Nation with a Protestation for the Evidence of Rape and Violence which was Planned throughout most of the Sejm and on day 3 May 1791 Carried out</hi>).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bartoszewicz1891-246-19">[19]</ref></p>

<p>Suchorzewski, with several other opponents of the constitution, departed to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</ref> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire">Russian Empire</ref>, where he became one of the founding members and high-ranking officials (<hi rend="italic">konsyliarz</hi>) of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation_of_Targowica">Confederation of Targowica</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Jezierski2005-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SokołowskiInlender1905-20">[20]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kraszewski1903-21">[21]</ref> Derdej speculated that out of all those who signed the act of the Confederation, Suchorzewski was the only one who might have thought they were really acting in the country's best interest.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Derdej2008-17">[17]</ref> He commanded a cavalry brigade in the Confederation forces during the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Defense_of_the_Constitution">War in Defense of the Constitution</ref> that the Confederates eventually won, overthrowing the Constitution. During the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kościuszko_Uprising">Kościuszko Insurrection</ref> he was sentenced, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_in_absentia">in absentia</ref></hi>, to a death by hanging, eternal <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infamy">infamy</ref>, loss of all titles and confiscation of possessions.
