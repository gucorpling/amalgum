<head>Life</head>
<p>John was the son of Simon of Saarbrücken-Commercy (d. 1325), son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_I_of_Saarbrücken-Commercy">John I</ref> <ref target="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean%20Ier%20de%20Sarrebruck-Commercy">(fr)</ref> (b. 1265 -  1341/42), Count of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Saarbrücken">Saarbrücken</ref>. His mother was Marguerite of Savoy-Vaud (d. 1313),<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> a daughter of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_I_of_Vaud">Louis I of Vaud</ref>, married with Simon in 1309. </p>
<p>1326, before the death of John II's grandfather, Count John I, the inheritance was divided. John was awarded the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Saarbrücken">County of Saarbrücken</ref> and a small part of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercy">Commercy</ref>, called "Saarbrücken" or "Château bas".  The larger part of Commercy, called "Château haut", went to his <hi rend="italic">uncle</hi> John II (Jean II) <ref target="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean%20II%20de%20Sarrebruck-Commercy">(fr)</ref>, as "Seigneur of Commercy", of the house of Saarbrücken-Commercy. One of his sons was Jean III.</p>
<p>Like his father Simon, John II supported France in the war against England.  During the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Poitiers">Battle of Poitiers</ref> 1356, both John II and King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_of_France">John II of France</ref> were taken prisoner by the English.  He was held in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallingford_Castle">Wallingford Castle</ref> until 1360.</p>
<p>In 1362, he fought against gangs of mercenaries near <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon">Lyon</ref> and was briefly taken prisoner again.  John II undertook several diplomatic missions in the service of the French King.  In 1362, he travelled to the court of Emperor <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IV,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Charles IV</ref> and in the following years, he travelled to the English court several times.  In 1364, he was appointed <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Butler_of_France">Grand Butler of France</ref> as a reward for his services. In 1370 John was appointed chairman of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Finances">Court of Finances</ref>. In 1371, he received the Lordship of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaucouleurs">Vaucouleurs</ref>.</p>
<p>In 1380, John II retired from the French court.  He died in 1381.  As he had no sons, his daughter <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna_of_Saarbrücken">Johanna</ref> inherited the County of Saarbrücken.  However, she died later that year, and the county fell to her son <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_I,_Count_of_Nassau-Weilburg">Philipp I</ref> of Nassau-Weilburg.  Various lines of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Nassau">House of Nassau</ref> would hold the county until it was conquered by France in 1795.</p>
<head>Marriage and issue</head>
