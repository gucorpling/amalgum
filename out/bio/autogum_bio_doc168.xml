<head>Controversy</head>
<p>In 2006, a report conducted by WIPO's Internal Audit and Oversight Division at the request of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Joint_Inspection_Unit">United Nations Joint Inspection Unit</ref> showed Idris' age had been misrepresented was the information was leaked to media outlets.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-MIP-17">[17]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-IPwatch-18">[18]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-19">[19]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> Earlier WIPO records showed Idris' date of birth to be 26 August 1945, but he had attempted to change his records to show he was born on 26 August 1954.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-MIP-17">[17]</ref> On 21 September 2007 the Secretariat of the WIPO called the report<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-21">[21]</ref> "a deliberate intention to harm [Idris]" <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-22">[22]</ref> and criticized the report's legitimacy and failure of the author to follow procedure which compromised its confidential status.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-23">[23]</ref> Idris' birthday has been reported as possibly being 26 August 1945,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-24">[24]</ref> 26 August 1953<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-25">[25]</ref> or 26 August 1954.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-birth-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>During the 10-day WIPO general assembly that ended on 3 October 2007, a move to remove Idris from his position was blocked. WIPO came under fire for its credibility. Idris agreed to resign,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-IHT-051207-26">[26]</ref> and stepped down a year early from his post as head of WIPO.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-AFP_14.11.07-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>In December 2016, it was reported that documents from WIPO dated in 2010 signed by the legal counsel of the organization, Edward Kwakwa, were released which show that Idris did not misrepresent his birth date.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-docs-27">[27]</ref></p>
