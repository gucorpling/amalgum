<head>Henry le Chen</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Henry le Chen</hi> [<hi rend="bold">le Cheyn</hi>, <hi rend="bold">le Chein</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Cheyne</hi>, <hi rend="bold">de Chene</hi>] was a late 13th-century and early 14th-century <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoto-Norman">Scoto-Norman</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop">bishop</ref>. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Boece">Hector Boece</ref> claims that he was the nephew of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_III_Comyn,_Lord_of_Badenoch">John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch</ref>, but no contemporary evidence supports this.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> Cheyne belonged to a family with Norman roots which was well established in the northeast of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scotland</ref>, holding significant amounts of territory on the boundaries of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earldom_of_Buchan">Earldom of Buchan</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Reid-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Life</head>
<p>Henry emerges for the first time - as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precentor">Precentor</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Machar's_Cathedral">Aberdeen Cathedral</ref> - when his name occurs in a document dated to 22 January 1277.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> Despite the fact he was only a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon">deacon</ref>, after the death of the former bishop, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_de_Benin">Hugh de Benin</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_(religion)">chapter</ref> unanimously elected le Chen to be the new <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Aberdeen">Bishop of Aberdeen</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-108-4">[4]</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Martin_IV">Pope Martin IV</ref> originally cancelled the election because le Chen had not been yet ordained a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest">priest</ref>, but reversed his decision and commissioned <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wishart">Robert Wishart</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_de_St_Edmund">Alan de St Edmund</ref> and William, the bishops of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Glasgow">Glasgow</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane">Caithness</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane">Dunblane</ref> respectively, to consecrate le Chen after one of them had ordained him a priest.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-108-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Le Chen's strong Comyn connections meant that, in the succession dispute which followed the deaths of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Scotland">Alexander III of Scotland</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret,_Maid_of_Norway">Margaret, Maid of Norway</ref>, he firmly supported the Comyn-backed claims of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Scotland">John Balliol</ref>; he was one of the auditors employed by Balliol during the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Cause">Great Cause</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Reid-2">[2]</ref> Although one of the senior royal councillors during the reign of King John Balliol,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Reid-2">[2]</ref> when King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England">Edward I of England</ref> invaded and deposed King John, le Chen quickly swore an oath of fealty to Edward, and was so well trusted by the King that the latter put him in charge of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriffdom">sheriffdom</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen">Aberdeen</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Reid-2">[2]</ref> In the period immediately following the uprising and restoration of the throne by Robert de Brus (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_the_Bruce">Robert the Bruce</ref>), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Carrick">Earl of Carrick</ref>, in 1306, le Chen was noticeably lukewarm to the new king (now <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_I_of_Scotland">Robert I of Scotland</ref>), and at some point was temporarily deprived of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporalities">temporalities</ref> of his <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_see">see</ref>, though there is no direct evidence that he suffered exile.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>In 1309 he attended Robert's first <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Scotland">parliament</ref> and was part of the renewal of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Perth">Treaty of Perth</ref> in 1312, but Bishop Henry nevertheless held a low profile for the remainder of the decade.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> However, despite the complete success of the Bruce cause, no other bishop is found to be promoted, and le Chen was a loyal subject of the king by the end of the decade when he was summoned to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_curia">papal curia</ref> (16 August 1320) to account for the behaviour of his king.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref>  On 16 June 1321, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_XXII">Pope John XXII</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication">excommunicated</ref> Bishop Henry, and on 23 May 1322, commanded the bishops of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester">Winchester</ref> and Dunblane to promulgate the sentence.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>John died at an unknown date in 1329, the same year as King Robert.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> Pope John XXII referred to le Chen as "of good memory", meaning that Henry had been absolved of his sentence before his death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> He was credited with constructing a bridge over the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Don,_Aberdeenshire">river Don</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref></p>
