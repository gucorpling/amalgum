<p>In 2004, Banks was approached by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruger_National_Park">Kruger National Park</ref> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</ref>) officials asking for a solution to update <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushbuckridge">Bushbuckridge</ref> community members on changes and developments in the park using their <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone">mobile phones</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-19">[19]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> After research, it turned out that all solutions at the time required <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</ref> access, which wasn't available in the region at the time.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ng2010-14">[14]</ref> In early 2005, Banks realized that a simple piece of software could be developed to send and receive multiple text messages (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">SMS</ref>) to and from mobile phones using a laptop with no Internet connection.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-21">[21]</ref> With an initial investment of 10,000 pounds,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ng2010-14">[14]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-bits-22">[22]</ref>) Banks started to develop <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FrontlineSMS">FrontlineSMS</ref> in summer 2005 and completed it within 5 weeks.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ng2010-14">[14]</ref> The software was officially launched in October 2005.

<p>Almost two years after its launch, FrontlineSMS was used by a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria">Nigerian</ref> organization called Humanitarian Emancipation Lead Project (HELP) to assist Nigerians in reporting on their <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_general_election,_2007">2007 national elections</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ng2011-24">[24]</ref> The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</ref> ran a story, <hi rend="italic">Texts monitor Nigerian elections</hi>, mentioning FrontlineSMS<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-25">[25]</ref> and user downloads and global interest accelerated.
