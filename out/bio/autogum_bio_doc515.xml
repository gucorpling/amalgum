<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir">Sir</ref> <hi rend="bold">Richard Herbert</hi> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Bachelor">Kt</ref> (died 1510) of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewyas">Ewyas</ref>, Herefordshire, was an English knight, gentleman, landowner, and courtier. He was an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegitimate">illegitimate</ref> son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herbert,_1st_Earl_of_Pembroke_(1423–1469)">William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke</ref>, and Maud, a daughter of Adam ap Howell Graunt (Gwynn).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Lee-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Burke-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Sil-3">[3]</ref> Richard had a full brother named George.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Sil-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Richard Herbert of Ewyas should not be confused with his uncle, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Herbert_of_Coldbrook">Sir Richard Herbert of Coldbrook</ref>, a brother of his father, William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Sanford-4">[4]</ref></p>
<head>Herbert legacy</head>
<p>The titles and estates of the Earl of Pembroke descended to Herbert's younger, legitimate half-brother William,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Sil-3">[3]</ref> but he achieved notability through his own merit and through his descendants: "Sir Richard Herbert, of Ewyas, who, though illegitimate, is ancestor of the men who have really, in modern times, rendered the name of Herbert illustrious."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Wilt-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>In 1465, Richard Herbert was granted Westminster, manors of Grove, Radnore, Mookas, Brutescourt, Throuckeston, Westhide, Egelton, Redehire, Howton and Wormeton Tirell, in Herefordshire.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Pub_Records-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>He was successful as a Gentleman Usher to King Henry VII and was appointed Constable and Porter of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abergavenny_Castle">Abergavenny Castle</ref> on 22 July 1509.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Sil-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Sanford-4">[4]</ref> While Herbert is most often named as "Sir Richard Herbert," there is uncertainty as to whether he was knighted. In "The Knights of England", there is a record of a Richard Herbert being knighted in 1513, but that was three years after this man's death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> According to Sil, Richard was never knighted, but was an Esquire.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Sil-3">[3]</ref> Richard is entitled Esquire in 1465, when he was granted manors and lands.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Pub_Records-6">[6]</ref> However, other sources<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Lee-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Burke-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Sanford-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Wilt-5">[5]</ref> call him "Sir Richard Herbert", and an article entitled "The Family of Herbert" in <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gentleman's_Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</ref></hi> states that he was knighted by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England">King Henry VIII</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-GM-8">[8]</ref> in which case as he died in 1510 he would have been knighted in the last year of his life, and the first year of Henry VIII's reign, which began in 1509.</p>
