<hi rend="bold">Joachim Gans</hi> (other spellings: <hi rend="bold">Jeochim</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Jochim</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Gaunz</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Ganse</hi>, <hi rend="bold">Gaunse</hi>) was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian">Bohemian</ref> mining expert, renowned for being the first <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew">Jew</ref> in North America.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-grassl-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Biography</head>
<head>Early life</head>
<p>Gans was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bohemia">Kingdom of Bohemia</ref>, and therefore was most likely related to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gans">David Gans</ref>, who settled there in 1564.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-abrahams-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>England</head>
<p>He is first mentioned in his professional capacity at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keswick,_Cumbria">Keswick</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland">Cumberland</ref>, in 1581.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Donald-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>He introduced a new process for the "making of Copper, vitriall, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(II)_sulfate">Coppris</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting">smeltinge</ref> of Copper and leade <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore">ures</ref>."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-State_Papers_Domestic_1865-4">[4]</ref> Gans figured in the English state papers of the reign of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Elizabeth I</ref> and a full description of his operations is preserved in these documents,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-State_Papers_Domestic_1865-4">[4]</ref> printed by Donald.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Donald-3">[3]</ref>  Gans's most dramatic scientific discovery was to reduce the time to purify a batch of copper ore from sixteen weeks to just four days.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-abrahams-2">[2]</ref> Additionally, Gans was able to use the impurities removed from the copper ore in textile <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordant">mordants</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Donald-3">[3]</ref></p>
<head>Colonization of America</head>
<p>Gans became the first Bohemian and the first recorded Jew in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States">colonial America</ref> when, in 1585, Sir <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Raleigh">Walter Raleigh</ref> recruited him for an expedition to find a permanent settlement in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Virginia">Virginia territory</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World">New World</ref>.</p>
<p>Sir <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lane">Ralph Lane</ref>, Governor of Raleigh's expedition, led the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_Colony">Roanoke Colony</ref> on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke_Island">Roanoke Island</ref> off the coast of modern <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina">North Carolina</ref> in 1585. Among the ruins at the Roanoke site, archaeologists have discovered lumps of smelted copper and a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldsmith"> goldsmith’s</ref> crucible attributed to Gans's work at the colony.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-grassl-1">[1]</ref> Because the royal mining company failed to resupply colonists who were also becoming increasingly fearful of conflicts with the Native Americans, they accepted an offer from Sir <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Drake">Francis Drake</ref> in June 1586 to sail them to England. Each of the colonists, including Gans, left North America.</p>
<head>Later life and trial for blasphemy</head>
<p>Gans moved to the town of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol">Bristol</ref> where he gave <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language">Hebrew</ref> lessons to English gentlemen who wanted to read the Bible in its original tongue. In 1589, Bishop of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichester">Chichester</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Curteys">Richard Curteys</ref> visited Gans who in speaking "in the Hebrue tonge," proclaimed himself a Jew. Bishop Curteys asked Gans, "Do you deny <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ">Jesus Christ</ref> to be the Son of God?" Gans replied, "What needeth the almighty God to have a son? Is he not almighty?"<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-abrahams-2">[2]</ref> Gans was brought before the mayor and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldermen">aldermen</ref> of Bristol for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy">blasphemy</ref>. Rather than embarrass an associate of the Royal Mining Company, Bristol’s town fathers referred his case to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty's_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council">Queen’s Privy Council</ref>, which included major investors of the Royal Mining Company.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-abrahams-2">[2]</ref> Gans was transported back to London to face their judgment.</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Walsingham">Francis Walsingham</ref>, who was then <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_state">joint principal secretary</ref> and other members of the council also knew him.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-abrahams-2">[2]</ref>
The council appears to have taken no hostile action, however, although the trial's outcome and all subsequent history of Gans is unknown, as no information is available.</p>
<head>Posterity</head>
<p>His discoveries along with the general body of his scientific work led to a degree of fame.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-abrahams-2">[2]</ref> Some critics have suggested that Gans was the model for the Jewish scientist Joabin in Sir <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon">Francis Bacon</ref>'s <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia">utopian</ref> novel, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atlantis">New Atlantis</ref></hi>, although others have suggested Joabin is named after <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joab">Joab</ref>, the commander of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_David">King David</ref>'s army and David's co-conspirator in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriah_the_Hittite">Uriah the Hittite</ref>'s death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-grassl-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>
