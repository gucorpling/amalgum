<p>Rodriguez, besides being a singer with a great voice, is an arranger and guitar player. All the songs that he interprets are composed by him. He has a great number of unpublished compositions that have not yet been recorded, and because of the unique characteristics of his native country, Cuba, many of his hits have never been exploited commercially, and some of them have never even been recorded.</p>
