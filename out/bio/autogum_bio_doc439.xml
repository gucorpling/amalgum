<head>Henry Williams (alias Cromwell)</head>
<p>Sir <hi rend="bold">Henry Williams, alias Cromwell</hi> (c. 1537 – 1604)<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFuidge1981-1">[1]</ref> was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_of_the_shire">knight of the shire</ref> (MP) for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingdonshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)">Huntingdonshire</ref> and a grandfather of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</ref>.</p>
<p>His grandfather, Morgan ap William, was the son of a man named William, and also used the name Williams, but his father abandoned the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic#Welsh_and_Cornish">Welsh patronymic</ref> system completely and adopted the name of Cromwell, in honour of an uncle <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell,_1st_Earl_of_Essex">Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex</ref>. The family then consistently used and wrote its name as "Williams, alias Cromwell",  well into the 17th century.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Biography</head>

<p>He was highly esteemed by Queen <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Elizabeth I</ref>, who knighted him in 1563.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> He was an important enough man, with a large enough house, for the Queen to do him the honour of sleeping at his seat, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinchingbrooke_House">Hinchingbrooke House</ref>, on 18 August 1564, on her return from visiting the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge">University of Cambridge</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Williams, alias Cromwell, was in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_England">House of Commons</ref> in 1563, as one of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_the_shire">knights of the shire</ref> for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingdonshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)">Huntingdonshire</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> and was four times appointed <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff_of_Cambridgeshire_and_Huntingdonshire">Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire</ref>, by Elizabeth, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> in the 7, 13, 22, and 34 years of her reign;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> and in the 20th, she nominated him a commissioner with others, to inquire concerning the draining of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fens">The Fens</ref> through <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parson_Drove">Cloughs Cross</ref> and so to the sea.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref></p>
<figure><caption>North front of Hinchinbrook (1787)</caption></figure>
<p>He made <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingdonshire">Huntingdonshire</ref> the entire place of his country residence, living at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_Abbey">Ramsey Abbey</ref> in the summer, and Hinchingbrooke in the winter; he repaired, if not built, the manor-house at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey,_Cambridgeshire">Ramsey</ref>, and made it one of his seats. Mark Noble comments that he had heard that the house of Ramsey was only the lodge of that magnificent pile, and converted by Sir Henry into a dwelling-house.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> Sir Henry also built Hinchingbrooke House adjoining to the nunnery at Hinchingbrooke,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> and upon the bow windows there he put the arms of his family, with those of several others to whom he was allied.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>Sir Henry lived to a good old age, dying 6 January 1604. He was buried in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints'_Church,_Huntingdon">All Saints' Church, Huntingdon</ref>, on 7 January.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> An indication of the funeral pomp used at his interment can be found by the charges of the heralds, which were the same as those incurred at the burial of some of the greatest knights of his day.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>Mark Noble stated that Sir William was called, from his liberality, the "golden knight"; and reported that in Ramsey it was said, that whenever Sir Henry came from Hinchingbrooke to that place, he threw considerable sums of money to the poor townsmen.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> This excellent character is given of him, "he was a worthy gentleman, both in court and country, and universally esteemed";<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> and which his merit justly deserved. By the record of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition_post_mortem">inquisitio post mortem</ref></hi>, taken at Ramsey, 2 June, following his death, it appears that he died possessed of these manors in Huntingdonshire, Saltry, Saltry-Moynes, Saltry-Judith, Sawtry-Monastery, all valued at £60 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>; <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warboys">Warboys</ref> and Whistow, with their rectories, and the New-red-deer Park, valued together at £40 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>; Hinchingbrooke, valued at £10 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>; <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broughton,_Cambridgeshire">Broughton or Broweton</ref>, with the rectory, valued at £20 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>; <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bury,_Cambridgeshire">Berry and Hepmangrove</ref>, and the rectory of Berry, valued at £20 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>; the forests of Waybridge, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapley">Sapley</ref>, valued at £6 13s 4d; the farm or grange of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higney">Higney</ref>, and the messuage called the George, with the land belonging to it, valued at £10 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>; and the manor of Ramsey, with the farm of Biggin, valued at £100 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi>. all of which were held of king by military service. except the forests of Waybridge and Sapley, together with the farm, or grange of Higney, the tenures of which were unknown.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<head>Family</head>
<p>Sir Henry Williams, alias Cromwell, married twice. His first marriage was to Joan, a daughter of  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Warren_(Lord_Mayor)">Sir Ralph Warren</ref>, twice <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_London">Lord Mayor of London</ref>;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> she died at Hinchinbrooke and was buried there in All Saints' church in 1584.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-19">[19]</ref></p>
<p>Some time after the death of Joan, Sir Henry married a lady of the name of Weeks, who bore for her arms azure a lion rampant checky argent and gules.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> She was buried at All Saints', Huntingdon, 11 July 1592 but no monument remains of either Sir Henry or of his wives, or indeed any of the name of Cromwell in that place as Huntingdon was devastated during the Civil War and all the monuments and brass plates to the dead were either destroyed or looted.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-21">[21]</ref> Lady Weeks died of a lingering illness, which in that superstitious age was blamed on witchcraft. On 4 April 1593, in the court presided over by justice Fenner, John Samwell, his wife and daughter were found guilty of causing the death of Joan through witchcraft and executed a few days later (see the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witches_of_Warboys">Witches of Warboys</ref> case).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-22">[22]</ref></p>
<p>By the first marriage, Sir Henry had numerous children; by the latter, none. Sir Oliver, the eldest son, gained the bulk of his fortune, to each of the other sons were given estates of about an annual value of £300.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-23">[23]</ref></p>
