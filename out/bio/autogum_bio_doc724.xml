<head>Leonel Power</head><p><hi rend="bold">Leonel Power</hi> (also spelled <hi rend="italic">Lionel, Lyonel, Leonellus, Leonelle</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Polbero</hi>;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Grove-1">[1]</ref> 1370 to 1385 – 5 June 1445) was an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">English</ref> composer of the late <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_music">Medieval</ref> and early <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_music">Renaissance</ref> eras.  Along with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dunstaple">John Dunstaple</ref>, he was one of the major figures in English music in the early 15th century.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-DevWest-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Key_figures_in_medieval_Europe-3">[3]</ref></p>
<head>Life</head>

<p>Very little is known about Power's life. Documents dating from the early 1440s refer to him as a native of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent">Kent</ref>. Stylistic analysis of his music, as well as his probable age during his known appointments, show that he may have been born between 1370 and 1385. A suggestion that Power was of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people">Irish</ref> origin, which appeared in W.H.G. Flood's 1905 <hi rend="italic">A History of Irish Music</hi>, is usually discounted by modern scholars, since Flood is not known to have had any other sources on Power's life than are currently available.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Grove-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>The earliest dated reference to Power refers to him as instructor to the choristers of the household chapel of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_of_Lancaster,_1st_Duke_of_Clarence">Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence</ref>. The duke died in 1421; the next reference to Power is from 1423: on 14 May he joined the fraternity of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Cathedral">Christ Church, Canterbury</ref>. He almost certainly served as choirmaster of the cathedral, and may also have been employed by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Lancaster,_1st_Duke_of_Bedford">John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford</ref>. He died at Canterbury on 5 June 1445 and was buried the next day; several notices of his death survive.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Grove-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Music and influence</head>
<p>While Power's output was slightly less than Dunstaple's (only 40 extant pieces can be definitely attributed to him), his influence was similar. He is the composer best represented in the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Hall_Manuscript">Old Hall Manuscript</ref>,</hi> one of the only undamaged sources of English music from the early 15th century (most manuscripts were destroyed during the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</ref> in 1536-1540 under <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII</ref>).</p>
<p>Power was one of the first composers to set separate movements of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_of_the_Mass">Ordinary of the Mass</ref> which were thematically unified and intended for contiguous performance. The Old Hall Manuscript contains his mass based on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_antiphon">Marian antiphon</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_Redemptoris_Mater">Alma Redemptoris Mater</ref>, in which the antiphon is stated literally in the tenor in each movement, unornamented.  This is the only cyclic setting of the mass Ordinary which can be attributed to him.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Grove-1">[1]</ref></p>
