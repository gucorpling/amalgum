<head>Biography</head>
<p>Jack Black is known particularly through <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mayhew">Henry Mayhew's</ref> account in <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Labour_and_the_London_Poor">London Labour and the London Poor</ref></hi>, where he tells Mayhew of his work and experiences, including a number of occasions when he nearly died from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection">infection</ref> following rat bites.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Mayhew-1">[1]</ref></p>

<p>When he caught any unusually coloured rats, he bred them, to establish new colour varieties. He would sell his home-bred domesticated coloured rats as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet">pets</ref>, mainly, as Black observed, "to well-bred young ladies to keep in squirrel cages". <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrix_Potter">Beatrix Potter</ref> is believed to have been one of his customers, and she dedicated the book <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Whiskers">Samuel Whiskers</ref></hi> to her rat of the same name.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-McCullough-2">[2]</ref> The more sophisticated ladies of court kept their rats in dainty <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded">gilded</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cage_(enclosure)">cages</ref>, and even <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Queen Victoria</ref> herself kept a rat or two. It was in this way that <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</ref>—or <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_rat">fancy</ref>—rats were established. Black also supplied live rats for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat-baiting">rat-baiting</ref> in pits, a popular mid-<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era">Victorian</ref> pastime.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-McCullough-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Black had a number of sidelines beyond rats, including fishing (for food and supplying <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarium">aquaria</ref>), bird catching and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxidermy">taxidermy</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Mayhew-1">[1]</ref> He was also an accomplished <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breeding">dog breeder</ref>. He told Mayhew: "I had a little rat dog—a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_Tan_Terrier">black tan terrier</ref> of the name of Billy—which was the greatest stock dog in London of that day. He is the father of the greatest portion of the small black tan dogs in London now... I've been offered a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_(British_coin)">sovereign</ref> a-pound for some of my little terriers, but it wouldn't pay me at that price, for they weren't heavier than two or three pounds. I once sold one of the dogs, of this same strain, for fourteen pounds, to the Austrian Ambassador. ... in fact, my terrier dog was known to all the London fancy. As rat-killing dogs, there's no equal to that strain of black tan terriers."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Mayhew-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Establishment of fancy rats</head>
<p>Between the 1840s and 1860s <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemmy_Shaw">Jemmy Shaw</ref> and Jack Black bred and sold many different colours of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_rat">fancy rats</ref> and their work aided in the establishment of them as pets.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> The fancy rats proper did not begin until Mary Douglas asked for permission from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mouse_Club">National Mouse Club</ref> to bring her pet rats to an exhibition at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aylesbury">Aylesbury</ref> Town Show on October 24, 1901. Her black and white hooded <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat">Rattus norvegicus</ref></hi> won "Best in Show," and the Rat Fancy was formally launched. </p>
<p>The original Rat Fancy lasted until 1931, as part of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mouse_and_Rat_Club">National Mouse and Rat Club</ref>. The modern Rat Fancy was revived in 1976 with the formation of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Fancy_Rat_Society">National Fancy Rat Society</ref>, and the fancy rat spread around the world. Nowadays, fancy rats are widely accepted as pets and exhibition animals.</p>
