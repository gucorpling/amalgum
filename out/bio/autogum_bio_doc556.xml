In 1503 he was made a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_of_the_peace">justice of the peace</ref> for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent">Kent</ref>, and in 1504 was appointed counsel to the corporation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye,_East_Sussex">Rye</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Baker2008-3">[3]</ref> and was also elected bailiff of his home town of Tenterden. From 1508, he was appointed to various royal commissions in his native Kent, in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesex">Middlesex</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex">Sussex</ref>, and across the Channel in the English possessions of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calais">Calais</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guînes">Guînes</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Miller-4">[4]</ref> By 1509 he had residences at both Canterbury, where he had acquired the manor known as The Dungeon just outside the city walls, and at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nackington">Nackington</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Baker_2008-8">[8]</ref></p>
