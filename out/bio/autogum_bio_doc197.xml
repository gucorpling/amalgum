<head>Opposition to French rule</head>
<p>Said was described by the French as an "influential war chief" and was held in good standing by tribesmen across the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Atlas">Middle Atlas</ref> region.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-windrow409-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hois59-4">[4]</ref> Together with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouha_ou_Hammou_Zayani">Mouha ou Hammou Zayani</ref>, leader of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaian_confederation">Zaian confederation</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Amhaouch">Ali Amhaouch</ref>, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darqawa">Darqawa</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam">Islam</ref> religious leader, he formed the so-called "Berber trinity" which opposed French rule in the Middle Atlas through military action.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hois63-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-camb290-9">[9]</ref> Said was initially open to a negotiated settlement with the French authorities but pressure from pro-war chiefs and the fear of ridicule from his tribesmen had forced his hand.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hois59-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-singer197-10">[10]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-bidwell34-11">[11]</ref></p>
<p>In February 1914 Said attacked a French post established by Colonel Gueydon at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oued_Zem">Oued Zem</ref>, 25 miles (40km) north-west of Kasbah Tadla. His attacks upon the post and its supply convoys led to Oued Zem becoming a focus of Moroccan resistance across the Middle Atlas.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-windrow409-7">[7]</ref> The French, led General <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mangin">Charles Mangin</ref>, managed to restore control locally but negotiations between Said and Colonel <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Simon">Henri Simon</ref> did not bring peace.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-windrow409-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bimberg8-12">[12]</ref> Mangin attacked Said's camp at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ksiba">El Ksiba</ref> and, though the Berber's suffered heavy casualties, Said bloodied the French, inflicting losses of 60 men killed and 150 wounded and capturing much of their equipment.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bimberg8-12">[12]</ref></p>
<head>Zaian War</head>
<p>The French, under Resident-General <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Lyautey">Hubert Lyautey</ref>, launched the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaian_War">Zaian War</ref> in the Middle Atlas in mid-1914 against the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaian_Confederation">Zaian Confederation</ref> of tribes. Early French gains were slowed by Hammou's victory at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_El_Herri">Battle of El Herri</ref>, support from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers">Central Powers</ref> and greater co-operation between Said, Hammou and Amahouch.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hois80-13">[13]</ref> Said's troops, numbering up to 5,000 tribesmen, engaged General <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noël_Garnier-Duplessix">Noël Garnier-Duplessix</ref>' men at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidi_Sliman">Sidi Sliman</ref>, near to Kasbah Tadla, in May 1915 but were heavily defeated, losing 300 killed and 400 wounded in exchange for three French dead and five wounded.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hois82-14">[14]</ref>&lt;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-jaques941-15">[15]</ref> This victory was a major setback for Said, leading to his withdrawal further into the mountains and a six-month period of relative peace.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hois82-14">[14]</ref> He continued to fiercely resist the French and was helped by German military supplies, of which his troops received the most of all the tribes in Morocco.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-burke448-16">[16]</ref></p>
<p>Further Berber resistance continued through the course of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War">First World War</ref>, despite the death of Amhaouch in 1918, and the French found themselves still heavily opposed by the signing of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_with_Germany">Armistice with Germany</ref> in November 1918.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hois85-17">[17]</ref> The Zaian war was eventually brought to a close in 1921 following the death of Hammou and the submission of the remaining Zaian Confederation members however said continued his resistance, fleeing first to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulouya_River">Moulouya Valley</ref> and then to the highest mountains of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Atlas">High Atlas</ref> after his defeat at the Battle of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ksiba">El Ksiba</ref> in April 1922 by General <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-François_Poeymirau">Joseph-François Poeymirau</ref> and Colonel <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Freydenberg">Henry Freydenberg</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hois90-18">[18]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-windrow466-19">[19]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hois92-20">[20]</ref> He remained there with elements of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aït_Ichkern">Aït Ichkern</ref> tribe until his death in action against French troops in March 1924.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hois92-20">[20]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bimberg14-21">[21]</ref> Said's followers continued their fight against the French until the final pacification of Morocco in 1934.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bimberg14-21">[21]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-bidwell77-22">[22]</ref></p>
