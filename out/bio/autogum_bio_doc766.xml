<head>Life</head>
<p>Anthony le Flamenc was of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_people">Flemish</ref> ancestry (as his surname indicates),<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller1921117-2">[2]</ref> and his forefathers had long been settled in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land">Holy Land</ref> before he rose to prominence in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankish_Greece">Frankish Greece</ref>. The eminent 19th-century scholar of the Frankish rule in Greece, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Hopf">Karl Hopf</ref>, suggested that he was the husband and co-ruler of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Pallavicini">Isabella Pallavicini</ref>, lady of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_Bodonitsa">March of Bodonitsa</ref> until her death in 1286, after which he disputed the succession to the march with her cousin <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pallavicini">Thomas Pallavicini</ref>. However, as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Miller_(historian)">William Miller</ref> pointed out, this was pure conjecture lacking any basis in contemporary sources.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller1909199–200-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Le Flamenc is mentioned for the first time in 1303, when the French version of the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicle_of_the_Morea">Chronicle of the Morea</ref></hi> records that the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Athens">Duke of Athens</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_II_de_la_Roche">Guy II de la Roche</ref> appointed him as his deputy (<hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailli">bailli</ref></hi>) over <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaly">Thessaly</ref>, a territory which had come under Guy's protection after its Greek ruler, Guy's uncle <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_Doukas_of_Thessaly">Constantine Doukas</ref>, died and left his underage son <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_Doukas_of_Thessaly">John II Doukas</ref> under Guy's tutelage. Anthony's son John, also received a post in Thessaly. Miller comments that it was possibly their experience with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vlachia">Vlachs</ref> of the region that recommended them for such an important assignment.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller1921117-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller1909200-4">[4]</ref> Anthony is also known to have had estates at nearby <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koroneia,_Boeotia">Koroneia</ref> and Patricio, possibly to be identified with the modern village of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ypsilantis,_Boeotia">Ypsilantis</ref>, where a medieval tower is located.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTELock1986105,_110-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Anthony was apparently held in high esteem: the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of the Morea</hi> calls him not only "the wisest of the duchy", but "one of the wisest men in Romania [Latin Greece]".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller1909200-4">[4]</ref> Indeed, he is the sole member of the lower nobility of the Duchy of Athens to be mentioned in the sources.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTELock1986110-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>He was a loyal follower of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_of_Hainaut">Matilda of Hainaut</ref>, the wife of Guy II. In 1305 he was among the witnesses to a deed relating to her property in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries">Low Countries</ref> (from which both of them hailed) and he was present with his son at her second engagement with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_of_Taranto">Charles of Taranto</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebes,_Greece">Thebes</ref> on 2 April 1309.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller1909200-4">[4]</ref> In 1308, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice">Republic of Venice</ref> accused Anthony, Guy, Rocaforte, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boniface_of_Verona">Boniface of Verona</ref> of plotting to seize the Venetian colony of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalkis">Negroponte</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller1909200-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>On 15 March 1311, Anthony fought in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Halmyros">Battle of Halmyros</ref> against the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Company">Catalan Company</ref> and was one of the few survivors, though he was captured and held for ransom, as implied by the presence of his name in a list of correspondents of the Venetian authorities in 1313.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller1909200-4">[4]</ref> Anthony built the Church of Saint George at Karditsa soon after his return from captivity, as attested by a donor's inscription, probably, as Miller suggests, commissioned by Anthony in fulfilment of a vow taken before the battle.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller1909199,_200-7">[7]</ref></p>
