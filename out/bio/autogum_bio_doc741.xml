<head>Biography</head>
<p>Diether was the eldest son of Count <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walram_II,_Count_of_Nassau">Walram II of Nassau</ref> and Adelheid of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katzenelnbogen">Katzenelnbogen</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cawley-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-dek-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-vorsterman-5">[5]</ref> It is believed that after his father died in 1276, Diether's mother and sister led a very devout life at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klarenthal_Abbey">Klarenthal Abbey</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</ref>. His younger brother, Count <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_of_Germany">Adolf of Nassau</ref>, was elected <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Romans">King of Germany</ref> in 1292 and died in 1298 in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Göllheim">Battle of Göllheim</ref>.</p>
<p>Diether was a dominican at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz">Mainz</ref> since 1292, and a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(title)">Doctor</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology">Theology</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-conrad-1">[1]</ref> Later, as archbishop, he supported the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order">Dominican Order</ref> energetically.</p>
<p>From 1295 Diether was in the service of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Boniface_VIII">Pope Boniface VIII</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-conrad-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-gauert-2">[2]</ref> Not only did Boniface VIII occasionally use Diether to influence King Adolf; Diether was also sent by Adolf as a negotiator to King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_IV_of_France">Philip IV "the Fair" of France</ref> in 1297 when Adolf, in exploring the state of his alliance with King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England">Edward I of England</ref>, thought he could achieve political double play.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-gauert-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Archbishop-Elector of Trier</head>
<p>Although the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_chapter">chapter</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trier_Cathedral">Cathedral of Trier</ref> had elected <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_II_of_Virneburg">Henry II of Virneburg</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provost_(religion)">provost</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Cathedral">Cathedral of Cologne</ref>, for political reasons the Pope elevated Diether to Archbishop of Trier on 18 January 1300. It was the intention of the Pope to appoint an irreconcilable opponent, due to the death of Diethers brother Adolf, to King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_I_of_Germany">Albert I</ref>. Diether had to sacrifice himself for this policy.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-eltester-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Diether had <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramstein_Castle_(Kordel)">Ramstein Castle</ref> built in 1300 and fortified castles in other places. In the same year he granted <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_privileges">town privileges</ref> to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittlich">Wittlich</ref>. In 1302 he founded the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_church">collegiate church</ref> <hi rend="italic">Liebfrauenkirche</hi> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberwesel">Oberwesel</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-conrad-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>The so-called Toll War led by King Albert I, against the alliance of the four electors from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland">Rhineland</ref>, in 1301, first required <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Palatine">Count Palatine</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_I,_Duke_of_Bavaria">Rudolf I of the Rhine</ref>, and then the archbishops Gerhard II of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_Mainz">Mainz</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigbold_von_Holte">Wigbold I</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electorate_of_Cologne">Cologne</ref> to submit. In November 1302, Albert also advanced to Trier and forced Diether, who was abandoned by his country, to a humble peace.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-eltester-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Diether's government was characterized by conflicts with the cathedral chapter, the clergy, and the subjects. The city of Trier suffered from financial difficulties, and there was a power struggle between the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm">estates of the realm</ref> in other cities of the Electorate. In the spring of 1303, after an uprising of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild">guilds</ref>, Diether had to allow the city of Trier complete freedom of the municipal administration.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-eltester-6">[6]</ref> From 1276 the inhabitants of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koblenz">Koblenz</ref> sought more independence, even established a city council and in 1280 prevented further construction of the city walls and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Castle_(Koblenz)">castle</ref>. In 1304 Diether subdued the city after fierce fighting and Koblenz had to give up the city council from then on.
As a result of the war with King Albert I, the financial situation of Dietrich was already very bad, now it became considerably worse.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-eltester-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Diether also made enemies in the church. After all the possessions and income of the Archdiocese had been <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_(law)">pledged</ref>, he <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confiscation">confiscated</ref> property and income from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parish_church">parish churches</ref> and, in 1303, had himself paid by the cathedral chapter for concessions. In 1306, after he also began to take <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relics">relics</ref> in private possession, the chapters of the Cathedral, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeonstift_of_Trier">St. Simeon's</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_St._Paulinus,_Trier">St. Paulinus'</ref>, as well as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Maximin's_Abbey,_Trier">St. Maximin's Abbey</ref>, complained to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_V">Pope Clement V</ref>. The Pope ordered Diether to defend himself against the allegations, which he however did not. He also treated the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_legate">papal legate</ref> badly, which was followed by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication">excommunication</ref> and later <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)#Roman_Catholic_canon_law">suspension</ref>.</p>
<p>Diether died at Trier on 23 November 1307, before he could fulfill further requests to account for himself to the Pope. He left his country in great confusion and burdened with debts.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-eltester-6">[6]</ref> He was buried in the church of the dominican abbey.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-conrad-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-gauert-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cawley-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-dek-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-vorsterman-5">[5]</ref> That church was destroyed in 1812.</p>
