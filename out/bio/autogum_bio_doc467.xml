<p>Both Martins were active in radical religious causes including the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestments_controversy#The_emergence_of_separatism_and_Presbyterianism">Admonition Controversy</ref>, part of an effort to encourage the queen to further reform <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism">Protestantism</ref> in England.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>

<p>The Martins' son <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Martin_(Jamestown)">Captain John Martin</ref> commanded the <hi rend="italic">Benjamin</hi> under Drake in the 1585–1586 expedition.

<p>Their daughter Dorcas<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Brown-9">[9]</ref> married Sir <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(judge)">Julius Caesar</ref>, later <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Rolls">Master of the Rolls</ref> under <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_England">James I</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-B-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Later life</head>
<p>Martin had remained both Warden and Master of the Mint for almost two decades, but following charges in 1597 that he was profiteering by delaying repayments he sold his office of Warden to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Knyvet,_1st_Baron_Knyvet">Sir Thomas Knyvet</ref>.  The two soon fell out, with Knyvet accusing Martin of owing the crown substantial funds and Martin insisting he was owed.  Martin was briefly imprisoned for debt,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Challis-8">[8]</ref> which led to his removal from his Aldermanry on 31 August 1602 on account of his "unfitting demeanour and carriage".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-B-1">[1]</ref> Suits and countersuits continued, with the Exchequer finding against Martin in 1607 and a further enquiry finding in his favour in 1615.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> He died in July 1617, and was buried in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham">Tottenham</ref> Church, 30 July 1617.  At his death he "was held near a hundred years old".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Brown-9">[9]</ref> His wife Dorcas had been buried in the same church on 2 September 1599, and his son Richard on 28 May 1616.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Brown-9">[9]</ref></p>
