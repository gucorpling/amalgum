<head>Early life</head>
<p>Little information survives about his life; even where he was born is unknown. He probably lived in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity-St._Sergius_Lavra">Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra</ref>, near <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow">Moscow</ref>, under Nikon of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radonezh">Radonezh</ref>, who became <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegumen">hegumen</ref> after the death of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergii_Radonezhsky">Sergii Radonezhsky</ref> in 1392. The first mention of Rublev is in 1405, when he decorated <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon">icons</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco">frescos</ref> for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_the_Annunciation,_Moscow">Cathedral of the Annunciation</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin">Moscow Kremlin</ref>, in company with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophanes_the_Greek">Theophanes the Greek</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokhor_of_Gorodets">Prokhor of Gorodets</ref>. His name was the last of the list of masters, as the junior both by rank and by age. Theophanes was an important <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_art">Byzantine</ref> master, who moved to Russia and is considered to have trained Rublev.</p>
<head>Career</head>
<p>Chronicles tell us that together with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Chyorny">Daniil Cherni</ref> he painted the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_Cathedral_in_Vladimir">Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir</ref> in 1408 as well as the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Cathedral_(Sergiyev_Posad)">Trinity Cathedral</ref> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_Lavra_of_St._Sergius">Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius</ref> between 1425 and 1427. After Daniil's death, Andrei came to Moscow's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andronikov_Monastery">Andronikov Monastery</ref> where he painted his last work, the frescoes of the Saviour Cathedral. He is also believed to have painted at least one of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_(illuminated_manuscript)">miniatures</ref> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitrovo_Gospels">Khitrovo Gospels</ref>.</p>
<p>The only work authenticated as entirely his is the icon of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(Andrei_Rublev)">Trinity</ref> (c. 1410, currently in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tretyakov_Gallery">Tretyakov Gallery</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow">Moscow</ref>). It is based on an earlier icon known as the "Hospitality of Abraham" (illustrating <ref target="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm#1">Genesis 18</ref>). Rublev removed the figures of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham">Abraham</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah">Sarah</ref> from the scene, and through a subtle use of composition and symbolism changed the subject to focus on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Mysteries">Mystery</ref> of the Trinity.</p>
<p>In Rublev's art two traditions are combined: the highest <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism">asceticism</ref> and the classic harmony of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_art">Byzantine</ref> mannerism. The characters of his paintings are always peaceful and calm. After some time his art came to be perceived as the ideal of Eastern Church painting and of Orthodox <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconography">iconography</ref>.</p>
<head>Death and legacy</head>
<p>Rublev died at Andronikov Monastery between 1427-1430. Rublev's work influenced many artists including <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionisy">Dionisy</ref>. The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoglavi_Sobor">Stoglavi Sobor</ref> (1551) promulgated Rublev's icon style as a model for church painting. Since 1959 the Andrei Rublev Museum at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andronikov_Monastery">Andronikov Monastery</ref> has displayed his and related art.</p>
<p>The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church">Russian Orthodox Church</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonized">canonized</ref> Rublev as a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint">saint</ref> in 1988, celebrating his <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_day">feast day</ref> on 29 January<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SHC-3">[3]</ref> and/or on 4 July.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SHC-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_of_saints_(Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America)">liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America</ref> remembers Rublev on January 29.</p>
<p>In 1966, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky">Andrei Tarkovsky</ref> made a film <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Rublev_(film)">Andrei Rublev</ref></hi>, loosely based on the artist's life. This became the first (and perhaps only) film produced in the Soviet era to treat the artist as a world-historic figure and Christianity as an axiom of Russia’s historical identity,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-jhoberman-6">[6]</ref> during a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Tataro-Mongol_Yoke_in_Russia">turbulent period</ref> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Russia">history of Russia</ref>.</p>
