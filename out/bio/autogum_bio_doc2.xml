<p>Horner "has been instrumental in orchestrating the attacks on climate scientists over the past decade in the form of vexatious and frivolous <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)">FOIA</ref> demands, efforts to force scientists to turn over all of their personal email," said <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_E._Mann">Michael Mann</ref>, a climate scientist targeted by Horner.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-abrams-3">[3]</ref></p>

<p>In 2015, bankruptcy court documents for the coal company <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Natural_Resources">Alpha Natural Resources</ref> revealed Horner was privately funded by grants sent to his home address.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fang-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-abrams-3">[3]</ref> In early June 2015, the Coal &amp; Investment Leadership Forum, a trade show, sent a message to its email list confirming coal industry support of Horner:</p>
<p>As the ‘<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_coal">war on coal</ref>’ continues, I trust that the commitment we have made to support Chris Horner’s work will eventually create great awareness of the illegal tactics being employed to pass laws that are intended to destroy our industry.</p>
<p>The email was signed by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Resource_Partners">Alliance Resource Partners</ref> Joe Craft III, Alpha Natural Resources Kevin Crutchfield, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummond_Company">Drummond Company</ref>'s Gary Drummond, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Coal">Arch Coal</ref>'s John Eaves and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Coal_Co.">United Coal Co.</ref>'s Jim McGlothlin.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fang-2">[2]</ref></p>
