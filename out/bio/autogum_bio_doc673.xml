<p><hi rend="bold">Johannes Symonis</hi> (<hi rend="bold">Jehan Simon</hi>) <hi rend="bold">Hasprois</hi><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> (died 1428) was a French composer originally from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arras">Arras</ref>. Four of his works of music survive in four different manuscripts, and he may also have written a treatise on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology">astrology</ref>.</p>
<head>Career</head>
<p>Hasprois led an itinerant life. His career began in royal courts. In 1378, in our earliest record of him, he was serving at the court of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I_of_Portugal">Ferdinand I of Portugal</ref>, but by 1380 he was at the court of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V_of_France">Charles V of France</ref>. His career afterwards was in the church. In 1384 he was the <hi rend="italic">petit vicaire</hi> (lesser <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicar">vicar</ref>) of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrai_Cathedral">Cambrai Cathedral</ref>, and in the same diocese he obtained the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)">rectorate</ref> of the parish church of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liessies">Liessies</ref>, probably in 1388. He also held <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefice">benefices</ref> at Arras, Rozoy in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisne">Aisne</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"><hi rend="italic">département</hi></ref> and Cambrai Cathedral. He left his parish between August 1390 and 1393 and went to serve as a private chaplain to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Clement_VII">Pope Clement VII</ref> at the Papal chapel at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon_Papacy">Avignon</ref>. As his name always precedes that of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_de_Bosco">Johannes de Bosco</ref>, who became a chaplain in 1391, in the registers, it is likely that he was appointed chaplain earlier than 1391. Hasprois continued to serve under <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipope_Benedict_XIII">Benedict XIII</ref> down to 1403. He was possibly the same person as the <hi rend="italic">magister</hi> Johannes Symonis who attended the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Constance">Council of Constance</ref> in 1417 and wrote an essay on astrology. Hasprois served in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Curia">Roman Curia</ref> as an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_notary">apostolic notary</ref> until his death in 1428.</p>
<head>Music</head>
<p>Hasprois's early two-voice <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballade_(forme_fixe)">ballade</ref></hi> "Puisque je sui fumeux" is "a prime example of the exceedingly complex style of the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_subtilior">ars subtilior</ref></hi>."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> The text of this <hi rend="italic">ballade</hi> is also preserved anonymously as "Balade de maistre fumeux". It is similar to a <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rondeau_(music)">rondeau</ref></hi> by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solage">Solage</ref>, "Fumeux fume par fumee",<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> and both were probably written for the "highly eccentric circle" gathered around <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Fumée">Jean Fumée</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> If so, then it probably dates to the time when Hasprois was at the court of Charles V.</p>
<p>Hasprois wrote two other <hi rend="italic">ballades</hi> in the tradition of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtly_love">courtly love</ref> as it was being expressed <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 1400. "Ma doulce amour" is preserved in three manuscripts and is the more complicated of the two. The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melisma">syllabic</ref> "Se mes deux yeux" is found in only one manuscript, alongside "Ma doulce". There is also an incomplete <hi rend="italic">rondeau</hi> refrain, "Jone, gente, joyeuse", with a tenor part lacking a text, ascribed to Hasprois in one manuscript.</p>
<p>Modern scholars have suggested several anonymous compositions as having possibly been composed by Hasprois: three from the manuscript GB-Ob 213, based on style, and two songs from the so-called "Leiden fragments", because his name appears in their texts.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> One of these, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_song">drinking song</ref> "Ho, ho, ho", is in the simpler early 15th-century style of Hasprois's two later <hi rend="italic">ballades</hi>.</p>
