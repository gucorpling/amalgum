<p><hi rend="bold">Joseph Vernon</hi> (c.1738â€“1782) was an English actor and singer. From his days as a boy soprano, he had a successful career on the London stage, interrupted only by the aftermath of an underage wedding to a colleague.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ODNB-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Early life</head>
<p>Born at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry">Coventry</ref> around 1738, Vernon was illegitimate.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ODNB-1">[1]</ref> He studied in London under <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Savage">William Savage</ref> in the choir of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</ref>. As a boy he had a fine soprano voice, and on 23 February 1751 he sang at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_Royal,_Drury_Lane">Drury Lane Theatre</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Arne">Thomas Arne</ref>'s <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_(Arne_opera)">Alfred</ref></hi>. On 22 May he took part in <hi rend="italic">Queen Mab</hi>, the pantomime by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Woodward_(English_actor)">Henry Woodward</ref>; on 20 September in the funeral procession in <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</ref></hi>; and on 19 November in <hi rend="italic">The Shepherd's Lottery</hi>, an opera by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Boyce_(composer)">William Boyce</ref>. In the early part of 1754 he sang tenor parts and acted comedy at Drury Lane.,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-DNB-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Scandal and exile in Dublin</head>
<p>In 1755 Vernon married <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Poitier">Jane Poitier</ref>, a singer at Drury Lane at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Chapel">Savoy Chapel</ref>. John Wilkinson, the incumbent of the Savoy Chapel, thought that the terms of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1753">Marriage Act 1753</ref>, aimed at clandestine marriages, did not apply to his extra-parochial church, and continued to issue licenses and to solemnise marriages. Among these technically irregular weddings, Vernon's happened to be the test case taken to court by the authorities.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> According to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate_Wilkinson">Tate Wilkinson</ref> Joseph and Jane, who had been acting as "Mrs. Vernon", were happy enough to be parted.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-DNB-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>On the other hand, the fallout of the prosecution case against the clergy of the Chapel was serious. Wilkinson was sentenced in 1756 to 14 years transportation to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_North_America">British North America</ref>, and died in 1757 on the way.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> The curate John Grierson, who had carried out the marriage, received the same sentence: Vernon had testified at the trial, and was then hissed on stage.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> The unpopular Vernon moved to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin">Dublin</ref>, where he had further success as an actor.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-DNB-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Return to Drury Lane</head>
<p>Back at Drury Lane in 1762, Vernon was given parts by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Garrick">David Garrick</ref>. He combined polished singing and a natural style of acting in Shakespeare.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> He was also assigned some characters in comedy and farce: Colonel Bully in <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Provoked_Wife">The Provoked Wife</ref></hi>; Master Stephen in <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Man_in_his_Humour">Every Man in his Humour</ref></hi>; Sir John Loverule in <hi rend="italic">The Devil to Pay</hi>, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_opera">ballad opera</ref> by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Coffey">Charles Coffey</ref>, and Sharp in <hi rend="italic">The Lying Valet</hi> by Garrick. According to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Boaden">James Boaden</ref>, Vernon's voice in maturity was of poor quality. Nonetheless, he continued to take singing parts in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera">opera</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)">interludes</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref> The song in Act III of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_for_Scandal">The School for Scandal</ref></hi> was written by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Linley_the_elder">Thomas Linley</ref> for him.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-DNB-2">[2]</ref> He took the title role in <hi rend="italic">Selima and Azor</hi>, Linley's first opera.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ODNB-1">[1]</ref></p>
