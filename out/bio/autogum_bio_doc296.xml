<p>Münejjim Bashi's main work is the <hi rend="italic">Jamiʿ al-Duwal</hi> ("The Compendium of Nations"), written in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic">Arabic</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKramers1993572–573-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB-2">[2]</ref> It was begun at the behest of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Vizier">Grand Vizier</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Mustafa_Pasha">Kara Mustafa</ref>, who instructed him to prepare a comprehensive historical work.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Hatice-4">[4]</ref> It is a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_history">world history</ref>, beginning with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam">Adam</ref> and ending in Ottoman times, in the year 1678. It is divided into three parts: the history of Muhammad, the history of pre- and non-Islamic dynasties, and the history of Islamic dynasties, concluding with the history of the Ottoman dynasty until 1678.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKramers1993572–573-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB-2">[2]</ref> His work is especially valuable as it preserves information from several sources now lost, especially on many minor Muslim dynasties overlooked by major historians. This is particularly the case on his use of the lost <hi rend="italic">Taʾrikh Bab al-Abwab</hi> ("History of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbent">Derbent</ref>"), which provides much information on the dynasties of eastern <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcaucasia">Transcaucasia</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arran_(Caucasus)">Arran</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adharbayjan">Adharbayjan</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKramers1993572–573-1">[1]</ref> His pre-Islamic section is also notable, as he used Roman and Jewish sources, as well as West European chronicles, and was the first Islamic historian to deal with dynasties like the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonians">Babylonians</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucids">Seleucids</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Assyrian_Empire">Assyrians</ref>.
