<head>Name and identity</head>
<p>Little is known about al-Hashimi, but his <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisba_(onomastics)"><hi rend="italic">nisbah</hi></ref>, al-Qurashi, suggests that he, like Baghdadi, claims a lineage to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad">Muhammad</ref>'s tribe of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quraysh">Quraysh</ref>, a position that offers legitimacy in some quarters.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-6">[6]</ref> Al-Hashimi's name is believed to be a <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nom-de-guerre">nom de guerre</ref></hi> and his real name is unknown.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:1-7">[7]</ref> There is some speculation that al-Hashimi is Amir Muhammad Sa’id Abdal Rahman al-Mawla, who is also known as Hajji 'Abdallah.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Katz">Rita Katz</ref>, director of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SITE_Intelligence_Group">SITE Intelligence Group</ref>, believes that it is unlikely that ISIL would "release any video speeches from this new leader or at least ones that show his face".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:4-3">[3]</ref> Nonetheless, on 1 November 2019, United States president <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</ref> claimed on social media that the United States government had identified al-Hashimi's true identity.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:5-9">[9]</ref> The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_and_Terrorism_Information_Center">Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center</ref> has speculated that al-Hashimi is of Iraqi nationality.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
<head>Career</head>
<p>According to ISIL, al-Hashimi is a veteran in fighting against <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_nations">western nations</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:1-7">[7]</ref> being a religiously educated and experienced commander.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> He was described as "the scholar, the worker, the worshiper", a "prominent figure in jihad",<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:2-12">[12]</ref> and an "emir of war".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:3-13">[13]</ref></p>
<head>Leader of ISIL</head>
<p>Less than a week after the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barisha_raid">death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</ref>, al-Hashimi was elected by a shura council as the new caliph of ISIL,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:2-12">[12]</ref> indicating that the group still considers itself a caliphate despite having lost all of its territory in Iraq and Syria.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:3-13">[13]</ref> Al-Hashimi's appointment was supposedly done in accordance with the advice of Baghdadi, meaning the new emir was named as a successor by Baghdadi himself.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> Further evidence that al-Hashimi may have been appointed as successor by Baghdadi may be inferred from the relatively quick succession of Baghdadi.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:4-3">[3]</ref> Al-Hashimi's coming to power followed several days of speculation and denial surrounding Baghdadi's death among ISIL supporters.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref></p>
<p>The general expectation was that al-Hashimi would become "the leader of a frayed organisation that has been reduced to scattered sleeper cells"<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> and the ruler of a "caliphate of ashes".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:4-3">[3]</ref> Some analysts believed that Baghdadi's death would likely cause ISIL to splinter, "leaving whoever emerges as its new leader with the task of pulling the group back together as a fighting force".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:2-12">[12]</ref> However, other analysts believed that Baghdadi's death will not have of an impact on ISIL "in terms of operational capacity" and that it was likely "not to result in the group’s demise, or really even bring about a decline".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>On 3 November, ISIL's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant_–_Sinai_Province">Sinai province</ref> pledged allegiance to al-Hashimi.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> The next day, al-Hashimi received pledges of allegiance from ISIL's Bangladeshi affiliates<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-19">[19]</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_in_Somalia">Somali province</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-20">[20]</ref>.</p>
