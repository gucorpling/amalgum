Later, she has been moulded as a complete Kuchipudi artiste and has been transformed as a gem of Kuchipudi by her Guru "Devaparijatham", "Raja Hamsa", "Natyavisarada" Sri Kaza Venkata Subrahmanyam, who is a disciple of the Gurus Dr. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vempati_Chinna_Satyam">Vempati Chinna Satyam</ref> and Sri Chintha Adinarayana Sarma.</p>
