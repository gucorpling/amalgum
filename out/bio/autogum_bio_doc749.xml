She was an important figure in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages">Late Middle Ages</ref> because of her religious foundations (<hi rend="italic">Stiftungen</hi>).</p>
<head>Life</head>
<p>Mechthild was the daughter of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrave">Margrave</ref> Dietrich of Landsberg, son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedi_III_of_Lusatia">Dedi the Fat</ref>, and Jutta, daughter and heiress of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landgraviate_of_Thuringia">Thuringian landgrave</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_III_of_Thuringia">Louis III</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Gensicke-1">[1]</ref> Mechthild was born around 1200, according to other sources around 1203, and around 1215 she married Count <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_III_of_Sayn">Henry III</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_of_Sayn">Sayn</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-BBKL-2">[2]</ref> In a deed at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisterbach_Abbey">Heisterbach Abbey</ref> dating to 1216, Mechthild is described as Henry's wife.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> The trigger for the marriage was a dispute between Dietrich of Landsberg and Henry II of Sayn, whose <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrschaft_(territory)">territories</ref> bordered one another. In addition the two were on opposing sides in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_throne_dispute">German throne dispute</ref> at the end of the 12th century. Dietrich, a supporter of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Hohenstaufen">House of Hohenstaufen</ref>, owned <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altenwied_Castle">Altenwied Castle</ref>, built by his ancestors; Henry II was for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Welf">House of Welf</ref>, and built the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Löwenburg_(Bad_Honnef)">Löwenburg</ref>. In 1205, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_III">Pope Innocent III</ref> asked whether the dispute could be settled by a marriage between Henry III and Mechthild. The agreement must have taken place no later than 1207, since Dietrich of Landsberg died that year.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Gensicke-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>When Henry III of Sayn died on New Year's Eve in 1246, he left no heirs. The only daughter of Mechthild was probably born shortly before or shortly after Henry's death and died soon afterwards.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Gensicke-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Hardt-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Henry had had his will drawn up at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blankenheim_Castle">Blankenheim Castle</ref> in the presence of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbot">abbots</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marienstatt_Abbey">Marienstatt</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisterbach_Abbey">Heisterbach</ref> during Christmas week of 1246. He decreed that if his unborn child survived, Mechthild should become the sole heir. But if the child died, then Mechthild should have the right to keep all goods until her death, after her death the estate was to pass to the children of Henry's sisters.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Hardt-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Schuetz-5">[5]</ref> Henry's sisters were Adelheid, who first married <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfrey_III_of_Sponheim">Godfrey of Sponheim-Starkenburg</ref> (died 1223?), her second marriage in 1225 was to Eberhard of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Eberstein">Eberstein</ref> (died 1263?), and the younger Agnes, who married Henry of Blieskastel.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Gensicke-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Hardt-4">[4]</ref></p>

<p>Contrary to Henry's wishes, the Sayn family made claims to the Sayn estate shortly after his death and by 29 August 1247, Mechthild left to the sons of her sister-in-law, Adelheid and the others, the castle and town of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blankenberg_(town)">Blankenberg</ref>, the castle and lands of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachenburg">Hachenburg</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freusburg_Castle">Freusburg Castle</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayn_Castle">Sayn Castle</ref>, the castles of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffenburg">Saffenburg</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hülchrath_(town)">Hülchrath</ref> and all the counties and bailiwicks that Henry had owned.

<p>On 1 May 1250, Mechthild signed a contract with the Elector of Cologne, Conrad of Hochstaden, at the Neuerburg, according to which all the estates around the castles of Altenwied, Neuerburg, Rennenberg and Windeck passed to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishopric_of_Cologne">Archbishopric of Cologne</ref> after her death in return for a one-off payment of 600 marks and an annual payment of 170 marks.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Bohn-6">[6]</ref> The Neuerburg and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_parish">church parish</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldbreitbach">Breitbach</ref> were available for her lifelong use. On 2 March  1261, Conrad's successor, Archbishop <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engelbert_I_of_Cologne">Engelbert I</ref> renewed the treaty, which was confirmed by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Urban_IV">Pope Urban IV</ref> in 1263.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Hardt-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Mechthild lived at the Neuerburg for a few more years and later moved to Cologne, where she had a residence at Sion Abbey. In 1283, in her will, she decreed that after her death her estate would eventually pass to the Archbishopric. Her date of death is unknown, according to an unconfirmed interpretation of a gravestone in Cologne she may have lived until 1291.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Gensicke-1">[1]</ref></p>
