He served as a general under <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleyman_Pasha_(son_of_Orhan)">Süleyman Pasha</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murad_I">Murad I</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayezid_I">Bayezid I</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Süleyman_Çelebi">Süleyman Çelebi</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_I">Mehmed I</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-oxbyz-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Byzantine sources mention him as Εβρενός, Ἀβρανέζης, Βρανέζης, Βρανεύς (?), Βρενέζ, Βρενέζης, Βρενές.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-plp-2">[2]</ref> A persistent Greek legend maintains that Evrenos' father was a certain Ornos, renegade <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine</ref> governor of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursa">Bursa</ref> who defected to the Ottomans, and then on to Karasi, after the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Bursa">Siege of Bursa</ref>, in 1326.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> He was known as Isa Bey Prangi, buried in the village of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prangi">Prangi</ref> (also known as Sırcık or Kırcık in Ottoman sources), a busy ferry-place on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritsa">Evros</ref> river about 6km (4mi) east from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didymoteicho">Didymoteicho</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-demetriades-4">[4]</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_J._Shaw">Stanford J.

<p>Οriginally, Gazi Evrenos was a noble dignitary, a beg in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karasids">principality of Karasi</ref>, joining the Ottomans only after their conquest of the beylik in 1345. He led many crucial Ottoman campaigns and battles in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria">Bulgaria</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaly">Thessaly</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia">Serbia</ref>. After having participated in the Ottoman conquest of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrianopolis">Adrianopolis</ref> in 1362, Evrenos was appointed to <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uc_beği">uc beği</ref></hi> (frontier warlord) of Thessaly.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-plp-2">[2]</ref> He and his <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akıncı">akıncıs</ref></hi> fought in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kosovo">Battle of Kosovo</ref> (1389) and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nicopolis">Battle of Nicopolis</ref> (1396). Evrenos conquered <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keşan">Keşan</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/İpsala">İpsala</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komotini">Komotini</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feres,_Evros">Feres</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthi">Xanthi</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroneia">Maroneia</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serres">Serres</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitola">Monastir</ref>, and, in 1397, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinth">Corinth</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-oxbyz-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ei_ewrenos-7">[7]</ref> He founded the town <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannitsa">Yenice-i Vardar</ref>, modern <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannitsa">Giannitsa</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> The Greek inhabitants of Gianitsa (Ottoman: Yenice Vardar) down to the early 20th century displayed reverence for "Gazi Baba", that is "papa Gazi".</p>
<p>Gazi Evrenos Bey was father of seven sons (Khidr-shah, Isa, Suleyman, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Bey_Evrenosoglu">Ali</ref>, Yakub, Barak, Begdje) and several daughters.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ei_ewrenos_oghullari-9">[9]</ref>
Among the numerous descendants of lord Gazi Evrenos, apparently the memory of some has dived into oblivion, as their deeds got incorporated into the achievements of their illustrious forefather. This explains the legendary, yet unlikely, 129-year lifespan of lord Gazi.</p>
<p>Together with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaloğulları">Mihaloğulları</ref> (from the Karasi emirate), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malkoçoğulları">Malkoçoğulları</ref> (from Serbia), Ömerli/Ömeroğlu, and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turahan_Bey">Turahanoğulları</ref>, Evrenos' descendants, the Evrenosoğulları, constitute one of the Byzantine families that effectively formed the early Ottoman warrior nobility.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ei_ewrenos-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>Gazi Evrenos died at an advanced age in Yenice-i Vardar. He was buried in a mausoleum there in 1417. The mausoleum survives but was badly mutilated in 19th century and served for a time as an agricultural store.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-demetriades-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>As one of the most successful Ottoman commanders, Evrenos acquired a considerable amount of wealth and founded numerous endowments (<hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf">awqaf</ref></hi>). Several monuments attributed to him survive in southeastern Europe. Of primary importance is his mausoleum, or <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Türbe">türbe</ref>, with its accompanying epitaph in Giannitsa.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-demetriades-4">[4]</ref> A <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_bath">hammam</ref> of Evrenos stands to the south of the mausoleum. Two other monuments stand in Greek Thrace.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
