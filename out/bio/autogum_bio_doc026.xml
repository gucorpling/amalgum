<head>Early life</head>
<p>Fonseca grew up in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coimbra">Coimbra</ref>, Portugal. She was the first member of her family to attend the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Coimbra">University of Coimbra</ref>, where she studied <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology">biology</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biospeleology">biospeleology</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology">geology</ref>. While enrolled in the university, she began teaching courses on biology and health to high schoolers in hope to get a doctorate and become a tenured professor in her alma mater. The university offered her a summer program, at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_Island_(Lake_Michigan)">Beaver Island</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan">Michigan</ref> where  the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Michigan_University_Biological_Station">Central Michigan University Biological Station</ref> was located. After falling in love with an American education system, she switched programs to get her master’s degree at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Michigan_University">Central Michigan University</ref>, and in 1996   got her Ph.D. in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology">ecology</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">evolution</ref> at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</ref> following by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow">fellowship</ref> with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution">Smithsonian Institution</ref>. As a postdoc at the National Zoo Institute for Conservation and Biodiversity, she had studied <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology">molecular biology</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_malaria">avian malaria</ref> of endangered <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism">endemic</ref> Hawaiian birds as well as vectors of the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Nile_virus">West Nile virus</ref></hi>, and by 1999 moved into the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_entomology">medical entomology</ref> field.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-princeton-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Career</head>
<p>From 1999 to 2001, Fonseca was a research associate at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reed_Army_Medical_Center">Walter Reed Army Medical Center</ref> where she studied human malaria in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya">Kenya</ref> and by 2001 accepted a position of geneticist at the Smithsonian Institution. In 2004, she became an Assistant Curator at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Natural_Sciences_of_Drexel_University">Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University</ref> and three years later joined <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University">Rutgers University</ref> where she served as tenure and then as full professor.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-princeton-1">[1]</ref>  In October 2016 she became an Interim Director of the Center for Vector Biology and in July 2017 was promoted to Director.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> Fromn 2015 to 2016 she was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._Burch">George E. Burch</ref> fellow at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Zoological_Park_(United_States)">National Zoological Park</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<head>Research</head>
<head>1995-2001</head>
<p>In 1995, while at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</ref>, Fonseca studied <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulium_vittatum">Simulium vittatum</ref></hi>, a species of black fly.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>In 2001, Fonseca along with Dennis Lapointe and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fleischer">Robert Fleischer</ref> conducted a study of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culex_quinquefasciatus">Culex quinquefasciatus</ref></hi> and its spread of avian malaria in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii">Hawaii</ref>. In the study they showed that  this mosquito was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands  in 1830 and exist on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_(island)">The Big Island</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui">Maui</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Atoll">Midway Atoll</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> The same year, Fonseca worked with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Strickman">Daniel Strickman</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reed_Army_Institute_of_Research">Walter Reed Army Institute of Research</ref> using <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral-density_filter">ND4</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAPD">RAPD</ref> analysis to study <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplotype">haplotypes</ref> of the subspecies of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_japonicus">Aedes japonicus</ref></hi>: <hi rend="italic">A. j. japonicus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. j. yaeyamensis</hi> at Japanese cities,  comparing  them with those on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island">Long</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter_Island,_New_York">Shelter Islands</ref> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref>. Her team also found the haplotypes of the species in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorville,_New_York">Manorville</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southold,_New_York">Southold</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)">New York</ref> as well in  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut">Connecticut</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland">Maryland</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio">Ohio</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</ref> and in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Egypt,_New_Jersey">New Egypt</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Township,_New_Jersey">Vernon Township, New Jersey</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>
<head>2004-2011</head>
<p>In 2004, Fonseca, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Schaffner">Francis Schaffner</ref> and colleagues published an article in the journal <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal)">Science</ref></hi> regarding the species of mosquito <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culex_pipiens">C. pipiens</ref></hi> and its role in the spread of viruses.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>From May to October 2008 to 2011, Fonseca, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Gaugler">Randy Gaugler</ref> and colleagues from  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University">Rutgers University</ref> had collected 73,828 female species of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_albopictus">Aedes albopictus</ref></hi> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_County,_New_Jersey">Mercer</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouth_County,_New_Jersey">Monmouth Counties</ref>. The 187 species out of 33,392 that were collected in Mercer County contained blood, while 219 out of 40,436 from Monmouth County had blood. She also collected 14,989 <hi rend="italic">Culex</hi> species in the same counties, out of which only 745 contained blood. The blood samples were from meals of the following mammals: <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human">humans</ref> (52.12%), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">cats</ref> (20.61%), or <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">dogs</ref> (11.52%) as well as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opossum">opossums</ref> (4.24%), gray squirrels (3.64%), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottontail_rabbit">cottontail rabbits</ref> (1.21%), and a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-footed_mouse">white-footed mouse</ref> (0.61%). In the study it was suggested by her and her team that 62% of humans were bitten by <hi rend="italic">A. albopictus</hi> in a suburban Monmouth, while the urban Mercer was at 43%. The study also suggests that the mosquito feeds on human blood mostly in August and in total collects 87% of blood meals between July and October.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>In 2011 she studied the subspecies of <hi rend="italic">C. pipiens</hi>, which is known as <hi rend="italic">Culex pipiens pallens</hi> as well as other members of the genus <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culex">Culex</ref></hi>: <hi rend="italic">C. quinquefasciatus</hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culex_australicus">C. australicus</ref></hi>, and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culex_globocoxitus">C. globocoxitus</ref></hi> and issued a verdict that <hi rend="italic">Culex pipiens</hi> is the only species that transmits <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbovirus">arboviruses</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filariasis">filariasis</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> She also studied <hi rend="italic">C. pipiens</hi> and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culex_restuans">C. restuans</ref></hi> for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(epidemiology)">vector</ref> competence on their <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_scale">spatial</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_scale">temporal scales</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
<head>2018-2019</head>
<p>In 2018, Fonseca studied <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longhorned_tick">longhorned tick</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen_County,_New_Jersey">Bergen County</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_albopictus">A. albopictus</ref></hi>, a species of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito">mosquito</ref> which had become a common pest in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Park,_Maryland">University Park, Maryland</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> In December that  year, she proved that the longhorned tick can reproduce <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexually_reproducing">asexually</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> and in 2019 she confirmed that the species had existed in New Jersey since 2013.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>During that year, Fonseca along with James Occi and Andrea Egizi published,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> a research paper on ticks in the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Medical_Entomology">Journal of Medical Entomology</ref></hi>. In it, they described 11 species of ticks, one of which was  found throughout Asia --and also in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey">New Jersey</ref>. The species that they collected were already known to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</ref>: <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyomma_americanum">A. americanum</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermacentor_albipictus">D. albipictus</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermacentor_variabilis">D. variabilis</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes_brunneus">I. brunneus</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes_cookei">I. cookei</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes_dentatus">I. dentatus</ref></hi>, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes_scapularis">I. scapularis</ref></hi> and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixodes_texanus">I. texanus</ref></hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> She also was a campaigner for a tick surveillance<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-17">[17]</ref> which eventually got introduced in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouth_County,_New_Jersey">Monmouth County, New Jersey</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref></p>
