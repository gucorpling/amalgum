<p>Gulkhan was first betrothed or married to Andronikos of Trebizond, an illegitimate son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexios_III_of_Trebizond">Alexios III of Trebizond</ref>. On 14 March 1376, Andronikos fell from a window in the imperial palace and subsequently died from his injuries. According to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Panaretos">Michael Panaretos</ref>, only his mother and the Empress mother took part in the funeral procession, and the betrothal was transferred to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_III_of_Trebizond">Manuel III of Trebizond</ref>, whom Panaretos describes as the "younger, proper and legitimate" son of the Emperor. Details like these have led historians to suspect more to the incident.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Panaretos-48-6">[6]</ref> The <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europäische_Stammtafeln:_Stammtafeln_zur_Geschichte_der_Europäischen_Staaten">Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten</ref></hi> (1978) by Detlev Schwennicke reports him killed by being thrown out of a tower.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>Panaretos sets forth Gulkhan's chronology in the marriage process. The revised betrothal was negotiated while she was still residing in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_Iberia">Iberia</ref>: she left her father's kingdom and met the imperial party at Macragialos on 15 August 1377; together they returned to Trebizond on Sunday, 30 August. On 5 September Gulkhan was crowned Empress, taking the royal name of Eudokia, and she was married to Manuel the next day by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_bishop">Metropolitan</ref> of Trebizond, Theodosius; the nuptial festivities lasted a week.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Panaretos-48-6">[6]</ref></p>
