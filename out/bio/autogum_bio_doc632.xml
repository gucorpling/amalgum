<p><hi rend="bold">Novak</hi> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Cyrillic_alphabet">Serbian Cyrillic</ref>: Новак; fl. 1404–10), known as <hi rend="bold">Karaljuk</hi> (Караљук), was a Serbian nobleman in the service of Despot <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Lazarević">Stefan Lazarević</ref> (r. 1402–1427), who was known to have fought a guerilla war against the Ottomans that brought great damage to Ottoman property.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKalić1982b75-1">[1]</ref> Despot Stefan was known to have served Hungarian king <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Sigismund</ref>, and at the same time having an ostensibly friendly relation with the Ottoman prince <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Süleyman_Çelebi">Süleyman Çelebi</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIlić197145-2">[2]</ref> This political game was not understood by some of the Serbian nobility, who <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/irreverently">irreverently</ref> attacked the Ottomans; one such case was that of Novak Karaljuk.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIlić197145-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Karaljuk was mentioned by chronicler <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_of_Kostenets">Constantine of Kostenets</ref> (fl. 1427–31) in relation to the war between Stefan and his brother <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuk_Lazarević">Vuk</ref> (d. 1410).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENovaković1893327-3">[3]</ref> He hailed from "one of the best families", and had even before the division of land between the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarević_dynasty">Lazarević brothers</ref> (after the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kosovo">Battle of Kosovo</ref>) been appointed to the service of Despot Stefan.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENovaković1893327-3">[3]</ref> He commanded a detachment of the Serbian army in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toplica_(river)">Toplica</ref>, and led a guerrilla war against the Ottomans.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIlić197145-2">[2]</ref> He made incursions into Ottoman territory,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENovaković1893327-3">[3]</ref> and notably, in 1404, during a passage of the Ottoman army of Süleyman through Serbia (via Toplica), he attacked the rear portion of the Ottoman field army from the mountains and captured the whole of the army's treasury, which he took to the Despot in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruševac">Kruševac</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIlić197145-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENovaković1893327-3">[3]</ref> As the passage had been allowed, Stefan himself returned the loot to the Ottomans;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENovaković1893327-3">[3]</ref> when asked to hand over Karaljuk, he told him that this was a man who lived in the forests (like a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajduk">hajduk</ref>),<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIlić197145-2">[2]</ref> and to whom nothing could be done;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTENovaković1893327-3">[3]</ref> the Despot returned the loot, but did not hand over Karaljuk (he did not want to, or perhaps was unable to do so).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIlić197145-2">[2]</ref> Revolts against the Ottomans were suppressed, and the brothers' conflict ended with division of the lands.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKastritsis2007126-4">[4]</ref> Süleyman returned to Anatolia in the summer of 1405.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKastritsis2007126-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>According to Buda Ilić's assessment, Karaljuk could not have been a real hajduk (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigand">brigand</ref>), as he returned the loot to Despot Stefan, nor could he have been a real rebel against the central (Ottoman) government. He was an important nobleman, as he must have had great military strength in order to manage capture the treasury of the Ottoman main army. It seems that he steadily believed in the need and possibility to expel the Ottomans from Serbia, and wanted to show this to Despot Stefan through his efforts.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIlić197145-2">[2]</ref></p>
