<p><hi rend="bold">Robert Cockburn</hi> (died 1526) was a 16th-century <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scottish</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat">diplomat</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleric">cleric</ref>.</p>
<p>Robert Cockburn was the third son of William Cockburn of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirling,_Scottish_Borders">Skirling</ref> and Cessford and Marion daughter of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Crichton">Lord Crichton of Sanquhar</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Cockburn was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University">university</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alumnus">graduate</ref>, and appears for the first time in 1501 when he was presented to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_IV_of_Scotland">James IV of Scotland</ref> for the position of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parson">parson</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar">Dunbar</ref>, being styled "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Scotland)">Master</ref> Robert Cockburn, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(religion)">dean</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen">Rouen</ref>".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-224-2">[2]</ref> Cockburn was later praised for his skill in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language">Latin language</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-86-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>He became <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Ross_(Scotland)">Bishop of Ross</ref> in 1507, by which time he was holding the position of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor">Chancellor</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Dunkeld">diocese of Dunkeld</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> He had received crown nomination to the bishopric on either March or May, and was provided to the see on 9 July.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> Cockburn was a chaplain to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XII_of_France">Louis XII of France</ref> and acted as a diplomat for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_IV_of_Scotland">James IV of Scotland</ref>. On 10 July 1507, Louis asked Cockburn to request 4,000 Scottish troops to assist in the defence of the French possession, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Milan">Duchy of Milan</ref>. In October James replied that he would send military support if warned in advance, and Cockburn was instructed to discuss another project. This was probably the Scottish king's plans for a crusade. Cockburn carried similar messages in 1512, in the crisis that culminated for Scotland in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Flodden">Battle of Flodden</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>

In May he addressed a short note to the English ambassador <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Magnus">Dr Thomas Magnus</ref>, as "my hertly gud frend and broder."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref></p>
