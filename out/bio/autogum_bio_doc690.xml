He also served King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_Scotland">James I of Scotland</ref> as a diplomat in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">England</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">France</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</ref>.</p>
<head>Early church career</head>
<p>Lichton was born in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Brechin">diocese of Brechin</ref> (probably <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus,_Scotland">Angus</ref>) somewhere between 1369 and 1379 to Henry and Janet Lichton.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ditchburn-1">[1]</ref> He was well-educated for his time, attending the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Orléans">University of Orléans</ref> and possibly the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_St_Andrews">University of St Andrews</ref>, earning <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licentiate_(degree)">licentiates</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)">civil law</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law">canon law</ref>, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_Degree">bachelorate</ref> in canon law, and a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate">doctorate</ref> in canon law, all achieved between 1394 and 1415; he attained an additional doctorate—in civil law—by 1436.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ditchburn-1">[1]</ref> Lichton followed an ecclesiastical career simultaneously with his studies. The first notice of this career comes in 1392, when he was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicar">vicar</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markinch">Markinch</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife">Fife</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ditchburn-1">[1]</ref> a vicariate of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews_Cathedral_Priory">St Andrews Cathedral Priory</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> He was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest)">canon</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Moray">diocese of Moray</ref> by 1394,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Aberdeen">Archdeacon of Aberdeen</ref> by 1395, holding this position into the following year, 1396.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<head>Bishop of Moray</head>
<p>After the death of Bishop <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_de_Innes">John de Innes</ref> in 1414, the chapter of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin_Cathedral">Elgin Cathedral</ref> met to elect a new bishop, and on 18 May Lichton was elected <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Moray">Bishop of Moray</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref>
Lichton travelled to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe">Continental Europe</ref> to receive consecration, and was consecrated on 8 March 1415, at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia,_Spain">Valencia</ref> by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avignon_Pope_Benedict_XIII">Pope Benedict XIII</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Lichton enjoyed an amicable relationship with the most powerful magnate in the area, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stewart,_Earl_of_Mar">Alexander Stewart, Lord of Badenoch and Earl of Mar</ref>, as Lichton appears to have suffered no harassment, attended the latter's marriage to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella,_Countess_of_Mar">Isabella, Countess of Mar</ref> back in 1404 and procured for him an annulment of that marriage when Stewart chose to remarry in 1415.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ditchburn-1">[1]</ref> Lichton was probably a kinsman of Stewart, as he is described as a kinsman of Stewart's uncle, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stewart,_Duke_of_Albany">Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany</ref>, the man who ruled Scotland as governor until his death in 1420.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>

<p>After the death of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_de_Greenlaw">Gilbert de Greenlaw</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Aberdeen">Bishop of Aberdeen</ref>, in 1421, Lichton was chosen as his successor, and was translated to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Aberdeen">diocese of Aberdeen</ref> in early April 1422, on the authority of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Martin_V">Pope Martin V</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> Pope Martin delegated authority to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_de_Cardeny">Robert de Cardeny</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunkeld">Bishop of Dunkeld</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stephani">William Stephen</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Dunblane">Bishop of Dunblane</ref>, in order to take Lichton's oath to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_see">Papal see</ref> without forcing him to travel to Rome.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-120-9">[9]</ref> It is of note that Lichton had already been in possession of the prebend of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinkell,_Aberdeenshire">Kinkell</ref> in the Aberdeen diocese,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-120-9">[9]</ref> a former possession of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller">Knights Hospitaller</ref> but attached to Aberdeen Cathedral by Lichton's time.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
<p>As Bishop of Aberdeen, Lichton was one of its greatest builders. The <hi rend="italic">Aberdeen Registrum</hi> noted that he began to rebuild the cathedral,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Boece">Hector Boece</ref> gave a description of his rebuilding, noting that although he finished the walls and two <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belltower">belltowers</ref>, the third belltower remained unfinished at his death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-121-12">[12]</ref> Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_the_Evangelist">St John the Evangelist</ref>, and donated much of his own money to new service books and vestments, as well as to the reconstruction of the cathedral.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-121-12">[12]</ref> He also authored several legal and religious texts, though none have survived.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ditchburn-1">[1]</ref></p>

<p>Henry was frequently used as an ambassador by the king, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I_of_Scotland">James I of Scotland</ref>. According to the 16th century <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Ross_(Scotland)">Bishop of Ross</ref> and historian <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lesley">John Lesley</ref>, Henry was one of the men sent to England to arrange the ransom of King James - held in England for most of his youth, not being released until 1424.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> On 9 June 1425, he and other prelates received a safe-conduct from King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VI_of_England">Henry VI of England</ref> enabling them to travel through England on their way to visit <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Martin_V">Pope Martin V</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome">Rome</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-120-9">[9]</ref> In 1428, Henry was the leader of an embassy sent to King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VII_of_France">Charles VII of France</ref> for a marriage proposal and to renew the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Scottish_alliance">Franco-Scottish alliance</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> and in January 1430, was sent into England for discussion of various grievances.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> On 31 March 1434, Lichton is found in attendance at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Basel">Council of Basel</ref>, though no more details of his activities there have survived.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ditchburn-1">[1]</ref></p>

<p>Lichton's death cannot be precisely dated. It fell between 11 November (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinmas">Martinmas</ref>) 1440, and 11 January 1441;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> it is probable that he died on either 12 or 14 December, because these were the anniversaries given to him in the 15th century and the 16th century respectively.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-121-12">[12]</ref> He was buried in his new chapel, the one dedicated to St John the Evangelist.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-121-12">[12]</ref> As a churchman, Lichton could never marry and did not; he did however father a bastard, a daughter named Janet, who appeared in the records receiving <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_dispensation">papal dispensation</ref> to marry in 1432.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ditchburn-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Due to curtailment of the cathedral the grave now lies in what appears as a simple enclosure on the east end of the cathedral i.e. it is no longer internal. Due to its exposure the grave is now somewhat ruinous. The stone effigy of the bishop has been moved and low lies on display in the north-west corner of the cathedral.</p>
