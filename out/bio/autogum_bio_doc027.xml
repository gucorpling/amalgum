He was from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayr">Ayr</ref> sub-clan,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ISLAMIC-COURTS-UNION-VICTORY-OVER-US-BACKED-WARLORDS-2">[2]</ref> part of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habar_Gidir">Habar Gidir</ref>, which is a branch of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawiye">Hawiye</ref> clan.

<head>Early life</head>
<p>Little is known about Aden Hashi Farah Aero, though from his clan, it was known that he received little formal education of any kind before joining the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifka_Halane">Ifka Halane</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Courts_Union">Islamic court</ref> in the mid-1990s under the tutelage of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hassan_Dahir_Aweys">Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys</ref>. According to sources from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Crisis_Group">International Crisis Group</ref>, Aweys selected him to go to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</ref> for further training.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-COUNTER-TERRORISM-IN-SOMALIA:-LOSING-HEARTS-AND-MINDS?-3">[3]</ref> (See page 10)</p>
<head>Afghanistan and Al-Qaeda</head>
<p>Aden Hashi Farah Aero was said to have gone to Afghanistan to train with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</ref> before 2001, according to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bryden">Matthew Bryden</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Crisis_Group">International Crisis Group</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-CANADIAN-AMONG-ISLAMISTS-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-THE-HOUR-OF-THE-ISLAMISTS-5">[5]</ref>
Here he was supposedly trained in explosives and other insurgent tactics, applying them in the Islamic Courts Union militias later on; notably with the Shiirkoole (Circolo) court of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogadishu">Mogadishu</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-COUNTER-TERRORISM-IN-SOMALIA:-LOSING-HEARTS-AND-MINDS?-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>According to International Crisis Group,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> it was after this stint with the terror organisation that he went back to Somalia in 2003 to set up a network with other <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Itihaad_al-Islamiya">al-Itihaad al-Islamiya</ref> veterans to assassinate foreigners and opponents, culminating in the eventual deaths of four foreign aid workers and at least ten Somali former military and police officers. On June 10, 2006, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian">The Guardian</ref></hi> repeated this story by stating, "An unnamed network run by one of Aweys's proteges, Aden Hashi Farah "Aero", has been linked to the murder of four western aid workers and more than a dozen Somalis who allegedly cooperated with counter-terror organisations."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FALL-OF-MOGADISHU-LEAVES-US-POLICY-IN-RUINS-7">[7]</ref>
They also desecrated an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_people">Italian</ref> cemetery in Mogadishu to great international outrage, and helped shelter and provide assistance to Al-Qaeda operatives in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banaadir">Banaadir</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Shabelle">Lower Shabelle</ref> region of Somalia.
