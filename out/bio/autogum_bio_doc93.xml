<p><hi rend="bold">Imran Ali</hi> (date of birth unknown) was an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">Indian</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">cricketer</ref> who played regularly for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidarbha_cricket_team">Vidarbha</ref> during the 1960s and 1970s.

<head>Cricket career</head>
<p>Little is known of Imran's early life, including his date and place of birth.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-profile-1">[1]</ref> His first matches at higher levels came for a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidarbha">Vidarbha</ref> team in the 1962–63 and 1963–64 editions of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooch_Behar_Trophy">Cooch Behar Trophy</ref>, a school-based tournament.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> His good form for Vidarbha led to his selection first for a Central Zone Schools side, and then for an India Schools side that toured Ceylon (now <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka">Sri Lanka</ref>) in April 1964, and included future <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket">Test cricketers</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surinder_Amarnath">Surinder Amarnath</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramnath_Parkar">Ramnath Parkar</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashok_Gandotra">Ashok Gandotra</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eknath_Solkar">Eknath Solkar</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> Imran scored a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)">century</ref> in the team's match against a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffna">Jaffna</ref> Schools side, an innings of 102 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out">not out</ref> batting alongside <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesh_Nagdev">Ramesh Nagdev</ref>, who scored 85 runs.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Following on from this good form at junior levels, Imran made his <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket">first-class</ref> for Vidarbha's senior side during the 1964–65 season of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy">Ranji Trophy</ref>, and went on to play in each of the team's three matches during the tournament,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fc-5">[5]</ref> scoring his first half-century, an innings of 83 runs, in the final match against <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh_cricket_team">Madhya Pradesh</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> He soon established himself as a regular player in Vidarbha's side, usually as a middle-order <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batsman">batsman</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-seasons-7">[7]</ref> An innings of 94 runs scored against <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_cricket_team">Rajasthan</ref> during the 1968–69 season led to Imran's selection to play for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Zone_cricket_team">Central Zone</ref> in that season's edition of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duleep_Trophy">Duleep Trophy</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> However, he played only two matches for Central Zone (the second against the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_cricket_team_in_Ceylon_and_India_in_1969–70">touring Australians</ref>), and was not selected in the side in later seasons.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fc-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Imran remained a consistent, although not outstanding, player for Vidarbha throughout the 1970s. Arguably his most successful seasons came towards the middle of the decade: he scored over 200 runs during both the 1974–75 and 1975–76 seasons, averaging 37.91 runs over both seasons combined.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-seasons-7">[7]</ref> Imran's only first-class <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)">century</ref> was an innings of 104 not out scored against <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railways_cricket_team">Railways</ref> in November 1975.
