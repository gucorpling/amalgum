<p><hi rend="bold">Spiridon</hi> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Cyrillic_alphabet">Serbian Cyrillic</ref>: Спиридон; fl. 1379–d. 11 August 1389) was the Patriarch of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Patriarchate_of_Peć">Serbian Patriarchate of Peć</ref> from 1380 to 1389.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPurković1976116-2">[2]</ref> He held office during the reign of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazar_of_Serbia">Prince Lazar</ref>, who was recognized by the Serbian Church as the legitimate ruler of the Serbian lands (in the period of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Serbian_Empire">Fall of the Serbian Empire</ref>), and with whom he closely cooperated.</p>
<p>Spiridon was chosen to succeed Patriarch <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefrem_(patriarch)">Jefrem</ref>, who abdicated, in 1379,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGavrilović198116-3">[3]</ref> and was enthroned after 3 May 1380.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTERadojičić195286-1">[1]</ref> Historian M. Petrović believes that Jefrem abdicated due to opposing the politics of suppressing the jurisdiction of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchate_of_Constantinople">Patriarchate of Constantinople</ref>, which was pursued by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazar_of_Serbia">Prince Lazar</ref> and Spiridon.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopović2006119-4">[4]</ref> The Serbian Church recognized Lazar as the legitimate ruler of the Serbian lands, the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autokrator">autokrator</ref></hi> (inherited by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemanjić_dynasty">Nemanjić dynasty</ref>), since 1375.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGavrilović198116-3">[3]</ref> Spiridon's life prior to enthronement is unclear. He is believed to have been born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niš">Niš</ref>, as written in the old list of Serbian patriarchs (Патріархъ Спиридонъ родомъ отъ Нишъ<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref>), accepted in early Serbian literature, however, there is no confirmation.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPurković1976117-6">[6]</ref> M. Purković assumed that Spiridon was a bishop of perhaps <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesaropolis">Caesaropolis</ref>, then the metropolitan of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melnik,_Bulgaria">Melnik</ref>. Two acts from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatopedi">Vatopedi</ref> dating to October 1377 mention a "metropolitan Spiridon".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPurković1976118-7">[7]</ref> Spiridon might have been the same as the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visoki_Dečani">Dečani</ref> ascetic Spiridon; Jefrem chose Spiridon as his successor, his close friend, fellow clergyman, and venturer, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesychasm">hesychast</ref> as himself, and also a man of the court – respectable, educated, and informed on the secrets and state skills and church politics, more than Jefrem himself.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHilandarski_odbor1978126-8">[8]</ref> Historian M. Spremić believed that Jefrem had in the first place been enthroned as a compromise between the Serbian Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and that he was forced to abdicate by followers of Prince Lazar.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopović2006119-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Spiridon was a close associate of Lazar,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> and their work coincided – the renewal of the Nemanjić ideal of symphony of the state and church.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarjanović-Dušanić200683–84-10">[10]</ref> The patriarch was the most important person along with the ruler, whom he versatilely supported.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESava_of_Šumadija1996465-11">[11]</ref> Spiridon confirmed Lazar's 1378 charter to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gornjak_monastery">Gornjak</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Ždrelo</hi>), Lazar's endowment, and Lazar's 1387 charter to Obrad Dragosalić.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTERadojičić195287–89-12">[12]</ref> On 2 March 1382, in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Žiča">Žiča</ref>, the founding charter of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drenče">Drenče</ref> monastery was written before Spiridon.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPurković1976119-13">[13]</ref> Spiridon died on 11 August 1389 (as recorded in Danilo's <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typikon">typikon</ref></hi> from 1416), not long after the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kosovo">Battle of Kosovo</ref> in which Lazar fell.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTERadojičić195286-1">[1]</ref> After Lazar's death, Spiridon stayed in alliance with Lazar's widow <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Milica_of_Serbia">Milica</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMarjanović-Dušanić200684-14">[14]</ref> After the battle and Spiridon's death, the security of the Serbian state and church was threatened by the Ottomans; Milica's political circle worked to establish peace with the Ottomans, a deal which was eventually struck with large Serbian concessions, by the summer of 1390.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGavrilović1981109-15">[15]</ref> Spiridon was succeeded by Jefrem, who returned and served shortly until he was replaced by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danilo_III_(patriarch)">Danilo III</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTERadojičić195288–89-16">[16]</ref></p>
