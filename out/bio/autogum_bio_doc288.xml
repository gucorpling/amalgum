<head>Life and career</head>
<p>Ceccarelli was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevagna">Bevagna</ref>. His father Pannonio was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_carving">meat carver</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[lower-alpha 1]</ref> His grandfather <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_Ceccarelli">Alfonso</ref> was a notorious doctor and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogist">genealogist</ref> who was executed in 1581 for falsifying documents. The first record of his activity in Rome is from 1620 when he was listed as a choir member at the church of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Spirito_in_Sassia">Santo Spirito in Sassia</ref>. In 1622 he entered the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegium_Germanicum_et_Hungaricum">Collegium Germanicum</ref>. He remained resident there for a year, but continued to sing in the choir of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sant'Apollinare_alle_Terme_Neroniane-Alessandrine">Sant'Apollinare</ref>, the Collegium's church, on multiple occasions up to 1645. During his time with the choir he trained with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Carissimi">Giacomo Carissimi</ref> who trained several other prominent Roman singers, including <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Bianchi_(musician)">Giuseppe Bianchi</ref> and the castrato Giovannino.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-DBDI-3">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kory-4">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[lower-alpha 2]</ref> Ceccarelli was also considered an outstanding interpreter of Carissimi's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motet">motets</ref> which they often performed together.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Fantoni-7">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Ceccarelli was appointed to the Sistine Chapel Choir in January 1628. He later served as the choir's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamberlain_(office)">chamberlain</ref> (<hi rend="italic">camerlengo</hi>) in 1630 and its secretary (<hi rend="italic">puntatore</hi>) in 1647. He was appointed  <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maestro_di_cappella">maestro di cappella</ref></hi> in 1652. In addition to his activities with the Papal choir, Ceccarelli sang in the festivities in Parma celebrating the marriage of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margherita_de'_Medici">Margherita de' Medici</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoardo_Farnese,_Duke_of_Parma">Odoardo Farnese</ref> in 1628 as well as at the court of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinando_II_de'_Medici,_Grand_Duke_of_Tuscany">Ferdinando II</ref> in 1635 and at the church of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luigi_dei_Francesi">San Luigi dei Francesi</ref> on several occasions between 1631 and 1653.

<figure><caption>Ceccarelli's <hi rend="italic">La miracolosa imagine della Madonna delle Gratie</hi> published in 1647</caption></figure>
<p>From the earliest years of his career Ceccarelli was described in some records as a tenor and in others a bass.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Grove-10">[8]</ref> The musicologist Alberto Iesuè has speculated that his true voice type was probably a bass and that he sang tenor parts in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsetto">falsetto</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-DBDI-3">[2]</ref> However, in <hi rend="italic">Tenor: History of a Voice</hi>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Potter_(musician)">John Potter</ref> refers to a type of voice with an extended register which he calls "tenor-bass" and notes that several other virtuoso singers of the 17th century who were described as tenors by their contemporaries could also sing in the bass register. A similar view on the existence of this voice type has been expressed by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodolfo_Celletti">Rodolfo Celletti</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Celletti-11">[9]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Potter-12">[10]</ref></p>
<p>Ceccarelli retired from the Sistine Choir in 1658. He spent his later years as a prominent member of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oratory_of_Santissimo_Crocifisso">Confraternity of the Most Holy Crucifix</ref> and served as <hi rend="italic">maestro di cappella</hi> of its associated church, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marcello_al_Corso">San Marcello</ref>, until 1667. He died on 7 March 1668. His funeral was held two days later at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria_Maddalena">Santa Maria Maddalena</ref>. In his will, he left most of his money and possessions to the confraternity.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-CMBV-8">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Lionnet-13">[11]</ref> According to his entry in the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Großes_Sängerlexikon">Großes Sängerlexikon</ref></hi>, Ceccarelli had become a priest in 1641. In his 1710 history of the Sistine Chapel Choir, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Adami_da_Bolsena">Andrea Adami</ref> refers to him as "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reverend">Rev.</ref> Odoardo Ceccarelli".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-GSL-14">[12]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Adami-15">[13]</ref></p>
<head>Compositions and writings</head>
<p>Ceccarelli composed several pieces of music, including a lyric drama in Latin for four <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soprano">sopranos</ref> and chorus, an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idyll">idyll</ref> in Italian for five voices, and a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantata">cantata</ref> for soprano and bass, <hi rend="italic">Ecco il re del cielo immenso</hi>.
