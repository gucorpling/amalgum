<head>Marsha I. Lester</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Marsha Isack Lester</hi> is an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans">American</ref> physical chemist. She is currently the Edmund J. Kahn Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</ref> Lester uses both theoretical and experimental methods to study the physical chemistry of volatile organic compounds present in the earth's atmosphere. Her current work focuses on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical">hydroxyl radical</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criegee_intermediate">Criegee intermediates</ref>.</p>
<head>Education</head>
<p>Lester graduated with a B.A. from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglass_Residential_College">Douglass Residential College</ref>, an institution for women within <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University">Rutgers University</ref>, in 1976. She then earned her Ph.D. from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University">Columbia University</ref> in 1981 in the laboratory of George Flynn. Her thesis was entitled <hi rend="italic">Vibrational Relaxation Dynamics in Bulk Gases and Supersonic Molecular Beams</hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> She carried out postdoctoral work as a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation">National Science Foundation</ref> Fellow at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell Laboratories</ref> from 1981 to 1982.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Career</head>
<p>Currently she works as a professor at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</ref> from which she has received the Edmund J. and Louise W. Kahn Award in the Natural Sciences. Lester was the first female chair of the Department of Chemistry, a position she held from 2005 to 2009.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:1-4">[4]</ref> She was a founder, and is currently chair, of the Penn Forum for Women Faculty, a group formed to support female faculty at the university.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:1-4">[4]</ref> Lester is also well known as the editor of the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Chemical_Physics">Journal of Chemical Physics</ref></hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Previously, Lester was the chair of the Division of Laser Science of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Physical_Society">American Physical Society</ref>. She also worked for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Chemical_Society">American Chemical Society</ref>. Later on, she was the chair of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Energy_(United_States)">Department of Energy's</ref> Council for Chemical and Biochemical Sciences.</p>
<head>Research</head>
<p>Lester's research group utilizes theoretical and experimental approaches to study chemical reactions. She focuses on modeling potential energy surfaces between reactive partners, with an emphasis on volatile organic compounds present in the earth's atmosphere. She has published extensively on the interactions and reactions of the hydroxyl radical.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> Lester's group was the first to obtain an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectrum">infrared spectrum</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_trioxide">hydrogen trioxide</ref> radical. Her lab currently works on modeling the stability of this radical and its <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformational_isomerism">conformers</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Currently, her group focuses on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemistry">photo-induced chemistry</ref> of Criegee intermediates, an intermediate in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkene">alkene</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozonolysis">ozonolysis</ref> pathway. This pathway is a primary oxidation pathway for alkenes in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere">troposphere</ref> and generates atmospheric hydroxyl radicals. Her lab synthesizes Criegee intermediates in order to further study their chemical reactions using <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy">spectroscopy</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Her lab also currently focuses on modeling and observing the collisional quenching of excited hydroxyl radicals. Quenching impacts the concentration of hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere, and is therefore of environmental interest.</p>
<p>Her research group at the University of Pennsylvania was behind the development of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_shell">open shell</ref> complexes.</p>
