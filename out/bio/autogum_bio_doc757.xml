<head>Rome and a Cardinalate</head>
<p>Hugh and Archbishop Wickwane preserved their friendship, even after he went to Rome. On 12 September 1280 Archbishop Wickwane named Master Hugh of Evesham, Canon of York, and Stephen Patringtone his proctors at the Papal Curia, and so notified Cardinals Giacomo Savelli and Matteo Rosso Orsini <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> In 1282 he was asked to assist the Archbishop in disputes with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Durham">Bishop of Durham</ref>.</p>

<head>Conclave of 1285</head>
<p>Cardinal Hugh participated in the conclave of 1â€“2 April 1285, at Perugia, where he had found refuge after being driven out of Orvieto.  In the Conclave  Cardinal Giacomo Savelli, Cardinal Deacon of S. Maria in Cosmedin, was elected on the first ballot.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref>  He took the name Honorius IV.  When Honorius IV died on Holy Thursday, 3 April 1287,  Cardinal Hugh was one of the thirteen cardinals who participated in the Conclave, which took place in Rome at the papal residence near Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref>  He was the senior cardinal-priest.  The Conclave opened in April, but the cardinals had one difficulty after another.  The plague broke out in the Conclave, and a number of cardinals died;  the rest retreated for a time to their private residences.  Six cardinals, the sources say, died in 1287.  One of them was Cardinal Hugh.  The survivors finally elected a new pope on 22 February 1288, Cardinal Girolamo Masci d' Ascoli, OFM, the Bishop of Palestrina, who took the name Nicholas IV.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref></p>
