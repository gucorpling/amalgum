<p><hi rend="bold">Butautas</hi> (baptized <hi rend="italic">Henryk</hi>; died on May 7, 1380 in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</ref>) was a son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kęstutis">Kęstutis</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duke_of_Lithuania">Grand Duke of Lithuania</ref>. He attempted to depose his uncle <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algirdas">Algirdas</ref> and usurp power in Lithuania, but failed and was forced into exile. He joined the court of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</ref> and even inspired a poem about conversion to Christianity. Butautas is sometimes confused with his brother <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaidotas">Vaidotas</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Coup and escape to Teutonic Knights</head>
<p>The first written record about Butautas comes from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Długosz">Jan Długosz</ref>. The historian describes Lithuanian raids into <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masuria">Masuria</ref> in 1336 and mentions Butautas, son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gediminas">Gediminas</ref>. Because of confused fathers, this information is not considered reliable.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-el-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>The first reliable data comes from summer of 1365. While Algirdas and Kęstutis were in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volhynia">Volhynia</ref> helping their brother <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liubartas">Liubartas</ref> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia–Volhynia_Wars">Galicia–Volhynia Wars</ref>, Butautas together with other nobles attempted a <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'état">coup d'état</ref></hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-lv-3">[3]</ref> However, the plans were discovered by Dirsūnas, deputy of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius">Vilnius</ref>. Butautas was arrested, but his accomplice or brother <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survila">Survila</ref> rescued him and killed Dirsūnas.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-as-4">[4]</ref> The coup failed and Butautas, Survila, and fifteen followers had to flee to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutonic_Knights">Teutonic Knights</ref>. Historian S. C. Rowell questioned whether the coup really happened as it is mentioned only in a late German source.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-unexp-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>In <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Köningsberg">Köningsberg</ref>, Butautas was baptized as Henryk in honor of the Commander of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insterburg">Insterburg</ref> on July 25, 1365.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-as-4">[4]</ref> Two Bishops, John of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishopric_of_Warmia">Warmia</ref> and Bartholomew of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopric_of_Samland">Sambia</ref> were summoned for the ceremony, also attended by English crusaders, including <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Warwick">Earl of Warwick</ref> and Thomas Ufford.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-unexp-5">[5]</ref> In August, he led a Teutonic raid deep into Lithuania reaching as far as Vilnius and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilkmergė">Vilkmergė</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-lv-3">[3]</ref> During the 12-day raid <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernavė">Kernavė</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maišiagala">Maišiagala</ref> were devastated.</p>
<head>Life at emperor's court</head>
<p>Sometime between August 1366 and April 1368, Butautas departed to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</ref> to join the court of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IV,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor</ref>. Survila remained with the Knights. Charles gave Butautas lands and the noble title of duke (Herzog).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-el-2">[2]</ref> Butautas is mentioned as a witness to several treaties and companion of the emperor on several trips, including one to Italy to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Urban_V">Pope Urban V</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-as-4">[4]</ref> He witnessed imperial charters issued in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modena">Modena</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucca">Lucca</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome">Rome</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udine">Udine</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangermünde">Tangermünde</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerichow">Jerichow</ref>. This last charter listed Butautas as "King of Lithuania" together with imperial family and before <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_legate">papal legates</ref> and other <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_nobility">Bohemian dukes</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-unexp-5">[5]</ref> At some point, the court was visited by German poet Schondoch who later composed a poem how an unnamed "Lithuanian king" was converted into Christianity.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-el-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Clarles died in 1378. Just two years later Butautas died in Prague and was buried in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas'_Church,_Prague">St. Thomas' Church</ref>. In 1413, his brother <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vytautas_the_Great">Vytautas the Great</ref> ordered <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_Mass">Requiem Mass</ref> and gave the church a large carpet. Because of this activity sometimes 1413 is given as Butautas' date of death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-as-4">[4]</ref></p>
<head>Family</head>
<p>It is known that Butautas left one son, Vaidutis, in Lithuania. He also emigrated to the west in 1381 at the age of sixteen.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-el2-6">[6]</ref> After his father's death he studied in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">Paris</ref> until 1387. In 1401, after his return to Poland, his cousin <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogaila">Jogaila</ref>, King of Poland, appointed him as the rector of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_University">Jagiellonian University</ref>. He died in 1422.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-el2-6">[6]</ref></p>
