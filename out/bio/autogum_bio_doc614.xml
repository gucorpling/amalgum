<head>Career</head>
<p>Neville was knighted sometime after 1426.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-baronage-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>In 1438, Bergavenny, as he was now styled, was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_of_the_peace">justice of the peace</ref> for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_England">Durham</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-baronage-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>He was a captain in the embattled <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Normandy">Duchy of Normandy</ref> in 1449.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-baronage-7">[7]</ref> His eldest son Richard was one of the hostages given to the French when the English surrendered the city of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen">Rouen</ref> in that year.</p>
<p>After the death of his first wife, he was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_peer#Writs_of_summons">summoned</ref> to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_England">Parliament</ref> in 1450 as "Edwardo Nevyll de Bergavenny", by which he is held to have become <hi rend="bold">Baron Bergavenny</hi>. At the time, however, this was considered to be a summons by right of his wife, and so he was considered the 3rd, rather than the 1st, Baron.</p>
<p>In 1454, he was appointed to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_Council_of_England">Privy Council</ref> assembled by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Plantagenet,_3rd_Duke_of_York">Duke of York</ref> as Lord Protector, along with his more prominent Neville kinsmen.
