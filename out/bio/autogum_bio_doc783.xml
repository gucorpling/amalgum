<head>Haukr Erlendsson</head>This is an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_name">Icelandic name</ref>. The last name is <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic">patronymic</ref>, not a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname">family name</ref>; this person is referred to by the given name <hi rend="italic">Hauk</hi>.
<p><hi rend="bold">Haukr</hi> or <hi rend="bold">Hauk Erlendsson</hi> (died 1334) was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawspeaker">lawspeaker</ref> (lawman) of Iceland, later lawspeaker and knight of Norway, known for having compiled a number of Icelandic sagas and other materials mostly in his own hand, bound in a book called the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauksbók">Hauksbók</ref></hi> after him.</p>
<head>Life</head>
<p>Hauk was born the son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlend_Olafsson_the_Strong">Erlend Olafsson the Strong</ref> aka Erlend <hi rend="italic">digre</hi> "the fat," who died 1312.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-owl-nfbk-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-maldage-1313-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[lower-alpha 1]</ref> The year of Haukr's birth is not known,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sturlunga-pref-4">[3]</ref> but his mother's name was Jorunn (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse_language">Old Norse</ref>: <hi lang="non" rend="italic">Jórunn</hi>),<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[4]</ref> whose ancestry is traceable to a brother of King Halfr of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hordaland">Hordaland</ref>, hero of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hálfs_saga_ok_Hálfsrekka">Hálfs saga ok Hálfsrekka</ref></hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[lower-alpha 2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[lower-alpha 3]</ref></p>
<p>Hauk may have been an illegitimate offspring,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sturlunga-pref-4">[3]</ref> although the question of whether his mother was Erlend's "first wife or mistress" is an open speculation.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[6]</ref> At any rate it is clear Hauk had a stepmother at some point, since Jarngerd (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse_language">Old Norse</ref>: <hi lang="non" rend="italic">Járngerðr</hi>) is called Erlend's wife in the <hi rend="italic">Landnamabók</hi><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[7]</ref> and this Jarngerd was beyond doubt the wife who survived Erlend's death in 1312.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-maldage-1313-2">[2]</ref> Hauk also had a half-sister named Valgerd, born to Jarngerd.</p>
<p>Hauk married Steinunn, a descendant of Hrafn Sveinbjornsson.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-landnamabok-2-25-11">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[lower-alpha 4]</ref></p>
<p>Hauk's father Erlend became <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawspeaker">lawspeaker</ref> (<hi rend="italic">lögmaðr</hi>)  of  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland">Iceland</ref> in 1287, went overseas in 1289, retired as lawspeaker and was awarded the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfjords">Westfjords</ref> in 1290 or 1292 according to some sources.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[9]</ref> Somewhere along, though not in his early years, Hauk was educated abroad in Norway, where "he owes his whole education".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sturlunga-pref-4">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Like his father before him, Hauk became lawspeaker of Iceland no later than 1294,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sturlunga-pref-4">[3]</ref> serving the post until 1299.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-owl-nfbk-1">[1]</ref>  Around 1301 he arrived in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway">Norway</ref>, and served from 1303 to 1322 as lawspeaker (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language">Norwegian</ref>: <hi lang="no" rend="italic">lagmann</hi>) in Oslo and on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gula_Thing">Gula Thing</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-owl-nfbk-1">[1]</ref> Sometime after 1303, he is mentioned as being on the king's council.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-owl-nfbk-1">[1]</ref> He was also one of the men who ruled to recognize <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_IV_of_Sweden">Magnus IV of Sweden</ref> as king over Norway.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-owl-nfbk-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>During this period, lawmen may or may not be conferred the title of <hi rend="italic">herra</hi> (at least those in Iceland),<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[10]</ref> at any rate, Hauk serving in Norway is addressed as "herra" in a 1309 letter,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[11]</ref> and in a letter dating from 1311, he is called "the lawspeaker of the Gula Thing and knight."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[12]</ref></p>
<head>Works</head>
<p>The <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauksbók">Hauksbók</ref></hi> is a compilation that includes Icelandic sagas and a redaction of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landnámabók">Landnámabók</ref>, as well as an arithmetical treatise called the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorismus_(Norse_text)">Algorismus</ref></hi>. Among the sagas included is a version of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiríks_saga_rauða">Eiríks saga rauða</ref></hi>, which includes the accounts of the exploration and the attempted colonization in the American continent by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorfinn_Karlsefni">Thorfinn Karlsefni</ref>, whom Hauk counts as one of his ancestors. He also penned "Hauk's Annals," which chronicled the events of his lifetime.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sturlunga-pref-4">[3]</ref></p>

<p>The following stemma is drawn from the genealogy appended to the last chapter of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiríks_saga_rauða">Eiríks saga rauða</ref></hi> in Hauk's own recension (in the <hi rend="italic">Hauksbók</hi>, supplemented with additional information from the <hi rend="italic">Landnámabók</hi>).</p>
