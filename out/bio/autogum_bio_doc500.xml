<head>Abraham Fraunce</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Abraham Fraunce</hi> (born between 1558 and 1560?–died in 1592 or 1593?) was an English poet.</p>
<head>Life</head>
<p>A native of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shropshire">Shropshire</ref>, he was born between 1558 and 1560. His name appears in a list of pupils of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrewsbury_School">Shrewsbury School</ref> in January 1571,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> and he joined <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_College,_Cambridge">St John's College, Cambridge</ref>, in 1576, becoming a fellow in 1580/1.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> His <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language">Latin</ref> comedy, <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi>, dedicated to Sir <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Sidney">Philip Sidney</ref>, was probably written at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_England">Cambridge</ref>, where he remained until he had taken his <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts">M.A.</ref> degree in 1583. He was called to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)">bar</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray's_Inn">Gray's Inn</ref> in 1588, and then apparently practised as a barrister in the court of the Welsh marches.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB1911-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>After the death of his patron, Sidney, Fraunce was protected by Sidney's sister, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sidney">Mary Herbert, Countess of Pembroke</ref>. His last work was published in 1592.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB1911-3">[3]</ref> According to the 19th-century antiquary <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hunter_(antiquarian)">Joseph Hunter</ref> in his <hi rend="italic">Chorus Vatum</hi>, in 1633 Fraunce wrote an <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithalamium">Epithalamium</ref></hi> in honour of the marriage of Lady <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalen_Egerton">Magdalen Egerton</ref>, seventh daughter of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Bridgwater">Earl of Bridgwater</ref>, in whose service he may have been; thus, it was long assumed that Fraunce died in or after 1633. More recent scholarship, however, places Fraunce's death in 1592 or 1593<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> and attributes the Cutler-Egerton epithalamium to Abraham Darcie.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<head>Works</head>
<p>His works are:</p>
<list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="italic">The Lamentations of Amintas for the death of Phyllis</hi> (1587), a version in English hexameters of his friend, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Watson_(poet)">Thomas Watson's</ref>, Latin <hi rend="italic">Amyntas</hi></item>
<item><hi rend="italic">The Lawiers Logike, exemplifying the praecepts of Logike by the practise of the common Lawe</hi> (1585)</item>
<item><hi rend="italic">The Arcadian Rhetorike</hi> (1588)</item>
<item><hi rend="italic">Abrahami Fransi Insignium, Armorum ... explicatio</hi> (1588)</item>
<item><hi rend="italic">The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countess_of_Pembroke">Countess of Pembroke</ref>'s Yvychurch</hi> (1591/2), containing a translation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torquato_Tasso">Tasso</ref>'s <hi rend="italic">Aminta</hi>, a reprint of his earlier version of Watson</item>
<item><hi rend="italic">The Lamentation of Corydon for the love of Alexis</hi> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil">Virgil</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclogue">eclogue</ref> II), a short translation from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliodorus_of_Emesa">Heliodorus</ref>, and, in the third part (1592) "Aminta's Dale," a collection of "conceited tales" supposed to be related by the nymphs of Ivychurch</item>
<item><hi rend="italic">The Countess of Pembroke's Emanuell</hi> (1591)</item>
<item>The Third Part of Pembroke's <hi rend="italic">Ivychurch</hi>, entitled <hi rend="italic">Aminta's Dale</hi> (1592)</item>
<item><hi rend="italic"><ref target="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/victoria/">Victoria, a Latin Comedy</ref></hi> (written before or in 1583; not published until 1906). It is a translation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Pasqualigo">Luigi Pasqualigo</ref>'s play, <hi rend="italic">Il Fedele</hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></item></list>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Arcadian Rhetorike</hi> owes much to earlier critical treatises, but has a special interest from its references to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Spenser">Edmund Spenser</ref>, and Fraunce quotes from the <hi rend="italic">Faerie Queene</hi> a year before the publication of the first books. In <hi rend="italic">Colin Clouts Come Home Again</hi>, Spenser speaks of Fraunce as Corydon, on account of his translations of Virgil's second eclogue. His poems are written in classical metres, and he was regarded by his contemporaries as the best exponent of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Harvey">Gabriel Harvey</ref>'s theory. Even <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nashe">Thomas Nashe</ref> had a good word for "sweete Master Fraunce".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB1911-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Countess of Pembroke's Emanuell, hexameters on the nativity and passion of Christ</hi>, with versions of some psalms, were reprinted by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grosart">Alexander Grosart</ref> in the third volume of his <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies’ Library</hi> (1872). Joseph Hunter in his <hi rend="italic">Chorus Vatum</hi> stated that five of Fraunce's songs were included in Sidney's <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophel_and_Stella">Astrophel and Stella</ref></hi>, but these should probably be attributed not to Fraunce, but to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Campion">Thomas Campion</ref>. See a life prefixed to the transcription of a manuscript Latin comedy by Fraunce, <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi>, by Professor GC Moore Smith, published in W Bang's <hi rend="italic">Materialien zur Kunde des älteren Englischen Dramas</hi>, vol. xiv, 1906.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EB1911-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Dana Sutton argues that Fraunce may be the author of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/hymen/">Hymenaeus</ref></hi> (1578).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
