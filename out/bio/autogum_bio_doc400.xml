<head>Family</head>
<p>Cromwell Lee was the youngest son of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Lee">Sir Anthony Lee</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Lee_(lady-in-waiting)">Margaret Wyatt</ref>, sister of the poet <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wyatt_(poet)">Sir Thomas Wyatt</ref>.

<p>His father is thought to have been in the service of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cromwell">Thomas Cromwell</ref> by 1532, and had an active career at court and in local government in Buckinghamshire. His eldest brother, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Lee_(died_1611)">Sir Henry Lee</ref>, was a prominent courtier and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England">Elizabeth I's</ref> champion. In about 1572 Cromwell Lee matriculated at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_College,_Oxford">St John's College, Oxford</ref>, but left without taking a degree.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936222-6">[6]</ref> He travelled in Italy for some years.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936222-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldring2004-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>He appears to have been close to his eldest brother, Sir Henry Lee, and to his illegitimate half-brother, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lee_(died_1608)">Sir Richard Lee</ref>. Through his first marriage to Mary Blundell, Sir Richard Lee held leases of two manors in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_Norton">Hook Norton</ref> which became the subject of subsequent litigation with John Croker, Mary Blundell's son by her first marriage. Pleadings from 1587 reveal that Sir Richard Lee had sublet these leases to his half-brother, Cromwell, who resided on the Hook Norton property with his family. The controversy over the leases is briefly mentioned in <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester's_Commonwealth">Leicester's Commonwealth</ref></hi> (1584), where the author refers to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dudley,_1st_Earl_of_Leicester">Earl of Leicester's</ref> oppressive 'dealing with Master Richard Lee for his manor of Hook Norton (if I fail not in the name)'. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936175–6-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>In addition to the leases at Hook Norton, Cromwell Lee had property at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutteslowe">Cutteslowe</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</ref>, and served as a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_of_the_Peace">Justice of the Peace</ref>, 'of no very good repute' for that county. However he resided principally in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford">Oxford</ref> itself, where in 1590 he was granted licence by the Vice-Chancellor of the University to eat meat in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent">Lent</ref>. According to Chambers, 'more than one Oxford <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigram">epigram</ref> describes his morals in the grossest terms'.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936223-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>On 23 September 1590 Sir Henry Lee was commissioned to investigate the murder of one Nicholas Crane, and his brother Cromwell was joined with him in the investigation, together with William Spencer of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarnton">Yarnton</ref>, and Walter Culpepper of Kent.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers193661-10">[10]</ref></p>
<p>In 1599 Sir Henry Lee purchased the tenancy in chief of the manor of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelsbury">Spelsbury</ref>, held of the crown, in Cromwell Lee's name, taking a bond from Cromwell which allowed Sir Henry enjoyment of the manor during Cromwell's lifetime and the reversionary interest at Cromwell's death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers193655,_222-11">[11]</ref> In 1600 Sir Henry Lee transferred to Cromwell his interest in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advowson">advowson</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlbury">Charlbury</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936220-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>Sir Henry was convalescing at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_Oxfordshire">Woodstock</ref> when he heard news of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Devereux,_2nd_Earl_of_Essex">Earl of Essex's</ref> rebellion in February 1601. According to Chambers, 'his first impulse was to repair to London with his brother Cromwell, but a relapse held him'. Whether Cromwell Lee went to London on his own at the time is not known.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936202-13">[13]</ref></p>
<p>Cromwell Lee compiled part of an Italian–English dictionary, completing it up to the word <hi rend="italic">tralignato</hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldring2004-7">[7]</ref> He gave the work to the library of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_College,_Oxford">St John's College, Oxford</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936222-6">[6]</ref> 'where a fair copy of it, transcribed by Thomas Potticary, M.A. of that College, yet remains'. Although unfinished, it is said to have been 'as big as a church bible'.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEP.R.O.1803341-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>He died in December 1601,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936222-6">[6]</ref> while resident in the parish of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Cross_Holywell">St Cross Holywell</ref>, Oxford.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldring2004-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936223-9">[9]</ref> His eldest brother, Sir Henry, was his heir at law, and in his own will dated 6 October 1609 directed that tombs be set up for his brother, Cromwell, and other family members. It seems, however, that this was never done.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936222,_233–4,_237-15">[15]</ref> An epitaph, attributed to 'a humorous student' of Oxford, stated that at his death Cromwell Lee 'gave nothing to the poor/But half to his bastards and half to his whore'.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEP.R.O.1803341-14">[14]</ref></p>
<p>His portrait, attributed to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Gheeraerts_the_Younger">Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger</ref>, was included in an exhibition at Oxford in 1904; however, its present whereabouts are unknown.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTECust190458-16">[16]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlakiston1904213-17">[17]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref></p>
<head>Marriage</head>
<p>In 1575 he married Mary Harcourt, widow of Richard Taverner (d.1575) of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodeaton">Woodeaton</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerk_of_the_Signet">Clerk of the Signet</ref> to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England">Edward VI</ref>. She was one of the eight daughters of Sir John Harcourt (d. 19 February 1566) of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanton_Harcourt">Stanton Harcourt</ref> by Margaret Barentyne,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTECollins1779269-19">[19]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> and by her first marriage to Richard Taverner was the great-grandmother of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Wood_(antiquary)">Anthony Wood</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-21">[21]</ref> There appear to have been no children of the marriage.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936223-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>The family of Lees of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barna">Barna</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Tipperary">Tipperary</ref>, claimed descent from Cromwell Lee, and according to Chambers this may have been through an illegitimate son, Robert Lee of New Woodstock, son of Cromwell's servant, Joan Hopkins <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Hatton. In his will he left Joan some kine and household goods at Cutteslowe, to her daughter Alice a marriage portion of £10, and to Robert his household furniture and his leases from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merton_College">Merton College</ref>. He made Joan and Robert his residuary legatees. She later married one Thomas Aylwin or Ayleward of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eversley">Eversley</ref>, a witness to the will.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936223-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>He is also reputed to have been the father of one John Lee (d.1609) who was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow">Fellow</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_College,_Oxford">St John's College, Oxford</ref>, and graduated MA in 1591. John Lee's mother was named Anne, and he had a brother, Francis Lee, as well as a sister married to a husband surnamed Tote. As Chambers notes, there was a family connection, as John Lee held the livings of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Marston">Fleet Marston</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wootton,_West_Oxfordshire">Wootton</ref>, but he could not have been a legitimate son 'or Sir Henry Lee would not have been Cromwell's heir at law'.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChambers1936223–4-22">[22]</ref></p>
