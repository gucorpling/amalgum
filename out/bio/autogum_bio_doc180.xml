<p>Her earliest recordings were made with the accompaniment of the twins Milas and Miles Pruitt (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo">banjo</ref> and guitar, respectively).

<p>Kimbrough recorded and performed using a number of pseudonyms. She used her married name, Lottie Beaman, on almost half of her tracks, but for her 1926 recording sessions Holmes suggested that she be renamed Lena Kimbrough.  He also used a photograph of her more photogenic sister, Estella, for publicity.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-AMG-2">[2]</ref> Kimbrough also appeared billed as Clara Cary and as Mae Moran. She further recorded in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Indiana">Richmond, Indiana</ref>, and pseudonyms were used for issues by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennett_Records">Gennett Records</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champion_Records">Champion Records</ref> (which billed her as Lottie Emerson), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertone_Records">Supertone Records</ref> (as Lottie Brown) and Superior Records (as Martha Jackson).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Trail-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> Her Gennett sessions produced the tracks "Rolling Log Blues" and "Goin' Away Blues", which the music journalist Tony Russell described as having "haunting beauty".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>Kimbrough's brother Sylvester appeared with her in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville">vaudeville</ref>, and in 1926 he supplied recording accompaniment for Paul Banks's Kansas City Trio. However, Kimbrough's musical collaboration with Holmes produced her better-known recordings.
