<head>Antonius Janue</head><p><hi rend="bold">Antonius Janue</hi> (?<hi rend="bold">Antonio da Genova</hi>) (fl. ca. 1460) was an Italian composer of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_music">Renaissance</ref>.  He was one of few known Italian composers of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony">polyphony</ref> in the middle of the 15th century, and left one of the few manuscripts of the time in the composer's own hand, showing erasures and corrections.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kanazawa,_Grove_online-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Life</head>
<p>Little is known with certainty about his life.  He may be the same as Antonio da Genova, a musician who worked in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrara">Ferrara</ref> in 1462, and he is probably the "Antonius de Jan." referenced in the archives of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa">Genoese</ref> ducal palace in 1456; "Janue" has been interpreted as meaning "of Genoa."  If these are the same person, he would seem to have been an active composer in northern Italy in the 1450s.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kanazawa,_Grove_online-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>He may have been a priest, given the common use of the "p." prefix in the manuscript sources, and also considering that he seems to have written only sacred music.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kanazawa,_Grove-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Janue probably compiled the manuscript <hi rend="italic">I-Fn 112bis</hi>, now in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Central_Library_(Florence)">Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence">Florence</ref>.  The manuscript contains pieces by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Dufay">Guillaume Dufay</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Binchois">Gilles Binchois</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dunstaple">John Dunstaple</ref>, and others, in addition to 16 pieces attributed to Janue himself.  Since he has more pieces in the manuscript than anyone else, including the most famous names of the time, and many of the pieces signed "Janue" contain erasures and emendations, it is presumed that he was not only the copyist but did some of his composing during the compilation process.  Many of the changes are reductions in complexity, suggesting that he was revising the works for less advanced singers.  It has been suggested that the manuscript was put together in Genoa, since his name appears on the payment register of the Genoese ducal palace in 1456, as receiving an annual salary.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kanazawa,_Grove_online-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<head>Music</head>
<p>Thirteen pieces are attributed directly to Janue in the <hi rend="italic">I-Fn 112bis</hi> manuscript:  eight hymns for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespers">Vespers</ref>, two settings of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificat">Magnificat</ref>, two <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processional_hymn">processional hymns</ref>, and a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laude">laude</ref>.  Stylistically they are polyphonic, usually for three voices, and rather simple in texture compared to the work of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundian_school">Burgundian</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Flemish_school">Franco-Flemish</ref> composers of the same time.  Janue often writes in <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauxbourdon">fauxbourdon</ref></hi> (in a similar manner to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Dufay">Dufay</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Binchois">Binchois</ref>), and occasionally uses imitation.  Transcriptions of Janue's music in modern notation usually have to use irregular meters in order to capture his metrical freedom.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kanazawa,_Grove-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Some of his works, for example the setting of the <hi rend="italic">Magnificat on Tone VI,</hi> were probably intended as replacements for equivalent settings by Dufay â€“ perhaps because the originals were too hard for inexperienced singers.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kanazawa,_Grove-2">[2]</ref></p>
