<head>Jaromar II, Prince of Rügen</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Jaromar II, Prince of Rügen</hi> (c.1218 – 20 August 1260) was a Danish nobleman.  He was the ruling Prince of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Rügen">Rügen</ref> from 1249 until his death.</p>
<head>Life</head>
<p>He was first mentioned on 8 November 1231.  From 28 September 1246, he was co-ruler with his father, Prince <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitslav_I,_Prince_of_Rügen">Vitslav I</ref>.  During the early years of his reign, he tried to maintain peaceful relations with his neighbours, the Dukes of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomerania">Pomerania</ref>, especially with the princes of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gützkow">Gützkow</ref>, who were vassals of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnim_I,_Duke_of_Pomerania">Barnim I</ref>.  He promoted trade by outlawing <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrecking_(shipwreck)">wrecking</ref> and providing safe passage for merchant ships from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lübeck">Lübeck</ref>.  In 1249, troops from Lübeck destroyed the city of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stralsund">Stralsund</ref>; this resulted in a war which lasted four years, during which Stralsund's privateers were allowed to capture ships from Lübeck.  All privileges granted to Lübeck were suspended, until the paid compensation for the damage done to Stralsund.</p>
<p>Jaromar II donated land to the three <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercian">Cistercian</ref> monasteries in his territory, in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen_auf_Rügen_Abbey">Bergen auf Rügen</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuenkamp_Abbey">Neuenkamp</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldena_Abbey">Hilda</ref>.  In 1252, he donated the Radevice Land in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mönchgut">Mönchgut</ref> to Hilda Abbey, near <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greifswald">Greifswald</ref>.  He supported the settlement of other religious orders in his territory.  The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order">Dominicans</ref> founded the St. Catherine monastery in Stralsund; the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan_Order">Franciscans</ref> founded the St. John monastery, also in Stralsund, in 1254.  In 1255, he granted Lübeck style <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_rights">city rights</ref> to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barth,_Germany">Barth</ref> and in 1258 to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damgarten">Damgarten</ref>.</p>

In Peder Bang escaped from a Danish prison, into exile in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaprode">Schaprode</ref> in Rügen.

They probably committed some serious acts of violence in the process, and burned down a large part of Copenhagen, after looting the city.  King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_I_of_Denmark">Christopher I of Denmark</ref> suddenly died in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribe">Ribe</ref> in May 1259.
