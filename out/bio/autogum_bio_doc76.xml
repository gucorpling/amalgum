<head>Philip J. Wyatt</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Philip J. Wyatt</hi> is the founder and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO">CEO</ref> of Wyatt Technology, located in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California">Santa Barbara, California</ref>.  He is known for contributions to laser light scattering, more specifically the physics of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_scattering_problem">inverse scattering problem</ref> and for commercializing analytical methods and instruments involving laser light scattering, which are widely used in academia, industry, and government.</p>
<head>Early life and education</head>
<p>Wyatt did undergraduate work at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago">University of Chicago</ref>, (B.A., 1952; B.Sc., 1954), and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ's_College,_Cambridge">Christ's College, Cambridge</ref>. He received his M.S. from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois">University of Illinois</ref> in 1956<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Tretkoff-1">[1]</ref> and his Ph.D. from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_University">Florida State University</ref> in 1959, where he first worked on the inverse scattering problem.  His Ph.D. work involved the development of a non‑local nuclear model of the scattering of neutrons by nuclei.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Tretkoff-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>He was nominated by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</ref> in 1965 as one of sixteen possible candidates for the first Scientist-Astronaut Selection Program in the United States.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-APS-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SBCC-3">[3]</ref></p>
<head>Career</head>
<p>As a graduate student, Wyatt worked at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory">Los Alamos National Laboratory</ref>. During the 1960s,  he worked for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronutronic">Aeronutronic</ref> division of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company">Ford Motor Company</ref>, General Research Corporation in Santa Barbara, California, and the defense contractor <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EG&amp;G">EG&amp;G</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-APS-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Wyatt founded his first company, Science Spectrum, Inc., in 1968.  The company developed several instruments that could be used to study the inverse scattering problem. They applied light-scattering techniques to the detection of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_weapons">biological weapons</ref> and the monitoring of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_quality">food quality</ref>. These early instruments used a traditional single detector to scan a range of scattering angles.  Shortly before the closure of the company in 1982, Wyatt developed an instrument for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-angle_light_scattering">multi-angle light scattering</ref> (MALS) in which a glass capillary containing a sample was surrounded by an array of detectors.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-AZO-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Wyatt then founded Wyatt Technology Corporation to develop and sell laser‑based scientific instruments for light scattering and particle size measurement.  His  instruments are used worldwide by universities, government agencies, the biotech industry and pharmaceutical companies.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Tretkoff-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Reisch-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Wyatt's instruments are used in a wide variety of fields.  Laser particle analysis has been applied to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine">wine</ref> and to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleaning_products">cleaning products</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-AZO-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Reisch-5">[5]</ref> The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Government">U.S. Government</ref> has supported work on the identification of bioterrorism threats such as airborne bacteria<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Tretkoff-1">[1]</ref> and metabolic poisons or carcinogens in drinking water.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-AZO-4">[4]</ref>   Wyatt's instruments are used for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_analysis">protein analysis</ref> by biopharmaceutical companies such as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amgen">Amgen</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Reisch-5">[5]</ref> They are used for detection of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_residues">drug</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide_residues">pesticide residues</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat">meat</ref>, and monitoring for possible <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity">toxicity</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zidovudine">AZT</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antineoplastic_drugs">antineoplastic drugs</ref> in patients.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Tretkoff-1">[1]</ref> Nobel prize winner <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Grubbs">Robert H.

<p>“Get into a market that is just on the verge of developing. If you’re too early, the company fails. If you’re a little too late, the competitors will eat you alive because  they have much better resources.” Philip J. Wyatt<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Tretkoff-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Wyatt has published over seventy publications, including books. He has at least ninety domestic and foreign patents related to laser light scattering and other technologies.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Papers-6">[6]</ref></p>
