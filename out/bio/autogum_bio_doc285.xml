<p>Not many details are known about Aliqoli's life.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266-3">[2]</ref> He was born sometime during the second half of the 17th century in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Portugal">Portugal</ref>, and was originally an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Saint_Augustine">Augustinian</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friar">friar</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary">missionary</ref> named António de Jesus.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266-3">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETeles_e_Cunha2009-4">[3]</ref> He arrived in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan">Isfahan</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty">Safavid</ref> royal capital, in 1691 at the latest. There he initially served in the retinue of Gaspar dos Reis, then head of the city's Augustinian monastery, before succeeding him in the post.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266-3">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmanat2017123-2">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlannery201395–96-5">[4]</ref> He reportedly played an important role in the contacts between Portuguese diplomats and the Shah's government "at a time of an attempted Portuguese-Iranian alliance against the sultans of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman">Oman</ref> in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf">Persian Gulf</ref>".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266-3">[2]</ref></p>

<p>He converted to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam">Shia Islam</ref> in Isfahan during the early reign of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah">Shah</ref> (King) <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Husayn">Sultan Husayn</ref> (r.1694–1722) and took the name Aliqoli Jadid-ol-Eslam.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPourjavadySchmidtke2009-6">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmanat2017123-2">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTERota201759-7">[6]</ref> There is no consensus on the date of his conversion. Reza Pourjavady and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine_Schmidtke">Sabine Schmidtke</ref> (2009) state that he converted in 1696,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPourjavadySchmidtke2009-6">[5]</ref> while according to Joao Teles e Cunha (2009), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_Amanat">Abbas Amanat</ref> (2017) and Giorgio Rota (2017) he converted in 1697.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETeles_e_Cunha2009-4">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmanat2017123-2">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTERota201759-7">[6]</ref> According to Alberto Tiburcio (2018), "it certainly took place between 1694 and 1697".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266-3">[2]</ref> The precise reason for his conversion remains unknown.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266-3">[2]</ref> However, it is known that he corresponded with the long-time <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Friars_Minor_Capuchin">Capuchin</ref> resident of Isfahan, Raphael du Mans, about his intentions, and that he "felt disappointed by the way many missionaries bribed Muslims into conversion".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266-3">[2]</ref> Aliqoli Jadid-ol-Eslam's life bears similarities to that of his fellow former Augustinian missionary, Manuel de Santa Maria, who also lived in Iran and who took the name Hasan-Qoli Beg after embracing Islam.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266-3">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTERota201759-7">[6]</ref></p>
<p>After apostatising, Aliqoli became an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apologetics">apologist</ref> for Shia Islam as well as a major polemicist against Christianity, Sufism and Judaism.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPourjavadySchmidtke2009-6">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266–267-8">[7]</ref> Abbas Amanat adds that in one of his major works, the <hi rend="italic">Sayf ol-mo'menin fi qetal ol-moshrekin</hi>, Aliqoli not only made "a violent attack on Christians, Jews, and Sunnis but also on philosophers, Sufis, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinomianism">antinomians</ref>".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmanat2017123-2">[1]</ref> In addition, after conversion, he served as a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragoman">dragoman</ref>, a translator and interpreter of European languages, at the Shah's court in Isfahan, succeeding du Mans to the post.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266–267-8">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETeles_e_Cunha2009-4">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmanat2017123-2">[1]</ref> Aliqoli was one of the late 17th century converts in Iran who "helped reaffirm the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad-Baqer_Majlesi">Majlesi</ref> brand of conservatism"; his appointment as royal dragoman further confirmed the Safavid state's "patronage of a prevailing xenophobic tendency".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAmanat2017123-2">[1]</ref> Tiburcio notes that according to one source, Aliqoli may have played a role in the persecution of the Catholic <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Armenians">Armenian</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sceriman_family">Shahremanian</ref> (Sceriman) family.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018267-9">[8]</ref> He displayed detailed knowledge of Shi'ite intellectual history in at least one of his works, which also referenced Church historians.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018270-10">[9]</ref> However, not all of his writings are extant, and of those works that survive, not all are fully preserved.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018267-9">[8]</ref></p>
<p>Aliqoli is known to have married.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266-3">[2]</ref> According to an August 1710 letter written by Louis-Marie Pidou de Saint-Olon, the Bishop of Babylon, his health had declined by that time, and he was reportedly suffering from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_tuberculosis">pulmonary tuberculosis</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlannery201394_(note_13)-11">[10]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTELockhart1986406-12">[11]</ref> Aliqoli died c.1722, probably in Isfahan, though the precise location remains uncertain.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETiburcio2018266-3">[2]</ref></p>
