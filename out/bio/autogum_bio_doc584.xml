<head>Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece</head>
<p>The <hi rend="bold">Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece</hi> (sometimes called the <hi rend="bold">Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altar</hi>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NGA-1">[1]</ref>) was an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Netherlandish_painter">Early Netherlandish painter</ref> active in Germany between 1475<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NGA-1">[1]</ref>/1480 and 1510.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-getty-2">[2]</ref>  Despite his anonymity, he is one of the most recognizable artists of the early <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance">Renaissance</ref> period in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">German</ref> art.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<head>Career</head>
<p>Almost nothing is known of his life, including his name; nevertheless, his hand is distinctive enough that scholars have found it fairly easy to trace his career.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-getty-2">[2]</ref>  His name is derived from an altarpiece dated to between 1505 and 1510, depicting <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Bartholomew">Saint Bartholomew</ref> flanked by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Agnes">Saint Agnes</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Cecilia">Saint Cecilia</ref>.  The painting is known to have hung in the church of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Columba">Saint Columba</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne">Cologne</ref>; the inclusion of a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthusian">Carthusian</ref> monk in the picture indicates a possible connection to the Carthusian <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery">monastery</ref> in that city.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NGA-1">[1]</ref>  The identity of the Master remains unknown; it has been suggested, given the number of commissions he executed for the Carthusian order, that he may have been a member himself.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NGA-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>It is now believed that, despite his associations with Cologne, and with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">German</ref> artistic circles, elements of his style suggest that the Master was initially trained in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands">Netherlands</ref> - a point of origin in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht_(city)">Utrecht</ref>, or in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelderland">Gelderland</ref> region, has been posited. A <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Hours">Book of Hours</ref>, open to an identifiably middle <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_(terminology)#Netherlandish">Netherlandish</ref> text, in the hand of Saint <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columba">Columba</ref> in a panel attributed to the Master conserved at Mainz,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> offers a clue to his cultural origins. It is further suggested that he emigrated to Cologne in about 1480.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NGA-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-getty-2">[2]</ref>  His early style may be seen in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_(illuminated_manuscript)">miniatures</ref> he painted for the Book of Hours of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_van_Bylant">Sophia van Bylant</ref>; the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellation">Flagellation</ref></hi> in this collection is dated to 1475, the earliest date associated with the Master.  The calendar in the book is that of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdiocese_of_Utrecht_(695–1580)">diocese of Utrecht</ref>; nevertheless, certain oddities of language indicate an affinity with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem">Arnhem</ref>, which was also the home of the donor.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NGA-1">[1]</ref>  Other early works, dated to the 1480s, include an <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoration_of_the_Magi">Adoration of the Kings</ref></hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Madonna and Child with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Anne">Saint Anne</ref></hi>, both of which exhibit affinities with northern Netherlandish painting and may have been created in the Netherlands.  Among the very few works attributed to the Master for which the original location is documented are a pair of altarpieces commissioned for the Carthusian monastery in Cologne by a lawyer, Dr. Peter Rinck,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NGA-1">[1]</ref> and the <hi rend="italic">Deposition</hi>, now at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musée_du_Louvre">Musée du Louvre</ref>, that was executed for the hospital of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Brothers_of_St._Anthony">Antonite brothers</ref> in Paris.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<head>Style</head>
<p>It has been said that the Master is the last "Gothic" painter to be active in Cologne.  Approximately twenty-five paintings have been attributed to him<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NGA-1">[1]</ref> on the basis of his highly individual style, which does not seem to bear any affinity to that of any other school then active locally.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-getty-2">[2]</ref> Despite the fact that he seems to have been the leading painter of his time in Cologne, no evidence of any followers, or of a school in the usual sense, may be found.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NGA-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>A number of influences, mainly Netherlandish, have been traced in the Master's paintings.  These include <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirck_Bouts">Dirck Bouts</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogier_van_der_Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-WGA-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cartage-7">[7]</ref> whose influence may be seen in the Munich <hi rend="italic">Madonna and Child with Saint Anne</hi>.  </p>
<p>Stylistically, the Master's paintings are characterized by their use of bright, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel">enamel</ref>-like colors<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cartage-7">[7]</ref> and an affinity to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Gothic">International Gothic</ref> style of painting.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Wiki-8">[8]</ref></p>
<head>Collections</head>
