<head>Niseko</head>


<p><hi rend="bold">Niseko</hi> (ニセコ) is a town and ski resort on the northern island of <ref target="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</ref>, <ref target="Japan">Japan</ref>.</p>

<head>Understand</head>

<p>Niseko is an increasingly popular destination for powder hungry skiers and boarders, and nearly alone among Japan's ski resorts is drawing increasing numbers of overseas visitors year-on-year as well. Niseko is highly favored by Australians, and more recently, Asian tourists. The resort boasts four ski areas: Hanazono, Hirafu, Niseko Village (formerly Higashiyama) and Annupuri. Most activity is centered around the village of Hirafu, approximately 20 minutes from the main town and administrative centre in the area, <ref target="Kutchan">Kutchan</ref>.</p>

<head>By plane</head>
<p>The nearest airport to Niseko is <ref target="Sapporo">Sapporo</ref>'s New Chitose Airport, which receives flights from all over Japan and some international destinations as well.</p>

<p>There are direct international flights from most neighboring countries. If you come from further far away often Nagoya (Chubu) or Seoul are most convenient transfers.</p>

<head>By bus</head>
<p>Skybus is a convenient door to door private airport transfer servicing all hotels in Niseko, operating 365 days a year. Bookings are essential. More information at <ref target="http://skybus.co.jp">Skybus</ref></p>

<p>During winter months, numerous limousine bus services are provided to various ski resorts in Niseko at a cost of ¥1900-¥2300 each way. In addition, two public bus lines run buses from New Chitose Airport ( CTS ) to Hirafu. Both operate on a regular timetable during the ski season, with the Chuo Bus having 5 trips each way daily while Donan Buses have 4 each way.</p>

<p>Times are subject to change from season to season, but each can be contacted by phone (Chuo-Bus +81 11 231 0500, and Donan-Bus +81 123 465701). In the 2006/7 season, the cost of a one-way ticket is ¥2300 and a return is ¥3850. The trip takes about <date when="2019-03-04">3.5 - 4</date> hours, depending on the road conditions. This is an excellent way to see the countryside, the snow covered farm lands and the quaint houses.</p>

<p>In the 2011/12 season both bus lines offer a discounted return ticket including a strongly discounted one-day ski pass.</p>

<head>By train</head>
<p>Reaching Niseko from Sapporo by train is a tricky affair, requiring a transfer of trains at <ref target="Otaru">Otaru</ref>, and perhaps a long wait as well; there are only six daily local trains between Otaru and Niseko. But, if it's between December and March, and you decide to leave Sapporo at around 8:00 or 12:30, you can get to Niseko on a direct train. The limited express train, appropriately named the <hi rend="italic">Niseko Ski-Express</hi>, makes the run in 2 hours at a cost of ¥4560. Return <hi rend="italic">Ski-Express</hi> trains depart from Niseko at 10:00 and 16:00. There is no charge for this train with the <ref target="Japan%20Rail%20Pass">Japan Rail Pass</ref>.</p>

<item> <hi rend="bold">Mt. Yotei</hi> (羊蹄山). This 1,898m peak is directly opposite Hirafu at Niseko. The peak makes for great views in the winter. In the summer, many people climb it, and it is possible to stay on top of the mountain in the Mountain Hut (山小屋). This mountain is sometimes called Ezo Fuji (蝦夷富士) due to it's strong resemblance to Japan's iconic Mt. Fuji, with Ezo being the former official name for the island of Hokkaido.</item>
