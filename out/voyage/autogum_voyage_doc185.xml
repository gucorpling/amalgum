<head>Arad (Israel)</head>

<p><hi rend="bold"><ref target="http://www.arad.muni.il/">Arad</ref></hi> (<hi rend="italic">Hebrew</hi>, &#1506;&#1512;&#1491;) is a small city in <ref target="Israel">Israel</ref> that lies on the border between the <ref target="Negev">Negev</ref> desert and the <ref target="Judaean%20Desert">Judaean Desert</ref>.</p>

<head>Understand</head>
<p><hi rend="italic">Tel Arad</hi>, the site of the ancient city of Arad, is located some 10 km west of the modern city centre. Arad is a great centre for hiking and exploring the northeastern part of the <ref target="Negev">Negev</ref> desert.</p>

<p>Modern Arad was founded in 1962 by young Israelis, most of them ex-kibbutzniks and ex-moshavniks, who were seeking an environment free of the urban ills of overcrowding, traffic, noise and pollution. Although not noted for its great beauty, the town's growth has closely followed a well-designed master plan. Arad's present population is approximately 28,000 (2003 estimate) and reflects the broad spectrum of Israeli society with a special emphasis on recent immigrants.</p>

<head>Get in</head>
<p>Take a bus from <ref target="Beer%20Sheva">Beer Sheva</ref>. There are also less frequent buses from Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities. Check the schedule for those ahead of time.</p>

<head>From Beer Sheva</head>
<p>From the Beer Sheva central bus station, line 386 (express), 387 (direct) and line 388 (higher frequency, but more intermediate stops) run to Arad. The price is ₪8.70.</p>

<head>From Tel Aviv</head>
<p>From <ref target="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</ref> (Arlozorov terminal only), lines 389 and 421 run to Arad. Each line has only 2-3 trips per day each direction. Line 421 continues to the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>In addition, line 550 runs from Bnei Brak to Arad, approximately 9 times per day.</p>

<head>From Jerusalem</head>
<p>From <ref target="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</ref>, lines 554 and 555 run to Arad. These lines are oriented to the Haredi sector, so they start in Haredi neighborhoods rather than the central bus station. Together these lines have about 9 trips per day in each direction.</p>

<head>Get around</head>
<p>There are 5 local bus lines (Lines 1, 2, 3, 11 and 12) that serve all parts of the city. These lines are operated by Metropoline.</p>

<p>Having said that, Arad can easily be explored on foot.</p>
