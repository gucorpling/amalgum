<head>Understand</head>

<p>A UNESCO World Heritage site, Gros Morne National Park protects an area of impressive natural beauty, rural Newfoundland culture, and unique geological wonders. The park's namesake mountain, Gros Morne, is the second highest point in Newfoundland at 806 metres. Its French meaning is "large mountain standing alone," or more literally "great sombre." </p>

<p>It covers an area of 1,805 km² (697 sq mi).</p>

<p>Gros Morne is a member of the Long Range Mountains, an outlying range of the Appalachian Mountains, stretching the length of the island's west coast. It is the eroded remnants of a mountain range formed 1.2 billion years ago.</p>

<p>The park's operating season is from mid-May to mid-October: most facilities are open seven days a week, including holidays. This is the high season, so you should book your accommodation well in advance. The park is open in winter with some activities available in winter. All major travel routes are maintained throughout the year, although temporary closures or warnings may come into effect in the event of adverse weather conditions.</p>

<head>History</head>

<p>The Gros Morne National Park Reserve was established in 1973 and received <ref target="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</ref> status in 1987. It became a national park on October 1, 2005.</p>

<head>Landscape</head>
<p>The park is in the Long Range mountains, an extension of the Appalachian chain running up the west coast of the island of Newfoundland. The landscape of the park is mountainous and rugged, and has a number of interesting geological features, including a number of fjords and the barren Tablelands.</p>

<p>The park's rock formations include oceanic crust and mantle rock exposed by the obduction process of plate tectonics, as well as sedimentary rock formed during the Ordovician, Precambrian granite and Palaeozoic igneous rocks.</p>

<head>Tablelands</head>

<p>The Tablelands, found between the towns of Trout River and Woody Point in south west of Gros Morne National Park, look more like a barren desert than traditional Newfoundland. This is due to the ultramafic rock&mdash;peridotite&mdash;which makes up the Tablelands. It is thought to originate in the Earth's mantle and was forced up from the depths during a plate collision several hundred million years ago. Peridotite lacks some of the usual nutrients required to sustain most plant life and has a toxic quality, hence its barren appearance. Peridotite is also high in iron, which accounts for its brownish colour (rusted colour). Underneath this weathered zone, the rock is really a dark green colour.</p>

<head>Fauna</head>
<p>The most notable animal in the park is the moose, part of a booming population that was introduced to Newfoundland around 1900. Other common wildlife in the park include an ecotype of caribou (<hi rend="italic">R.t caribou</hi>), black bears, red foxes, Arctic foxes, snowshoe hares, red squirrels, lynxes, river otters and beavers. Harbour seals are common in St. Pauls inlet, and whales (pilots minkes, humpbacks, fins) may be in the area especially during the capelin season in early summer. Many bird species can be found in the park, from shorebirds along the ocean to birds of the bogs and interior forests.</p>

<head>Climate</head>
<p>The climate in this part of Newfoundland is on the cool side of temperate - daytime highs are around 20°C in the summer and -5°C in the winter. Annual precipitation is just over 1300 mm.</p>

<head>Get around</head>
<p>A car is probably the most convenient way to get around, because the park is huge, and things are far apart. Biking may also be an option, if you don't mind lots of hills.</p>

<p>Be careful if you drive at night, since moose are often spotted on the roads in Newfoundland, and collisions are common. An adult moose can weigh well over a ton, and hitting one at highway speeds is likely to be fatal. Moose are most active around dawn and dusk, so be vigilant if you're driving at those times.</p>
