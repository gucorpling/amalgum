<head>Arad (Romania)</head>

<p><hi rend="bold">Arad</hi> is an industrial city of some 160,000 population at the western edge of Romania, close to the border with Hungary. It is a regional transportation hub and a convenient place to stop over on a journey between those countries. There is an intact Vauban-style fortress and an interesting old town with a great number of historic buildings. Most of them date from the <ref target="Austro-Hungarian%20Empire">Habsburg era</ref>, ranging from Baroque to Art Nouveau. While some have been recently renovated, others are left in a state of dilapidation. </p>

<p>The city's cultural life is marked by a Philharmonic Orchestra, several theatres and a museum complex. The latter is particularly interesting for history buffs, as it showcases evidence from various eras of human history that have been discovered in this area. The Arad county <ref target="wine">wine</ref> route starts a few kilometer east of the city.</p>
