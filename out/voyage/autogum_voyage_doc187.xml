<head>Understand</head>
<p>The varied landscape of Derbyshire makes it an attractive destination for sightseers, particularly hikers. The south is a low-level clayland area, dominated by the broad, flat, gravel-filled valley of the River Trent. The north and central west of the county is classic limestone hills and valleys. Further north, surrounding these limestone areas, are higher level moorlands, dotted with rock outcrops and gritstone edges, while the lower area are rolling hills and deep valleys with small picturesque villages that a hobbit might feel at home in. The eastern part of the county consists of a rural and urban landscape influence by its industrial, mainly coal-mining, past. </p>

<p>Derbyshire also has many historical attractions from stately homes to early industrial heritage buildings, and includes the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site - a long, wooded corridor running from Derby to Matlock and containing some of the first water-powered mills of the Industrial Revolution. </p>
