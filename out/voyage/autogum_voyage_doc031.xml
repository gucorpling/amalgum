<p>Contrary to popular belief the town isn't named after the seven oak trees that stood alongside the cricket pitch (six of which were destroyed in the great storm of 1987); the town's name is instead derived from the Saxon word <hi rend="italic">seouenaca</hi>, the name given to a small chapel in Knole Park around 800 AD.</p>

<item> <hi rend="bold">Church of St. Mary's</hi>, Chiddingstone. This parish church is a beautiful Grade II* listed sandstone church and is, perhaps, the fourth built on the site. In the churchyard is a mausoleum dating from 1736 built by Henry Streatfeild; leading down into the family vault beneath which has a through flow of air provided by vents in two false altar tombs. The church was almost destroyed by a lightning fire in 1624.</item>
<item> <hi rend="bold">Chiddingstone Castle</hi>. Open to the public and houses Buddhist, Egyptian and Japanese artefact collections - the Japanese collection is exceptionally fine. The house dates back to the early 1500s, owned by the Streatfeild family and in the early 1800s was Gothicised by Henry Streatfeild with a new ashlar castellated exterior. The castle was sold to Lord Astor in 1938, and then served as a base for military forces during the Second World War. It then became Long Dene school until 1954 when the school was closed. The collections were assembled at startlingly low cost by Denys Eyre Bower, who bought the Castle with a bank loan, and was subsequently imprisoned on an absurd charge of attempting to murder his fiancee, who claimed Italian nobility but was in fact from Balham. The extraordinary story is told by Mary Eldridge in her book "Beyond Belief". </item>
