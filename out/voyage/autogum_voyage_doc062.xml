<head>Understand</head>
<p>The most important tourist destinations in the Eastern Region of the Dominican Republic are the beaches of <ref target="Punta%20Cana">Punta Cana</ref> and <ref target="Bavaro">Bavaro</ref>. These two beaches are filled with all-inclusive hotels, very popular among Europeans and North Americans. All these hotels are very safe and are a showcase of Dominican hospitality. For those seeking to escape the rather artificial paradise of Punta Cana and Bavaro, the closest town where tourists can witness the Dominican reality is that of <ref target="Hig%C3%BCey">Higüey</ref>, the religious center of the country. The "Basilica de Higüey" is the scene of intense local pilgrimage every January.</p>
<p>To the South, you will find the city of La Romana, contiguous to the world-famous resort of <ref target="Casa%20de%20Campo">Casa de Campo</ref>, where the rich and wealthy of the Dominican Republic and the world have their beach residences. Casa de Campo has the country's best golf courses, as well as a beautiful and fancy Marina, smaller than that of Cap Cana. Tourists should not miss the tourist town of <ref target="Altos%20de%20Chav%C3%B3n">Altos de Chavón</ref>, the replica of a Renaissance Italian village, home to one of the Caribbean's most important art schools, overlooking a cliff and the Chavón River. Its replica of a Roman Amphitheater is the scene of multiple shows and concerts. Close to La Romana is the beach of <ref target="Bayahibe">Bayahibe</ref>, another alternative to Punta Cana. Also, those who are looking for infinite white-sand beaches but hate huge hotels and resorts can explore the Saona Island off the southeastern coast, offering the same natural beauty of Punta Cana, but undefiled by mass tourism.</p>

<p>Destinations off the beaten path include first the chaotic town of <ref target="San%20Pedro%20de%20Macoris">San Pedro de Macoris</ref>, home to the most famous Dominican baseball players such as Sammy Sosa and Pedro Martinez. The town is surrounded by "Bateys" or sugar-cane plantations, offering a stark contrast with the resorts. To the North, you will find the beach of <ref target="Miches">Miches</ref>, which the locals have made impressive efforts to develop on their own, providing for an alternative more authentic tourist destination without any of the fancy all-inclusive resorts that plague the East Coast. Miches is close to <ref target="Los%20Haitises%20National%20Park">Los Haitises National Park</ref>. The park has an outstanding natural beauty, displaying a beautiful tropical rain-forest, and an unending chains archipelagos that are readily explorable by boat.</p>
