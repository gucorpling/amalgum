<head>Belize City</head>


<p><hi rend="bold">Belize City</hi> is the largest city in <ref target="Belize">Belize</ref>. It is on a small peninsula protruding into the <ref target="Caribbean">Caribbean</ref> Sea. It was the capital city until flooding and other damage from a hurricane in 1961 prompted the government to relocated to <ref target="Belmopan">Belmopan</ref>, closer to the geographic center of the country.</p>

<head>By plane</head>
 <hi rend="bold">Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport</hi> ( BZE ), Belize City (about 30 minutes drive (15 km) northwest of Belize City centre in the village of Ladyville), ☏ +501 225-2045 , ✉ bacc@pgiabelize.com . BZE is connected from the U.S. (American, Delta, United, and Southwest); from Central America (Avianca El Salvador, Transportes Aéreos Guatemaltecos and Copa) and from the surrounding regions of Belize, the <ref target="Yucat%C3%A1n%20and%20the%20South">Yucatan Peninsula</ref> and from Flores by <ref target="http://www.mayaislandair.com">Maya Island Air</ref> and <ref target="http://www.tropicair.com">Tropic Air</ref>. There are seasonal flights offered from Canada with <ref target="http://www.aircanada.com">Air Canada Rouge</ref> and <ref target="http://www.westjet.com">Westjet</ref>. The best way to get to and from the city centre is by taxi. If going to San Ignacio see "By shuttle" in the below as there are shuttle companies based in San Ignacio that offer airport transfers to San Ignacio and to the surrounding areas in the Cayo District. Some may connect the airport to other places such as the water taxi terminals in Belize City or Placencia from the airport without going to San Ignacio. Ask. An airport bus service does exist, but it is very infrequent and unreliable.

<item> <hi rend="bold">Various from Novelos Bus Terminal</hi>, Novelos Bus Terminal @ W Collett Canal St (W Collett Canal St and King St). Bus travel is a very common mode of transportation in Belize for going to work, shopping and other errands. Therefore, bus service along the main highways is frequent, usually hourly and sometimes half-hourly during peak travel times. For service to/from small rural towns off the main highway they can be less frequent to as little as 4 times or twice daily and no service on Sundays. Like the famous <ref target="Chicken_bus">chicken buses</ref> in Guatemala, they operate in the recycled U.S. school buses, but they can also be in the older MCI (Motor Coach Industries) buses (intercity buses used by Greyhound and other companies in the U.S., usually for "express" services). They are usually not crowded, but they can be too. The services provided are either "regular" which means they stop anywhere along the road to pick up and let off passengers and "express" with only scheduled stops in major towns.</item>

<p>The companies and drivers' unions don't have websites or published schedules like they do in Mexico and the "west". If they do, it's usually handwritten on a piece of paper or cardboard and taped to a wall or bus station window for all to see at the bus station. The buses do display the final destination or a list of major destinations served on the windshield.</p>

<p>Shuttles can pick you up at the airport, your hotel or from anywhere, and transfer you much quicker to almost anywhere in the country and with much more ease since they are door to door:</p>

<p>Most of them are based in San Ignacio Town, east of Belize City in the Cayo District and wrote about connecting San Ignacio to the airport and other places in Belize. Therefore, you must ask them if they provide transportation originating in Belize City and going somewhere else if you don't plan to go to San Ignacio.</p>
