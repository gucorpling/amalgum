<head>Paleontology</head>


<p><hi rend="bold">Paleontology</hi> is the study of prehistoric life on Earth, especially through <hi rend="bold">fossils</hi>, and is an important tool for studying organisms' evolution. A traveller can find museums, as well as dig sites, which tell the story of our planet before mankind.</p>

<head>Do</head>
<p>In some places you can actually "fossil hunt" yourself, but this may be subject to a number of local regulations, as well as import/export restrictions when <ref target="border%20crossing">crossing borders</ref>. In some cases what you find in terms of "fossils" is so commonplace that no protection need to be enforced, but it is a great way to spend a day with children (especially the "dinosaur crowd") as well as to introduce amateur paleontologists to the subject. Some museums that sit in appropriate geological contexts even offer fossil hunting as a part of their program and you should certainly take advantage of that if possible. One of the eras that is rather "packed" with common - though pretty - fossils is limestone from the Jurassic era as it can be found in Franconian Switzerland and the English Jurassic Coast.</p>

<p>If you want to look for rare or valuable fossils, you would most likely have to connect with a university or science-institute who do more sophisticated digs and actually find fossils that haven't been found or at least not been scientifically described before. In many cases those digs are only open to people with legitimate science degrees in the appropriate field(s) or studying towards one. In case you need to cross borders for such, a tourist visa may sometimes not be the category to apply for in those cases.</p>
