<head>Understand</head>

<p>Marple was inhabited in 1683 by a group of Quakers who were members of the <ref target="http://www.quaker.org/">Society of Friends</ref>. The Quakers escaped from England and the religious persecution present there and settled in the land of William Penn’s Holy Experiment. The Holy experiment was an attempt by the Quakers to establish their own community. The community began to grow during the pre-revolutionary period, and while no action took place in Marple during the Revolutionary War, the growth of occupation crafts such as weavers and millers gave way to increased trade. Once the war was over, Marple returned to its farming and agrarian lifestyle.</p>

<p>Population in Marple began to grow rapidly after the Civil War. The Industrial Revolution brought rail transportation through the township making transportation easier around Marple and into Philadelphia. The largest period of development for Marple Township came towards the end of World War II. The improvement of roads, public transportation and the availability of the automobiles made Marple a suburban community.</p>
