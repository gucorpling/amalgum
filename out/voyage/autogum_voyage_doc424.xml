<head>Penticton</head>

<p><hi rend="bold"><ref target="http://www.penticton.ca/">Penticton</ref></hi> (The 'Peach City') is a beautiful spot in the south <ref target="Okanagan">Okanagan</ref> nestled between two lakes: The 155-km-long Okanagan Lake to the north, and the smaller Skaha Lake to the south. Tourism in Penticton is largely seasonal. In the summer tourists double Penticton's population to 60,000. In the winter things used to be very quiet, but now that World Cup Freestyle Skiing stops at local Apex Mountain every winter, the winter scene is picking up.</p>

<head>Understand</head>
<p>This area has been inhabited for thousands of years by the Salish group of <hi rend="bold">First Nations</hi> people. They called their settlement in this area <hi rend="italic">Snpinkten</hi> which translates as 'a place to stay forever' and gives Penticton its name. The first non-native settler Thomas Ellis preempted land in Penticton in 1869 and started a very successful cattle ranch. With the arrival of engineering marvel <hi rend="bold">Kettle Valley Railway</hi> the boom in Penticton had begun. Penticton became a municipality in 1908, and a city in 1948.</p>

<p>Penticton's climate is well suited for agriculture, and thousands of fruit trees were planted all along the west and east bench areas overlooking Okanagan Lake. From cherries in early July to apples and pears in early September, Penticton has always been a large producer and exporter of non-citrus tree fruit. Many local oldtimers decry the trend of ripping out perfectly healthy and productive <hi rend="bold">orchards</hi> for the more lucrative vineyards which supply grapes for the regions more than thirty <hi rend="bold">boutique wineries</hi>. Today Penticton's two largest industries are tourism and the growing wine industry, which threatens to eclipse the fruit production industry.</p>

<p>Penticton's climate and geography is a northern, four-seasons version of what some call <hi rend="bold">Mediterranean</hi>. Large clay banks, benches, and scrubland skirt the mid-level mountains that frame the valley on the east and west sides. Summers are hot with an average temperature of 27°C, and peaks of 35-40°C are not unheard of. The large size of Okanagan Lake tempers the climate in winter which sees an average high of 0.9°C in January. It can and does snow occasionally, but generally only during December and January will it accumulate in modest quantities. You can check the snow level with a quick glance to the mountains, which will have a white apron about half to three-quarters of the way up. Penticton gets about 2000 hours of sun per year, which is a higher average than <ref target="Rio%20de%20Janeiro_%28city%29">Rio de Janeiro</ref>.</p>

<head>By car</head>
<p>Most travellers will arrive in Penticton by automobile. Highway 97 is the major north-south route through the city. Travel times are about 4 hours from <ref target="Vancouver">Vancouver</ref>, 8 hours from <ref target="Calgary">Calgary</ref> and 5 hours from <ref target="Seattle">Seattle</ref> or <ref target="Spokane">Spokane</ref>. Penticton is a 40-minute drive south from <ref target="Kelowna">Kelowna</ref>. The US/Canada border crossing to the south on Highway 97 is open 24 hours a day; other border crossings in this region are closed overnight.</p>

Views to the south are accessed by an easy paved trail to the lookout. The panoramic views require walking up the hill, but there are plenty of benches to rest at and take in the view.</item>

This is the second Peach, as the first was pushed into the lake during the 1990 <hi rend="bold">Peachfest</hi> riot (The riot was an isolated incident, Penticton is really quite safe.)</item>
