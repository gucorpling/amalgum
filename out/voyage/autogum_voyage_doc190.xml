<head>Olango Island</head>

<p><hi rend="bold">Olango Island</hi> is in <ref target="Cebu%20Province">Cebu Province</ref>, just offshore from (east of) Mactan Island and <ref target="Lapu-Lapu">Lapu-Lapu</ref> city. It is known mainly for its wildlife sanctuary but also has some fine beaches and dive sites. The Olango Island Group includes Olango and six smaller islands nearby. The main town and main port is <hi rend="bold">Santa Rosa</hi> on the west coast.</p>

<p>Much of the terrain is mangrove swamp, home to large numbers of birds and also, unfortunately, to many <ref target="mosquitoes">mosquitoes</ref>.</p>

<head>Understand</head>

<p>Olango is fairly densely populated — 30,000 people as of 2010 in about 10 sq km (4 sq miles) — and it is part of <ref target="Metro%20Cebu">Metro Cebu</ref>, the country's second-largest urban region. However, it feels distinctly rural; there are no roads wider than two lanes and many are not paved, there are few buildings higher than two storeys and many one-storey nipa huts, quite a few homes lack running water, and various sorts of livestock run loose.</p>

<p>Despite the rural impression, Olango is probably not a destination for backpackers on a tight budget; the accommodation open to tourists is all resorts. These are not as expensive as resorts in some other areas, but still more than cheap hotels elsewhere.</p>

<p>The island lacks things like shopping malls or even a large market; residents generally go to Lapu-Lapu for those. There are sari-sari shops, fruit stalls and barbecue places, and Santa Rosa has a pharmacy and a small hospital with an ambulance, but facilities are generally quite limited.</p>

<p>Administratively the Olango Group is split like <ref target="Mactan%20Island">Mactan Island</ref> to the west; the larger northern part is included in Lapu-Lapu city while some of the south is in <ref target="C%C3%B3rdova%20%28Cebu%29">Córdova Municipality</ref>.</p>

<head>Get in</head>

<p>There are several ferries, only a few of which carry vehicles. The most-used route is from a pier next to the Hilton Hotel on the Lapu-Lapu side to Santa Rosa on Olango. Officially, it is the Punta Engaño Pier but locals call it the and taxi drivers may know the destination as Movenpick. The resort hotel next to it was Hilton but is now Movenpick. An important pier on Olango island itself is the .</p>

<p>There are also boats from the Hilton pier to <ref target="Getafe%20%28Bohol%29">Getafe</ref> on <ref target="Bohol">Bohol</ref>.</p>

<p>Getting to and from the pier is easiest by taxi, about ₱300 from downtown Cebu. <ref target="Mactan-Cebu%20International%20Airport">Mactan-Cebu International Airport</ref> is located in Lapu-Lapu, not far from the pier; a taxi to or from there is only about ₱30 . There are also <ref target="jeepney">jeepney</ref>s that run between the pier area and the airport or Lapu-Lapu and <ref target="Mandaue">Mandaue</ref> cities.</p>

<p>These boats carry passengers, bicycles, motorcycles and freight, but not cars. They seat about 40 people, have outriggers, and look like the photo. Cost is ₱15 plus a ₱5 terminal fee and the ride takes about 20 minutes. Boats run every half hour or so during daylight hours, but there are fairly often delays while freight is loaded or unloaded. The boats do not run in bad weather and are small enough that those with sensitive stomachs may be uncomfortable with even a mild swell.</p>

<p>Boarding one of these ferries is an interesting experience; the gangplanks are narrow, they move because one end is on the boat, not all have a railing, and on some the railings or even the floor have gaps. However, crew members are very helpful about reaching out with a stabilizing hand where needed, and sometimes two of them will hold up a long bamboo pole to provide a railing. There are porters moving freight on and off the boat; one of them will be happy to handle your luggage for a few pesos.</p>

<p>There are lots of other boats, mostly smaller than the ferries, around the pier. Many offer "island-hopping" trips to some of the smaller islands in the area. Boats direct to resorts on Olango can also be arranged, either by contacting the resort ahead of time or just <ref target="haggling">haggling</ref> with boat men around the pier.</p>

<p>There is occasionally a small RoRo ferry between the Hilton and Santa Rosa piers, mainly carrying freight and trucks loaded with freight.</p>

<head>Get around</head>
<p>The commonest mode of transport on the island is a motorcycle plus sidecar rig known as a <ref target="Philippines%23By_tricycle">pedicab</ref>. These are more expensive on the island than elsewhere; most rides cost ₱120 .</p>

<p>Bringing your own bicycle or motorcycle would be practical; the ferries can carry those, traffic on the island is light, and the main roads are mostly paved though often quite narrow. You need to drive slowly and watch for potholes, wandering animals, and children playing in the street. At night, beware of motorcycles running without lights.</p>

<head>Do</head>
<p>The main dive sites around Olango itself are Mabini Point at the northern tip of the island (be cautious; currents here are tricky), Baring on the northwest side, and Santa Rosa near the middle of the west side.</p>

<p>It is also possible to hire a boat to get to various smaller islands nearby; some of those have good diving.</p>

<p>The Lapu-Lapu city government organizes a tour they call <ref target="http://www.lapulapucity.gov.ph/index.php/home-othermenu-42/59-frontpage/frontpage-links-/191-omg-olango-my-getaway-tour">OMG, Olango my Getaway</ref> at ₱999 a person; it includes transport, some meals, and a night at Triponia Homestay, listed under <ref target="%23Sleep">#Sleep</ref>.</p>

<head>Buy</head>

<p>There are some handicrafts and shells available from street vendors and in shops at the ferry terminals, but this side of tourism is not well developed.</p>
