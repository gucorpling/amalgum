<head>Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport</head>


<p><hi rend="bold"><ref target="http://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/homepage">Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport</ref></hi> ( CDG ) is the main airport of <ref target="Paris">Paris</ref>, one of the busiest hubs in Europe, largest airport in France and home of the national carrier, Air France. It is located north of Paris and is sometimes referred to as <ref target="Roissy">Roissy</ref> Airport. The airport is named after the General Charles de Gaulle, wartime leader of the Free French and later President of France.</p>

<p>It is owned by the Aéroports de Paris group together with <ref target="Paris%20Orly%20Airport">Paris Orly Airport</ref>.</p>

<head>Understand</head>
<p>CDG is amongst the largest airports in the world not only in terms of traffic, but also surface area, and its multiple disjointed terminals and sheer size may be disorienting. While connections to, from, and via CDG are often attractive, one needs to take extra care not to get lost, and plan in extra time to just cover the distances needed to get to or from the gate.</p>

<head>Terminals</head>
<p>CDG has three terminals. The free CDGVal shuttle train runs between terminals, car parks and train stations.</p>


<list type="unordered">
<item> <hi rend="bold">Terminal 1</hi>. The original one, built in the 1970s to serve the intercontinental "jumbo jets" that had just debuted in service. It is notable for its unusual layout and retrofuturistic brutalist design, with a round central section featuring underground travelator connections to seven "satellites" named 1T through 1Z (not used at the airport but used on the guide to talk about the different satellites) to which planes dock via jetways. Nowadays it is used by Star Alliance carriers and some other non-allied airlines. </item>
<item> <hi rend="bold">Terminal 2</hi>. The notoriously confusing gigantic one, consisting of interconnected sections named 2A through 2G. Terminal 2G is a separate building from other "Terminals 2x" and is only reachable via navette/bus in 10-15 min (bus leaves every 20 min) so allow extra time if you travel to/from there. Terminal 2 houses all Air France flights, as well as those of other SkyTeam carriers, with some other airlines' gates spread over the many sections. Notably, Easyjet uses terminal 2D. </item>
<item> <hi rend="bold">Terminal 3</hi>. The low-cost terminal serving low-fare carriers, including Vueling, but <hi rend="bold">not Easyjet</hi>, which has gates in 2D. The CDGVal station shared with Roissypôle requires a walk from the CDGVal station to its entrance, and has limited facilities.</item>
</list>


<head>Gare Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV</head>
<p>This is the TGV train station in the middle of the airport's Terminal 2 (between sections 2C/D and 2E/F of the Terminal), where both national and international TGV trains stop. Both the RER B train and CDGVal stop here (both stations shared with Terminal 2). </p>

<head>Roissypôle</head>
<p>The area consisting of hotels and other services situated between the Northern side (Terminal 1 and 3) and Southern side (Terminal 2) of the airport. It has a CDGVal stop shared with Terminal 3, and also has the second of the 2 RER B stops, closer on the way to Paris. </p>

<head>Destinations</head>
<p>A list of destinations is available on Paris Aéroport's website: https://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/passengers/flights/destinations/destinations-directory</p>

<head>By train to Paris</head>
<p>The RER train line "B" connects CDG airport to central Paris and is the fastest and most economical option for most travelers. The airport has stations in T3 (where you can take the free CDGVAL shuttle train to T1) and T2. Trains to Paris leave every 8 minutes and all stop at Gare du Nord (TGVs to Lille, Eurostar trains to the UK and Thalys trains to Belgium and Holland), Châtelet-Les Halles, Saint-Michel Notre-Dame, Luxembourg, Port-Royal, Denfert-Rochereau and Cité Universitaire. Adult tickets cost €10.3, and for children between 4-9 the fare is €7 each. You can also purchase daily pass for all trains inside Paris for zones 1 to 5 for €17.6, which makes it a better and cheaper option if you're making a round trip.</p>

<p>Tickets are valid for connecting travel to any metro or RER station within Paris. The train takes around 35 minutes to Gare du Nord and 45 minutes to Denfert-Rochereau, making this the fastest way to get to the city. Tickets can be purchased either through green (sometimes blue) automated ticket vending machines ("Billetterie Île-de-France") or through the ticket office serviced by transit authority personnel.</p>

<p>The automated ticket machines accept euro coins of €2, €1 and 50, 20, 10, 5 cent denominations and give change. 'Chip &amp; PIN' credit card (typical in Europe and elsewhere) payment is OK on these machines, but cards from the US (or in general have only a magnetic strip or 'chip &amp; signature'), you most likely will not be able to use your card. In the airport stations there are separate automated machines which change €20, €10 and €5 notes to €2 and €1 coins. However, due to the high demand, the machines frequently run out of coins. The currency exchanges explicitly state notes will not be changed for coins. Because of these limitations, purchasing tickets from the ticket office may be your only option. Although there are many counters, the queues can be very long.</p>

<p>Trains for Paris leave from platforms 11 and 12. Look for signs saying "RER B" or "All trains go to Paris". When using the ticket from and to the airport (as with tickets for the RER commuter trains in general) you have to use it to enter <hi rend="bold">and</hi> to exit the quay areas. Always keep the ticket handy as the SNCF officials sometimes check for tickets, and if you are without one you may be fined €40. This means that after you put the ticket into the entry gate and are cleared to pass, you must retrieve the ticket from the machine and keep it with you until you leave the train system including any connections.</p>

<p>During off-peak hours and on the weekends, if you're not in a hurry, avoid the trains from the airport heading to Saint Rémy lès Chevreuse: they will stop at all stations between the airport and Paris. Instead, wait a few minutes for a train heading to Massy-Palaiseau, it will be non-stop between the airport and Paris Gare du Nord (but won't overtake the omnibus train). If you're going to the airport, look on the information displays on the platforms: if the next train to Aéroport Charles de Gaulle stops at a dozen of stations, the next one should go to Mitry Claye (don't take that one), and then the following one will be non-stop from Paris Gare du Nord to the airport. But remember, this is only during off-peak hours, as well as all day on the weekends.</p>
