<head>Understand</head>
<p>Fort Worth grew from a military camp established at the close of the Mexican War by Gen. Winfield Scott, and named for Gen. William Jenkins Worth who fought in the war. Forty-two men of Company F, 2nd Dragoons, established the camp on June 6, 1849. The Fort Worth to Yuma, Arizona, stage line was established in 1850. The city became the seat of Tarrant County 1860, and after the Civil War, it became a major shipping and supply depot for cattlemen.</p>

<head>Climate</head>
<p>Fort Worth is located in the American South, and has a subtropical climate with mild winters, hot summers, and a wet spring and fall in between. In winter and summer it can also be a very dry place, as it receives warmer, drier weather from the Mojave Desert in the west and the Great Plains in the north.</p>

<p>Winters are generally mild, with average highs in the mid to upper 50s (10-15 °C) and average lows around the freezing mark (0-5 °C). It is not uncommon for Winter days with highs in the upper 60s (~20°C) with the following days high temperature 20-30 degrees cooler. It may snow in Fort Worth a couple times a year, and occasionally winter temperatures will not get above freezing (32°F, 0 °C), but for the most part winter is just relatively dry and cool. There is, however, the danger of freezing rain and ice storms.</p>

<p>Spring and fall bring very pleasant temperatures, but spring is also known for its storms. Fort Worth is at the Southern tip of Tornado Alley, and springtime weather can be quite volatile and severe storms often occur. Summers are hot and dry - but often humid - with temperatures frequently surpassing 100 °F (38 °C).</p>

<p>Average precipitation in Fort Worth is 33 inches (830 mm) per year.</p>
