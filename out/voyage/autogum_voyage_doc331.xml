<head>Understand</head>
<p>This is the least populated and least visited region of Bali. It is dominated by the <ref target="West%20Bali%20National%20Park">West Bali National Park</ref> and a huge area of protected reserve, much of which is completely uninhabited. Both the north and south coasts of this region offer quiet beaches but of a very different nature. Those in the north fringe calm seas which are excellent for diving and snorkelling. The southern beaches are wilder and include a number of renowned surfing spots. The town of <ref target="Gilimanuk">Gilimanuk</ref> on the very westernmost tip of Bali is the departure point for ferries to <ref target="Java">Java</ref>.</p>

<head>By car</head>
<p>Two major roads lead into West Bali, one on the north coast and one on the south coast.</p>

<p>The northern route links <ref target="Lovina">Lovina</ref> and <ref target="Singaraja">Singaraja</ref> in <ref target="North%20Bali">North Bali</ref> to <ref target="Pemuteran">Pemuteran</ref>. This is a relatively quiet road which offers some great scenery and attractions en-route and visitors are advised to take it slowly.</p>

<p>Much busier is the southern route as this carries the bulk of the commercial traffic to and from <ref target="Java">Java</ref>. This road links <ref target="South%20Bali">South Bali</ref> to <ref target="Tabanan">Tabanan</ref> in <ref target="Central%20Bali">Central Bali</ref> and then to the western region towns of <ref target="Negara">Negara</ref> and <ref target="Gilimanuk">Gilimanuk</ref>. A car journey from <ref target="South%20Bali">South Bali</ref> all the way to <ref target="Gilimanuk">Gilimanuk</ref> will take upwards of 3 hours.</p>

<head>By bus</head>
<p>Scheduled shuttle buses run from many of Bali's main visitor centres to <ref target="Gilimanuk">Gilimanuk</ref> and these are widely advertised in towns such as <ref target="Kuta">Kuta</ref>, <ref target="Lovina">Lovina</ref>, <ref target="Sanur">Sanur</ref> and <ref target="Ubud">Ubud</ref>. Check locally and book one day in advance.</p>

<p>Bemos servicing <ref target="Negara">Negara</ref>, <ref target="Gilimanuk">Gilimanuk</ref> and other parts of the south coast leave from Ubung terminal in <ref target="Denpasar">Denpasar</ref> and Pesiapan terminal in <ref target="Tabanan">Tabanan</ref>.</p>

<head>By boat</head>
<p>Ferries run from Ketapang ferry terminal, <ref target="Banyuwangi">Banyuwangi</ref>, <ref target="East%20Java">East Java</ref> to <ref target="Gilimanuk">Gilimanuk</ref> every 30 minutes, 24 hours a day. The journey itself takes about 45 minutes but loading and unloading may extend that time considerably. Since Bali has been the subject of terrorist interest from <ref target="Java">Java</ref> security has tightened enormously - be prepared for delays.</p>

<head>Get around</head>
<p>This remote region of Bali lends itself to getting around by hire car or motorcycle. Cars for rent are not all common here so best to bring it in with you from one of the main tourist destinations. You will find motorbikes easier to come by, especially in the beach communities of <ref target="Pemuteran">Pemuteran</ref> and <ref target="Medewi%20Beach">Medewi Beach</ref>.</p>
