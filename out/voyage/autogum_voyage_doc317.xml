<head>Sharjah</head>


<p><hi rend="bold"><ref target="http://www.sharjahtourism.ae">Sharjah</ref></hi>(Arabic: الشارقة) is the third largest city in the <ref target="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</ref> and the capital of <ref target="Sharjah%20%28emirate%29">Sharjah emirate</ref>. Sharjah is known for its Arabic and Islamic architecture as well as its libraries, Islamic museums, and cultural centers. The city is known as the cultural and literature hub of the United Arab Emirates. The city is rooted in its Arabic and Islamic heritage with many Ummayyad and Abbasid-styled buildings and offers a glimpse of Arabic and Islamic environment in an otherwise largely westernized country. It is a major hub for family friendly environment and activities and has a more conservative atmosphere. The city has many green parks, apartment complexes, and a large community of Arabs from all the Arab world making the city an effective cultural meeting point for many different communities of Arabs.</p>

<p>In contrast to <ref target="Abu%20Dhabi">Abu Dhabi</ref> and <ref target="Dubai">Dubai</ref>, Sharjah offers visitors a vastly larger view into Arabic and Islamic art, literature, and architecture. Its a usual destination for visitors who are looking for a cultural and a more local experience of Arabia and Islamic atmosphere compared to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</p>

<head>Understand</head>
<p>Sharjah is very closely connected to <ref target="Dubai">Dubai</ref> through the Dubai-Sharjah-Ajman metropolitan area, with commuter traffic creating rush hour traffic jams. Many people live in Sharjah but work in Dubai, hence traffic from Sharjah to Dubai and Dubai to Sharjah is largely expected in rush hours.</p>

<p>The emirate is considerably larger than Dubai, with coastline on both west and east coasts of the peninsula, and with exclaves of Kalba, Khor Fakkan, and Dibba Al Hisn. The road to the east coast goes through rugged Al Hajar mountains. Public buildings in the Emirate are all in Umayyad and Abbasid architecture, and were all designed by the present Shaikh (a qualified architect). Therefore the city offers a nice visual change and a more cultural atmosphere from the usual fare of skyscrapers in other Emirates.</p>

<p>The <ref target="http://www.sharjah-welcome.com/en/home">Sharjah Commerce and Tourism website</ref> has sections on business, heritage, leisure, education, and coast.</p>

<head>Talk</head>
<p>As in the rest of the UAE, Arabic is the official language, although most residents speak other languages - particularly Hindi, Urdu and Tagalog. English is widely spoken in shops, souqs, and hotels.</p>
