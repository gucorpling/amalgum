<p>Benn's speech argued that the phrase 'war on terror' should be deprecated because it can't be won by military means alone as well as indicating that the 'war-on-terror' concept may have actually assisted terrorist groups by giving them a sense of belonging.</p>

<p>Six ministers in radical cleric <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muqtada%20al-Sadr">Muqtada al-Sadr</ref>'s <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadrist%20Movement">Sadrist Movement</ref> have resigned from the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iraq">Iraqi</ref> government, because <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime%20Minister%20of%20Iraq">Prime Minister</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri%20al-Maliki">Nouri al-Maliki</ref> did not push for a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country.</p>
<p>At a press conference, the head of Sadr's parliamentary bloc Nassar Rubaie, read a statement from al-Sadr:
"Considering the public interest, we found that it was necessary to issue an order to the ministers of the Sadr bloc to immediately withdraw from the Iraqi government,"
The statement continued, "The six ministries shall be handed over to the government itself, hoping that this government would give these responsibilities to independent bodies who wish to serve the interests of the people and the country."</p>
<p>Al-Maliki was happy the Sadrists respected the political process. The move could have threatened to topple his government, but so far the Sadrist Movement is still part of the ruling coalition.</p>
