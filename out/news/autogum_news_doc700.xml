<p>A team of researchers from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University%20of%20Tennessee">University of Tennessee</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Knoxville">Knoxville</ref>, has confirmed that <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/near-Earth%20asteroid">near-Earth asteroid</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(29075)%201950%20DA">(29075) 1950 DA</ref> is primarily held together by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/van%20der%20Waals%20forces">van der Waals forces</ref> rather than gravity. They have shown that the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation%20period">rotation rate</ref> of the 1.1 km asteroid is higher than could be possible if only <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gravity">gravity</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friction">friction</ref> were responsible for holding it together. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesive%20forces">Cohesive forces</ref> prevent large scale <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shedding">shedding</ref> of material and breakup of the asteroid. Their study was published Wednesday in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature%20(journal)">Nature</ref>.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the bulk <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/density">density</ref> 1.7±0.7 g/cm³ of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asteroid">asteroid</ref> is approximately two times lower than the value required for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-gravitation">self-gravity</ref> to balance out the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal%20force">centrifugal forces</ref> caused by rotation. As Ben Rozitis, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/planetary%20scientist">planetary scientist</ref> and a co-author of the study, told <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space.com">Space.com</ref>: "I was expecting to find a high-density metallic asteroid, as such an asteroid wouldn't require cohesive forces to hold itself together under its fast rotation. Instead we found the opposite! [...] We knew from previous work that this asteroid was rotating faster than it should be, and we wanted to know why".</p>
<p>Spectral observations of 1950DA indicated that it is either an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-type%20asteroid">E-</ref> or <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-type%20asteroid">M-type</ref> asteroid in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tholen%20classification">Tholen classification</ref>. However, its low <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optical%20albedo">optical albedo</ref> and low <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radar">radar</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circular%20polarization">circular polarization</ref> ratio (a very smooth surface at centimetre to decimetre scales) showed that it cannot be an E-type asteroid.</p>
<p>Unusually for an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-type%20asteroid">M-type asteroid</ref> (which are mostly <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metallic">metallic</ref>), 1950DA has low <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radar">radar</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albedo">albedo</ref>. It would have been puzzling, if it was not for the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Rosetta_(spacecraft)">Rosetta</ref> observations of 21 Lutetia, which is also an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-type%20asteroid">M-type asteroid</ref> with very similar low <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radar">radar</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albedo">albedo</ref>. Researchers have used for 1950DA the same meteorite analogue which was earlier found to fit best 21 Lutetia: <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enstatite%20chondrite">enstatite chondrite</ref> with grain density of 3.55 g/cm³. It allowed to calculate macro-porosity of 51±19%, indicating that 1950DA is a rubble-pile asteroid.</p>
<p>Taking into account <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography">thermal-infrared</ref> measurements of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thermal%20inertia">thermal inertia</ref>, presence of a fine-grained <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lunar%20regolith">regolith</ref> is implied, primarily around 1950DA's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equator">equator</ref>. Negative <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ambient%20gravity">ambient gravity</ref> near the equator of the asteroid (48±24% of its surface) requires existence of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cohesive%20forces">cohesive forces</ref> to prevent loss of material. This is similar to an effect noticed between the fine <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain%20size">grains</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regolith">regolith</ref> on the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Moon">Moon</ref>. Lunar regolith was found to be highly cohesive because of van der Waals forces between grains by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo%2017">Apollo 17</ref> expedition in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974">1974</ref>.</p>
<p>As Ben Rozitis explained: "We found a low-density rubble pile that traditionally would be unable to hold itself together unless cohesive forces were present. It's exciting because we've provided the first evidence that cohesive forces are important for small asteroids, which had only been predicted up until now."</p>
<p>The balance between <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion%20(geology)">cohesion</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negative%20gravity">negative gravity</ref> requires small grain sizes consistent with the grain size distribution on 1950DA, and similar to that of another rubble-pile asteroid, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(25143)%20Itokawa">(25143) Itokawa</ref>. Unlike Itokawa, 1950DA does not have large <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boulder">boulder</ref>s on the surface; they may have been lost as 1950DA's rotation accelerated due to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YORP%20effect">YORP effect</ref>. This effect results in a change of the rotation rate of an asteroid (either faster or slower), and is caused when the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">Sun</ref> heats up an object unevenly, due to asymmetric surface <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/topography">topography</ref>. As the heat escapes, the rotation rate is slowly changed due to an uneven rate of cooling. The researchers find that a rubble-pile asteroid may have a high rotation rate, if it is held together by cohesive forces between the grains. But as the spin rate increases due to YORP effect, the centrifugal force may cause the rubble pile to eventually separate as it happened with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main-belt_comet#P/2013_R3">P/2013 R3</ref>.</p>
<p>The findings may have implications for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asteroid%20impact%20avoidance">asteroid impact avoidance</ref>. A very small impulse may break one <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/potentially%20hazardous%20object">potentially hazardous object</ref> into several pieces. As Ben Rozitis said: "You'd want to avoid interacting with the asteroid directly. An alternative is to use a 'gravity tractor,' or a heavy spacecraft placed near the asteroid, which uses the force of gravity to pull the asteroid off course". Bong Wie, an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aerospace%20engineer">aerospace engineer</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa%20State%20University">Iowa State University</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames">Ames</ref>, noted: "I just hope that an asteroid on a collision course with Earth will not be spinning rapidly and it will not be a rubble-pile asteroid".</p>
<p>According to Daniel Scheeres, an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aerospace%20engineer">aerospace engineer</ref> at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University%20of%20Colorado">University of Colorado</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder">Boulder</ref>, understanding such cohesive forces may also be important for future <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asteroid%20mining">asteroid mining</ref>. Ben Rozitis clarified: "Mining missions intend to visit small asteroids about 10 meters (33 feet) or less in size, as it is thought that they are predominantly solid bodies. However, cohesive forces enable such small asteroids to be rubble piles instead. A small rubble-pile asteroid would be harder to interact with and collect, as it can easily deform or break up when subject to external forces."</p>
<p>The study was supported by <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NASA">NASA</ref>.</p>
