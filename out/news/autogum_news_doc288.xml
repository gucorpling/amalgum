<p>A <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">British</ref> police officer has been banned from driving after drinking over the limit of alcohol. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable#United_Kingdom_and_the_Commonwealth">PC</ref> Andy Walker, 51, drank a glass of wine and two glasses of beer at a "family party". When a police officer stopped his car to investigate, after Walker was having trouble parking his car Sunday morning, he found that his fellow officer's blood alcohol level was 61 micrograms, while the limit is 35 micrograms. At a court hearing today, Walker admitted the charges and has been since banned from driving for 16 months.</p>
<p>"I made a monumental mistake in my judgement when I decided I was fit enough to drive," Walker admitted.</p>
<p>Walker has been active in many anti-drinking-and-driving campaigns throughout the years.</p>
