<head>Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to release "Memoirs: 1939-1993"</head><p><hi rend="bold">Saturday, September 8, 2007</hi></p>
<p>On Sunday <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs:%201939-1993">Memoirs: 1939-1993</ref> a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memoir">memoir</ref> written by former <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister of Canada</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%20Mulroney">Brian Mulroney</ref> will be released.  The 1,152 page tome outlines Mulroney's version of events during his time as prime minister.</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV">CTV</ref> will broadcast a documentary on Brian Mulroney on the eve of his book launch.  In addition, the network plans to air <hi rend="italic">Triumph &amp; Treachery: The Brian Mulroney Story</hi> on Sunday, CTV says the 90-minute special will be the most complete interview the former prime minister has ever given and his first comprehensive interview since leaving office in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993">1993</ref>.The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec">Quebec</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French%20language">French language</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVA%20(TV%20network)">TVA</ref> network will air a similar documentary exclusively in French later that night.</p>
<p>Mulroney allocates a fair amount of text commenting on his antogonist the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death">late</ref> and former Prime Minister <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre%20Elliot%20Trudeau">Pierre Elliot Trudeau</ref>.  Mulroney believes that Trudeau lacked the moral fibre to be Prime Minister for not serving in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian%20Forces">Canadian Forces</ref> during <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%20War%20II">World War II</ref>.  </p>
“
Pierre Trudeau was not among them. That's a decision he made. He's entitled to make that kind of decision. But it doesn't qualify him for any position of moral leadership in our society.
”
— Mulroney
<p>Mulroney insinuates that the young Trudeau had <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</ref> beliefs at that time , "This is a man who questioned the Allies when the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew">Jews</ref> were being sacrificed and when the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Holocaust">great extermination program</ref> was on, he was marching around <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outremont%20(borough)">Outremont, Quebec</ref> on the other side of the issue."</p>
<p>Mulroney also blames Trudeau for scuttling the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meech%20Lake%20Accord">Meech Lake Accord</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990">1990</ref> pact aimed at securing <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec">Quebec</ref>'s signature on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution%20of%20Canada">Constitution of Canada</ref>.</p>
<p>The current Prime Minister <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen%20Harper">Stephen Harper</ref> supported Mulroney's right to comment on Trudeau, "I think it's well known Mr. Mulroney was an opponent of Mr. Trudeau," Harper said. "He was his opposition leader and, as you know, came to power at the end of the Trudeau period when people wanted to make a change. I'll leave it to people who were there then to fight those battles. I think it's perfectly reasonable that they would comment. I think these are debates that are best left to some of the people who were around then and academics."</p>
<p>Trudeau's former piers and friends have rallied behind his legacy and made public comments to dampen Mulroney's accusations.</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephane%20Dion">Stephane Dion</ref> responded to Mulroney critiques with a five paragraph statement posted on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal Party</ref> website, "It is regrettable that, after attending <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death%20and%20state%20funeral%20of%20Pierre%20Trudeau">prime minister Trudeau’s state funeral</ref> and praising him as 'an exceptional individual who served his country effectively and well … a gallant political warrior who loved his country,' Mr. Mulroney would seem to be at such odds with his own views."</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%20Axworthy">Tom Axworthy</ref>'s, response to Mulroney was that Trudeau should be judged by his actions once his values matured and he entered public life, not by "ridiculous" thoughts he entertained briefly in his teens and early twenties.</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20R.%20English">John R. English</ref> stated, Trudeau's youthful views must be put in the context of the times, when most Quebecers were so virulently anti-British and opposed to what they saw as a British war that they were blinded to the evils of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler's</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism">Nazism</ref>.</p>
