<p>The Surf Championship Competition, "Ceremonial Quiksilver Pichilemu 2010", took place on Wednesday in the Chilean city nicknamed "Capital of the Surf", <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Pichilemu">Pichilemu</ref>. Waves nine meters high or larger were predicted in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta%20de%20Lobos">Punta de Lobos</ref>, sixkilometers from the urban centre of Pichilemu.</p>
<p>Some of the most important surfers were in the championship, the South African Grant "Twiggy" Baker, Hawaiians Jamie Sterling and Mark Healey, as well as the Chilean Ramón Navarro, who won the Master Drop award last December, the 10-meters "hellish wave" in Hawaii. The weather conditions in Pichilemu have been fine recently and the tides are optimum.</p>
<p>"This Championship will be one of the best in the big waves circuit. We will see huge waves, like the ones that made Diego Medina [another Chilean competitor] to win Billabong XXL [...] Many of the surfers there have never seen waves like the ones of this 2010 Championship [...] I'm prepared and anxious," said Ramón Navarro to <hi rend="italic">La Nación</hi>, some minutes before the competition started.</p>
<p>The competitors accorded to donate <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US$">US$</ref>15,000 (almost 16 million pesos) to help people affected in the Pichilemu area after the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2010_Chile_earthquake">February 27 earthquake</ref>.
