<p>Pop culture event <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Toronto">Toronto</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto%20ComiCon">ComiCon</ref> continued to grow this year, the sixth year since its restructuring as a three day program. Beginning on Friday evening, it continued through to Sunday. Organized by the same company as <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Fan_Expo_Canada">Fan Expo Canada</ref>, the event offered exhibitors, retailers, an artist's alley, and panels.</p>
<p>Cast members from <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canada">Canadian</ref> teen show <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrassi%20Junior%20High">Degrassi Junior High</ref></hi> were among the featured guests at the convention. While the current series in the franchise, best known as <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrassi:%20The%20Next%20Generation">Degrassi: The Next Generation</ref></hi>, has spawned Broadway star <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake%20Epstein">Jake Epstein</ref>, rapper <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake%20(musician)">Drake</ref>, and others, the earlier show including <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacie%20Mistysyn">Stacie Mistysyn</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%20Brogren">Stefan Brogren</ref> remains popular, particularly in Canada. Brogren told industry publication <hi rend="italic">Kidscreen</hi>: "A part of me thought we would do it for five years and maybe get recognized for a couple of years afterwards and then that would be it. I had no idea it would turn out to be such an important thing in so many peopleʼs lives and not just in Canada, but around the world."</p>
<p>The current program is now distributed by Netflix, and Brogen remains a cast member as school principal, in addition to being a producer and director.</p>
<p>It was the first time the cast did a convention event. The cast also plan to tour to other conventions in Canada this year.</p>
<p>Also appearing were <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20Picardo">Robert Picardo</ref>, the holographic doctor on <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%20Trek:%20Voyager">Star Trek: Voyager</ref></hi>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray%20Park">Ray Park</ref>, Darth Maul in <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%20Wars:%20The%20Phantom%20Menace">Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</ref></hi>.</p>
<p>Panels at the convention focused on topics like steampunk costuming, wig styling, recently rebooted comic <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain%20Canuck">Captain Canuck</ref></hi>, toy collecting, and the history of comic books in Canada over the decades, in conjunction with Canada's sesquicentennial year. Cast members from <hi rend="italic">The Sean Ward Show</hi> appeared at the event, meeting guests to the convention and hosting a panel about the superhero comedy YouTube channel which has more than 600 million views.</p>

<p>As per usual, many attendees showed off costumes based on their favourite video games, comic books, television series, movies, and other pop culture creations. Characters ranged from one woman's interpretation of Roadhog from the current <hi rend="italic">Overwatch</hi> video game, to retro revivals like the titular character from three-decade-old series <hi rend="italic">Alf</hi>. Wikinews' Nick Moreau was at the event Saturday to photograph.</p>
<p>Many cosplayers at the event gave their own personal twists to recognizable characters. Two takes on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%20Princess">Disney Princesses</ref>, for example: one group turned Moana, Cinderella, Mulan and Snow White into lightsaber-wielding <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi">Jedi</ref>, while another woman touring the con floor was dressed in preparation for a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boudoir">boudoir</ref> photo shoot later that day. Other twists included a Wookie version of Winnie the Pooh, sophisticated armour based on Pokemon characters, and a Stormtrooper from <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Planet of the Apes</ref></hi>.</p>
