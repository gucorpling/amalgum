<p>Violence, ballot stuffing and a shortage of voting slips marred Saturday's presidential polls in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nigeria">Nigeria</ref>. Sixteen people were reported killed and an attempt to blow up the election headquarters failed. </p>
<p>The chief of the largest local monitoring group, Transition Monitoring Group, said that a winner could not be announced on the basis of the poll conducted. </p>
<p>President <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olusegun%20Obasanjo">Olusegun Obasanjo</ref> said that despite flaws, the elections could achieve a peaceful and democratic transfer of power. Such a result would be the first time power changes from one civilian administration to another since Nigeria's independence in 1960. </p>
<p>Opposition leader <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammadu%20Buhari">Muhammadu Buhari</ref> said he would call his supporters on to the streets if the ruling People's Democratic Party's candidate to succeed Obasanjo, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umaru%20Yar'Adua">Umaru Yar'Adua</ref>, is announced the winner. </p>
<p>The Nigerian supreme court ordered that Vice-President <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiku%20Abubakar">Atiku Abubakar</ref>'s name be included in the ballot five days before elections, contributing to logistical difficulties. </p>
<p>Early results are showing a victory for Yar'Adua.</p>

<p>Former <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime%20Minister%20of%20Bangladesh">Prime Minister of Bangladesh</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh%20Hasina">Sheikh Hasina</ref> has been prevented from boarding a flight to her home country by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British%20Airways">British Airways</ref>.

<p>Meanwhile, fellow former Prime Minister <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda%20Zia">Khaleda Zia</ref>, who had been fighting to stay in the country to face any charges that might result from a recent crackdown on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption">corruption</ref>, has now given in to pressure from the government to go into <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile">exile</ref>.

<p>Hasina and Zia are bitter rivals and had been considered the top candidates in January elections that were called off. International observers have blamed many of the problems facing Bangladesh on the two former prime ministers.</p>
