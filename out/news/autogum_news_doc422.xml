<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Newt_Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</ref> refutes claims by his second wife, Marianne Ginther, that he demanded that they have an open marriage so that he could continue an affair with Callista Bisek, who later became his third wife.</p>
<p>The accusations, aired on ABC News on Thursday, come just before the Republican party's <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/South_Carolina">South Carolina</ref> presidential primary. If true, the allegations would mean Gingrich was having an affair whilst pillorying President <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton">Bill Clinton</ref> over his involvement with Monica Lewinsky.</p>

<head id="Dolce_&amp;_Gabbana_make_apology_over_Hong_Kong_photography_ban">Dolce &amp; Gabbana make apology over Hong Kong photography ban</head>
<p>Italian luxury goods brand <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolce%20&amp;%20Gabbana">Dolce &amp; Gabbana</ref> has issued an apology over its ban on Hong Kong citizens taking photographs of its shopfront in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong Kong</ref>, even when taken from a public sidewalk. The ban enforced by its security guards against locals but not mainland Chinese and foreigners infuriated locals, who have staged a number of protests against the retailer.</p>
<p>Photography from a public place of subjects normally visible from that place is legal in Hong Kong, and the local government has been condemned for not confronting Dolce &amp; Gabbana, leaving things to protesters to bring about the apology.</p>
