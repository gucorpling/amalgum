<head id="Stephen_Hawking_goes_weightless">Stephen Hawking goes weightless</head>
<p>65-year-old scientist <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</ref> took a ride on the "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit%20Comet">Vomit Comet</ref>", an airplane producing weightlessness by following a parabolic flight path. He did this to show awareness for space exploration. The flight took off and landed at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Florida">Florida</ref>.</p>
<p>Hawking, who is confined to a wheelchair due to a degenerative disease, was unstrapped from it while the plane made eight free-fall maneuvers that simulate zero-gravity to those on-board. Hawking told reporters he enjoyed the zero-gravity part of his flight and other people with him said he "didn't want to come back".</p>
<p>Hawking made the flight to draw attention to the importance of space exploration. "I believe the human race has no future if it doesn't go into space," he said.</p>

<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">Saudi</ref> police have arrested 172 militants planning to attack Saudi Arabia's oil fields. They also planned to free inmates and use an aircraft.</p>
<p>"They had the personnel, the money, the arms. Almost all the elements for terror attacks were complete except for setting the zero hour for the attacks," said Brig. Mansour al-Turki, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior%20minister">Ministry of Interior</ref> spokesperson. "They had reached an advanced stage of readiness and what remained only was to set the zero hour for their attacks."</p>

<head id="Abdullah_Gül_does_not_get_presidency_in_first_round">Abdullah Gül does not get presidency in first round</head>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Turkey">Turkey</ref>'s Foreign Minister <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah%20Gül">Abdullah Gül</ref> failed the first round of voting in parliament on Friday. He received 357 votes; 367 votes are required to win. Opposition parties asked the Constitutional Court to stop the voting. If the Constitutional Court rules in favor, a general election could be called.</p>
<p>A second round will be on May 2. If Gül doesn't pick up the additional ten votes then, the process will move on to a third and if necessary a fourth round. During those rounds, only a simple majority is needed so Gül seems assured of getting the presidency.</p>

<head id="Chinese_cat_reportedly_gives_birth_to_'poodle'">Chinese cat reportedly gives birth to 'poodle'</head>
<p>A <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat">cat</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou,%20China">Zhengzhou</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">China</ref> gave birth to four kittens of which one reportedly looks like a white <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poodle">poodle</ref>, says owner Zhang Qiming. People from around the city are making visits to the house where the cat gave birth.</p>
<p>"It looks very different from the other kittens, and its mouth, nose and paws are all dog-like," said owner Zhang Qiming. "Also, its tail is one centimetre shorter than that of the other three kittens."</p>
<p>There appears to be no proof other than the owner's statements that "kitten" is a dog or that the cat in fact gave birth to it.</p>
