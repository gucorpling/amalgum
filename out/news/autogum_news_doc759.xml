<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Diego Grez</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Where are you living right now?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">Juana Bustamante</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> We are living in tents that the military gave to us. There are 22 families here [over the court], and over there by the plum trees there are another 22, in addition to the ones that are living in the school, and some that live [over there] on the other side.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">DG</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">In total, how many families do you think there are [who have lost their home]?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JB</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> There are apparently around 365 families. All of us are homeless.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">DG</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is going to happen to the apartments?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JB</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> I'm not sure. It's such a shame. Imagine the pain of seeing your home completely destroyed and having to live in the court. It's terrible. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">DG</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Has the Mayor, Mr. Héctor Valenzuela helped you?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JB</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> No, he hasn't helped us. He knows that tons of mice are coming out from sewers over there. A few days ago, someone told him that mice were coming out of the sewers. He laughed and said: "I'll see later what I can do." Can you see how the water has expanded throughout the entire street? Valenzuela said that the departments have to be demolished before they can give us provisory homes (<hi rend="italic">mediaguas</hi>).</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">DG</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Thanks for your time and I hope you can get your home back soon.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">JB</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> Thank you for this interview to let the world know what's happening to the common people, to the poor people. Thanks again.</p>
