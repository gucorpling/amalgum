<head id="US:_Former_FBI_agent_missing_in_Iran">US: Former FBI agent missing in Iran</head>
<p>On Monday, the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref> said it sent an official inquiry to Iran via Swiss diplomats about a former <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</ref> agent who went missing while in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iran">Iran</ref> on private business. He is believed to have gone missing several weeks ago on the island of Kish. The FBI say he has not worked for them in a decade nor is he a contractor for them. A US <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</ref> spokesperson declined to give name, age or occupation of the missing man. The spokesperson also said that they have no indication that he is being held by any Iranian entity.</p>

In what has been called the "biggest military hack of all time," McKinnon allegedly used the code-name <hi rend="italic">Solo</hi> as he hacked into 97 computers and caused $700,000 worth of damage according to US prosecutors.

<head id="US_Supreme_Court_rules_against_EPA_on_carbon_dioxide_regulation">US Supreme Court rules against EPA on carbon dioxide regulation</head>
<p>The <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">US</ref> Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that carbon dioxide should be regulated by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</ref> (EPA). The majority opinion said that the EPA had offered "no reasoned explanation" for refusing to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from cars. Previously the EPA had argued that the 1970 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean%20Air%20Act">Clean Air Act</ref> did not give it the powers to regulate green house gases because they were not deemed to be pollutants. Twelve states and several environmental groups jointly brought the case against the EPA, contending that it was failing in its legal duty to regulate environmental pollution by not regulating green house gas emissions.</p>
