<p>Secretary of State, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice">Condoleezza Rice</ref> is due at a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</ref> Security Council meeting to help bring an end to the Israeli <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008–2009_Israel–Gaza_conflict">assault</ref>. <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref> Government officials say that they would like an immediate and stable ceasefire.</p>
<p>"We would like an immediate ceasefire, absolutely... An immediate ceasefire that is durable, sustainable and not time-limited," said Assistant Secretary of State <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean%20McCormack">Sean McCormack</ref>.</p>
<p>The <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israel">Israeli</ref> Government, however, does not find the "international pressure" high enough to call a ceasefire. Reports also say that <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/European_Union">European Union</ref> has given a tacit green light to the Israeli assault, because they failed to come against it.</p>
<p>As of today, the total death toll has increased to 600 <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Palestine">Palestinians</ref> (100 of which are civilians), and 2,700 are wounded.</p>

<p>It has been six days since <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</ref> halted the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural%20gas">natural gas</ref> flow to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ukraine">Ukraine</ref>, and therefore to subsequent countries such as <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bulgaria">Bulgaria</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Austria">Austria</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Turkey">Turkey</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Poland">Poland</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Romania">Romania</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hungary">Hungary</ref>. The Russian natural gas pipeline is the primary source of natural gas for some countries such as Ukraine, Austria and Turkey.</p>
<p>Ukraine is currently in negotiations with Russia in order to restart the gas flow, however Russia has increased the prices from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20dollar">US$</ref>179.50 per 1,000 cubic meters to $250 per 1,000 cubic meters for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Austrian Government officials are planning a meeting due to the 90% decrease in natural gas flow coming from Russia. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMV">OMV AG</ref> reports that Austria has a three-month natural gas reserve which would allow them to get by the winter of 2009. Currently, 51% of Austria's natural gas comes from Russia and only 18% of their natural gas is produced locally.</p>
<p>The Turkish Government says that Turkey is more time-limited in this crisis, since they only have 5 days of natural gas reserve left. However in this situation, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iran">Iran</ref> has stated that they will increase gas flow to Turkey.</p>
