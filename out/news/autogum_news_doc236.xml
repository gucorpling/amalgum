<figure rend="StipeMesic1.jpg"></figure>Outgoing <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Croatia">Croatian</ref> president <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stjepan%20Mesić">Stjepan Mesić</ref> pardoned 36-year-old Siniša Rimac, a convicted war criminal, jailed for eight years for participating in executions of Serb civilians back in 1991, when Croatia was at war with Serb forces. Among other crimes, he is guilty of killing a 12-year old girl. At that time he was part of a military unit led by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomislav%20Merčep">Tomislav Merčep</ref>, who was never prosecuted.
<p>Rimac's jail term was shortened by one year, following president Mesić's decision.</p>
<p>Serbian president <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris%20Tadić">Boris Tadić</ref> described the act as "anti-european" and "anti-civilisational" that cannot be justified.</p>

<p>Mohamed Kohail, a Canadian resident convicted after a deadly school fight in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah">Jeddah</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</ref> will not be executed as originally sentenced. The country's highest court, the Supreme Council, cancelled the death sentence but ordered that Kohail face retrial in the case. The Canadian <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20International%20Trade">Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade</ref> confirmed this development on Saturday.</p>
<p>Kohail's younger brother Sultan is also charged in this case and could also be sentenced to death as his case was moved from the youth court to the adult system. Both brothers deny that they had caused the death of Munzer Haraki during the 2007 brawl.</p>
