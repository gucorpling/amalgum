<p>Soldiers in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</ref> got fed up after waiting in line at a bank in the capital of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare">Harare</ref>. Due to rampant <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyperinflation">hyperinflation</ref> (the latest count has reached 231,000,000% annually), banks often have a shortage of cash and what they have is rationed out. Often the amount that is permitted to be withdrawn cannot even pay for a loaf of bread at the street markets.</p>
<p>After waiting all day in line at the bank, the soldiers and other customers attacked money changers and stole cash. Initially, city police stood by, but eventually broke up the rampage with tear gas.</p>
