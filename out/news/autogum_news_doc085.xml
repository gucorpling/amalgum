<figure><caption><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamil%20Kopúnek">Kamil Kopúnek</ref>'s late goal against Italy helped propel <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia%20national%20football%20team">Slovakia</ref> into the round of 16 Image: <ref target="http://flickr.com/photos/33468357@N04/4637991761">Stefan Heinisch</ref> (Flickr).</caption></figure><p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Slovakia">Slovakia</ref> eliminated defending champions <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</ref> from the World Cup. First round groups E and F were decided on Thursday: <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Paraguay">Paraguay</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Netherlands">Netherlands</ref> progress alongside Slovakia.</p>
<p>When a team finishes third or fourth in a group, they are on their way home. After the elimination of France, runners-up in 2006, it was the turn of the reigning champions. Slovakia met Italy in their first <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup">World Cup finals</ref> as an independent country.</p>
<p>After 81 minutes, the <hi rend="italic">Azzuri</hi> (Italy) were down by two goals, both struck by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Róbert%20Vittek">Róbert Vittek</ref>, when they got one back. They were denied a chance to equalize by a rebound from a Slovak knee on the goal line. </p>
<p>Their next goal was disallowed as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside%20(association%20football)">offside</ref>. The Slovaks strengthened their lead when a gross positioning error by Italy led to a goal from a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner%20kick">corner</ref>. Italy scored their second goal in the closing moments of the game, but it wasn't enough, and the Azzuri were out of the tournament.</p>
<p>For the fourth time in history, the reigning world champion was eliminated in the first round.  The previous occasions were Italy in 1950, Brazil in 1966 and France in 2002.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, Japan achieved a surprise 3 – 1 defeat of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Denmark">Denmark</ref>.  This, along with their victory over Cameroon on June 14, secured their qualification.  Paraguay stamped their ticket for the round of sixteen in a nil–nil draw with <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</ref>'s <hi rend="italic">All Whites</hi>.  The draw gave New Zealand a point to take them ahead of Italy, finishing Group F in third place.  The All Whites leave the tournament undefeated, recalling Cameroon's elimination in 1982 after three draws, pipped by Italy on goals scored.  The Netherlands beat <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Cameroon">Cameroon</ref>, securing Group E's first place.</p>
