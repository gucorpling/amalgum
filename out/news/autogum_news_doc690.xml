<p>Cowboys owner <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry%20Jones">Jerry Jones</ref> spoke with members of the media on Thursday, saying that he was "very disappointed in that we're having to deal with this," saying that the altercation was not a big deal.</p>
<p>"They were literally kidding each other," Jerry Jones told the Associated Press on Thursday. "They were jiving around ... and all of a sudden one of them starting saying some things, and here you go."</p>
<p>Cowboys nose tackle <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank%20Johnson">Tank Johnson</ref> said everything was overblown and shouldn't distract the team.</p>
<p>"This is not that big of a deal," Johnson told the Associated Press. "Nobody's in jail, nobody's in trouble, nobody's hurt. We're all here ready to practice, ready to work."</p>

<p>Jones has already been in police trouble in connection with a shooting at a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Las_Vegas">Las Vegas</ref> strip club and other incidents which have led to his arrest six times since he was drafted in 2005 by the Tennessee Titans. Jones was suspended in April 2007 by Goodell and allowed to return to play in August.</p>
<p>Jones said this after his reinstatement: "I know my responsibilities to the NFL and I'm going to hold my own and do what I need to do to make sure I stay where I am right now, which is reinstated. I work hard every day to make sure I don't make the same mistakes. Can I say I would never ever make the same mistakes? No, I can't say that. I'll make sure I put myself in way better situations than I have put myself in the past."</p>
