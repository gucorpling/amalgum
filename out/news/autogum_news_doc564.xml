There was brief peace just five days ago when protesters agreed to unblock downtown streets. That was soon broken as violence occurred when interior ministry troops, special "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkut%20(Ukraine)">Berkut</ref>" security forces, and police officers confronted protesters. </p>
<p>So far 26 people, including protesters and ten police officers, have been killed in Independence Square clashes. This is the most violence the country has seen since it gained independence 20 years ago.</p>

Facebook's plan says it will pay US$12 billion in stocks and US$4 billion in cash. All parties are still waiting regulatory approval.
