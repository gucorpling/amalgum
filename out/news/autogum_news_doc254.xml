<p>Fighting and a heavy exchange of fire  between <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israel">Israel</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas">Hamas</ref> continued in the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip">Gaza Strip</ref> overnight despite Hamas agreeing to the main outlines of a ceasefire brokered by officials in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Egypt">Egypt</ref>. </p>
<p>On <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramattan">Ramattan</ref>'s</hi> live video feed of the strip, Israeli tanks and gunships could be seen continuing to strike their targets, while Hamas fought Israeli soldiers on the streets. This marks the third night of intense bombings and exchanges. The fighting has brought the Palestinian death toll from the Israeli offensive to over 1,000, leaving thousands more injured. </p>
<p>"[We] presented to the Egyptian leadership our detailed vision," said Hamas in a statement which also added that Hamas did not reject the proposal.</p>
<p>The Israeli government is said to be looking at details of Hamas's proposal, but so far no agreement has been reached between the two sides. Damage incurred from the war is estimated to cost Gaza nearly <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20dollars">US</ref>$1.5 billion.</p>

The situation is untenable. It's genocide." Over 1,000 <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Palestine">Palestinians</ref> have died since the bombings began on December 27, 2008 and over 4,300 have been injured.  </p>

Israel claims it began bombarding Gaza to eliminate rockets being fired by Hamas and Palestinian fighters inside the Strip.</p>
<p>"You have to attack problems at their root cause and the Palestinian people have been subjected to subhuman treatment for decades and this [the Israeli offensive] is going to make matters worse," added d'Escoto.</p>
