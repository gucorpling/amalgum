<p>With more than 6.1 million likes, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</ref></hi> has recognised "Gangnam Style" as being the most liked YouTube video ever; it also has over 449,000 dislikes. 'officialpsy', the YouTube channel upon which the video was uploaded, now has in excess of 2.1 million subscribers and has achieved over 1.4 billion video views overall. According to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Google">Google</ref>, the company which owns YouTube, the video has attracted between seven and ten million daily views on average since being uploaded to the site.</p>
<p>Park Jae-Sang, the actual name of Psy, explained the meaning of the song in an August 2012 interview with <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/CNN">CNN</ref>. "People who are actually from Gangnam never proclaim that they are — it's only the posers and wannabes that put on these airs and say that they are 'Gangnam Style' — so this song is actually poking fun at those kinds of people who are trying so hard to be something that they're not", he said. Despite its international popularity, in a separate interview with <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Reuters">Reuters</ref></hi> earlier in August, Park Jae-Sang said "Gangnam Style" — a satire of consumerist aspects of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam%20District">Gangnam District</ref> of the South Korean capital of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Seoul">Seoul</ref> — "never targeted foreign countries. It was for local fans". He said his intention with the video "was to look uncool until the end. I achieved it." </p>

<p>"Gangnam Style" has inspired countless parody versions, prompting <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</ref> newspaper <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph_(UK)">The Daily Telegraph</ref></hi> to suggest it was "the most parodied video ever". Among the parody versions are one performed by inmates of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Philippines">Philippines</ref>' <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu%20Provincial%20Detention%20and%20Rehabilitation%20Center">Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center</ref>, one with students from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton%20College">Eton College</ref> in the United Kingdom, one from <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">Chinese</ref> artist <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai%20Weiwei">Ai Weiwei</ref> and one created in the approach to the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2012_United_States_presidential_election">2012 United States presidential election</ref> called "<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney">Mitt Romney</ref> Style".</p>
<p>Numerous prominent figures have attempted to imitate the "Gangnam Style" dance — which involves crossing one's wrists over each other and motioning as if "you're riding an invisible horse in your lower body," Park Jae-Sang explained — including <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Secretary-General</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">US</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States">President</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</ref> and Google chairman <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric%20Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</ref>.</p>
