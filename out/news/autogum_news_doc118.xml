<p>"The time has come for Robert Mugabe to answer for his crimes against humanity, against his countrymen and women and for justice to be done.

<p>Sentamu that the power-sharing deal that was signed by Mugabe and the Zimbabwean opposition in September was "now dead".</p>
<p>Dr Sentamu's statement comes after a severe cholera outbreak spread in Zimbabwe, and saw 12,545 cases reported and 565 people dead.</p>
