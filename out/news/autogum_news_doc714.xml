Gordon started the race in ninth, and eventually won his first race of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series">2013</ref> and snapping a 32-race winless streak. The race, contested over 500 laps, featured a season-high 17 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing%20flags#Yellow_flag">caution flags</ref> for 111 laps and involving 21 drivers, and 15 different race leaders.</p>

<p>After winning, Gordon stated:</p>
"It’s hard to top what it feels like to win, especially when you’ve been through what this team has been through. I’m so proud of them for never giving up. We’ve shown it all year long; we’ve been through a lot, but this makes it all worth it. It means a lot to all of us to get a huge win here for points, for the Manufacturers’ Championship, for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick%20Hendrick">Rick Hendrick</ref> family and for those we lost several years ago [in a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004%20Hendrick%20Motorsports%20aircraft%20crash">plane crash</ref> near the track]. We’ve left so many racetracks looking at each other going, ‘what do we need to do?’ Today, it all came together."
<p>In the points race, Gordon moved up to third, 27 points behind Johnson and Kenseth, who were both tied for the lead with 2,294. The remaining ten drivers in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase%20for%20the%20Sprint%20Cup">Chase for the Sprint Cup</ref> were: Harvick (2,266), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle%20Busch">Kyle Busch</ref> (2,258), Bowyer (2,239), Earnhardt (2,238), Biffle (2,236), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt%20Busch">Kurt Busch</ref> (2,219), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl%20Edwards">Carl Edwards</ref> (2,218), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey%20Logano">Joey Logano</ref> (2209), <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan%20Newman">Ryan Newman</ref> (2,188) and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasey%20Kahne">Kasey Kahne</ref> (2,170).</p>
<p>The win was Gordon's eighth at Martinsville, tying him with Johnson for the most among active drivers at the track.
