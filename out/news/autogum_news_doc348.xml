<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</ref>-based <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Asiana_Airlines">Asiana Airlines</ref> was fined <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">US$</ref>500,000 on Tuesday by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation">United States Department of Transportation</ref> for failing to provide support for victims' families after <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiana%20Airlines%20Flight%20214">Asiana Airlines Flight 214</ref> crashed at San Francisco airport in July 2013. Foreign airlines are to abide by a federal law called the "family assistance plan". The law states an airline must promptly assist and provide a toll-free number for calls from the passengers' families. It took the airline five days to contact the 291 families of the passengers aboard. </p>
<p>Of 307 on board, three <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">Chinese</ref> teens died and over 200 people were injured. The jet hit a seawall on approach, tearing the rear of the plane off, and throwing three flight attendants onto the runway. </p>

<p>United States President <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</ref> has ordered <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</ref> to make plans to pull all the nation's troops from <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Afghanistan">Afghanistan</ref> by the end of 2014. The Obama administration notified Afghan president <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai">Hamid Karzai</ref> that it would prefer to keep a residual military presence in Afghanistan for training and counterterrorism missions, but Karzai is refusing to sign the agreement for some US forces to remain. Once <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</ref> ends hostilities in November, a contingency plan for a full departure will begin. </p>
<p>US-Afghan relations have worsened over the past few months. Obama told Karzai the US will move forward with additional contingency planning if the bilateral agreement to maintain a US presence is not signed. </p>

<p>After <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Murder_of_Lee_Rigby">an attack</ref> in the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/London">London</ref> streets last year on British soldier Lee Rigby, two men were sentenced on Wednesday. The leader of the attack, Michael Adebolajo, was sentenced to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whole%20life%20tarrif">life behind bars</ref>. Michael Adebowale was given a life sentence, but with the possibility of parole after serving a minimum of 45 years. In court, the two <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Islam">Islamic</ref> converts indicated the killing was for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah">Allah</ref>. </p>
<p>Bystanders watched Adebolajo and Adebowale hit Rigby with a car then butcher him with a meat cleaver and knives. The attack was recorded on closed-circuit TV and by bystanders. Both men were convicted of murder in December 2013. </p>
