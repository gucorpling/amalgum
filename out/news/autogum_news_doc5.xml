<p>Ndlovu said of the outbreak that it was a "genocidal onslaught on the people of Zimbabwe by the British." It was compared to a "serious biological chemical weapon".</p>
<p>This comes just a day after President Mugabe announced that the cholera epidemic had been stopped, contradicting aid workers saying that the crisis was only getting worse.</p>
<p>Mugabe has already accused Western powers of planning to use the epidemic as a reason to oust him.</p>
