<p><hi rend="italic">Time</hi> said of Mohamed in announcing the news: "Not many people make national news by bringing a homemade clock to school. But the ninth-grader's arrest, after teachers and authorities mistook said clock for a bomb, kicked off a national debate over racial profiling".</p>

<p>The September 14 incident in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving,%20Texas">Irving</ref>, Texas triggered a wider discussion about <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia">Islamophobia</ref> within the community. The <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</ref> hashtag #IStandWithAhmed became part of a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social%20movement">social movement</ref> in support of the youth. After news of the police response was reported, Mohamed received support online ranging from US President <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</ref> to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</ref> creator <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</ref>.</p>
<p>Mohamed brought the digital clock he made to school on September 14, and a teacher mistakenly thought it resembled a bomb. Police arrested and questioned the student. Images of the boy wearing a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NASA">NASA</ref> T-shirt and handcuffed by the police were quickly posted and reposted online.</p>
<hi rend="bold">Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House?</hi>

<p>The Twitter attention led to outreach from <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Google">Google</ref> and Mohamed was invited to their Google Science Fair. Mohamed was a VIP guest at the Google Science Fair, and met finalists at the event held at Google's headquarters located in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain%20View,%20California">Mountain View</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/California">California</ref>. Co-founder of Google, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey%20Brin">Sergey Brin</ref>, personally met with Mohamed during his visit to Google.</p>
<p>US President <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</ref> tweeted using his @POTUS account: "Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great." <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</ref> gave Mohamed the option to come to their company for an internship. <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</ref> co-founder <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</ref> tweeted to Mohamed and said the boy was welcome to come and tour the company.</p>
<p>Both the Irving Independent School District and the Irving Police Department have asserted that the boy's religion and name were not a factor in the manner in which they approached the situation.</p>
