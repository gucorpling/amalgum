<p>Broadcast live on the web from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvary%20Chapel%20Costa%20Mesa">Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa</ref> on Friday, pastor Raul Ries delivered the eulogy along with Skateboarder <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian%20Hosoi">Christian Hosoi</ref>.  Both spoke about Adams character and influence on the skateboarding and surfing communities.  Adams' own church pastor and one of his closest friends Trip shared personal stories from letters Adams had written him concerning his faith and his desire to be known for being a man of God.  Adams' step-father Kent Sherwood who taught Adams how to surf when he was just three years old, also shared personal stories about Adams when he was just starting to surf and skateboard as a young child.</p>
<p>With clear skies and warm sunny weather on Saturday, hundreds of surfers, amongst them long time friends of Adam's from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Boys">Z-Boys</ref>, held a large memorial paddle-out tribute mid-day on the north side of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice%20Beach">Venice Beach</ref> Pier.  Chants of "Jay Jay Jay" could be heard from the pier as onlookers watched water being splashed about into the air by the hundreds of people perched on their surfboards.  <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los%20Angeles%20County">Los Angeles County</ref> fire department boats and lifeguards were on hand to add to the paddle-out by spraying their water cannons high into the air and blowing their horns, while monitoring everyone's safety.  Later in the afternoon nearby a skateboarding session was held at the Venice beach skate park also in Adams' honor.</p>

He has been acknowledged as someone who helped transform the novelty of skateboarding into a global phenomenon.

<p>Later in life Adams became a <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Christian">Christian</ref> and found a purpose in helping the next generation of skaters and surfers by speaking to the public with positive messages about making good choices in life, along with other notable skateboarder Dennis Martinez.
