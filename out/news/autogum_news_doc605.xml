<head>Toronto Comicon 2019 welcomes fans with celebrities, creativity, cosplay</head><p><hi rend="bold">Friday, March 29, 2019</hi></p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Toronto">Toronto</ref> Comicon 2019 returned to its titular city from March 15 to 17, as one of the largest pop culture events in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</ref>. The popular event featured celebrity guests like actors <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan%20Fogler">Dan Fogler</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron%20Perlman">Ron Perlman</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20De%20Lancie">John De Lancie</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Rhys-Davies">John Rhys-Davies</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaleel%20White">Jaleel White</ref>, as well as comic artists, authors, and professional cosplayers. The event included a large show floor with hundreds of retailers and artists promoting their creations. Wikinews' <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:Zanimum">Nicholas Moreau</ref> attended the event, taking photos of the various sights.</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Rhys-Davies">John Rhys-Davies</ref> broke news when he revealed that a <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliders">Sliders</ref></hi> reboot is being considered. "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry%20O'Connell">Jerry [O'Connell</ref>] and I are talking to NBC at the moment. The basic problem is that no one knows who owns the rights". Their legal department had apparently been looking into the matter for two months, as of the convention weekend. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma%20Caufield">Emma Caufield</ref> talked of being cast in an NBC television pilot while a recurring guest actor on <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</ref></hi>. Faced with loosing the character of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anya%20Jenkins">Anya Jenkins</ref>, the producers finally committed to making her a regular. "It was a good day," she recalls.</p>

<p>Special effects costumer Ian Campbell, whose screen credits include <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%20Trek:%20Discovery">Star Trek: Discovery</ref></hi>, had a booth at the convention displaying his prop replicas and cosplay items. Amidst the bustle of activity, Campbell was working on a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanos">Thanos</ref> helmet sculpt. After the convention, he told Wikinews that "it can be tough to maintain focus with so many people streaming past and along questions, but sculpting in front of a crowd at conventions is great because it allows people to see the process that goes into what I do [...] it also can serve as inspiration to other to pursue their own artistic endeavors."</p>
<p>Lisa Mancini has been cosplaying for two years, her "passion" for the hobby "stemmed through my love for Halloween." She typically chooses "to portray beloved characters from childhood or strong females. I also enjoy a good gender bent cosplay to ensure a touch of uniqueness!"</p>
<p>Mancini told Wikinews after the event that the best part of cosplay is "bringing a character to life." One of the characters she took on this year was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel%20Girl">Squirrel Girl</ref>, a Marvel Comics character. Mancini has been described by the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily%20Hive">Daily Hive</ref></hi> as a "squirrel whisperer", for the close affinity some of the animals have for her.</p>
<figure><caption>Stephanie Chapman as Abe Sapien from <hi rend="italic">Hellboy</hi>.</caption></figure>
<p>Stephanie Chapman has knit a variety of knit outfits, an uncommon technique for cosplay. Prompted by Ron Perlman's visit, she wore a costume based on <hi rend="italic">Hellboy</hi> character <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe%20Sapien">Abe Sapien</ref>, which lacks the eyeholes of her normal masks. With "Abe, I wanted to go for accuracy over comfort," Chapman told Wikinews, a choice leaving her largely helpless without a handler. The costume "is very warm [...] so I have to stay hydrated and try to keep as calm as possible. It's just really hard to stay calm when I meet someone like Ron Perlman". With the combination of excitement and "the stress I'm putting on my body", she shared that she was prone to meltdown in suit.</p>
