<p>The Quiksilver Ceremonial Punta de Lobos has been a tradition since 1998. Christensen won that championship, and has regularly participated in it since then, according to <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%20Tercera">La Tercera</ref></hi>. "If [the Chilean waves] weren't that good, I wouldn't come back. They're powerful, that's what makes of Chile a great place to train," Christensen told <hi rend="italic">La Tercera</hi>.</p>
<p>The competition was scheduled to take place sometime between April 1 and May 31; it was confirmed to take place on May 28 by Gary Linden, the Big Wave World Tour Contest Director. "We are excited to kick off the 2011 Big Wave World Tour with the third annual Quiksilver Ceremonial. [...] It looks like patience is going to pay off as we are expecting surf in the 30 to 40 foot range with light winds and good lighting making for the perfect start to season," Linden said.</p>
<p>"The Quiksilver Ceremonial is one of the world's most anticipated big wave events, featuring some of the best waves and skilled surfers from around the globe," Hawaiian media <hi rend="italic">Aloha Update</hi> reported. Carlos Ferrer, marketing manager of Quiksilver Chile, said: "This championship has managed to put itself as one of the great dates of the worldwide surfing scene. It is of international class."</p>

<p>On Thursday, Mayor of Pichilemu <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Roberto_Córdova">Roberto Córdova</ref> reunited with organizers of the ceremonial,  Carlos Ferrer, Gary Linden, and Ricardo Parot from Wetfly Productions, at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pichilemu%20city%20hall">Pichilemu city hall</ref>. "The mayor reiterates his commitment to the community with these kinds of events in the low-season as they are great attractions that help support Pichilemu's tourism industry," city hall representatives said on its Facebook profile.</p>
<p>Many people visited Punta de Lobos on Friday, as the surfers were practicing. "There was great expectation in Punta de Lobos yesterday [on Friday]," <hi rend="italic">La Tercera</hi> reported. "It has arrived the same amount of people coming a long holiday weekend to Pichilemu, but this time, only to see the championship," director of surf magazine <hi rend="italic">Glass.cl</hi> Rodrigo Farías told the newspaper. Farías also told <hi rend="italic">La Tercera</hi> that during <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Surf's_up_in_Chile;_championship_competition_in_Pichilemu">last year's ceremonial</ref> there were waves eight-meters high, and "[Saturday]'s waves are expected to be more ordained." He predicted that it would be "a bit cloudy, and there will be more time between one wave and another, so there could be more tubes, which will be much better visually."</p>
