<p>Khartabil worked as a computer engineer and contributed to Mozilla and Wikipedia. A supporter of free access to knowledge and culture, Khartabil co-founded Syria's first hackerspace, Aiki Lab, and led Creative Commons' Syrian project.</p>
<p>The fellowship to honour Khartabil aims to promote free culture in various forms, including art, music, software, and community. On their official blog, Creative Commons said they would encourage applications from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant">Levant</ref>, Middle East, and North Africa.</p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Amazon">Amazon</ref> Web Services is to act as a supporting partner and the fellows would receive a stipend of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US$">US$</ref>50 thousand over the course of ten months. The fellowship is to be awarded on a one-year basis, which could be renewed. Additionally, the organisations are to provide up to US$3000 for the candidates to purchase equipment and software.</p>
<p>Promoting candidates from "closed societies" from the countries with a history of oppression of freedom of expression and access to free knowledge, the fellowship laid three requirements for the eligibility. The applicants must have a history of contribution to the open source/access or free culture communities, and propose in their application an initiative promoting free culture values, and in which the fellowship would be their primary work focus. The fellowship applications are to be accepted from February, and the fellowship is to be awarded in April.</p>
