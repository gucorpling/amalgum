<p>NASA's Cassini spacecraft zoomed past Saturn's moon <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus%20(moon)">Enceladus</ref> at just 50 kilometres above its surface. The probe attempted to take detailed images of active geysers on the moon, which may offer evidence for the additional existence of liquid water on the moon. If water is confirmed this would be the first time <hi rend="italic">liquid</hi> water is found outside of the Earth.</p>
