<p>Nuclear negotiations between <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iran">Iran</ref> and six other nations continued yesterday and have made progress, according to diplomats. The meeting is the first time Iran has met with world powers in over a year. When the meeting broke for lunch, a diplomat warned of premature optimism, however. The diplomat also mentioned the possibility of reaching common ground in the future.</p>
<p>Iran continues to insist that the development of a nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes, but <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israel">Israeli</ref> Prime Minister <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</ref> has threatened a preemptive strike, saying that his country would be threatened by Iran achieving nuclear capability. Although <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/U.S.">U.S.</ref> President <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</ref> has not eliminated the possibility of using military force against Iran, he has expressed desire for a diplomatic solution instead.</p>

<head id="Antarctic_emperor_penguin_population_approximated_from_space">Antarctic emperor penguin population approximated from space</head>
<p>Scientists from the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</ref> used satellite imagery to approximate the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctic</ref> population of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emperor%20penguins">emperor penguins</ref> at approximately 600,000, nearly double that of previous estimates. The scientists used high resolution imagery to ensure the ability to distinguish between shadows, excrement and the penguins themselves. They also found approximately 238,000 breeding pairs of penguins in Antarctica. Two-decade-old studies estimated this number to be between 135,000 and 175,000.</p>
<p>Although the population estimate is higher than before, their numbers may decline in the coming years if current climate trends continue, according to researchers. Researcher Phil Trathan said "Current research suggests that emperor penguin colonies will be seriously affected by climate change." The species, which only occupies Antarctica, is currently listed as "least concern" by the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</ref>.</p>
