<head id="Missile_shield_to_feature_in_talks">Missile shield to feature in talks</head>
<p>Meetings are underway at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</ref> headquarters in an attempt to reassure <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</ref> that the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20missile%20defense">missile defence plans</ref> pose no threat. The <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref> maintains the system is to protect against missiles from rogue states, whereas Russia sees the system as compromising its strategic interests in the region.</p>
<p>In today's talks NATO allies encouraged the United States to make the planned anti-missile shield capable of covering all of Europe. They did this without committing themselves to joining the project.</p>
<p>Reaction to the proposed system in European states has been mixed.</p>

<head id="Water_cuts_possible_as_Australia_faces_drought">Water cuts possible as Australia faces drought</head>
<p>Irrigation water to a substantial proportion of Australia's farming regions could be cut due to drought conditions, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">Australian</ref> PM <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Howard">John Howard</ref> has warned.</p>
<p>Mr Howard's comments concerned the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray-Darling%20Basin">Murray-Darling Basin</ref>, one of the largest systems in Australia. "If it doesn't rain in sufficient volume over the next six to eight weeks, there will be no water allocations for irrigation purposes in the basin", adding that the drought conditions could continue until May 2008.</p>
<p>He continued "It is a grim situation, and there is no point in pretending to Australia otherwise," he said. "We must all hope and pray there is rain."</p>

<head id="Russian_plans_for_Bering_Strait_tunnel_received_with_skepticism">Russian plans for Bering Strait tunnel received with skepticism</head>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</ref>, in coordination with the government of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</ref>, is planning to build a tunnel from Russia to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska">Alaska</ref>, Viktor Razbegin, deputy head of industrial research at the Russian Economy Ministry, told reporters in Moscow Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The tunnel is budgeted to cost US$65 billion and would take 10 to 15 years to build.  The tunnel is to provide train and automobile transport between Alaska and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian%20Far%20East">Russian Far East</ref>, and to carry <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petroleum">petroleum</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural%20gas">natural gas</ref> pipelines, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electric%20power%20transmission">high-voltage electrical cable</ref>. </p>
<p>The proposed tunnel is 64 miles long, or about 100 kilometers, in total, and is designed to link with two islands in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</ref>.  The project is expected to have a very positive economic effect in the area.</p>
<p>Derek Brower, an energy market expert, called the project "absurd" and suggested the Russian government is playing political games to threaten its <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</ref> customers to sign energy deals.</p>
<p>"I've never heard of this plan," said Sergei Grigoryev, Vice President of oil pipeline monopoly <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transneft">Transneft</ref>.</p>
<p>"To be honest, anyone who look[s] at the map will realize that the project is too hard to implement," an anonymous government source told <hi rend="italic">Reuters</hi>.</p>
