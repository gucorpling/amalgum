<head>WHEREIN EDITH CARR WAGES A BATTLE, AND HART HENDERSON STANDS GUARD</head>

<p>Many people looked, a few followed, when Edith Carr slowly came down the main street of Mackinac, pausing here and there to note the glow of colour in one small booth after another, overflowing with gay curios. That street of packed white sand, winding with the curves of the shore, outlined with brilliant shops, and thronged with laughing, bare-headed people in outing costumes was a picturesque and fascinating sight. Thousands annually made long journeys and paid exorbitant prices to take part in that pageant.</p>

<p>As Edith Carr passed, she was the most distinguished figure of the old street. Her clinging black gown was sufficiently elaborate for a dinner dress. On her head was a large, wide, drooping-brimmed black hat, with immense floating black plumes, while on the brim, and among the laces on her breast glowed velvety, deep red roses. Some way these made up for the lack of colour in her cheeks and lips, and while her eyes seemed unnaturally bright, to a close observer they appeared weary. Despite the effort she made to move lightly she was very tired, and dragged her heavy feet with an effort.</p>

<p>She turned at the little street leading to the dock, and went to meet the big lake steamer ploughing up the Straits from Chicago. Past the landing place, on to the very end of the pier she went, then sat down, leaned against a dock support and closed her tired eyes. When the steamer came very close she languidly watched the people lining the railing. Instantly she marked one lean anxious face turned toward hers, and with a throb of pity she lifted a hand and waved to Hart Henderson. He was the first man to leave the boat, coming to her instantly. She spread her trailing skirts and motioned him to sit beside her. Silently they looked across the softly lapping water. At last she forced herself to speak to him.</p>

<p>“Did you have a successful trip?”</p>

<p>“I accomplished my purpose.”</p>

<p>“You didn't lose any time getting back.”</p>

<p>“I never do when I am coming to you.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to go to the cottage for anything?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then let us sit here and wait until the Petoskey steamer comes in. I like to watch the boats. Sometimes I study the faces, if I am not too tired.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen any new types to-day?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “This has not been an easy day, Hart.”</p>

<p>“And it's going to be worse,” said Henderson bitterly. “There's no use putting it off. Edith, I saw some one to-day.”</p>

<p>“You should have seen thousands,” she said lightly.</p>

<p>“I did. But of them all, only one will be of interest to you.”</p>

<p>“Man or woman?”</p>

<p>“Man.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Lake Shore private hospital.”</p>

<p>“An accident?”</p>

<p>“No. Nervous and physical breakdown.”</p>

<p>“Phil said he was going back to the Limberlost.”</p>

<p>“He went. He was there three weeks, but the strain broke him. He has an old letter in his hands that he has handled until it is ragged. He held it up to me and said: 'You can see for yourself that she says she will be well and happy, but we can't know until we see her again, and that may never be. She may have gone too near that place her father went down, some of that Limberlost gang may have found her in the forest, she may lie dead in some city morgue this instant, waiting for me to find her body.'”</p>

<p>“Hart! For pity sake stop!”</p>

<p>“I can't,” cried Henderson desperately. “I am forced to tell you. They are fighting brain fever. He did go back to the swamp and he prowled it night and day. The days down there are hot now, and the nights wet with dew and cold. He paid no attention and forgot his food. A fever started and his uncle brought him home. They've never had a word from her, or found a trace of her. Mrs. Comstock thought she had gone to O'Mores' at Great Rapids, so when Phil broke down she telegraphed there. They had been gone all summer, so her mother is as anxious as Phil.”</p>

<p>“The O'Mores are here,” said Edith. “I haven't seen any of them, because I haven't gone out much in the few days since we came, but this is their summer home.”</p>

<p>“Edith, they say at the hospital that it will take careful nursing to save Phil. He is surrounded by stacks of maps and railroad guides. He is trying to frame up a plan to set the entire detective agency of the country to work. He says he will stay there just two days longer. The doctors say he will kill himself when he goes. He is a sick man, Edith. His hands are burning and shaky and his breath was hot against my face.”</p>

<p>“Why are you telling me?” It was a cry of acute anguish.</p>

<p>“He thinks you know where she is.”</p>

<p>“I do not! I haven't an idea! I never dreamed she would go away when she had him in her hand! I should not have done it!”</p>

<p>“He said it was something you said to her that made her go.”</p>

<p>“That may be, but it doesn't prove that I know where she went.”</p>
