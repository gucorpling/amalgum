<head>Petition calls for Trump UK ban</head>
  

<p>A petition reached over 300,000 signatures today urging <ref target="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</ref>, considered the front runner to become the <ref target="w:Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</ref> 's candidate for President of the <ref target="w:United%20States">United States</ref> , be banned from entering the <ref target="w:United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</ref> . This follows Mr Trump's comments that <ref target="w:Islam">Muslims</ref> should be blocked from entering the US.</p>

<p>Also, <ref target="w:Scotland">Scotland</ref> 's First Minister, <ref target="w:Nicola%20Sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</ref> , removed Trump from his role as business ambassador for Scotland.</p>

<p>On Monday, Mr Trump said he wants a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US" until the country can understand "what the hell is going on" with regard to terrorism. He said in a statement that a large number of Muslims show "great hatred towards Americans".</p>

<p>Trump's comments on Monday came days after a shooting in <ref target="w:San%20Bernardino%2C%20California">San Bernardino</ref> , <ref target="w:California">California</ref> by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik, in which fourteen people were killed. US President <ref target="w:Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</ref> said in an address from the <ref target="w:Oval%20Office">Oval Office</ref> on Sunday the attack was an act of terrorism.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's statement has been widely criticised, including by members of his own political party. Republican <ref target="w:Matt%20Moore%20%28politician%29">Matt Moore</ref> said the policy is a "bad idea" and Speaker of the <ref target="w:United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House</ref> <ref target="Paul%20Ryan">Paul Ryan</ref> said "this is not Conservatism".</p>

<ref target="w:Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</ref> candidate for President <ref target="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</ref> described Trump's comments as "shameful". Secretary of State <ref target="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</ref> argued Trump's statement would not help in the ongoing fight against <ref target="Islamic%20State">Islamic State</ref> (IS), saying his remarks were "not constructive".

<p>Trump argued that his policy idea is "no different" to that of former President <ref target="w:Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt%27s">Franklin D. Roosevelt's</ref> policy which saw large-scale confinement of Japanese US citizens in internment camps following Japan's attacks on <ref target="w:Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</ref> in 1941. Mr Trump also said the policy should not be implemented on Muslims currently living within the US.</p>

<p>Kassem Allie from the <ref target="w:Islamic%20Center%20of%20America">Islamic Center of America</ref> , accused Trump of evoking fear "reminiscent of <ref target="w:Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</ref> and <ref target="w:Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</ref> ". <ref target="w:The%20Pentagon">The Pentagon</ref> expressed concern Trump's demands could be counterproductive in the fight against IS, saying it "bolsters Isil's narrative".</p>

<p>Mr Trump also said on Tuesday that police in <ref target="London">London</ref> are "afraid for their lives" in some areas because of radicalisation in the city. These comments were rebuffed by the United Kingdom Prime Minister <ref target="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</ref> who said Trump was "simply wrong" and Mayor of London <ref target="Boris%20Johnson">Boris Johnson</ref> said the claim was "ridiculous".</p>
