<p><hi rend="italic">Time</hi> said of Mohamed in announcing the news: "Not many people make national news by bringing a homemade clock to school. But the ninth-grader's arrest, after teachers and authorities mistook said clock for a bomb, kicked off a national debate over racial profiling".</p>

The <ref target="Twitter">Twitter</ref> hashtag #IStandWithAhmed became part of a <ref target="w:social%20movement">social movement</ref> in support of the youth.

<p>Mohamed brought the digital clock he made to school on September 14, and a teacher mistakenly thought it resembled a bomb. Police arrested and questioned the student.

<p>The Twitter attention led to outreach from <ref target="Google">Google</ref> and Mohamed was invited to their Google Science Fair.
