<head>UK's 'ban Trump' petition passes half-million mark</head>
  

<p>A petition on the <ref target="w:UK">UK</ref> government's website, calling for <ref target="w:US">US</ref> Presidential hopeful <ref target="w:Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</ref> to be barred from entering the country, has now passed a half-million signatories becoming the most-popular petition ever posted on the site. The signatories include a majority of UK <ref target="w:Member%20of%20parliament">MPs</ref> .</p>

<p>The petition was originally submitted late November by campaigner Suzanne Kelly from <ref target="w:Aberdeen">Aberdeen</ref> , preceding Trump's remarks which prompted the overwhelming response. Kelly, saying her attention was drawn due to concerns over Trump's golfing developments in the area, noted, "I never in my wildest dreams imagined it would get so many signatures". Locally, <ref target="w:Robert%20Gordon%20University">Robert Gordon University</ref> have stripped an honorary degree from Trump, and First Minister <ref target="w:Nicola%20Sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</ref> removed him from the GlobalScot network of business ambassadors.</p>

<p>Following the tycoon's call for a "complete shutdown of <ref target="w:Islam">Muslims</ref> entering the United States", an <ref target="w:NBC">NBC</ref> /<ref target="w:The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">WSJ</ref> survey found the majority of adults in the United States disagree with him. The remarks also prompted global criticism of Trump. </p>

<ref target="w:London">London</ref> mayor <ref target="w:Boris%20Johnson">Boris Johnson</ref> said the demand made him "unfit to hold the office of the president of the United States". <ref target="w:France">French</ref> Prime minister <ref target="w:Manuel%20Valls">Manuel Valls</ref> stated on <ref target="w:Twitter">Twitter</ref> , "Mr. Trump, like others, fuels hatred [...] our only enemy is radical <ref target="w:Islamism">Islamism</ref> ." The director of the American university in <ref target="w:Cairo">Cairo</ref> 's <ref target="w:Kamal%20Adham%20Center%20for%20Television%20and%20Digital%20Journalism">Kamal Adham Center for Television and Digital Journalism</ref> , <ref target="w:Hafez%20Al%20Mirazi">Hafez Al Mirazi</ref> , said: "What we are getting now is really terrible [...] Stuff that only the <ref target="w:Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</ref> and others would say." Kassem Allie, from the <ref target="w:Islamic%20Center%20of%20America">Islamic Center of America</ref> , accused Trump of evoking fear "reminiscent of <ref target="w:Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</ref> ".

<p>In contrast, a humorous petition calling on <ref target="w:NASA">NASA</ref> to "send Donald Trump into Space and Leave Him There" on the change.org site has exceeded 30,000 signatures. Autumn Boehle from <ref target="w:Michigan">Michigan</ref> , who started the petition last Wednesday, says, if the petition garners sufficient signatures, she will provide a link where people can: "donate to make this happen. It wont be cheap, but it will be worth while."</p>

<p>The petition to ban Donald Trump from the UK, having passed 100,000 signatures, is now eligible for debate in the <ref target="w:UK%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</ref> .</p>
