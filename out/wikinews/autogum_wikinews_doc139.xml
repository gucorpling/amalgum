<p>La Roja had 80% possession of the ball in front of Uruguay. Two Uruguayan players were <ref target="w:red%20card%20%28association%20football%29">red carded</ref> in this match.</p>

<ref target="w:Mauricio%20Isla">Mauricio Isla</ref> scored in the 81 minute, assisted by <ref target="w:Jorge%20Vald%C3%ADvia">Jorge Valdívia</ref> , the only goal of the match. <ref target="w:Edinson%20Cavani">Cavani</ref> got his <ref target="w:yellow%20card%20%28association%20football%29">yellow card</ref> at the 29 by arguing with a <ref target="w:Assistant%20referee%20%28association%20football%29">linesman</ref> . 11 minutes later, Uruguayan defender <ref target="w:Jorge%20Fucile">Jorge Fucile</ref> was <ref target="w:yellow%20card%20%28association%20football%29">booked</ref> for clattering on <ref target="w:Eduardo%20Vargas">Vargas</ref> . The first half ended with 0&ndash;0 score, and four players booked. 

<p>Cavani's father Luis Cavani was arrested earlier this week over a Monday truck crash in which a 19-year-old motorcyclist was killed. Then, in the 63 minute Chilean defender <ref target="w:Gonzalo%20Jara">Jara</ref> provoked Cavani reportedly by putting his finger in Cavani's anus. Cavani touched Jara's face, and Jara fell to the ground causing Cavani to get a card. The Uruguayan team had only nine men left after Fucile received his second yellow card for a foul on <ref target="w:Alexis%20S%C3%A1nchez">Alexis Sánchez</ref> . </p>
