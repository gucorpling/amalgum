<head> 3. Network Structure and Storage Availability</head>
<p>
One of the objectives of this paper is to understand the impact of link addition and deletion on storage availability for those agents who are involved in the link addition/deletion as well as those who are not. The storage availability is determined by the distances between them and their closeness (from Equation (2)). Therefore, first we study how addition and deletion of a link impacts the shortest distances between pairs of agents and, therefore, their closeness. This analysis provides a base for understanding the effect of link-addition/deletion on agents’ storage availability in . </p>

<p>Lemmas 1 and 2 show that, with respect to closeness, every link benefits agents on either side of the link. An action of link addition or deletion between a pair of agents not only impacts their closeness, but also that of other agents. Now, we study the impact of link addition or deletion between a pair of agents (say, <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j</hi>) on the closeness of the other agents .<b>Lemma</b> <b>3.</b>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Suppose  and . Then,  if and only if  for all .</hi><b>Proof.</b> 
<p>
If  for all , then by Equation (1), . </p>

<p>Conversely, suppose . </p>

<p>It is easy to see that, if for some , if , then . (Paths in  exist in  too). </p>

<p>We have  for all  and, if there exists <hi rend="italic">x</hi> such that , then , a contradiction. ☐<b>Lemma</b> <b>4.</b>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Suppose  and . Then,  if and only if  for all .</hi><b>Proof.</b> 
<p>
As  for all <hi rend="italic">l</hi>, the proof follows in lines similar to that of Lemma 3. ☐ </p>

<p>We now show necessary and sufficient conditions for increase in the closeness of agents who are not involved in link addition or deletion.<b>Theorem</b> <b>1.</b>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Suppose , and let k be an agent distinct from i and j. Then,  if and only if there exists at least one agent  such that  and all shortest paths  from k to l in  contain .</hi><b>Proof.</b> 
<p>
Let . Then, by Lemma 3, there must be at least one agent, say <hi rend="italic">l</hi>, such that . </p>

<p>Suppose  and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> are all distinct. Note that <hi rend="italic">j</hi> may be the same as <hi rend="italic">l</hi>. </p>

<p>If possible, let  for all . Then,  for all . From Lemma 1, , a contradiction. Therefore, there exists an  such that . </p>

<p>As , . As ,  and . Hence, . </p>

<p>Now,  </p>

<p>It follows that every shortest path between <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> in  contains . (Note that if there exists a shortest path from <hi rend="italic">k</hi> to <hi rend="italic">l</hi> in  that does not contain , then this shortest path exists in  too). </p>

<p>Conversely, let  such that  and all shortest paths  from <hi rend="italic">k</hi> to <hi rend="italic">l</hi> in  contain . </p>

<p>Clearly, . </p>

<p>If possible, let . This means for every <hi rend="italic">l</hi> in  there exists a shortest path from <hi rend="italic">k</hi> to <hi rend="italic">l</hi> in  that does not contain , a contradiction. Therefore, . ☐<b>Theorem</b> <b>2.</b>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Suppose , and let k be an agent distinct from i and j. Then,  if and only if there exists at least one agent  such that  and all shortest paths  from k to l in  contain .</hi> </p>

<p>We skip the proof as it is similar to the proof of Theorem 1. </p>

<p>In subsequent sections, we present our results due to link addition. We present our results on link deletion in Appendix B. </p>

<head> 3.2. Effect of Closeness on Distances of Agents Not Involved in Link Alteration</head>
<p>
In this section, we classify agents whose mutual distances from each other remain the same after link alteration. We use the same to analyze the effect of closeness on distances between agents who are not involved in the link addition or deletion. </p>
