The conveyor belts used in different fields of industry can be made in the manufacturing process either at the required dimensions in exploitation or at other smaller dimensions, and this determines the use of vulcanization as a process for combining the conveyor belts so as to obtain the conveyor belts with the desired performances. It is worth noting in this regard the need for joining of the conveyor belts that are used in the transport of materials over long distances. These strips have metallic inserts in structure and are used for the transport of coal and ores. Thus, the maximum lengths at which the strips with metal inserts are manufactured are made up to 210 m, due to difficulties that appear in the technological manufacturing process. Because this type of band has to transport materials at much greater distances than the manufacturing length, it is necessary to combine them by vulcanization. </p>

<p>Thus, the conveyor belts of special importance, which should have high mechanical properties, have different inserts (textile—<figure>Figure 1</figure>a, metal—<figure>Figure 1</figure>b), and their properties are based on rubber-insertion adhesions and are used for equipping high-capacity conveyors or those working in high demand conditions (high slope, high speed, reduced length with frequent alternations with straight paths and passes on drums) where very good breaking resistance, great flexibility and high reliability are required. </p>

<p>In order to increase the service life of the conveyor belts, it is necessary to combine them by vulcanization so that in the joining areas, the mechanical characteristics will be the same or very close to those of the rest of the belt and to obtain a homogeneity of the entire conveyor belt. </p>

<p>In general, the vulcanization of the various rubber products, but especially of the conveyor belts, generates lower mechanical characteristics in the joint area than the rest of the product and this causes a decrease in the life of the product. In this sense, the aim is to find a technical solution that will allow the homogenization of the properties of the materials in the joint area with those of the material from the respective product. </p>

<p>The adjustment of the vulcanization time of the rubber products, in order to combine them, is made according to the thickness of the rubber in the area of their connection. In order to regulate the vulcanization temperature, the type of rubber used in the vulcanization process is taken into consideration, and the pressing pressure is determined according to the thickness of the rubber and its structure. Any vulcanization process of a rubber product is currently carried out by regulating three technological parameters, namely: </p>

vulcanization time;</dd><dt id="">2)</dt><dd>
<p>
vulcanization temperature;</dd><dt id="">3)</dt><dd>
<p>
pressing pressure of the ends of the product.</dd></dl> </p>

<p>The three parameters mentioned above may take different values depending on a certain type of rubber product, and if the adjustment of these parameters is not achieved at optimum values then the results obtained regarding the characteristics of the joint area are not appropriate. The inadequate results are mainly determined by the presence in the joint area of a high porosity of the joint material but also of an uneven thickness of the conveyor belt, and this causes a decrease of the mechanical characteristics of the joints. </p>

<p>The reduction of the porosity in the joint area can be obtained by the appropriate adjustment of the three technological parameters presented at optimal values. In the process of jointing by vulcanization, the pressing pressure is one of the parameters of special importance. At present, different opinions have been issued regarding the influence of the pressing pressure, but in particular the research carried out refers to metallic materials and less to rubber materials or composite materials with rubber matrix. An uneven distribution of the pressing pressure on the width of the conveyor belt can result in a non-corresponding quality for the realized joint. </p>

<p>A main cause that determines the removal of the conveyor belts is that in the joint area is not obtained an uniform thickness of the conveyor belt and thus the dimensional error of the type “bell” appears, meaning that the conveyor belt has in the joint area a much greater thickness in the middle compared to the outer parts. This fact is determined by the fact that the used vulcanization facility has an unoptimized metal structure that deforms very much during the vulcanization in the sense that it has a very large deformation in the middle. </p>
