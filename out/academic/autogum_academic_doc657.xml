Kounis syndrome is defined as acute coronary syndromes (ACS) induced by hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reaction. Several causes are reported to induce Kounis syndrome, such as medicines, environmental exposures, bee stings, and asthma (Table 2). Ayhan Akoz et al. conducted a prospective study and found the incidence of Kounis syndrome in all admissions to be 19.4/100,000. The most common etiology reported was the use of medications, accounting for about 81%. In the current concept, three variants of Kounis syndrome have been described. Type I variant is characterized by allergy-related coronary spasm without coronary lesions or risk factors. Patients with type I Kounis syndrome present electrocardiographic change with or without cardiac enzymes elevation due to the acute release of inflammatory mediators inducing coronary spasm. The type II variant includes pre-existing atheromatous disease. An acute allergic reaction leading to the release of inflammatory mediators induces plaque erosion or rupture, which causes acute myocardial infarction. Type III has been defined in patients with pre-existing coronary disease and coronary artery stent thrombosis. In the Jack P. Chen et al. study, the pathology of drug-eluting stent (DES) thrombosis in these patients presented with eosinophils and mast cell infiltration in Giemsa and hematoxylin–eosin staining. In the Stéphane Cook et al. study, the association with late DES thrombosis and local inflammation in histopathology was reported. In intravascular ultrasound analysis, vessel remodeling was also confirmed. Very late stent thrombosis is recognized as a feature of Kounis syndrome (<figure>Figure 5</figure>). </p>

<p>The detail pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. In the current concept, Kounis syndrome is related to inflammatory cell and mast cell-associated disorders. Local inflammatory cell interactions induce hypersensitivity and anaphylactic results by releasing inflammatory mediators after activation. In the Nicholas G. Kounis et al. summary, Kounis syndrome is a complex multisystem disease accompanied by allergy–hypersensitivity–anaphylaxis. During hypersensitivity, the mast cells and lymphocytes release inflammatory mediators, promoting an allergic reaction via a high serum level of histamine, proteases, arachidonic acid products, and chemokines. These factors cause platelet aggregating and tissue factor expression. The proteases also induce plaque erosion and rupture by activating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). The downstream mediators induce vasoconstriction and worsen coronary vasospasm. </p>

<p>The diagnosis of Kounis syndrome is based on clinical symptoms and cardiac surveys, including cardiac enzyme, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and angiography. The serum level of tryptase and histamine can provide more information about the allergic reaction (<figure>Figure 5</figure>). Tajda Keber et al. suggested measuring cardiac enzymes in acute allergic reaction patients as necessary to diagnose Kounis syndrome promptly and manage cardiac injury early and appropriately. Echocardiography and coronary angiography can provide detailed information to rule out takotsubo cardiomyopathy or other cardiac disorders in cardiac wall motion abnormalities patients. Keita Goto et al. reported that thallium-201 (Tl) single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and 125I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) SPECT were conducted in a post-Kounis syndrome patient, and they revealed a local perfusion defect with decreased BMIPP uptake. Aylin Okur et al. included 26 patients with known or suspected Kounis syndrome and conducted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The results revealed an early-phase subendocardial contrast defect and local edema in lesion areas in T2-weighted images. These newer images provide a reliable study to assess cardiac injury in Kounis syndrome. </p>

<p>Compared to the majority of ACS subjects, the therapeutic strategy of Kounis syndrome should focus on both the cardiac injury and allergic reaction. Sometimes, the two different conditions may require opposing treatments. In the current concept, the administration of medicine should avoid promoting an allergy reaction and aggravating the cardiac injury. Intravenous corticosteroids (hydrocortisone: 1–2 mg/kg/day) and antihistamine agents (diphenhydramine: 1–2 mg/kg) are useful to control the allergic reaction. Aspirin is, however, potentially detrimental because of cyclooxygenase inhibition, promoting arachidonic acid release into the leukotriene pathway. Calcium channel blockers and nitrates can relieve the vasospasm. In hemodynamically unstable patients, nitrates may not be appropriate due to their hypotension properties. Opioids may induce mast cell degeneration, which may worsen the anaphylaxis. Beta-blockers should be used with extreme caution because they can exaggerate coronary spasms and cause epinephrine to be ineffective. Epinephrine is the only life-saving drug in the event of aggravated ischemia, vasospasm, and arrhythmias. In some animal studies, adrenaline may cause LV impairment and not recovery in established anaphylactic shock. Therefore, adrenaline is only suggested in high-grade anaphylactic reactions. Adequate fluids resuscitation and oxygen therapy are important supportive treatments for Kounis syndrome. Type II variant patients can take advantage of an ACS protocol. Double antiplatelet therapy in the pharmacological treatment of myocardial revascularization is suggested, including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and another P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. In the type III variant, the ACS protocol accompanied by urgent aspiration of intrastent thrombus is suggested (<figure>Figure 5</figure>). Antihistamines, corticosteroids, and mast cell stabilizers may be helpful for allergic symptoms after stent implantation or revascularization. </p>
