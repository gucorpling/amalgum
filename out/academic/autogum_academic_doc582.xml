Deep Learning networks are revolutionizing both the academic and the industrial scenarios of information and communication technologies. Their theoretical maturity and the coexistence of large datasets with computational media is making this technology available to a wide community of makers and users, and recent evolution has been remarkable in techniques such as deep belief networks, Boltzmann machines, auto encoders, or recurrent networks. In a different yet often closely related arena, the analysis of large amounts of data from the Electronic Health Recording, the Hospital Information Systems, and other medical data sources, success cases on companies, and new products have made possible new tools for estimation of in-hospital stay duration, chronic patient identification, and policies to reduce readmissions by preventing illness progression. Large and small companies have paid attention to this new era, in which machine learning and statistical analysis need to be revisited if they want to provide suitable algorithms, especially in healthcare scenarios, where patient data more than ever is becoming the key to improving patient healthcare. </p>

<p>Healthcare is now an open field for advantageous use of deep learning and big data advancements, and challenges are open in order to provide systems that can be accurate enough to be useful to the clinician and the patient in the health itinerary. Not only are large amounts of data available, but also sensitivity and specificity are to be paid special attention, as well as support systems rationally fitting into the health system. </p>

<p>The goal of this special issue was to put together relevant contributions, condensed into five key cornerstones of deep learning and big data applications in healthcare. On the one hand, the applications have included works with medical images (magnetic resonance, radioscopy and tomography, echography, nuclear medicine), contributions to signal processing (cardiac, neural, long-term monitoring, wellness devices), or data from large forms (primary attention, specialized medicine, clinical practice, electronic health recordings, hospital information systems, interoperability). The feature interpretation remains an open issue in deep learning and big data state-of-the-art, but it takes special relevance in healthcare applications in order to gain confidence in their use both by the healthcare staff and by the patients; so contributions including insights into this hot and open topic have naturally been provided. </p>

<p>The result is that accepted submissions have naturally grouped around a set of topics and techniques that can be considered as actual knowledge clusters in these fields, and they can be summarized as follows. </p>

<p>Medical structured data: Many applications deal with what we could denominate structured data, which includes as sources tabular data from trials, from the electronic health recording itself, or from data forms obtained from the patients. In, the failure of dental implants is early predicted using machine learning systems and considering a variety of features compared with previous approaches based on single factors. In, patient eligibility in interventional cancer clinical trials is predicted in terms of short statements considered as inclusion or exclusion criteria, and using pretrained word-embeddings as inputs to deep classifiers. In, blood transfusion in the sensitive case of orthopedic procedures is scrutinized in advance to surgery, and different classifiers (such as logistic regression and decision trees) are used to open the way to this new application. In, daily questionnaires from mobile applications are shown to suffer from missing data, and they are completed with a principled approach based on long-term–short-term memory networks, with representative case applications given by their use for activity, food, and biometrics in athletes. In, adverse drug reactions are analyzed from medical records of patients with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, using a generalized sequential pattern algorithm for early detection of their onset. In this work, the results provided with clinical information relevant for different medication groups, which can be useful for the involved physicians to stop the administration of suspected drugs in the early stages, are mined. </p>

<p>Medical unstructured data: A different application field can be established in the unstructured data (broadly speaking, free text, images, and others) that can be obtained from Hospital Information Systems and other related sources. In, concept detection in medical images is addressed with the help of unsupervised learning applied to the biomedical literature, with the use of bags of visual words, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. In, the behavioral characteristics of smartphone addiction are scrutinized by automatically collecting and analyzing data through an app. Cognitive bias is present between the self-reports and the automatically collected data, and here again data mining allows to show the relevant terms and items, hence contributing to knowledge discovery in these sources. In, a file system structure with distributed topography is developed to support the storage of large amounts of data from wellness recordings in the Internet of Things. In, the integration of atomic association rules with classification is improved to adapt large amounts of data, and it is used with advantage in Tibetan medical syndrome, a model of which is built in shorter time, with fewer rules but more understandable, and with higher accuracy than the conventional methods. </p>
