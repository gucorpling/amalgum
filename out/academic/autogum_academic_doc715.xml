<head> 5. Numerical Experiment</head>
<p>
In this section, a series of numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results proposed in this study. As shown in Proposition 1, there are several  values under different scenarios. Only some specific scenarios are illustrated in this section, while others can be similarly implemented. </p>

<p>Let . Under this setting,  for any positive , where  is defined in Proposition 1. In addition, assume that  lies in the [1, 10] interval. Thus  and , defined in Proposition 1, satisfy . Based on the parameter setting, the influences of  on  and  are shown in <figure>Figure 2</figure>. </p>

<p><figure>Figure 2</figure> shows some interesting phenomena. As shown in <figure>Figure 2</figure>a, both  and  increase in  when . However,  increases in  when . This is because condition  in Proposition 3(3) is not satisfied for any  when . <figure>Figure 2</figure> indicates that a higher  does not necessarily generate more profit with relatively low emission caps. That is likely because relatively low emission caps restrain the space of arbitrage through the carbon-trading market. It should be noted that  also decreases in  when  is less than a threshold. </p>

<p>Let , and . The influence of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> on profits is shown in <figure>Figure 3</figure>. <figure>Figure 3</figure> shows that  and  increase in <hi rend="italic">h</hi>. The product obtains more of a low-carbon premium with an increasing <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, which means that the consumer is willing to pay more for low-carbon products. </p>

<p>As stated in Proposition 1, there are several situations for . Let . Under this setting, , implies that . In addition,  for any  leads to . Profits under the two modes with respect to  are illustrated in <figure>Figure 4</figure>. As shown in <figure>Figure 4</figure>, the changing trends of  and  with respect to  are different. The curve of  is always below curve . This difference exists due to the effect of double marginalization. In order to investigate the influence of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> on profits, let  and . In this situation,  and . The curves of  and  with respect to <hi rend="italic">h</hi> are plotted in <figure>Figure 5</figure>. As shown in <figure>Figure 5</figure>, both  and  increase in <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, and always . </p>

<p>Let  and . It follows from the statement above,  and . The curves of  and  with respect to  are plotted in <figure>Figure 6</figure>. As shown in <figure>Figure 6</figure>, emissions under both modes decrease in . Emissions under a decentralized mode are always less than emissions under a centralized mode. When  and ,  and . The curves of emissions with respect to <hi rend="italic">h</hi> under the two modes are plotted in <figure>Figure 7</figure>. As shown in <figure>Figure 7</figure>, both of  and  decrease in <hi rend="italic">h</hi>. Moreover,  is greater than  for any <hi rend="italic">h</hi>. <figure>Figure 4</figure>, <figure>Figure 5</figure>, <figure>Figure 6</figure> and <figure>Figure 7</figure> indicate that the centralized mode dominates the decentralized mode, with higher profits and fewer emissions. </p>

<p>At the end of this section, the influence of  and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> on  and  is investigated. Since  is the feasible interval for , the length of  represents the manufacturerâ€™s decision flexibility in profit-sharing mode. Let  and . The influence of  on  and  is plotted by <figure>Figure 8</figure>. <figure>Figure 8</figure> shows the distance of , and  increases in , which the manufacturer has more decision flexibility with higher  under contract mode. Let  and , The influence of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> on  and  is plotted by <figure>Figure 9</figure>. In <figure>Figure 9</figure>, the distance of  and  expands with an increasing <hi rend="italic">h</hi>. In other words, the manufacturer has more decision flexibility with a higher <hi rend="italic">h</hi>. </p>
