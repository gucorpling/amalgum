<head> 3. Novel Comparison Laws, Distance and Entropy Measures for PHFLTS</head>
<p>
In this section, we attempt to develop novel comparison laws as well as define a novel distance measure for PHFLTS. The entropy measure for PHFLTS is adapted from the previous work by Liu et al..<b>Definition</b> <b>10.</b></p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">The lower bound (min) , upper bound (max) , and average value of the PHFLTS  are defined as:</hi> </p>

<p><dl class="html-order"><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(1)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">;</hi></dd><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(2)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">; and</hi></dd><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(3)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic"> where , , and .</hi></dd></dl></p>
<p>
<b>Definition</b> <b>11.</b>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">The envelope of the PHFLTS, denoted as , is an interval value whose lower and upper bounds are determined by Definition 10. Then,</hi>

(5)

<hi rend="italic">which id adapted from its previous counterpart—HFLTS envelope defined by Rodríguez et al..</hi><b>Definition</b> <b>12.</b>
<hi rend="italic">The comparison between two PHFLTSs  and  is defined based on the concept of the envelope and the average value of PHFLTS. The specific comparison rules are as follows.</hi> </p>

<p><dl class="html-order"><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(1)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">If , then ;</hi></dd><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(2)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">If , then</hi></dd></dl> </p>

<p><dl class="html-alpha-lower"><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">If , then ;</hi></dd><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">If , then</hi></dd></dl> </p>


<p><dl class="html-roman-lower"><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(i)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">;</hi></dd><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(ii)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">, where  represents the variance of .</hi></dd></dl> </p>

<p>It is worth noting that the comparison between arbitrary two PHFLTS envelopes is in fact comparing an interval value, which can be accomplished with reference to those defined for HFLTS envelope by Rodríguez et al..</p>
<p>
<b>Definition</b> <b>13.</b>
<hi rend="italic">Let  be an LTS, and let  and  be two PHFLTSs. The definition of the distance measure between them could be put forward as follows.</hi>

(6)

<hi rend="italic">where the , , and  have been defined in Definition 10.</hi> </p>

<p>The defined distance measure for PHFLTSs obviously satisfies the following axiomatic requirements: </p>

<p><dl class="html-alpha-lower"><dt id="">(a)</dt><dd>
;</dd><dt id="">(b)</dt><dd>
, if and only if ; and</dd><dt id="">(c)</dt><dd>
.</dd></dl></p>
<p>
<b>Proof.</b> 
The proof of (a) and (c) is obvious, and thus omitted here. We only need to prove that the proposed distance measure satisfies (b). </p>

<p>Firstly, we have

and

</p>

<p>It is evident that ,  if and only if the conditions that , and , are satisfied simultaneously, that is, , , , and . Then, based on the Definition 12, the above conditions could be satisfied only when . Therefore, , if and only if . </p>

<p>The proof is completed. □ </p>

<p>Given the proposed distance measure, we can define the similarity measure for PHFLTS based on Zadeh’s negation as follows.

(7)

</p>

<p>Similarly, the defined similarity measure satisfies the following basic axiomatic requirements: </p>

<p><dl class="html-alpha-lower"><dt id="">(a)</dt><dd>
;</dd><dt id="">(b)</dt><dd>
, if and only if ; and</dd><dt id="">(c)</dt><dd>
.</dd></dl> </p>

<p>The proofs are similar to those of the distance measure for PHFLTS, and thus they are omitted here. </p>

<p>The entropy measure is an important tool to express the mathematical values of the fuzziness of PHFLTS. We adapt the following entropy measures of PHFLTSs from those defined by Wei et al. for HFLTSs and those defined for probabilistic linguistic term set by Liu et al..<b>Definition</b> <b>14.</b>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Let  be an LTS, and let  be a PHFLTS. Then, the entropy measure for PHFLTSs is defined as follows.</hi> </p>

<p><dl class="html-order"><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(1)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">;</hi></dd><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(2)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">; and</hi></dd><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(3)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">.</hi></dd></dl> </p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Especially, we adopt the convention .</hi><b>Proposition</b> <b>1.</b>
<hi rend="italic">The entropy measure defined in Definition 14 satisfies the following properties:</hi> </p>

<p><dl class="html-order"><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(1)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">,</hi></dd><dt id=""><hi rend="italic">(2)</hi> </dt><dd>
<hi rend="italic">.</hi></dd></dl> </p>

<p>The proofs of Proposition 1 are similar to those of Wei et al. and Liu et al. and, therefore, are omitted here. Furthermore, one can refer to the works of Tian et al. and Gou et al. for more definitions of information measures such as cross-entropy, relative entropy, and hesitant entropy. The proposed entropy measure for PHFLTS entails the advantages of superior interpretability and applicability. In addition, it preserves the ability to measure the information contained in PHFLTSs and assure the reliability of the derived weights, as discussed in the subsequent section. </p>
