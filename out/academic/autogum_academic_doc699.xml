Twenty-first century Western fears about Islamic extremism are not new. William Shakespeare makes reference to the threat of Turkish invasion and spread of Islam in nearly half of his dramas of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The use of terms like “infidels” (<hi rend="italic">King Richard III</hi>), “Mahomet” (<hi rend="italic">King Henry VI—Part One</hi>), and “Turks” (in <hi rend="italic">Hamlet, Othello,</hi> etc.) reminded Elizabethan audiences of the Ottoman advance into Europe with the intent of conquest and conversion. In Shakespeare’s tragedy <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, the hero, a Christian converted from Islam, murders his wife after being tricked into believing she has committed adultery. Subsequently learning of her innocence, he then kills himself to pay for his criminal act. Critics of the play have devised a number of theories about Othello’s character and behavior. However, I believe Shakespeare reveals the dilemma of a Moorish husband divided between his dueling Muslim and Christian identities.  </p>

<p>In several plays, Shakespeare features a non-Caucasian character who, despite villainous conduct resulting in disgrace or punishment, manages to draw our sympathy along with our condemnation. Aaron the Moor, Shylock the Jew, Caliban, and Othello offend viewers’ moral and legal sensibilities. Yet, Shakespeare draws our attention to these characters’ humanity, emphasizing some qualities that make them eerily similar to us. Their divided nature mirrors contradictions in ours. We see this in Othello’s agonizing attempts to ignore Iago’s accusations of Desdemona as well as his final repentance for her murder. This article will focus on Shakespeare’s development of Othello’s hybrid Muslim-Christian identity that ultimately leads to his downfall. Considering throughout various ways in which recent critical discussions of Islam in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> in the past decade and a half have enriched our understanding of Shakespeare’s tragedy, this article will seek to participate in these discussions even as it offers its own contribution to how Islam is treated in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>. The information used in this article is not intended to convey an authoritative purview of Islam or its scriptures and interpretations. Rather, it offers introductory contexts from a lay perspective as consideration for potential influences on William Shakespeare’s construction of his character Othello, recognizing throughout that Shakespeare neither directly mentions Sharia in the play nor demonstrates awareness of the various complex manifestations of Sharia within Islamic culture.  </p>

<p>Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century travel reports, business exchanges, and harem tales, along with numerous encounters between eastern and western cultures, seemingly influenced Shakespeare’s treatment of this theme of dueling identities. A growing body of contemporary research reveals new insights into Elizabethan understanding of Islamic culture and its impact on stage drama. But was Shakespeare familiar with the concept of the Qur’an-based Sharia, a code of conduct and honor principles governing family relations and social contexts? If so, how did his understanding impact the development of Othello’s character? Othello the Moor is a naval general who, seemingly converted to Christianity as a youth (possibly by force), alternates between Christian and Muslim identities when confronted by allegations of adultery against his bride, Desdemona. Othello’s wounded ego and his appeal to justice in murdering Desdemona becomes evident in his wavering between Christian identity as a husband emotionally struggling with the belief that his wife has been unfaithful and Muslim beliefs demanding justice to reestablish honor.  </p>

<p>Othello’s shifting identity can be considered within the larger framework of personal identity in the theater during Shakespeare’s time. Although racial stereotypes played a role in Elizabethan perceptions of non-European beliefs and values, Peter Berek raises the question of the fluidity of social and religious identity on the Elizabethan stage: “The theater of the 1590s was obsessed by the possibilities that identity might be willed or chosen and social position achieved by deeds, not birth” (Berek 1998, p. 130). Plays like <hi rend="italic">Tamburlaine</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi>, and Shakespeare’s tetralogy beginning with <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi> and ending with <hi rend="italic">Henry V</hi> underscore this theme. Marranos, or Iberian Jews converted to Christianity, are plausible representations of the notion that identity is not stable and can be created by individuals themselves, an idea that has stood the test of time. Othello is a prime example of shifting identities: He was presumably born Muslim, kidnapped into slavery, and converted to Christianity; he eventually became a Venetian general who secretly married into Venice’s ruling class and led a military expedition to Cyprus. During the play, questions subtly arise as to whether he is Christian or Muslim, Venetian or Moor, honorable or criminal. This duality serves as the locus of his (dis)orientation and resulting actions.  </p>
