Due to the characteristics of the currently available and emerging LULC data sets as well as the state of the knowledge of the monarchs’ migratory habitat, the geographic extent of this habitat and the LULC changes within it that might be affecting the monarchs’ population can only be measured and modeled at a coarse resolution and more appropriately at a regional level. The issues that create challenges and limitations to these assessments can be categorized into: (a) LULC data sets characteristics and temporal availability; (b) availability of ancillary land management information; (c) ability to construct accurate forage suitability indices based on knowledge of the phenology and abundance of plant species used by monarchs during their migration (e.g., <ref target="https://www.usanpn.org/news/spring">https://www.usanpn.org/news/spring</ref>); and (d) level of knowledge of the ecological and behavioral patterns of the monarch during their journey. Improvement in these areas will increase our ability to understand, model, and predict the implications of LULC and its changes in the migration habitat and on monarchs’ population changes. Despite limitations, analyses and modeling with current data must be carried out to assist in reducing uncertainties and creating approximations to support the design and execution of management and conservation actions. In what follows, we touch briefly on each of these challenges.  </p>

<p>Currently available LULC data sets need improvement in spatial resolution, thematic classes’ granularity, expanding their extent across borders, and to be available and homogenous for at least two dates to enable change detection analyses. The highest resolution currently available for cross-border analyses is 30 m (GlobeLand30). At this resolution, the intricacies of landscape mosaics that are conducive to foraging or roosting in the migratory habitat are not detectable (e.g., grassland along roadsides, streams, disturbed patches of forest, and vegetative corridors through urban areas). GlobeLand30′s coarse thematic classes granularity (10 classes) does not distinguish between types of forests, shrublands, or grasslands. This limits the ability to estimate the density of nectar-producing flora associated with each land cover type. Data sets with higher thematic classes’ granularity such as the INEGI Series or the NLCD are not cross-border. Trying to overlap these higher thematic granularity data sets with GlobeLand30 to refine its LULC classes propagates classification errors, and the resulting product is not reliable for better estimating migratory habitat. We have tested this approach over small areas with unsatisfactory results. Additionally, the thematic classifications of the US and Mexico national data sets are not homogeneous in resolution, number of classes, and accuracy across the border and hence cannot be compared or combined with other LULC data sets. Both thematic granularity and spatial resolution need to be homogenized in time and space to be able to perform LULC change detection analyses across the entire extent of monarch migratory habitat. </p>

<p>In addition to accurately and precisely knowing the type of LULC, land management practices can determine whether a specific LULC type is conducive to migratory habitat or not. This is most notable for pesticide and herbicide application, vegetation maintenance practices (e.g., forest fuel treatments, mowing), and creation of supplemented monarch foraging vegetation. Agriculture and grasslands are found to be some of the most conducive LULC types to foraging. However, herbicides can destroy naturally occurring nectar sources, and pesticides can weaken and kill monarchs directly. This brings into question the conduciveness of agricultural fields, pasture/rangeland, grasslands along roadsides or utility rights-of-way, and various vegetative corridors and mosaics through urban environments (e.g., parks, home gardens). This information is not well documented, especially throughout Mexico. Forest fuel treatments, such as prescribed burns and thinning, create disturbed areas that can create additional foraging for monarchs. Due to the spatial resolution and temporal lag between LULC data sets, it is not possible to detect where these practices are occurring. Mowing also can destroy conducive grassland habitat. Fallowing practices on pasture and rangeland can also determine the foraging habitat availability. Efforts to create supplemented foraging, such as the Interstate-35 milkweed corridor and the US National Park Service efforts to improve migratory pollinator corridors, need to be easily accessible in formats that can be input into geographic information systems (GIS) to better support the study and modeling of migratory habitat. </p>

<p>Many species of nectar producing flora that are conducive for the monarch habitat have been identified. However, it is difficult to assess the amount of foraging these plant species collectively supply over the extent of the monarchs’ migration. While the USDA has created a foraging suitability index for native pollinators, it is more focused on the honeybee, specific to the US, and comes with a host of limitations. A monarch migration specific foraging suitability index has yet to be created. The Instituto de Ecología of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) (Ecology Institute in the National Autonomous University of Mexico) has been working on identifying monarch-conducive plant species and consolidating this information for easy access. Additionally, for each plant species, it is necessary to document information about its geographic extent, associated land cover type, density estimations, nectar production, monarch usage, effects of land management practices, and phenological behavior. </p>
