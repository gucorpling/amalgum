<p>
The game between farmers and agricultural social service providers is a dynamic game. This study applied backward induction to estimate, first, the agricultural social service provider’s strategic choices and then, the farmers’ decisions. </p>

<head> 3.1.1. Strategic Choices of the Agricultural Social Service Provider</head>
<p>
When the farmer chose the T-year-trusteeship strategy (T), the social service provider had to choose between long-term behaviors and short-term behaviors. His choice depended on the returns from the two options,  and  respectively, i.e., whichever was the higher one. According to the Equations (4) and (6), from , we get . This is noted as , and its economic significance is that if the social service provider chose long-term behaviors, it would pay a fixed investment amount <hi rend="italic">z</hi> that takes  to recover but could save operating costs of  each year. The result suggests that if the farmer chose the T-year-trusteeship strategy and if , the social service provider would choose long-term behaviors; if the contrary was true, they would choose short-term behaviors. </p>

<p>When the farmer chose the 1-year-trusteeship strategy (1), the social service provider had to choose between long-term behaviors and short-term behaviors, which he would choose depending on returns from the two options,  and  respectively, i.e., whichever was the higher one. According to Equations (8) and (10), from , we get . This result suggests that if the farmer chose the 1-year trusteeship strategy and if the agricultural social service provider thought that their years of trusteeship out of T years are , the social service provider would still choose long-term behaviors; if the contrary was true, they would choose short-term behaviors. </p>

<head> 3.1.2. Strategic Choices of the Farmer</head>
<p>
The agricultural social service provider’s strategic choices and the farmer’s countermeasures are discussed in terms of three circumstances with respect to the lengths of ,  and , namely , , and , respectively shown in Table 2. </p>

<p>When , the agricultural social service provider would choose long-term behaviors and the farmer’s return when choosing the T-year trusteeship strategy and the 1-year trusteeship strategy would be  and , respectively, based on which the farmer would make their strategic choice. According to Equations (3) and (7), from , we get . Its economic significance is that if the farmer could entrust their land long enough, the agricultural social service provider would be certain to choose long-term behaviors, and if the agreed trusteeship price  was lower than the expected trusteeship price for T years , the farmer would choose a long-term contract, and the result of the game equilibrium will be T-L. If the contrary was true, the farmer would choose a short-term contract and the result of game equilibrium will be 1-L. </p>

<p>When , the agricultural social service provider would choose their strategy according to the farmer’s strategic choice. If the farmer chose the T-year-trusteeship strategy, the agricultural social service provider would choose long-term behaviors. If the farmer chose a 1-year-trusteeship strategy, the agricultural social service provider would choose short-term behaviors. The farmer’s returns in the two circumstances are  and . They would make their strategic choice depending on whichever was larger. According to Equations (3) and (9), from , we get .  is the monotonically increasing function of t in the neighborhood of T, whose range is , and  is the monotonically decreasing function of t in the neighborhood of T, whose range is . Therefore, , whose economic significance is that if the sum of the output return and fixed investment as a result of the agricultural social service provider seeking long-term behaviors was not lower than the possible loss due to fluctuations in trusteeship prices, the farmer would choose T-year trusteeship, and the result of the game equilibrium would be T-L, otherwise the farmer would choose the trusteeship once a year, and the result of the game equilibrium would be 1-S. </p>

<p>When , the agricultural social service provider would choose short-term behaviors and the farmer’s return when choosing the T-year trusteeship strategy and the 1-year trusteeship strategy would be  and , respectively, based on which the farmer would make his strategic choice. According to Equations (5) and (9), from , we get , and its economic significance is that if the farmer entrusted their land for a time that was short enough, the agricultural social service provider would be certain to choose short-term behaviors, and if the agreed trusteeship price  was lower than the expected trusteeship price for T years , the farmer would still choose T-year trusteeship and the result of the game equilibrium would be T-S. If the contrary is true, the farmer would choose a short-term contract, and the result of the game equilibrium would be 1-S. </p>

<head> 3.2. Results of Equilibrium under the Variable Price System</head>
<p>
The calculation of game results under the variable-price system is similar to that under the fixed-price system, namely estimating the agricultural social service provider’s strategic choices first and then the farmer’s strategic choices. </p>
