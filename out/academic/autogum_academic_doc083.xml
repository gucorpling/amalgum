<head> 3. Performance of Plastics and Glass-based Greenhouse Cladding Materials</head>
<p>
The performance of the greenhouse cladding materials were evaluated based on the following criteria; mean daytime and nighttime temperature, carbon dioxide concentration within the greenhouse, water vapor pressure deficit, specific leaf weight, leaf chlorophyll content, and dry matter content. In addition, the ray emission model (REM) was employed to estimate the heat losses within the greenhouse. The selection of the above parameters was informed by previous research studies that adopted these techniques to analyze the optical properties, thermal performance, and supplemental lighting of silica glasses, PVC, polyolefins, LDPE, double inflated polyethylene (D-poly), and acrylic. In particular, Al-Mahdouri and co-researchers adopted the REM method to evaluate the thermal performance of plastic and glass cladding materials because it was a rigorous technique for evaluating heat losses within a greenhouse. The data in Table 5 were obtained from three separate greenhouses for three months. The letters a, b, and c are used to denote significant variations. </p>

<p>The data suggest that the three greenhouse materials had comparable performance in retaining heat within the greenhouse structure (daytime and night-time temperatures. However, there was considerable variation in water vapor pressure deficit if glass materials were employed to clad the greenhouse structures. The p-value used to determine significance was 0.5. The VPD was the lowest in double inflated polyethylene. Low VPD levels induce calcium deficiency and reduction in the plant foliage and fruit yield. In contrast, CO2 concentration was most pronounced in greenhouse structures covered with acrylic materials. The variations in VPD levels between glass and polyethylene are attributed to differences in heat conduction and differences in humidity depending on the season. </p>

<p>Following the comparison of the three materials, glass was a suitable material when it is necessary to maintain high VPD and low to average CO2 concentrations. In contrast, glass was preferred if the regulation of CO2 levels was an issue of interest. The data is comparable to Papadopoulos and Hao's research, which reported low light transmissivity in acrylic materials compared to D-poly or glass. As noted in the earlier sections, the seasonal weather variations impact heat retention and VPD levels in the different covering materials. Papadopoulos and Hao noted that the VPD levels in D-poly and acrylic greenhouses did not always remain low. The VPD of acrylic and D-poly materials was comparable to glass in January and February, as shown in Table 7. However, there were considerable differences in March, April, and July - a factor that impacted plant maturity and fruit development. </p>

<p>The highest leaf weight (top, middle, and bottom) was recorded in glass-cladded greenhouses, as shown in Table 6. Similarly, the chlorophyll content (bottom, middle, and new) was highest in the glass-cladded greenhouses. Despite these differences, the rate of photosynthesis was comparable. On the downside, the glass covers resulted in greater solar irradiation—a factor that led to more significant dry matter content and fruit dry matter content. Both D-poly and glass greenhouses had higher fruit yields compared to acrylic greenhouses. In general, glass and D-polymer were ideal materials compared to acrylic due to the optimization of chlorophyll content and photosynthesis. However, acrylic greenhouses had the best fruit weight, which translated to better fruit grades.  </p>

<p>The yield reported by contrasts with who reported that D-poly materials provided the best yield - the difference can be attributed to the plant under cultivation; data in Table 7 and Table 8 are specific to cucumber cultivation while Table 9 is specific to tomatoes. Therefore, the suitability of D-poly, acrylic, and glass covering materials is dependent on the types of plants grown in the greenhouse and the weather. Other studies have suggested that acrylic covering materials could offer better performance compared to D-poly and glass, but aging (photo-degradation and oxidation) and weathering were primary risk factors. </p>

<head> 3.1. Percentage of UV-Transmittance</head>
<p>
The optical properties of LDPE plastic sheets are dependent on the percentage of UV-A and UV-B transmittance (0%, 3%, and 5% transmittance). The data in Table 8 and Table 9 illustrates that the different UV transmittance percentages influenced the transmission of different UV wavelengths, which determine PAR and UV-B radiation reaching the plants and the rate of photosynthesis and damage to the canopy.  </p>

<p>The values in Table 10 affirm that plastic films with 0% UV transmitted the least UV-B rays as illustrated by the low greenhouse radiation transmission coefficient (τ). In contrast, the rate of UV-B transmittance was highest in 5% UV plastic films. The percentage of UV-A and UV-B transmittance had a domino effect on water vapor pressure deficit, plant canopy, and fruit quality, as shown in Table 11; less exposure to harmful UV-B radiation resulted in higher plant weight and fruit weight (0% UV plastic films). Based on the empirical data, 0% UV plastic films were best suited for greenhouse cladding based on the optical properties. However, the 3%UV plastic films resulted in better leaf width and photosynthesis. </p>
