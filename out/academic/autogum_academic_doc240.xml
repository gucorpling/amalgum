<head> 4. The Belief Structure of Neighborhood-Covering Multigranulation Rough Set</head>
<p>
Next, we use the belief and plausibility function to analyze the belief structure of the neighborhood-covering multigranulation rough set. Tan et al. pointed out that only the pessimistic multigranulation rough sets have the belief structure. Therefore, we only discuss the belief structure of neighborhood-covering pessimistic multigranulation rough sets. </p>

<p>Let <hi rend="italic">P</hi> be an average probability distribution, i.e.,  for , where  denotes the cardinality of a set. </p>

<p>Chen et al. stated that the neighborhood-covering single-granularity rough sets have the belief structure. If the covering <hi rend="italic">C</hi> is single-granularity covering in the model of neighborhood-covering multigranulation rough set, then the neighborhood-covering multigranulation rough sets are reduced to neighborhood-covering single-granularity rough sets. This is a special case in the model of neighborhood-covering multigranulation rough set, where the belief and plausibility function can be employed to characterize the belief structure.<b>Theorem</b> <b>1.</b>
<p>
<hi rend="italic"> Let  be a covering information system. If the covering C is single-granularity covering, then there is a belief structure such that for any ,</hi>

(12)

<hi rend="italic">Then  is a belief function on U, and  is a plausibility function on U.</hi><b>Corollary</b> <b>1.</b>
<p>
<hi rend="italic"> Let  be a covering information system. If the covering C is single-granularity covering, then there is a belief structure such that for any ,</hi>

(13)

<hi rend="italic">Then  is a belief function on U, and  is a plausibility function on U.</hi> </p>

<p>However, whether the belief structure exists in the general case of neighborhood-covering multigranulation rough set needs to be further discussed. First, we use the union of sets and transform the neighborhood-covering pessimistic multigranulation rough set to the neighborhood-covering single-granulation rough set. Then we use the relationship partition function to establish the relationship between neighborhood-covering and partition, and transform the neighborhood-covering single-granulation rough set into the single-granulation classic rough set. Finally, we obtain the relationship between the evidence theory and neighborhood-covering multigranulation rough set. </p>

<p>We use the following definition to transform the neighborhood-covering pessimistic multigranulation rough set to the neighborhood-covering single-granulation rough set.<b>Definition</b> <b>13.</b>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Let  be a covering information system and  be a family of coverings of U. For ,  denotes a covering based on the covering family C w.r.t the neighborhood of x.</hi> </p>

<p>The definition of covering in Definition 13 is the single-grain covering of <hi rend="italic">U</hi>, therefore the pessimistic multigranulation rough set is transformed into the single-grain rough set. Next, we will define the relationship partitioning function, establish the relationship between covering and partition, and transform the covering rough set into the classic rough set.<b>Theorem</b> <b>2.</b>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Let U be a universe and C be a covering of U. For , we define the relationship partition function , . Then  is a partition of U.</hi><b>Proof</b> <b>of Theorem 2.</b>
<p>
First, we prove that , for . </p>

<p>Suppose there exists  such that . Then, , which contradicts with . Thus, , for . </p>

<p>Second, we prove that . For any , we have  and . Hence, . </p>

<p>Therefore,  is a partition of <hi rend="italic">U</hi>. □ </p>

<p>Because of Theorem 2, we transform the covering rough set into the classic rough set. Yao et al. showed that the belief and plausibility functions can be derived by the lower and upper approximation operators in rough set theory. So, the following theorem holds.<b>Theorem</b> <b>3.</b>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Let  be a covering information system,  be a family of coverings of U. For any , a probability assignment function is , and its definition is as follows:</hi>

(14)

<hi rend="italic">then the belief and plausibility function on U are</hi>

(15)

(16)

<b>Proof</b> <b>of Theorem 3.</b>
<p>
By Theorem 2, we have . </p>

<p>The following proves . </p>

<p>We have: </p>

<p>. </p>

<p>In addition, , and thus  if and only if . </p>

<p>Furthermore, we can easily conclude that ⇔. </p>

<p>Hence, </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The proof of  is similar. Thus, we can assert this conclusion. □ </p>

<p>Next, we will give a counterexample to illustrate that neighborhood-covering optimistic multigranulation rough set approximation cannot be characterized by evidence theory.<b>Example</b> <b>2.</b>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Let  be a covering information system, ,  be a family of coverings of U. , , . Let , .</hi> </p>

<p><hi rend="italic">We can calculate:</hi> </p>

<p><hi rend="italic">, , , ,</hi> </p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Then</hi> </p>

<p><hi rend="italic"></hi> </p>

<p><hi rend="italic">We assume that  for all .</hi> </p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Therefore, , , , .</hi> </p>

<p><hi rend="italic">As we know, a belief function satisfies the following:</hi> </p>

<p>∀ </p>

<p><hi rend="italic">However, in this example, we have .</hi> </p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Thus, neighborhood-covering optimistic multigranulation rough set approximation cannot be characterized by belief and plausibility functions.</hi> </p>
