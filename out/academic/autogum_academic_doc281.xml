Consider a mmWave cellular network consisting of base stations, blockages, and a source transmitter, which is a UE. The UE attempts to connect to the N closest base stations, and therefore operates in a th order macrodiversity mode. The locations of the base stations are modeled as an infinite homogeneous PPP with density . We assume the centers of the blockages also form a homogeneous PPP with density , independent from the base station process. Let  indicate the source transmitter and its location. Due to the stationarity of the PPPs, and without loss of generality, we can assume the coordinates are chosen such that the source transmitter is located at the origin; i.e., . In Section 6, we will consider additional transmitters located in neighboring cells, which act as interferers. </p>

<p>Let  for <hi rend="italic">i</hi>  denote the base stations and their locations. Let  be the distance from  to . Base stations are ordered according to their distances to  such that . The signal of the source transmitter is received at the closest <hi rend="italic">N</hi> base stations, and hence, <hi rend="italic">N</hi> is the number of  connected to . For a PPP, a derivation of the distribution of  is given in Appendix B, which implies a methodology for generating these distances within a simulation. </p>

<p><figure>Figure 1</figure> shows an example of second-order macrodiversity () cellular network where the user attempts to connect to its closest two base stations. The solid line indicates the link from the user to the base station is LOS, while the dashed line indicates the link is NLOS. The figure shows examples of two different blockage scenarios. In <figure>Figure 1</figure>a the closest base station () is LOS while  is NLOS to the user, in which case the blockage only blocks a single link. In <figure>Figure 1</figure>b a single blockage blocks both links to  and . The fact that sometimes a single blockage can block both links is an illustration of the effect of correlated blocking. </p>

<head> 2.2. Blockage Model</head>
<p>
As in, each blockage is a segment of length <hi rend="italic">W</hi>. To capture the worst-case scenario, as shown in <figure>Figure 2</figure>a, it is assumed that the line representing the blockage is perpendicular to the line that connects it to the transmitter. Although <hi rend="italic">W</hi> can itself be random as in, we assume here that all blockages have the same value of <hi rend="italic">W</hi>. In <figure>Figure 2</figure>a, the red stars indicate the blocked base stations, which are located in the blue shaded region. If a blockage cuts the path from  to , then the signal from  is NLOS, while otherwise it is LOS. Here, we assume that NLOS signals are completely blocked while LOS signals experience exponential path-loss with a path-loss exponent ; i.e., the power received by  is proportional to . </p>

<p>Each base station has a blockage region associated with it, illustrated by the blue shaded rectangles shown in <figure>Figure 2</figure>b. We use  to denote the blockage region associated with  and its area; i.e.,  is both a region and an area. If the center of a blockage falls within , then  will be blocked since at least some part of the blockage will intersect the path between  and . Because  is a rectangle of length  and width <hi rend="italic">W</hi>, it is clear that . Unless  and  are exactly on opposite sides of the region, there will be an overlapping region <hi rend="italic">v</hi> common to both  and . Because of the overlap, it is possible for a single blockage to simultaneously block both  and  if the blockage falls within region <hi rend="italic">v</hi>, which corresponds to correlated blocking. </p>
