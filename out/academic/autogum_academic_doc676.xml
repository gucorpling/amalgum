This paper tackles the joint price and greenness decisions of the finance-constrained supply chain. Three streams of literature are related with our work, namely, green supply chain management (GSCM), green supply chain collaboration and coordination, and emerging enterprises’ operational strategies under financial constraints. </p>

<p>Mathu pointed that when focusing on lean and agile supply chains, closed-loop supply chains, reverse logistics, and the practice of just in time, the operation is transformed to GSCM. GSCM can be seen as an environmental innovation, which integrates environmental thinking into supply chain management (SCM). It aims to minimize or eliminate wastages including hazardous chemical, energy and emissions along supply chain. As reviewed by Ashby et al., Green product development has been long recognized as one of the main themes in GSCM. Enterprises apply tools such as design for environment, design for disassemble, and life cycle analysis in order to reduce the product’s environmental impact. It is believed that enterprises implementing GSCM practices can benefit from cost savings, better public image and decreased environmental liability. What is more, it is supported that GSCM is closely related to the participants’ financial performance. Feng et al. suggest that GSCM as an integral supply chain strategy is positively associated with both environmental and financial performance. Flammer finds that enterprises’ ecofriendly behavior is closely related to significant stock price increases, whereas enterprises with eco-harmful behavior face decreases in stock price. Zhang et al. proposes social control as an effective mechanism to strengthen the impact of GSCM on enterprises’ financial performance. Following these researches, this paper pays attention to the green products, investigates the relationship between product greenness and the enterprises’ utilities. Different from previous literatures, this paper considers not only the relationship between product greenness and the enterprise’ profits, but also the relationship between product greenness and the finance-constrained enterprise’s survival probability. </p>

<p>Among the issues in GSCM, collaboration is the most important. Chin et al. indicate that environmental collaboration is a key relational capability to facilitate the GSCM strategic formulation and execution. Further, from the perspective of supply chain coordination and the development of economic models, green supply chain coordinating issues are also developed and discussed widely. Zhang and Liu study the decisions in a three-level supply chain with market demand and product greenness related. It is pointed out that revenue-sharing mechanism, Shapley-value coordination mechanism, and asymmetric Nash negotiation mechanism can all improve the performance in a decentralized supply chain. Zhu and He introduce quality (greenness) as a decision variable, and study the green product design in the competitive supply chain. Ghosh and Shah compare the pricing, greenness, and supply chain revenue in the decentralized channel structure, and propose that two-part tariff contracts can coordinate the green supply chain and cooperation can improve product greenness. Ghosh and Shah study the manufacturer-retailer supply chain where consumers have preference for greenness, and find that cooperation with cost-sharing contracts can improve the greenness and revenue of supply chains, but bargaining between manufacturer and retailer would not increase the retailer’s revenue. Swami and Shah focus on channel conflicts between manufacturers and retailers in green supply chains, and study coordination problems among green supply chain members. Contributing to this stream of literatures, this paper (i) constructs a two-stage cooperative analytical framework between the supplier and the manufacturer for the long-term, and cross-stage R &amp; D process of green products; (ii) examines the impact of investment-sharing contract on green innovation in the sustainable supply chain cooperation. </p>

<p>Recently, an increasing of scholars have paid attention to the emerging enterprises’ operational strategies under financial constraints. Babich argues that only when the enterprises survive in the market, can they make profits in the long term. Under the financial constraints, the emerging enterprises would be exposed to bankruptcy risk, should the market fail as expected. Therefore, studies on emerging enterprises’ innovating activities also focus on the emerging enterprises’ survival probability. According to Cefis and Marsili, emerging enterprises can increase their survival probability through innovations. Criscuolo et al. find that emerging enterprises in the service industry have a higher probability of innovation. In contrast, Shane finds that most emerging enterprises start from ordinary industries without special creativity. Bhidé argues that only 6% of the giant enterprises began by offering unique products or services, while 58% began by offering alternatives of existing products and services. Thus, different from the empirical researches, this paper (i) adopts a two-stage analytical framework to conduct theoretical researches on green innovation decisions of the emerging enterprises, and (ii) expands the research of financial constraints from a single enterprise level into the supply chain level. </p>
