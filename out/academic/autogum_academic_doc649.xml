There is little published literature considering the role of palliative radiotherapy in metastatic sarcoma, although it is recommended as a treatment option for palliation by both the UK bone and soft tissue sarcoma guidelines and the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines. To the authors’ knowledge this is the largest retrospective study published to date reviewing the use of palliative radiotherapy for sarcoma. The results confirm that palliative radiotherapy can successfully provide symptomatic benefit to patients with metastatic sarcoma. This study is limited by being retrospective such that the assessment of symptomatic improvement could only be assessed from documentation in medical records. It was therefore not possible to quantify the amount of symptomatic improvement seen or indeed to be certain of the accuracy of the results. The aim of this review, however, was to confirm that radiotherapy does have a role in the palliation of advanced sarcomas and to guide future prospective studies to gain more accurate evidence of the use of palliative radiotherapy in this setting. In addition, this study was limited by the heterogeneous population studied. Both soft tissue and bone sarcomas of multiple types were included. The radiobiology of the different subtypes of sarcoma has not been well studied, but it is accepted that these tumours tend to be relatively radio-resistant, with a high alpha beta ratio. There have been several publications considering the role of palliative radiotherapy for other, more common solid tumour types. A meta-analysis has shown that when treating bone metastases from a number of different primary tumour sites and histology’s, there appears to be little short-term symptomatic benefit in a fractionated course of radiotherapy, compared to a single fraction. Most oncologists therefore advocate the use of a single fraction to control pain secondary to bone metastases. With longer follow-up, however, it seems that patients treated with a fractionated course of palliative radiotherapy are less likely to need retreatment than those given a single fraction. This study demonstrates that selected patients with advanced sarcoma can benefit from palliative radiotherapy provided their prognosis is long enough for the benefits from radiotherapy, in terms of symptomatic improvement, to outweigh the inconvenience of undergoing radiotherapy and the associated side effects that they may suffer. </p>

<p>As sarcomas are felt to be intrinsically radio-resistant, it can be hypothesized that a single fraction of palliative radiotherapy may not be sufficient to offer adequate symptomatic benefit. The results presented here suggest a higher symptomatic response rate with a biological effective dose (BED) of 50 or greater. <figure>Figure 3</figure>b demonstrates an increase in response rate with increasing BED up to 50 Gy4. Beyond this point the response is maintained but does not appear to increase further, suggesting very high doses of palliative radiotherapy may not be necessary to achieve a good symptomatic response in this patient group. The one apparent outlier in <figure>Figure 3</figure>b is the 100% symptomatic response in patients receiving a BED of 30–39.9, this is likely to be an outlier as there was only one patient in this group. </p>

<p>Because of the limited evidence available in the use of radiotherapy for palliation in sarcoma the Royal College of Radiologists Radiotherapy dose fractionation guidance (3rd edition) recommends several different dose fractionation schedules (Table 5). Excluding 8 Gy single fraction and 20 Gy in 5 fractions which are commonly used schedules for all solid tumours; the remaining recommended dose fractionation schedules all have a BED of greater than 50 Gy4. Although this case series has demonstrated that very high doses of radiotherapy may not provide additional short-term symptomatic benefit, longer courses of radiotherapy may be considered in patients with a good performance status and prognosis in an attempt to provide a longer period of symptomatic benefit without the need for retreatment. A previously published case series of 17 patients who received palliative radiotherapy for sarcoma using 39 Gy in 13 fractions over two and a half weeks demonstrated this was well tolerated and provided high rates of durable pain control. Collection of survival data may help to assess if the correct patients are being offered higher dose, longer courses of radiotherapy. <figure>Figure 4</figure> however does not appear to show any correlation between the BED of the radiotherapy delivered and overall survival. Interpretation of this data is extremely limited because of the heterogeneity of the patient population with multiple different histological subtypes and the small numbers of patients treated with each dose and fractionation schedule. </p>

<p>To gain a better understanding of the most appropriate dose and fractionation schedules for different sarcoma subtypes large volume, multicentre, prospective data collections is required using a small number of different dose and fractionation schedules, ideally those outlined by the Royal College of Radiologists (Table 5). </p>
