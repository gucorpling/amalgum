<head> 3. Analytic Network Process Approach</head>
<p>
In this paper we consider the use of a multiple criteria decision analysis method to rank all the locations potentially suitable for siting a freight lorry parking. </p>

<p>In line with objective RO.1, the first subsection deals with the analysis of the stakeholders and their objectives. The main task here is to identify the relationships between different classes of stakeholders and the issues they care about most, as these will constitute the basic elements in developing our Spatial Decision Support System. Following such analyses, and consistently with research objective R0.2, we explore the possible use of ANP as a suitable model component for our SDSS. Although we first also considered using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, we soon realised that the complexity of the problem rendered this method unsuitable. The characteristics of this problem cannot in fact be hierarchically represented, as it involves logical interconnections between elements in a complicated dependency structure that allows elements on different levels to influence each other. Moreover, a purely hierarchical model cannot encompass the case of alternatives potentially influencing the weights associated to the criteria. Since in the lorry parking location problem the elements influencing the decision-making process turn out to be highly interconnected, the Analytic Network Process (ANP) permits to model the problem in a more complete way by controlling and estimating all the element interconnections. That is possible because ANP is able to generalise the AHP approach by allowing the presence of any type of possible mutual influences among the elements. In the ANP method, the problem is structured as a network, and its elements are evaluated through a pairwise comparisons approach to measure their weights in the model, which, after some matrix calculations, allows ranking of the alternatives considered in the problem. A detailed description of the proposed ANP method is provided in Section 3.2, where we focus on the process of constructing the ANP network model for the specific lorry parking location problem. To this aim, we first outline the main phases of the ANP (RO.2) and then construct the ANP dependency network model based on the outcomes of the stakeholder analysis (RO.3-RO.4). </p>

<head> 3.1. Stakeholder Analysis</head>
<p>
In the process of making a decision on a public matter, the starting point for the theoretical model should be the various stakeholders and their interests. The stakeholders are those individuals or organisations that have personal interest and influence in the decision process because they have goals directly or indirectly affected by the problem and its possible resolution. Consequently, the first essential step in a public decision-making problem process is classification of the stakeholders involved and their interests. The stakeholders identified in our decision-making problem alongside their main objectives are drafted in Table 1. </p>

<p>As expected in a real problem scenario, we can see that there are multiple stakeholders with different and conflicting interests. Local residents are directly affected by inappropriate HGV parking, as highlighted in Section 2, and their main interest is to maximise the distance between their homes and HGV traffic and hence the freight lorry parking. Local residents are the primary source of information on inappropriate parking through their reporting of nuisances to local authorities, and these complaints are the spur for political action to tackle the problem. Local businesses are also affected by inappropriate parking, as road congestion causes delay in incoming deliveries. Because local businesses are the main factor in the generation of HGV flow, through their involvement it is possible to obtain information about the HGV flow that would otherwise be difficult to obtain, such as the number of daily deliveries in the area. City Council holds an indirect interest in the problem since it is concerned with the general well being of the local population; hence, it could decide to provide financial support for construction of a freight lorry parking and enact policies to discourage inappropriate parking. To ensure a positive revenue stream, a freight lorry parking needs to be attractive to drivers, which means it should offer security for their goods and access to amenities while avoiding costly HGV deviations from their original routes. Freight lorry parking owners can be interested in the project as it represents a long-term financial investment. </p>

<head> 3.2. Building an ANP Model for the Considered Problem</head>
<p>
Let us start by outlining the main phases of the ANP method as a Multiple Criteria Decision Making tool as described in. The ANP is a generalisation of AHP, and is more appropriate for dealing with real decision-making processes with complex dependency structures between the considered elements. </p>
