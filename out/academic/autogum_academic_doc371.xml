Systematic evaluation is necessary to improve the quality of VR programme as this kind of programme has not yet been realised widely. Feedback from the holders and successors as well as engineers are mandatory. Holders and successors are at the very core of this whole transmission system, which authorises them to evaluate whether the programme is effective in educating and training the general public, contributing towards making the ICH more authentic and sustainable. The engineers and technicians are to try the programme themselves so that they can see whether the technologies are rightly used to enhance the presence and immersion within the programme. They are the ones who understand what needs to be improved and how it can be improved. Feedback from the general public who have tried out the programme is also essential. Questionnaires can be useful to get the opinions on how the people felt and thought about the programme on the basis of the grades and descriptive answers they give to each question. The questionnaire is intended to evaluate the programme regarding (1) educational effects, (2) technical effects, and (3) inducing effects. The tentative list of questions with regard to the Jultagi programme follows: </p>

<p>
Questions on “educational effects” are to see whether the programme is effective in teaching the general public by giving relevant information about Jultagi and ICH in general.

<p>
Questions on “technical effects” are to see whether technologies are properly applied on the programme and are helpful to enhance its educational effect.

Questions on “inducing effects” are to see whether this pre-level participatory programme encourages actual education of transmission run by living human treasure in reality.
