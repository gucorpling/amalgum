<head> 2. Self-Similar Graph Actions</head>
<p>We review the properties of self-similar graph actions defined by Exel and Pardo. All the material in this section is taken from works. </p>

<p>Suppose that  is a directed graph, where  is the set of vertices,  is the set of edges, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is the domain map, and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the range map. A directed graph <hi rend="italic">E</hi> is called <hi rend="italic">finite</hi> if  and  are finite sets. For a natural number <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, a path of length <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in <hi rend="italic">E</hi> is a finite sequence of the form

where  and  for every <hi rend="italic">i</hi>. The domain and range of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are defined by  and , respectively. A vertex  is considered as a path of length 0, with . If <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are paths such that , then we denote the path obtained by juxtaposing <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> by . We use  to denote the length of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>. For every non-negative integer <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, we denote the set of paths of length <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in <hi rend="italic">E</hi> by  and define . The set of right-infinite paths of the form  is denoted by . </p>

<p>The product topology of a discrete set <hi rend="italic">E</hi> is defined on . The cylinder set  for each  is defined by</p>

<p>Then, the collection of all such cylinder sets forms a basis for the product topology on . </p>

<p>An automorphism of a directed graph <hi rend="italic">E</hi> is a bijective map , such that  for , , and  on . An action of a group <hi rend="italic">G</hi> on a directed graph <hi rend="italic">E</hi> is a group homomorphism from <hi rend="italic">G</hi> to the group of all automorphisms of <hi rend="italic">E</hi>. To simplify the notation, we will adopt the shorthand notation</p>

<p>A <hi rend="italic">self-similar graph action</hi>  consists of a directed graph <hi rend="italic">E</hi> and an action of a group <hi rend="italic">G</hi> on <hi rend="italic">E</hi> by automorphisms, with a <hi rend="italic">one-cocycle</hi> , such that for all  and ,</p>

<p>As Exel and Pardo showed in ([6] Proposition 2.4), the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> action and one-cocycle extend to  via the inductive formula

for  with , so that we have

for every  with . In addition, the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> action induces an action of <hi rend="italic">G</hi> on  given by</p>

<p>It is not difficult to obtain the following properties of restrictions. For  and  with ,</p>

<p>A self-similar graph action  is called pseudo-free if for any  satisfying  and , it holds that . We say that the <hi rend="italic">G</hi> action on  is topologically free if  is dense in  for every . A path  in  is said to have an entry if there is at least one  such that  has more than one element.<b>Assumption</b> <b>1.</b></p>

<p><hi rend="italic">In this study, we assume the following,</hi> </p>

<p>
<list>
<item><hi rend="italic">1</hi>.<hi rend="italic">Every group is a finitely generated countable group,</hi></item>
<item><hi rend="italic">2</hi>.<hi rend="italic">every graph is a connected finite directed graph with the properties that every circuit has an entry and  and  are nonempty sets for every vertex,</hi></item>
<item><hi rend="italic">3</hi>.<hi rend="italic">every finite path has an entry,</hi></item>
<item><hi rend="italic">4</hi>.<hi rend="italic">our self-similar graph action  is pseudo-free, and</hi></item>
<item><hi rend="italic">5</hi>.<hi rend="italic">the G action on  is topologically free.</hi></item>

<head> Inverse Semigroups and Groupoids</head>
<p>Suppose that  is a self-similar graph action. An inverse semigroup  of  is defined as follows ([6] §4),

with the binary operation defined by

and the unitary adjoint operation defined by</p>

<p>Then,  is an inverse semigroup containing zero, whose idempotent semi-lattice is given by</p>

<p>The inverse semigroup  has a canonical action on  in terms of partial homeomorphisms: The domain of  is

and</p>

<p>We note that  is the empty map. </p>

<p>Now, we briefly describe groupoids of germs of inverse semigroups and groups. Let <hi rend="italic">X</hi> be a locally compact Hausdorff space and <hi rend="italic">S</hi> an inverse semigroup (or a group) acting on <hi rend="italic">X</hi>. Then, consider a set , and define an equivalence relation on  by  if and only if  and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> coincide on a neighborhood of <hi rend="italic">x</hi>. The equivalence class of every  is called the germ of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> at <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, denoted by . The set of every germ is a groupoid, called the groupoid of germs of <hi rend="italic">S</hi> on <hi rend="italic">X</hi>, whose operations are given by</p>

<p>The unit space is identified with <hi rend="italic">X</hi>. When two germs  and  satisfy , their product is defined as</p>

<p>A basis for a topology is given by the collection of sets of the form</p>

<p>The groupoid of germs of the  action on  is denoted by , and called the <hi rend="italic">Cuntz–Pimsner groupoid</hi> of . </p>

<p>We recall that an inverse semigroup <hi rend="italic">S</hi> has an order relation defined by</p>
