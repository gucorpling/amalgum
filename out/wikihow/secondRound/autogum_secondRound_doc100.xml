<head>Steps</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Get to know him . This can appear to be somewhat not similar to the statement i made earlier  but truth be told , you like him there's no harm in knowing someone .Chances are you might end up finding a friend in him and thats how you should want it end . No hate please .</item>
<item>Knowing him doesn't mean that you make yourself appealing to him . Talk but no indecent approach and make sure you aren't the one always starting the conversation . Be nice to both him and the girl he is dating .</item>
<item>Don't get your hopes up .He's already dating someone so be honest with youlself the entire time that it may or may not work out the way you intend it to . Girl , always remind youself you are amazing and there is a guy for you . Maybe this is the one or not but don't get desperate and think it is the end of the world . Don't get emotionally attached to him . Be neutral , have feelings but don't let it control you .</item>
<item>So the real thing starts from now onwards , don't go to the place where you meet i.e. classes or work . See if he notices your absense ,whether he bothers to know what happened .</item>
<item>Don't throw everything away for him . Study hard or work more to keep your mind of it . Do yoga , go to movies , go to that favourite restaurant you have and shower yourself with love . Don't become desperate for him . Be patient and calm . Things will take time to happen but you can't stop yourself from others and other tasks for him . Be great , be beautiful , be you .</item>
<item>I you're still not over him , tell someone about it . Talking always helps but be sure taht the person you're telling it to isn't just intrested in stories and spreading rumours , talk to genuine people who care for you and will help you get through it .</item>
<item>Unfollow him on facebook , remember unfollow not unfriend , you don't want drama . This will help you from continuosly going to his profile and checking changes . Because out of SIGHT means out of MIND .</item>
<item>And the final step , talk to him . Tell himhow you feel . But if he is a jerk , don't . learn the difference and move on .</item>
<item>Be happy , be you . There are no control of who you are going to end up liking but you have the choice of moving on . He may be the perfect one , but what makes you think he is ? Everything is on the eye of the beholder . Its you who sees him in this manner , once youll change perspective you'll know the flaws you overlooked . But look down on someone from their flaws , learn to accept them the way they are .</item></list>
