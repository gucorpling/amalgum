<list type="ordered"><item>Your 40s and 50s really can be the best time of your life. You know yourself and are clear on your likes and dislikes. You should be feeling at your most confident and have probably already achieved a lot in your life, maybe having had children or an established career to feel proud of. For many of us during this period, our children will become more independent, leaving time to pursue hobbies and interests that you couldnâ€™t find time for before. For those who are in relationships this may mean spending more quality time together. For those who are not, you can get out and meet others, including potential partners, with a real sense of self, and a freedom that you may not have experienced for years. Some of you may choose this time of life to begin a family. The truth is that these days, your 40s and 50s may bring a huge variety of experiences, and you are ready for them; with experience and wisdom on your side! <figure rend="Prioritise Your Health at 40 and 50 Step 1 Version 2.jpg"></figure></item>
