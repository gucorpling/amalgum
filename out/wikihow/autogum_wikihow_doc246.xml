<head>Purchase and Install Refrigeration</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Purchase and install a walk-in cooling unit. A walk-in cooling unit is a cold storage room designed to maintain the standard refrigeration temperature of 28 to 40 degrees (-2 to 4 â„ƒ). Although some small food service operations may not require a walk-in cooler, the majority of commercial operations will. Walk-in coolers can be custom built to fit any location. Speak to several HVAC contractors and refrigeration specialists to get the best bid. <figure rend="Set Up a Commercial Kitchen Step 1.jpg"></figure></item>

<item>Purchase a refrigerated line station and supplemental refrigeration units. Adequate refrigeration is a necessity in the commercial kitchen.

<head>Purchase and Install Cooking Equipment</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Purchase and install an industrial range hood and H-VAC ventilation system. Any commercial operation that prepares food over an open flame, such as a stove top or a broiler, is required to have a range-hood and ventilation system installed. The range hood sits over the top of stove-tops and broilers, and uses fans to pull carcinogenic materials and heat through carbon filters up and out of the building. A range hood can be custom built to fit any location. <figure rend="Set Up a Commercial Kitchen Step 5.jpg"></figure></item>

<item>Some municipal health department authorities require that floor-drains be installed in commercial food service facilities. Check with local plumbing and heating contractors for price quotes on installing floor drains.</item>
