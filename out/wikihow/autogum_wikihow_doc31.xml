<head>Prepare for Your First Gymnastics Meet</head><p>You were so excited when you got the letter saying you had been invited to your first ever gymnastics meet, but now it's time to prepare. Let's get started! 😋</p>
<head>Steps</head>
<head>What to wear 👗</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Check with your coach for what you should wear. Depending on the category of the meet, there may be different dress codes. Some meets may require you to buy your gymnastics official leotard, while other may allow you to wear your own.</item>
<item>If you are wearing your own leotard, make sure you wear the perfect one. Try to choose a leotard that has a popping colour to it, such as purple. To add some extra glitz, try to find a leotard that has glitter, sparkles, or dress diamonds embroidered on it. Remember, the more professional the leotard, the more professional the judges will think you are.</item>
<item>If you are allowed to wear black gym shorts, then that is an option, but many gymnasts prefer not to wear shorts to the meet as it will make them look more advanced. If you are going to wear gym shorts, be sure to check that they do not constrict your flexibility at any level. Also, try not to wear gym shorts that have your name on them, as it may seem slightly childish to the judges.</item>
<item>For your hair, the style differs according to whether you have long or short hair. For short hair, (shoulder length and above) put your hair in a high ponytail. If you have longer hair, tie it into a bun. Make sure that there are no whispy bit hanging down, and, if necessary, use a moderate amount of hair spray.</item></list>
<head>Practise 👯</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Go to every single gym class there is, and if possible, extra ones too. If you absolutely must miss  a class; make up for it by taking an extra class on another day.</item>
<item>Practise with your friends if you are both going to the meet. If your friends are not going to the meet but they know a little about gymnastics, perform your routine to them, and listen to their feedback.</item>
<item>Take advice from anyone who offers it. If you know someone who has been to quite a few meets, ask them about it, and see if they can give you any advice or tips. Most likely if you listen to them, you could gain a few extra points.</item>
<item>Use every free second you have to rehearse and/or practise. If you are in the car or on the train or bus, go over your routine mentally in your head. If you are in a big space, practise a few kick butt moves.</item></list>
<head>The Meet 😝🤗</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Believe in yourself. As long as you follow this step, nothing else matters.</item>
<item>Just remember, win or loose, there is also next time. Good luck Xxx❤️💜💞💗💚💙💛</item></list>
