<head>Buy a Dinette Set</head><p>A dinette set is a set of table and chairs that are used for informal dining. They are often found in kitchens or other informal eating areas in the home. Average families eat most of their meals at a dinette set. Dinette sets can be simple or elaborate. They can seat 2 people or 8. A dinette set is not limited by price, size or materials used for its manufacture. There are a great many styles of dinette sets; here's how to buy a dinette set.</p>
<head>Steps</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Consider your budget. <figure rend="Buy a Dinette Set Step 1.jpg"></figure>
<list type="unordered"><item>Dinette sets can come complete with the chairs and table grouped into 1 price, or the tables and chairs can be priced individually. No matter how the dinette set is sold, you should first consider what your budget is for the furniture. Remember, however, that you get what you pay for. If you buy an especially cheap dinette set, you may find yourself needing to replace it sooner than you'd have liked. A cheap dinette set may not save you money in the long run.</item></list></item>
<item>Consider the size. <figure rend="Buy a Dinette Set Step 2.jpg"></figure>
<list type="unordered"><item>Don't buy a dinette table larger than you need. If you have 4 people in your family who would eat at the dinette set regularly, then buy a table large enough for 4 chairs. Also consider how much room you have in which to place the dinette set. A small nook might require that you purchase a small table. If you periodically need to seat more than the usual number of people at the table, then consider purchasing one that can be extended and fitted with a table leaf, to increase the size of the table.</item></list></item>
<item>Choose the material. <figure rend="Buy a Dinette Set Step 3.jpg"></figure>
<list type="unordered"><item>Dinette sets can be made of just about any material. The cheapest will be made of plastic, while the most expensive will be made of real wood. Consider how much abuse your table will be taking. If you have small children, then perhaps a solid oak dinette set isn't practical. On the other hand, if you want to buy a piece of furniture to last a lifetime, then by all means invest in the best quality wood you can afford.</item></list></item>
<item>Choose the style. <figure rend="Buy a Dinette Set Step 4.jpg"></figure>
<list type="unordered"><item>Dinette sets are available in myriad styles and finishes. They can be ultra-modern or very traditional. Pick the table and chairs that best suits your style. Dinette sets are available in many colors or finishes. From chrome to cherry wood, all you need to do is pick the style and finish that suits your personal style and home dï¿½cor.</item></list></item>
<item>Decide between stools and chairs. <figure rend="Buy a Dinette Set Step 5.jpg"></figure>
<list type="unordered"><item>Dinette sets are available with either stools or chairs. While sets with stools can look interesting and modern, they may not be practical for small children or where comfort is an issue. If your dinette set is not going to be used often then comfort isn't as much an issue. If you'll be using your set regularly, then opt for regular chairs with cushioned seats.</item></list></item></list>
