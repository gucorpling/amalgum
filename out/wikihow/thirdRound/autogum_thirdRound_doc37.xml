<item>Use a bookmark. It is so frustrating to come back and realize that you already read that part of the book. You may also skip over a few chapters and not know what's going on. Use one that is fun and colorful so you won't mind having it with you.</item>
<item>Get a notebook and make notes.</item>
<item>If you are anxious to get to the ending, don't force the words into your head. Relax a little and take a break when you need one.This way you will really enjoy what you're reading.</item>
<item>If it was a very long book or one you didn't think you would like to begin with (but you ended up liking it) reward yourself by getting the movie, or getting some ice cream or just having a good time!</item>
<item>If you get into hard spots to get past, then reread it, slowly. It may help to read it aloud. If it is still tough, then consider getting the audio-book. They are very good, and the fun voices make them enjoyable.</item>
<item>You should not be tired when reading! This will only tempt you you to fall asleep or watch TV.</item>
<item>If you want, you can listen to a CD or your MP3/iPod while reading.  If you especially enjoy a book you can replay the CD when you read it again or read another book.</item></list>
