<item>Decide what purpose you'll use the art for. <figure rend="Find an Illustrator Step 8.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Know ahead of time, what the eye, hair and skin color of the subjects are.  <figure rend="Find an Illustrator Step 9.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Decide if you will be providing reference material or if you expect the artist to procure it. Some artists will charge for finding reference material as it can be very time consuming. You might consider finding the reference to save fees. <figure rend="Find an Illustrator Step 10.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Decide if there will be any text on the page.  Do you want the artist to provide the text or leave room for your printer to place the text on the finished art.  If you want the artist to do it what font should be used.  If you are having your printing company place the text they can superimpose it on the digital art. <figure rend="Find an Illustrator Step 11.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Do you need the artist to design a logo and if so what are your ideas for it?  What is the message you want to convey? <figure rend="Find an Illustrator Step 12.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Do you want a logo you already have placed on the art?  Can you supply a digital image of the logo. <figure rend="Find an Illustrator Step 13.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>You can ask the illustrator to show you samples of art they have which conveys the type and quality of the illustrations they create, however, do not expect them to have the exact thing you have in mind.  For instance if you want a picture of a bride on a skateboard and they have drawn skateboards and brides separately you can be confident they draw them together.   If the artist can draw an airplane but has not drawn a skateboard be confident they can draw the skateboard. <figure rend="Find an Illustrator Step 14.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Ask the artist if you will be supplied with a sketch before they go to the final finish. Do not expect the artist to redraw the picture if you change your mind for the original layout without incurring more fees. <figure rend="Find an Illustrator Step 15.jpg"></figure></item></list>
