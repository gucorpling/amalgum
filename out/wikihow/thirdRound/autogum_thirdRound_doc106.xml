<head>Looking After Your Health</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Do not starve yourself. Starving your body can actually give you the opposite of what you want by making your body go into survival mode which means it will hold on to fat easier. Lose weight the healthier way  by eating fresh fruits and vegetables, going to the gym, and by drinking more water. <figure rend="Look Beautiful, Healthy and Fit Naturally Step 1.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Hydrate your body first thing in the morning. Start your day having aloe-vera pulp, coconut water or normal water. Leave a cup on your nightstand to remind yourself to drink every morning. <figure rend="Look Beautiful, Healthy and Fit Naturally Step 2.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Replace coffee with tea. Instead of drinking coffee all the time, have two cups of green tea every day. You can drink coffee but not frequently. Green tea is filled with antioxidants and can help you have better skin and shed off those extra pounds. <figure rend="Look Beautiful, Healthy and Fit Naturally Step 3.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Exercise as much as possible. Get a membership at your local gym and try your hardest to go there at least once a week then twice a week etc. Workout at home if you're not comfortable doing it in public areas. <figure rend="Look Beautiful, Healthy and Fit Naturally Step 4.jpg"></figure></item>

<item>Wait until your hair is dry to comb it. Brushing wet hair is a big no no when it comes to hair. Never use a brush on wet hair as it will only tear it out. Instead use wide toothed comb, make sure to comb your hair from bottom to top not top to bottom. <figure rend="Look Beautiful, Healthy and Fit Naturally Step 10.jpg"></figure></item>
