<head>Steps</head>
<list type="ordered"><item><ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Be_Confident">Be confident</ref>! Stand tall and smile, or all of your hard work will go to waste. Never stand in a corner or try to avoid attention or no one will notice how fabulous you look. <figure rend="Dress-Hipster-Grunge-Step-1-Version-2.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Have a clear face. Use a product like Proactive if you have zits. Make sure to wash your face daily, and that you are free of acne before attempting the next step, or you could cause a break-out. Wash as often as you need, daily showers are the norm. No one will care how fabulous you look if you smell like sweat! <figure rend="Achieve-Smooth-Skin-on-a-Budget-Step-6-Version-2.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Carry around a little make up pouch with you with your favorite products. In your make up pouch, you should have at least your eyeliner, blush, lip gloss and mascara. A comb or hairbrush helps too. Also keep some deodorant and chapstick just in case. <figure rend="Organize-Your-Purse-Step-14.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Tie up your hair into a nice, cute ponytail or smooth it out before you step out of your house. Change your hairstyle every once in a while. Having the same hairstyle for the whole year can become a little dull and boring. Try a bun or braid to jazz things up. You can even go to the stylist and ask for a snip. <figure rend="Do-an-Ariana-Grande-Ponytail-Step-3-Version-3.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Don't leave home without checking yourself in a mirror. Check the mirror every few hours - you could just use your make-up mirror. Don't try this during class, or you could get into trouble. <figure rend="Choose-a-Foundation-for-Dark-Skin-Tones-Step-5.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Carry a big bag to put all of your essentials in. It's easier to carry just one bag, except for your make up pouch, which can be put into your big bag, and it looks more stylish, too. <figure rend="Wear-White-Step-8-Version-3.jpg"></figure></item>
