<item>Study up on the history of the Fab Four.

Anything that will help you connect and feel closer to the Four Lads from Liverpool! <figure rend="Be a Beatles Fan Step 7 Version 2.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Listen to the solo work. If you learn a bit about John and his Plastic Ono Band, Paul McCartney and Wings, George Harrison and his Traveling Wilburys, and Ringo and his All Starr Band, you'll begin to recognize each member as an individual person, and not just as one whole group known as The Beatles. You'll grow familiar with their music styles, the things they sing about, and the way each man was. <figure rend="Be a Beatles Fan Step 8 Version 2.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Learn the meaning behind each song. It helps you learn about their lives, families, and interests. You'll begin to feel close and you may even be able to relate to each member! It adds a bit of a story and even more meaning to the songs they had written. <figure rend="Be a Beatles Fan Step 9 Version 2.jpg"></figure></item></list>
