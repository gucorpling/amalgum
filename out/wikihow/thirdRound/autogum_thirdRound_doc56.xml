<head>Navigate Pixiv</head><p>Pixiv is a popular Japanese website that serves as a place for artists to showcase their work. Top Japanese artists place their work on here for a variety of franchises, including some original works of their own. Be wary, however; mature artwork is allowed on this website, and sometimes may not be tagged as mature by accident. This article will show you how to browse the website with minimum fuss. No account is needed, but a translator is recommended.</p>
