<head>Cancel a YMCA Membership</head><p>Having a membership to your local YMCA gives you access to health and wellness services in your community. However, you may decide to cancel your membership due to finances, preference, or a permanent move out of the country. Make sure you give your local YMCA branch advance notice of your cancellation. Then process your cancellation by filling out the necessary paperwork and submitting it to the YMCA.</p>

You can also visit your local YMCA branch in person and speak to a representative at the front desk for more information. <figure rend="Cancel a YMCA Membership Step 1.jpg"></figure></item>
