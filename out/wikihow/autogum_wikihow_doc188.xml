<head>Visit a Relative You Can't Stand</head><p>Some people can't stand their relatives, this article will show you how to maintain your sanity when you visit them, assuming your relative lives more than a few hours away.</p>
<head>Steps</head>
<head>Long Visit</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Stay in a hotel if you can. It may cost you a bit of money, but you'll be away from them for at <hi rend="italic">least</hi> 8 hours. (That's 1/3 of the day!)  <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 1.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Act like you want to be there. When you arrive, say hello, give them a hug, and try to tolerate their presence. Early in the evening, start yawning and say the trip really wore you out, and you'll be going to bed early. Then, if you want, you can spend the evening reading.  <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 2.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Sleep in. Unless your relative is the type to not bother sleeping people (or you're in a hotel), this could give you a couple more hours away from them. <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 3.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Say you are going to buy a souvenir for your family. Ask them if they want to come with you; most likely they will say no, especially if it's really early in the morning. That means you can do whatever you want for a while. (Make sure you actually buy something, though, or else they might get suspicious.)  <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 4.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Stay at their house for a while. Do your best to tolerate them as you can. When you've had enough, excuse yourself and run for the bathroom. Then you can take a long shower, mess around on your phone, whatever. Just don't spend three hours in there, as that might raise suspicions. <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 5.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Say you want to see some more of the town. They will probably ask to come with you; that's fine. At least you won't be alone with them. <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 6.jpg"></figure></item></list>
<head>If your relative comes to your house</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Try to get them to stay in a hotel. Don't try forcing them though as they might feel you didn't want them to be there and might cancel their plan. This might be a good thing but it can damage your image in the family.
<list type="unordered"><item>Make some good excuse like they are cleaning the house, removing insects, no empty rooms etc. <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 7.jpg"></figure></item></list></item>
<item>Try to stay in your room a lot. Interact with them when they arrive and tolerate them for 10 minutes at maximum. Then politely excuse yourself inside saying you have some work to complete. <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 8.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Go on a lot of "errands" while they're at your house. Help with the cooking and cleaning, and offer to go shopping so as to avoid them even for 20 minutes. <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 9.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Sign up for a 5K, train a lot. (Unless you want to there's no need to actually show up for the race.) <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 10.jpg"></figure></item>
<item><ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Fake_a_Fever">Pretend you're sick</ref>,don't let them take you to the doctor though. <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 11.jpg"></figure></item></list>
<head>Short Visit</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Pretend that lots of people are calling you. You can do this by setting many alarms with your ringtone. Give them some sort of explanation about it; for example, you could say that it's a busy week at work and they need your input.  <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 12.jpg"></figure></item>
<item>Come on a weeknight so you can leave early. Tell them you want to get plenty of sleep, as you have work/school the next day. <figure rend="Visit a Relative You Can't Stand Step 13.jpg"></figure></item></list>
<head>Tips</head>
<list type="unordered"><item>Make sure to actually spend time with them, especially if they're really old and going to die soon.</item>
<item>Arrive late in the afternoon for a prolonged stay. If you combine this with going to bed early, you'll seriously cut down on the time you'll be around them.</item>
<item>Take "naps."</item></list>
