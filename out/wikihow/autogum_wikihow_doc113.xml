<head>Write Computer Shortcuts with Autohotkey</head><p>AutoHotkey is a program designed to help automate your computer. It is free to download and is very simple to use. There are many communities dedicated to helping and answering questions you might have. Find out more at their website <ref target="http://www.autohotkey.com/">http://www.autohotkey.com/</ref> This tutorial will teach some of the basics of AutoHotkey and instruct you in writing three simple programs.</p>
<head>Steps</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>Step 1 Installing. Install AutoHotkey from their website (link in the introduction). Once it has downloaded, run the installer by double clicking it.In most cases, you can press "express install" but you can go through "custom install" if you think you need special installation. When it is done you can press exit. <figure rend="WCSA1a.png"></figure></item>
<item><figure 2="" a="" figure🎃👻="" figure🎃👻step="" make="" rend="WCSA2a.png" script.="" 🎃👻<="" 🎃👻👻🎃="" 👻🎃figure="">👻🎃/figure&gt;
<list type="unordered"><item>Right click on desktop and go to new-&gt;autohotkey script.</item>
<item>Name it whatever you'd like.</item>
<item>Right click the script,and select edit script. If prompted to select a program, choose notepad. You will see a text file with a bit of information about AutoHotkey. You can delete it, but it shouldn’t effect the script.</item></list></figure></item>
<item><figure rend="WCSA6.png"></figure>Step 3 Writing the script. The first example will be a program that clicks. First we'll set up the hotkey which is the button or button combination you press to run the script. For this example, we’ll use the the combination “alt c”
<list type="unordered"><item>To assign the hotkey type “!c::”</item>
<item>To add the click command, type “click” on a new line. This will cause the script to click wherever the mouse currently is.</item>
<item>Type “return” on a new line. This signals the end of the hotkey function. At this point, we can test what we’ve made so far.</item></list></item>
<item><figure rend="WCSA7.png"></figure> Step 4 Running it. Save and close out of the notepad, and double click the file you made in step 2, or right click and select “run script”. Test the program by pressing the hotkeys that we set up, alt c in our example. This should cause the program to click where the cursor is. If it doesn’t, go back to the script editor and see what went wrong.</item>
<item>Step 5 Making the script repeat. We will now make a loop so the program will click repeatedly.
<list type="unordered"><item>To make the loop, type “loop {“ on a new line under "!c::".</item>
<item>Put a "}" between "click" and "return".</item></list></item>
<item>Step 6 Stopping the Loop. At this point, I do not recommend running the script, as this will make the script keep clicking over and over without any means of stopping it, except for shutting down the computer. In order to keep this from happening, we will add another hotkey to stop the program from running. Below the first return, we’ll make a new hotkey which will disable the script. For this example we'll use "ctrl k"
<list type="unordered"><item>After the “return”, type “^k::” on a new line.</item>
<item>On the next line type “pause”</item>
<item>On the next line, type “return” This will pause the script where it is, and thus stop the loop. <figure rend="WCSA8.png"></figure></item></list></item>
<item><figure figure🎃👻="" rend="WCSA10.png" 🎃👻<="" 👻🎃figure="">👻🎃/figure&gt;Step 7 Test it again. Now this should click over and over when you press “alt C” and then it should stop when you press “ctrl K”. You can see the difference it made on an online clicking tester. If you get a message that says it is already running, click "yes" to allow the new one to start running.</figure></item>
<item>Step 8 Open websites. Now that we have the basics of hotkeys and looping down, we’ll make something with a new command, run.This is a command that will open files, URLs ,and even programs To start, we’ll have it open a website, for example, the New York Times
<list type="unordered"><item>Make a new script like we did in step 2.</item>
<item>Pick the hotkey you want to use, I will use “alt W”, so we type "!w::"</item>
<item>On the next line, type “Run” .</item>
<item>After “Run” we put a comma and then the URL to the New York Times's website.</item>
<item>On the next line type "return". If we run this, then it should open the New York Times’s website in whatever your default browser is.  <figure rend="WCSA11.png"></figure></item></list></item>
<item>Step 9 Open more than one thing. We can make the program open multiple things at once. Let’s have it open Yahoo and the C drive.
<list type="unordered"><item>On a line after the first run command and before "return", type “run, <ref target="https://www.yahoo.com/”">https://www.yahoo.com/”</ref></item>
<item>On the next line, type “run, C:/”. Run it again and we should get multiple tabs and the c drive popping up. <figure rend="WCSA12.png"></figure></item></list></item>
<item>Step 10   Automatically type a signature.  If you want to send an email or make memo, it might be helpful to have a shortcut specifically for typing out your signiture at the end.
<list type="unordered"><item>Make a new script</item>
<item>Pick the hotkey. I will be using “ctrl S”. So you type "^s::"</item>
<item>On the next line, type “send Sincerely” (you can replace "Sincerely" with whatever closing you'd like)</item>
<item>On the next line, type “Send {Enter}”</item>
<item>On the next line, type “Send Your Name” (you can replace "Your Name" with your name)</item>
<item>Finish the script by typing “return”  <figure rend="WCSA13.png"></figure></item></list></item></list>
<head>Tips</head>
<list type="unordered"><item>If a program other than notepad opens up, exit out of the program, right click on the script go to “open with” and then “notepad”. (step 2)</item>
<item>Anything with a " ; " in front of it will be ignored in the code. The " ; " indicates a comment (step 2)</item>
<item>You can choose any hotkey you want, but note that the hotkey you choose won’t do it’s normal function. This means if you choose “b” as your hot key, anytime you try to type the letter b, it will only run the script, so choose a hotkey that won’t interfere with regular use. (step 3)</item>
<item>The “!” means alt and “c” is for the c key and “::” signals for a hotkey to start. (step 3)</item>
<item>The curly braces ( “{“ and “}” ) indicate what is being looped by the loop function. (step 5)</item>
<item>If your script ever starts getting out of control or you need to stop it, you can go to the tray icon, right click it and select “ exit”. (step 5)</item>
<item>For the send command, you can’t send !,#,+,^,{,or} without putting them in curly braces ( { } ).</item></list>
