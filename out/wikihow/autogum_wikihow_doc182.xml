<head>Loving Yourself</head>
<list type="ordered"><item>You need to know that there are two people in a marriage. When you want a marriage to work then you must remember that you can only "change", one person which is you. So before you start working on the other person, work on yourself. You must love yourself and give to yourself what you want your partner to give you.</item>
<item>Take a sheet of paper and write down all of the things that you want your partner to say to you. Every romantic line and every promise that you want to hear, no matter how stupid it seems. Write every single word that you wish your partner said to you! Write it in first person. For eg- " I love you baby and I will always keep you happy no matter what." Once you write that letter, read and evaluate it for the things that are promised in the letter. In the case above, love and happiness are promised/said. Now you must give to yourself whatever is promised. In the case above Â the person should give love to him/herself love and make him/herself happy.</item>
<item>Stand in front of the mirror and say to yourself, "I love you." Feel as much as love as you can as you say this. You can extend this and have a full talk with yourself but remember to tell yourself that you love you every single day</item>
<item>Affirm to yourself that you deserve love and a loving relationship. For this you can write a list of all the things that you genuinely love about your self and your qualities. Say to yourself over and over again and believe that 'I am worthy of great love.'</item>
