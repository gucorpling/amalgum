Introduction

<p>
<s>
The
answers
for
questions
concerning
social
justice
in
collaborative
or
cooperative
forms
of
education
can
be
defined
as
largely
untested
and
often
self-referential
.
</s>
<s>
The
core
to
these
claims
is
the
rhetoric
that
the
networked
nature
of
such
practices
can
provide
equal
opportunities
for
all
individuals
to
freely
and
openly
share
their
ideas
and
participate
in
group
activities
(
see
,
for
example
,
)
.
</s>
<s>
The
research
reporting
on
empirical
data
,
such
as
studies
illustrating
the
variety
of
identities
among
participants
(
e.
g.
,
)
or
comparing
the
number
of
contributions
across
different
cohorts
of
students
(
e.
g.
,
)
,
can
provide
only
tangential
support
for
these
idealistic
propositions
.
</s>
<s>
This
potential
for
more
egalitarian
or
democratic
forms
of
engagements
among
people
is
accepted
to
be
somehow
actualised
naturally
within
collaborative
or
cooperative
forms
of
learning
.
</s>
<s>
This
assumption
is
problematic
because
researchers
in
the
field
of
education
continue
employing
frameworks
that
cannot
reflect
the
nuanced
ways
in
which
complexly
interwoven
forms
of
identifications
(
such
as
class
,
ethnicity
,
sexual
orientation
,
and
gender
)
operate
to
produce
differentiated
experiences
across
cohorts
of
students
.
</s>
<s>
There
is
an
urgent
need
for
a
theoretical
framework
that
does
not
limit
equity
with
access
or
participation
but
focuses
on
the
otherwise
hidden
ways
in
which
group
work
can
yield
suboptimal
outcomes
.
</s>
<s>
If
networked
learning
is
becoming
more
diverse
and
widened
,
research
should
critically
examine
the
extent
to
which
these
claims
can
be
substantiated
in
practice
.
</s>

<s>
This
article
aims
to
expand
the
current
understandings
of
social
justice
in
networked
learning
practices
by
challenging
the
ways
in
which
being
is
conceptualised
in
communal
settings
.
</s>
<s>
In
specific
,
it
provides
a
theoretical
lens
for
going
beyond
a
wide-spread
speculation
that
networked
learning
practices
inherently
provide
equal
opportunities
to
participate
,
a
speculation
that
has
long
hindered
the
development
of
critical
frameworks
and
approaches
in
the
theory
of
networked
learning
.
</s>
<s>
By
problematising
the
engagements
,
relations
and
connections
among
people
in
networked
spaces
,
this
article
aims
to
generate
a
new
research
agenda
in
networked
learning
concerning
social
justice
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
This
,
however
,
requires
clarification
of
what
networked
learning
is
and
how
social
justice
is
conceptualised
before
proceeding
further
with
the
conceptual
analysis
.
</s>
<s>
Networked
learning
is
an
umbrella
term
for
pedagogical
approaches
or
applications
where
technology
is
utilised
to
connect
learners
,
tutor(s)
,
and
resources
to
form
a
learning
network
.
</s>
<s>
In
networked
learning
,
knowledge
is
distributed
through
and
mediated
by
the
participants
of
a
community
.
</s>
<s>
Accordingly
,
learning
is
not
an
individual
pursuit
but
a
collective
effort
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
a
matter
of
engagement
with
others
in
a
community
.
</s>
<s>
As
a
value-laden
term
,
the
concept
of
justice
is
a
contextual
decision
about
what
is
right
or
fair
.
</s>
<s>
At
this
point
,
it
should
be
asserted
that
the
difference
between
justice
and
equality
(
since
,
as
it
is
argued
above
,
research
tends
to
employ
the
concept
of
equality
when
making
claims
on
social
justice
)
.
</s>
<s>
Equality
refers
to
an
arbitrary
point
of
equilibrium
:
It
is
quantitative
sameness
or
evenness
.
</s>
<s>
Justice
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
a
qualitative
judgement
on
fairness
.
</s>
<s>
To
determine
what
is
socially
just
,
therefore
,
is
not
limited
with
concerns
whether
there
is
an
actual
or
perceived
equality
in
a
given
situation
,
but
includes
judgements
on
whether
the
given
situation
is
fair
or
not
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
It
is
argued
that
if
social
justice
is
a
concept
that
requires
qualitative
judgements
about
a
given
situation
rather
than
quantified
measurements
,
regressing
or
accumulating
individuals
and
their
experiences
into
measurable
categories
cannot
account
for
the
uniqueness
of
each
individual
neither
can
it
explain
how
cultural
differences
play
a
role
in
networked
learning
activities
.
</s>
<s>
To
understand
how
subjectivities
are
constructed
,
managed
and
negotiated
within
a
community
is
needed
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
what
follows
,
one
such
framework
is
discussed
in
online
education
with
respect
to
the
principles
of
networked
learning
.
</s>
<s>
First
,
the
focus
is
needed
on
online
selves
to
better
understand
the
relation
of
identification
to
learning
in
networked
spaces
.
</s>
<s>
Then
,
the
current
conceptualisations
of
being
in
online
spaces
are
explored
and
the
need
for
the
concept
of
social
absence
is
argued
.
</s>
<s>
Lastly
,
a
discussion
is
made
that
the
mediated
experience
in
online
spaces
should
be
conceptualised
in
tandem
with
one
’s
social
presence
and
social
absence
if
online
education
is
to
be
studied
more
rigorously
and
if
claims
of
equity
and
justice
are
to
be
made
in
networked
learning
.
