A
multiple

study
design
increases

From
the
nine
cases
studied
within
the
ERA-Net
project
mentioned
above
,
two
experiments
were
selected
for
in
depth
analysis
herein
.
</s>
<s>
This
was
a
decision
based
on
a
measure
of
comparability
,
as
the
cases
—
the
Austrian
VLOTTE

the
Norwegian
ASKO
—
both
were
smart
grid
experiments
with
certain
similar
features
which
made
them
interesting
for
comparison
.

Both
cases
were
company
driven
projects

focus

the
development
of
solutions

convert
vehicle
fleets

sources

<s>
In
both
cases
,
the
activities
were
in-house
developments
aiming
first
at
the
companies

own
needs

However
,
at
the
same
time
,
both
activities
can
be
characterized
as
mission-oriented
innovation
,
as
they
aimed
to
contribute
to
a
decarbonized
transport
sector
in
general
.

In
the
VLOTTE
project
,
a
regional
Austrian
ESCO
together
with
an
associated
DSO
developed
a
smart
e-car
park
as
part
of
their
own
e-vehicle
fleet

In
the
ASKO
case
,
a
large
grocery
wholesaler
from
Norway
established
a
hydrogen
infrastructure
for
a
hydrogen-powered
fleet
of
heavy-duty
delivery
trucks
and
fork
lifts

In
addition

a
similar
thematic
mission

the
projects

there
is
another
interesting
common
feature
:

In
both
cases
,
we
are
dealing

system
as
an
outcome
of

Our

studies
provided
a
comprehensive
description

<s>
The
empirical
surveys
therefore
focused
on
the
historical

the
local

regional
contexts
,

the
roles

strategies
of
various
actors

the

The
Norwegian
case
is
represented
by
ASKO
midt-Norge

a
large
grocery
wholesaler
,

focuses
on
their
endeavour
to
be
self-supplied

<s>
At
the
time
of
the
study
,
they
had
installed
a
300-m2
solar
PV
rig
on
the
roof
of
their
warehouse
(
storage
)
complex

the
surplus
energy
of
which
is
going
to
power
a
hydrogen
production
facility

During
the
next
year
,
they
increased
the
acreage
of
this
PV
park
to
12,000
m2

<s>
A
hydrogen
production
was
planned
to
fuel
delivery
trucks
that
operate
in
the
middle

low
north
regions
of
Norway

<s>
Most
of
the
solar
power
,
however
,
was
to
be
used
to
power
the
company
storage
facility

keep
goods
cold

</s>
<s>
Because
of
this
,
and
contrary
to
most
other
use
scenarios
that
include
solar
power
,
ASKO
has
a
demand
curve
that
follows
the
production
curve
of
the
PV
system
quite
well
as
the
demand
for
keeping
goods
cold
correlates
with
the
supply
of
solar
energy

The
Austrian
case
—
called
VLOTTE

the
most
western
region
of
Austria

on
e-mobility

distributed
generation

load
management

VLOTTE

program

Today

In
accommodation
of

request
Illwerke
vkw
installed
a
fast
charging
infrastructure
that
is
owned
by
them

can
be
used
by
customers
that
own
a
vkw
membership
card
