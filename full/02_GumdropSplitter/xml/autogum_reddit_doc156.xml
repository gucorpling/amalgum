working
making
around
25k

year

I
have
been
juggling
retirement
savings
,
401k
,
and
emergency
funds

I
am
in
a
very
lucky
position
of
being
able
to
rent
my
parent

home

They

I
currently
have
a
student
loan
of
$18.3k

my
savings
are
looking
around
$17k

my
emergency
funds

My
bills

I
am
very
lucky
my
parents
are
still
helping
me
out

I
need
to
get
out

their
wing

I
am
currently
in
the
slow
season
of
the
company
I
work
for

my
hours

months

June/July

I
have
decided
to
work
on
my
CCNA
certificate

these
two
months

If
I
dedicate
myself
these
2
months
I

I
can
take

My
plan

start
a

My
question
is
,
should
I
bite
the
bullet
now
,
and
use
our
savings
and
pay
my
student
loan
,
which
has
an
Interest
rate
of
6.8
%

or
keep
paying
the
minimum
plus
some
over
payment
towards
the
principal
each
month
?

The
bills
are
not
the
issue

I
live
pretty
comfortably
at
the
moment

but
that
can
change
any
day
as
my
current
job
is
very
back
breaking
at
times

and
the
hours
fluctuate
with

month

The
looming
debt
discourages
me
quite
a
bit
every

I
think
of
planning
towards
the
future

I
want
a
small
home

a
kid

and
a
relatively
better
paying
job
with
regular
hours

Thanks
for
giving
me
a

your
time

Refinance
with
a
paydown
to
a
reasonable
percentage
would
definitely
help

I

As
for
CCNA
,
you
can
probably
get
55k
year
as
long
as
you
have
tech
experience
,
and
if
you
do
n't
,
getting
a

should
get
you
up

35k

Last
note
,
in
a
lot
of
states
25k
for
two
people
qualifies
for
subsidized
Healthcare
,
so
you
could
pad
some
savings
there
