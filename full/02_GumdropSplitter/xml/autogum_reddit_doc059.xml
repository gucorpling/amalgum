The
concern

So
,
it
's
time
to
get
our
hands
dirty
everyone
,
let
's
actually
talk
a
super
serious
talk
.
</s>
<s>
Obviously
I
know
a
good
portion
of
you
are
younger
here
but
there
's
a
fair
share
of
us
who
are
young
adults
,
or
middle
aged
.
</s>
<s>
We
've
seen
things
,
we
've
seen
how
things
play
out
.
</s>
<s>
I
am
certainly
thankful
for
the
fact
I
was
born
in
the
time
I
was
,
no
one
questioned
me
being
a
tomboy
and
not
necessarily
wanting
to
always
be
feminine
.
</s>
<s>
I
was
that
weird
girl
who
liked
video
games
and
hoodies
,
nothing
more
.
</s>
<s>
No
one
thought
I
wanted
to
be
a
boy
,
no
one
saw
me
as
a
boy
.
</s>
<s>
As
an
intersex
individual
who
basically
grew
up
no
different
to
a
girl
,
this
was
fine
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
my
situation
went
downhill
at
15-16
.
</s>
<s>
The
aspects
of
me
being
more
GNC
were
considered
&quot;
masculine
&quot;
and
due
to
being
intersex
as
well
?
</s>
<s>
Lead
to
me
being
forced
to
take
testosterone
against
my
will
.
</s>
<s>
It
was
treated
as
if
I
was
rejecting
femininity
.
</s>
<s>
Seeing
these
young
kids
do
this
to
themselves
not
out
of
distress
but
because
of
harmful
stereotypes
and
interests
separated
on
gender
?
</s>
<s>
It
pains
my
heart
,
especially
because
I
was
forced
to
&quot;
transition
&quot;
because
of
it
.
</s>
<s>
Let
's
be
honest
here
,
kids
half
the
time
do
n't
know
what
they
want
and
I
think
puberty
blockers
and
the
like
should
be
recommended
with
minimal
therapy
gatekeeping
.
</s>
<s>
I
think
children
should
not
be
considered
to
be
transgender
on
aspects
of
acting
more
in
line
with
stereotypes
of
the
other
gender
and
having
interests
in
that
line
too
.
</s>
<s>
The
problem
is
,
how
do
we
help
children
who
want
to
avoid
looking
like
busty
women
as
girls
,
and
muscle
men
as
boys
?
</s>
<s>
Well
one
particular
thing
I
thought
of
was
the
fact
we
lead
them
to
healthier
life
styles
and
try
to
set
them
up
on
kid-friendly
diets
that
would
prevent
these
effects
but
not
lead
to
the
other
body
ruining
aspects
of
HRT
.
</s>
<s>
As
they
're
teenagers
maybe
light
workouts
that
focus
on
sculpting
the
body
feminine-like
for
guys
and
workouts
that
build
mass
for
girls
.
</s>
<s>
We
absolutely
on
no
stance
should
be
encouraging
these
GNC
girls
and
boys
that
they
're
transgender
,
especially
if
they
have
little(questionable
to
transition
)
or
no
gender
dysphoria
.
</s>
<s>
We
should
be
promoting
healthy
treatment
that
allows
boys
to
be
feminine
without
fearing
being
picked
on
and
having
their
face
shoved
into
a
locker
and
girls
being
able
to
be
more
masculine
and
self
expressive
without
being
ridiculed
for
it
.
</s>
<s>
The
transgender
movement
as
of
right
now
is
pushing
kids
like
these
to
transition
and
it
legitimately
ticks
me
off
.
</s>
<s>
Probably
one
of
my
many
breaking
points
.
</s>
<s>
If
I
grew
up
in
this
time
?
I
'd
probably
be
even
more
messed
up
then
I
am
today
!
Arguably
suicidal
due
to
the
fact
I
'd
be
denied
my
aspects
of
seen
as
masculinity
while
presenting
a
girl
.
</s>
<s>
Suicidal
why
?
</s>
<s>
Because
I
suffer
from
androgen
insensitivity
.
</s>
<s>
I
have
an
extremely
high
testosterone
resistance
and
back
when
I
was
committed
I
was
basically
injected
with
steroid
level
doses
to
make
a
slight
difference
.
</s>
<s>
Not
just
that
,
but
GNC
men
and
women
are
being
told
they
must
be
transgender
and
suppressing
their
desire
to
be
a
woman
or
a
man
!
</s>
<s>
What
kind
of
world
do
we
live
in
that
we
're
telling
people
to
be
living
breathing
harmful
stereotypes
and
locking
the
aspects
of
sex
to
a
very
and
I
mean
VERY
SMALL
BOX
!
What
happened
to
the
days
where
it
was
empowering
to
deny
gender
norms
and
not
ruin
your
body
for
stupid
reasons
.
</s>
<s>
It
gets
worse
though
,
those
that
are
GNC
and
have
no
interest
in
doing
anything
but
hormones
are
even
calling
themselves
transsexual
now
?
!
How
much
terminology
does
the
transgender
movement
have
to
change
before
they
're
happy
?
!
?
</s>
<s>
Or
is
this
the
effect
of
the
GNC
community
getting
back
at
transgender
?
</s>
<s>
It
is
your
body
and
your
rules
but
the
effects
of
hormones
are
dangerous
and
for
trans
individuals
it
is
used
to
help
alleviate
their
dysphoria
while
they
prepare
for
their
long
and
grueling
journey
of
treatments
and
judgement
.
</s>
<s>
I
even
had
someone
who
does
n't
know
of
my
intersex
status
tell
me
I
might
not
actually
be
a
woman
.
</s>
<s>
They
did
n't
say
this
in
the
biological
aspect
,
they
used
the
fact
I
do
n't
like
makeup
and
I
'm
a
gamer
.
</s>
<s>
Yeah
,
two
things
that
break
the
norm
for
femininity
and
I
'm
no
longer
a
woman
.
</s>
<s>
Nevermind
the
fact
I
have
days
I
do
wear
makeup
and
I
do
dress
up
some
days
,
rather
then
my
typical
lazy
girl
attire
.
</s>
<s>
Who
knew
...
.
</s>
<s>
As
if
that
's
the
case
!
I
know
firmly
what
I
am
and
that
year
of
testosterone
being
injected
in
my
body
induced
damage
I
ca
n't
repair
.
</s>
<s>
I
ca
n't
see
the
same
way
I
used
to
anymore
and
I
have
serious
body
dysphoria
now
even
to
the
terms
that
my
genitalia
which
maybe
needed
a
light
correction
procedure
now
actually
needs
an
intrusive
surgery
because
of
the
dysphoria
and
anxiety
it
invokes
in
me
.
</s>
<s>
I
have
to
put
my
body
under
the
table
and
risk
my
life
to
make
what
testosterone
did
to
my
undeveloped
genitals
more
livable
for
me
.
</s>
<s>
Did
you
know
I
ca
n't
even
take
a
shower
or
look
at
my
body
's
reflection
nude
in
the
mirror
since
?
</s>
<s>
I
have
to
wear
a
blindfold
when
I
shower
and
I
actually
carry
this
thing
on
me
for
if
I
suspect
I
'll
be
in
these
situations
.
</s>
<s>
Closing
my
eyes
does
n't
always
work
,
that
hormone
RUINED
ME
!
</s>
<s>
So
I
'm
quite
passionate
about
this
topic
because
not
only
is
it
grooming
a
bunch
of
GNC
children
and
adults
to
think
they
have
to
transition
to
be
the
way
they
are
...
It
's
also
going
to
bite
the
transgender
movement
hard
when
they
experience
dysphoria
for
real
.
</s>
<s>
They
will
grow
bitter
and
resentful
,
like
I
did
but
the
odds
of
them
coming
out
of
that
blaming
rage
and
hate
is
unlikely
.
</s>
<s>
Detransitioners
have
been
popping
up
and
all
of
them
have
mostly
been
siding
with
the
Anti-Trans
groups
and
movements
.
</s>
<s>
They
see
transgenderism
as
something
that
ruined
their
life
,
instead
of
acknowledging
they
were
pressured
to
ruin
their
bodies
based
on
their
presentation
preference
.
</s>
<s>
Admittedly
,
the
topic
burns
me
and
I
wish
it
was
taken
more
seriously
.
</s>
<s>
Gender
Dysphoria
is
not
a
joke
and
if
you
are
n't
trans
and
take
hormones
you
will
induce
this
horrible
feeling
on
yourself
like
myself
and
many
others
.
