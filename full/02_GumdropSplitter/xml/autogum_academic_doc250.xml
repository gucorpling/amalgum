The

One
of
the
major
challenges
of
lignocellulosic

ethanol
is
to
ensure
optimization
of
biomass
conversion
into
components
and
by-products
.

Pretreatment
schemes
ensuring
optimized
use
of
the
biomass
continue
to
be
developed

Raw
material
flexibility
,
minimum
inhibitor
formation

as
well
as
maximum
carbohydrate

are
central
targets

Using
feedstocks

supply
a
factory

as
opposed
to
tiny
amounts

be
carried
out
)
brings
its
own
technological
challenges
:
the
variability
in
quality
and
composition
of
the
feedstock
is
clearly
recognized
as
a
key
point
,
resulting
in
the
need
for
a
robust
pretreatments

<s>
Among
the
various
techniques
applied
in
real
plants
,
enzymatic
hydrolysis
has
proven
to
be
efficient
,
but
enzymes
cost
can
account
for
up
to
30
–
50
%
of
the
total
cost
of
ethanol
production

In

overcome
this
barrier

new

Additionally
,
the
presence
of
lignin
during
hydrolysis
behaves
as
an
inhibitor

it
deposits
itself
onto
cellulose
in
biomass

making
it
inaccessible
to
enzymes

or
it
can
even
adsorb
the
enzymes

Simultaneous

a
challenge

continuous

is
expected
to
increase
the
yield
and
reduce
the
cost

the
final

<s>
The
tolerance
of
ethanol
producing
bacteria
for
high
substrate

inhibitor

still
needs
to
be
improved

its
progress
on
developments
of
co-fermenting
microbes
have
been
slower
than
projected
.
Review
on
“
present
technical
issues
”
hindering
cellulosic
ethanol
production
indicated
microbial
species
had
been
engineered
to
ferment
both
C5
and
C6
sugars
,
but
ethanol
yields
were
low
,
and
the
microbes
had
low
tolerance
to
high
ethanol
contents
compared
to
C5
fermenting
microbes
.
Liu
et
al.
further
reported
that
there
has
been
considerable
work
trying
to
improve
co-fermenting
bacteria
for
at
least
four
decades
to
date
,
but
still
today
,
it
’s
possible
to
recognize
familiar
difficulties
amongst
various
projects

Alcohol

High
