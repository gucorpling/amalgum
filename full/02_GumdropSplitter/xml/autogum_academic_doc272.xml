The
method
proposed
in
this
paper
will
seek
to
exploit
the
correlations
between
distinct
currency
crosses
in
order
to
predict
the
medium-term
trend
of
ones
of
them
.
</s>
<s>
To
this
end
,
the
authors
will
describe
below
a
pipeline
that
is
based
on
the
use
of
set
of
cross-currency
exchanges
characterizing
an
arbitrage
opportunity
in
the
Forex
market
.
</s>
<s>
As
introduced
in
the
first
section
,
an
arbitrage
takes
advantage
of
differences
in
the
price
of
single
currency
related
to
short-time
misalignments
between
the
traded
currency
with
the
related
ones
.
</s>
<s>
A
typical
example
of
arbitrage
is
the
so-called
triangular
arbitrage
referred
to
three
currencies
of
which
one
is
obtainable
from
the
combination
of
the
prices
of
the
other
two
crosses
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
article
,
we
will
refer
to
the
EUR/USD
,
GBP/USD
,
and
EUR/GBP
crosses
.
</s>
<s>
A
similar
approach
can
be
extended
to
any
other
trio
of
related
currencies
.
</s>
<s>
The
currency
on
which
to
execute
trading
operations
is
EUR/USD
.
</s>
<s>
The
price
of
the
EUR/USD
cross
for
arbitrage
purposes
in
the
currency
market
must
always
be
obtainable
from
the
other
two
pairs
EUR/GBP
and
GBP/USD
by
the
relationship

In
Equation
(

)
,
we
have
denoted
with
<b>
<hi rend="italic">
px(tk

</hi>
</b>
the
price
of
the
currency
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
in
a
financially
balanced
market
,
so
that
an
investor
cannot
take
advantage
of
arbitrage
conditions
and
consequently
obtain
a
systematic
gain
,
Equation
(
1
)
must
always
be
verified
,
i.
e.
,
there
must
be
a
very
precise
temporal
correlation
between
specific
currency
crosses
.
</s>
<s>
In
reality
,
small
short-term
misalignments
are
always
found
in
the
Forex
markets
and
these
are
often
excellent
trading
opportunities
for
financial
robot
advisors
who
automatically
execute
many
operations
,
taking
advantage
of
these
short-time
market
misalignments
.

For
the
reasons

the

analyzes
the

In

the

execute
financial
