A

by
a
graph
model
,
where
<hi rend="italic">
N

,
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
A

represent
the
set

a
binary
preference
relationship

For

more
preferred

while
indicates
that
the
two
states
are
equally
preferred
by
DM
<hi rend="italic">
i

.
</s>
<s>
There
are
three
preference
elicitation
approaches
within
the
framework
of
the
GMCR
:
direct
ranking
,
option
weighting
,
and
option
prioritization
.
</s>
<s>
More
specifically
,
the
first
approach
can
be
easily
used
in
smaller
conflict
models
with
limited
states
for
directly
ranking
states
according
to
a
DM
’s
value-based
system

</s>
<s>
In
the
second
method
,
the
ordering
of
states
is
determined
according
to
their
total
weights
which
can
be
calculated
by
using
each
option
’s
weight
.

However
,
some
preference
ordering
over
states
cannot
obtained
by
using
this
approach

</s>
<s>
In
a
given
conflict
,
if
the
number
of
options
is
<hi rend="italic">
a
</hi>
,
then
the
number
of
states
can
be
written
as
2
<hi rend="italic">
a
</hi>
since
each
option
can
be
chosen
or
not
.
</s>
<s>
The
option
prioritization
is
from
the
option
level
instead
of
the
state
level
,
which
can
significantly
improve
the
computational
efficiency
of
preference
ranking
,
especially
for
large-scale
conflicts
.
</s>
<s>
When
analyzing
the
preference
of
DMs
in
a
dispute
,
we
only
need
to
acquire
a
set
of
option
statements
for
each
DM
which
are
ranked
from
most

important
in
a
hierarchical
order

the
