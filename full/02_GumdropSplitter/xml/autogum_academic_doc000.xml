As
a
kind
of
on
â€“
off
valve
,
gate
valves
are
widely
used
in
various
process
industries
.
</s>
<s>
When
compared
with
other
valves
,
it
needs
smaller
torque
during
the
open
and
close
processes
of
the
valve
,
and
it
also
results
in
smaller
flow
resistance
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
due
to
the
complexity
of
the
sealing
device
,
more
components
in
gate
valves
are
needed
,
which
might
lead
to
high
proneness
of
gate
valve
failure
.

Researches
about
various
valves
have
been
focused
in
the
past
years
.
</s>
<s>
For
instance
,
Qian
et
al.
applied
Tesla
valves
in
the
hydrogen
decompression
process
and
investigated
the
pressure
drop
and
Mach
number
in
multi-stage
Tesla
valves
.
Yuan
et
al.
and
Jin
et
al.
conducted
numerical
simulations
to
study
the
cavitation
inside
the
poppet
valve
and
the
globe
valve
,
and
the
cavitation
characteristics
and
the
structural
parameters
that
affected
the
cavitation
were
found
.
Dasgupta
et
al.
and
Zhang
et
al.
and
Qian
et
al.
focused
on
the
dynamic
valve
open
and
close
processes
of
a
proportional
valve
,
a
pressure
relief
valve
,
and
a
pilot-control
globe
valve
respectively
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
Jin
et
al.
and
Qian
et
al.
investigated
the
structural
parameters
of
a
pilot-control
angle
valve
and
a
micro
Tesla
valve
,
Xu
et
al.
focused
on
the
pulsatile
flow
of
a
mechanical
heart
valve
,
Chen
et
al.
investigated
the
thermal
stress
of
a
pressure-reducing
valve
,
and
Qian
et
al.
analyzed
the
possibility
of
the
noise
distribution
in
perforated
plates
connecting
pressure-relief
valve
.

Specific
to
the
gate
valves
,
lots
of
works
have
also
been
done
focusing
on
different
issues
.
</s>
<s>
There
are
works
regarding
the
flow
resistance
and
the
temperature
distributions
.
</s>
<s>
Solek
and
Mika
investigated
the
relationship
between
the
loss
coefficient
and
the
Reynolds
number
for
gate
valves
with
ice
slurry
flow
,
and
their
experiments
showed
that
the
loss
coefficient
remained
constant
in
the
turbulent
regime
,
but
decreased
with
the
increase
of
the
Reynolds
number
in
the
laminar
regime
.
</s>
<s>
Alimonti
and
Lin
et
al.
studied
the
flow
characteristics
and
resistance
characteristics
of
a
gate
valve
with
different
openings
and
different
inlet
velocities
,
and
it
was
found
that
the
flow
resistance
could
be
gradually
stabilized
when
the
opening
was
larger
than
2/8
.
</s>
<s>
Long
and
Shurong
numerically
investigated
the
flow
and
temperature
distributions
in
the
stem
gate
valve
while
using
axisymmetric
models
,
and
Hu
et
al.
performed
experiments
and
numerical
simulations
to
study
the
temperature
and
the
convection
heat
transfer
coefficient
distributions
in
a
gate
valve
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
meantime
,
there
are
also
works
regarding
structure
optimization
,
the
corrosion
erosion
distributions
,

the
stress
analysis
.
</s>
<s>
Kolesnikov
and
Tikhonov
focused
on
the
conicity
of
the
output
channel
of
the
wedge
gate
valve

Xu
et
al.
focused
on
the
seal
and
piston
of
a
subsea
gate
valve
.
</s>
<s>
Babaev
and
Kerimov
found
that
there
was
fretting
corrosion
for
a
parallel
slide
gate
valve
.
Lin
et
al.
found
that
the
erosion
rate
in
a
gate
valve
was
related
to
the
pipe
diameter
,
the
cavity
width
,
and
the
inlet
velocity
,
while
the
open
degree
had
little
effects
but
a
large
Stokes
number
could
increase
the
difference
of
erosion
distributions
for
different
valve
placements
.
</s>
<s>
As
for
the
stress
analysis
,
Liao
et
al.
found
that
the
fatigue
of
the
inlet
valve
sleeve
resulting
from
collision
stress
was
the
main
reason
for
the
valve
failure
.
</s>
<s>
Zakirnichnaya
and
Kulsharipov
analyzed
the
stress-strain
of
the
wedge
gate
valves
while
using
fluid-structure
interaction
technology
and
they
found
that
the
safe
operation
resources
value
of
the
wedge
is
lower
than
the
valve
body
.
Punitharani
et
al.
applied
the
finite
element
analysis
(
FEA
)
method
to
evaluate
the
residual
stresses
in
a
gate
valve
,
and
they
found
that
there
were
large
tensile
and
compressive
residual
stresses
on
the
circular
bead
of
the
gate
valve

valve

In

different
Reynolds
number

depth

the
structural
stress
analysis

done

This
work

helpful
for
the
understanding

the
judgment

the
reason
for
valve
failure
in
the
future
