So
people
that
try
to
classify
that
as
some
sort
of
welfare
that
's
exploding
the
budget
is
just
disingenuous
,
especially
when
you
figure
the
fact
that
Social
Security
surplus
is
just
on
book
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
on
budget
,
so
therefore
,
the
surplus
works
to
actually
reduce
the
deficit
and
therefore
brings
borrowing
costs
for
the
government
down
.
</s>
<s>
So
,
Social
Security
has
had
a
very
good
impact
all
the
way
around
,
and
it
's
something
that
's
actually
worked
to
keep
people
out
of
poverty
.
</s>
<s>
Now
,
I
mean
ten
percent
of
the
people
are
in
poverty
,
if
we
did
n't
have
social
security
,
40
percent
of
the
older
people
would
be
in
poverty
.

But

Republicans
want

undo
what
works
well

Not
just
the
Republicans
necessarily
,
but
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%20Dog%20Democrats">

and
the

class
,
the
elite
want
to
undo
what
works
well
for
the
people
,
which
is
Social
Security
,
and
they
want
to
keep
a
failed
healthcare
system
that
's
uncompetitive
in
the
world
economy
.

I

it
's

these

when

can

That
's
the
way
it
should
work

</p>
<p>
<s>
We
do
need
agricultural
workers
,
and
I
think
we
need
workers
in
the
domestic
area
,
and
there
's
other
places
where
the
illegal
immigrants
are
needed
as
well
in
restaurant
work
,
hotel
work
,
and
some
type
of
domestic
work
,
because
they
've
done
a
lot
of
the
work
that
Americans
would
n't
do
.
</s>
<s>
But
we
do
have
to
keep
tabs
on
it
and
the
guest
worker
program
is
the
best
way
to
do
it
.
</s>
<s>
And
I
think
if
you
are
worried
about
the
factories
,
and
the
construction
jobs
that
may
be
going
to
illegals
,
then
the
easiest
way
to
remedy
that
and
the
parties
wo
n't
do
it
because
they
're
both
too
deep
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber%20of%20Commerce">

money
,
but
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
give
the
businesses
that
play
by
the
rules
the
right
to
sue
the
ones
that
do
n't
under
the
series
of
unfair
uncompetitive
practices
under
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal%20Trade%20Commission">

.
</s>
<s>
If
you
would
just
give
the
affected
businesses
,
standing
to
sue
,
which
I
do
n't
think
they
have
right
now
,
then
the
whole
thing
would
end
.
</s>
<s>
But
they
wo
n't
do
that

It
would
be
the
surest
way
