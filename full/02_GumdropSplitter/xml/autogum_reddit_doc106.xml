There

are

conscious

which
ones
are

Some

Some
believe
that
a

becomes

all

debating
completely

This
is
the
relevant
quote
,
after
Bernard
asks
ford
what
makes
a
host
's
consciousness
different
from
a
human
's
(
emphasis
mine
)
:
&gt;&quot;This
is
the
very
question
that
consumed
Arnold
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">
...
]
The
answer
always
seemed
obvious
to
me
.
<hi rend="bold">
There
is
no
threshold
</hi>
that
makes
us
greater
than
the
sum
of
our
parts
,
<hi rend="bold">
no
inflection
point
at
which
we
become
fully
alive
.
We
ca
n't
define
consciousness
because
consciousness
does
not
exist
.
</hi>
Ford
is
telling
us
the
truth
here
,
at
least
the
closest
thing
to
the
truth
we
're
likely
to
ever
have
.
Consciousness
,
whether
you
're
an
ant
,
a
dog
,
a
human
,
or
robot
,
is
a
matter
of
<hi rend="bold">
degrees
</hi>
.
It
is
a
fluid
spectrum
.
The
only
real
measure
we
have
to
tell
if
something
is
conscious
or
not
is
how
it
reacts
to
stimuli
.
I
believe
you
're
conscious
because
if
I
say
&quot;
Hello
&quot;
to
you
,
you
will
greet
me
back
in
a
more
or
less
expected
way
.
That
is
you
reacting
to
an
external
stimulus
.
But
,
if
I
drop
a
banana
on
the
floor
and
it
bruises
,
is
that
an
example
of
a
living
thing
reacting
to
a
stimulus
?
When
the
leaves
on
trees
turn
upside-down
in
anticipation
of
the
rain
,
is
it
because
they
are
<hi rend="bold">
conscious
</hi>
of
the
subtle
changes
in
the
atmosphere
around
them
?
It
would
be
easy
to
say
&quot;
No
,
because
bananas
and
trees
do
n't
think
or
make
choices
.
&quot;
But
that
begs
the
question
.
It
misses
the
point
.
You
do
n't
have
any
access
to
what
that
tree
may
or
may
not
be
<hi rend="bold">
experiencing
</hi>
.
If
I
say
&quot;
Hello
&quot;
to
you
and
you
say
it
back
,
I
<hi rend="bold">
assume
</hi>
that
you
chose
to
do
that
.
But
what
if
we
were
both
in
Westworld
?
How
could
I
know
based
just
on
that
interaction
whether
or
not
your
&quot;
thoughts
&quot;
and
&quot;
choices
&quot;
were
electrical
impulses
in
your
brain
or
electrical
impulses
in
your
weird-egg-pearl-thingy
?
No
matter
how
many
times
I
say
&quot;
Hello
&quot;
and
watch
your
reaction
,
I
'll
never
have
direct
,
unfiltered
access
to
your
<hi rend="bold">
actual
qualitative
experiences
</hi>
,
and
so
I
can
never
be
100
%
sure
.
For
anyone
more
interested
in
this
,
I
highly
recommend
researching
(
beyond
just
these
wikipedia
entries
)
the
[
Hard
Problem
of
Consciousness
</ref>
and
the

I
also
point
to
this
as
a
clue
that
there
is
no
consciousness
transfer
either
,
since
Ford
just
died
.

He
's
been
in
control
of
the
host
brains
until
just
now
,
and
he
does
n't
believe
consciousness
is
a
real
thing
,
so
how
could
it
be
transferred
?
