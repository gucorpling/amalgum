So
we
need
to
have
work
for
people
and
to
do
that
we
have
to
keep
capital
in
the
community
and
we
ca
n't
do
that
if
we
're
going
to
continue
to
underwrite
the
speculation
.

If
we
're
going

use

capital
we
have
to
underwrite
the
speculation

banks

Everyone

require
billions

bailouts

even
more

<s>
They
got
some
bailouts
from
Federal
Reserve
money
...
and
what
do
they
do
,
they
hurt
the
economy

</s>
<s>
To
cover
their
own
losses
and
stupidity
,
they
take
that
money
at
one
third
of
one
percent
,

turn
around
and
sponsor
credit
cards
,
usually
with
16

24
percent

rates

I

I
mean
,
I
could
sit
here
with
a
chart

put
all
this
information
up
in
probably
30
or
40
minutes
in
a
national
press
conference
and
I
guarantee
you
70
percent
of
the
people
would
approve
of
what
I
said
,

we

have
a

country

You
