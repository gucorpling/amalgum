Salinity
is
one
of
the
most
important
marine
parameters
,
which
controls
many
processes
such
as
physical
circulations
,
biogeochemistry
dynamics
from
regional
to
global
ocean
.
</s>
<s>
Although
drifters
and
buoys
,
together
with
cruises
,
have
accumulated
large
amount
in-situ
water
salinity
data
in
different
regions
,
it
is
still
difficult
to
monitor
global
ocean
salinity
with
high
temporal-spatial
resolution
by
the
in
situ
measurements
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
past
decade
,
with
the
successful
launch
of
the
soil
moisture
and
ocean
salinity
(
SMOS
)
satellite
by
the
European
Space
Agency
(
ESA
)
,
the
Aquarius/SAC-D
satellite
,
and
the
soil
moisture
active
passive
(
SMAP
)
satellite
by
the
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration
(
NASA
)
,
global
sea
surface
salinity
(
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
)
observations
from
space
have
become
possible
and
a
significant
improvement
has
been
made
to
understand
the
ocean
dynamics
and
climate
change
.

<s>
The
early
concept
of
remote
sensing
of
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
has
been
demonstrated
in
the
late
1970s
with
observations
by
Skylab
and
two
airborne
L-band
radiometry
experiments
.
</s>
<s>
At
the
end
of
1990
,
two
airborne
microwave
interferometers
,
the
electronically
scanned
thinned
array
radiometer
(
ESTAR
)
and
the
scanning
low-frequency
microwave
radiometer
(
SLFMR
)
,
successfully
produced
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
maps
in
coastal
areas
in
agreement
with
in-situ
measurements
with
an
accuracy
of
about
1
psu
.
</s>
<s>
Based
on
many
experiments
,
the
L-band
is
evidenced
as
the
optimal
frequency
for
remote
sensing
of
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
,
which
has
been
adopted
by
SMOS
,
Aquarius/SAC-D
and
SMAP
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
sensitivity
of
satellite
measured
brightness
temperature
to
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
is
quite
low
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
the
sensitivity
of
vertically
polarized
brightness
temperature
to
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
variation
is
0.4
to
0.8
K/psu
for
different
observing
angles
and
sea
surface
temperatures
(
<hi rend="italic">
SST
</hi>
)
,
and
it
is
only
0.2
to
0.6
K/psu
for
the
horizontal
polarization
brightness
temperature
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
remote
sensing
of
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
requires
a
highly
accurate
retrieval
model
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
widely
accepted
that
the
corrections
of
the
sea
surface
and
atmospheric
effects
are
essential
for
remote
sensing
of
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
,
since
these
effects
could
alter
the
value
of
sensor-measured
brightness
temperature
and
introduce
errors
into
the
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
retrieval
process
.
</s>
<s>
Besides
the
atmospheric
effects
,
the
increasing
of
sea
surface
emissivity
due
to
the
sea
surface
roughness
and
foam
effects
is
the
main
source
of
error
,
which
could
significantly
hamper
the
accuracy
of
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
retrieval
.
</s>
<s>
Over
the
past
decades
,
the
correction
for
sea
surface
roughness
effects
were
studied
based
on
the
in-situ
and
airborne
measurements
;
for
example
,
the
experiments
made
from
a
tower
,
wind
and
salinity
experiments
(
WISE
)
,
airborne
Passive-Active
L-band
Sensor
(
PALS
)
campaign
and
Combined
Airborne
Radio
instruments
for
Ocean
and
Land
Studies
(
CAROLS
)
campaigns
.
</s>
<s>
Many
rough
surface
emission
models
have
also
been
developed
based
on
the
theoretical
and
empirical
methods
.
</s>
<s>
Among
these
models
,
the
small-slope
approximation/small
perturbation
model
(
SSA/SPM
)
,
two
scale
model
(
TSM
)
and
empirical/semi-empirical
models
have
been
widely
used
by
the
research
community
and
implemented
in
different
satellite
data
processing
systems
.
</s>
<s>
As
the
foam
effect
is
significant
at
high
wind
speed
conditions
(
above
a
threshold
of
12
m/s
)
due
to
strong
wave
breaking
,
it
has
been
corrected
by
numerous
models
;
for
example
,
the
semi-empirical
models
and
radiative
transfer
equation
(
RTE
)
based
models
,
which
were
developed
to
estimate
the
foam
covered
sea
surface
emissivity
.
</s>
<s>
Although
many
theoretical
and
empirical
models
have
been
developed
,
some
problems
are
still
unsolved
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
the
TSM
originally
proposed
to
estimate
brightness
temperature
at
higher
frequencies
,
uses
the
sea
surface
wave
spectrum
by
multiplying
a
factor
of
2
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
whether
this
modification
can
be
applied
to
L-band
is
still
unclear
,
and
the
choice
of
cutoff
wavenumber
is
arbitrary
and
needs
to
be
clarified
in
the
L-band
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
the
sea
surface
reflection
of
downwelling
atmospheric
emission
is
another
contribution
to
satellite-observed
brightness
temperature
,
thus
the
determination
of
the
cutoff
wavenumber
is
required
not
only
for
sea
surface
emission
but
also
for
reflection
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
the
widely
used
empirical
models
decouple
the
wind
effect
from
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
SST
</hi>
effects
,
which
means
that
the
surface
emission
is
due
to
a
perfectly
flat
sea
surface
and
the
wind-roughened
sea
surface
.
</s>
<s>
The
wind-roughened
sea
surface
is
associated
with
the
increased
brightness
temperature
(
due
to
sea
surface
roughness
effect
)
,
which
induces
regional
biases
when
applied
to
different
areas
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
the
satellite
measurements
of
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
are
hampered
by
the
effect
of
radio
frequency
interference
(
RFI
)
in
offshore
areas
of
China
(
i.
e.
,
Bohai
sea
,
Yellow
sea
and
East
China
sea
)
,
which
causes
a
large
amount
of
data
to
be
discarded
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
the
compatibility
of
these
models
in
coastal
area
of
China
needs
to
be
assessed
and
tested
in
order
to
achieve
higher
accuracies
of
<hi rend="italic">
SSS
</hi>
from
the
space-borne
observations
.
