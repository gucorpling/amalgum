Through
my
profession
,
I
have
come
to
appreciate
that
<hi rend="italic">
how
</hi>
things
are
communicated
is
just
as
important
as
what
is
being
communicated
.

Sometimes
the
words
we
choose
or
the
method
we
select
to
share
an
idea
gets
in
the
way
of
people
appreciating
it
and
embracing
it
.
</s>
<s>
Why
is
this
important
?
</s>
<s>
Because
a
President
who
is
attentive
to
not
only
what
he
is
saying
,
but
how
he
is
saying
it
,
is
apt
to
be
more
effective
at
rallying
people
to
a
common
cause
.

My
work
in
advertising
,
for
which
I
have
won
many
awards
,
has
demanded
that
I
generate
creative
solutions
,
and
help
inspire
them
in
others

virtually
every
single
day

Why

We
all
know
that
our
country

face
major
challenges
,
to
put
it
mildly

Our
only
hope
in
overcoming
these

I

In

I

proposed

be
“
repurposed

two

three
decades
to
help
fight

warming

<s>
What
I
envision
is
asking
the
very
bright
scientists
and
engineers
at
NASA
to
direct
their
gaze
down
at
Earth
rather
than
up
in
the
stars

This
way
,
we
can
tap
into
their
collective
brainpower

help
develop
new
technologies

improve
energy
efficiency

to
slow
global
warming

But
the
need

so
great

slow

As
President

I
would
keep
a
healthy
military

intelligence
budget

all
along
making
sure
that
we
are
training
and
caring
for
our
soldiers

they
prepare

wait

adjust

I

raise

<p>

I
would
work
quickly

secure
our

putting
additional
measures

monitored
fencing

more

crossing
guards
;
small

mobile
groups

elite
soldiers
to
“
spot
check

our
borders

more
resources

the
Coast
Guard

protect
our
shores

more
human

technical
resources

monitor
those
who
come
to
play

work
in

country

We
need

consider
enemies

affairs
