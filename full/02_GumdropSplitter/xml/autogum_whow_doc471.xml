As

ages

shallow
roots
can
sometimes
expand
to
the
point
that
they
become
exposed
above
the
surface
of
the
soil

<s>
Roots
can
also
become
exposed
due
to
soil
erosion

cramped
conditions
forcing
the
roots
to
the
surface

</s>
<s>
If
your
tree
has
exposed
roots
that
are
causing
problems
,
try
covering
the
roots
with
mulch
or
an
attractive
ground
cover
.
</s>

As
a
last
resort
,
consider
removing
or
partially
removing
a
problem
root

</s>
<s>
Prevent
problems
by
planting
your
trees
strategically

species
that
