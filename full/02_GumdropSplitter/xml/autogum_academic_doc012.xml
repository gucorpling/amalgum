Introduction

<p>
<s>
Weaning
is
a
multifaceted
stressor
incorporating
nutritional
,
environmental
and
physiological
elements
and
thus
is
one
of
the
most
challenging
periods
for
both
producers
and
calves
(
e.
g.
,
)
.
</s>
<s>
Improper
handling
of
stressors
in
early
calfhood
can
impact
negatively
upon
future
health
,
welfare
and
productivity
.
</s>
<s>
Abrupt
weaning
of
calves
,
whereby
a
previously
unchanged
milk
allowance
is
removed
suddenly
over
24
h
,
has
been
associated
with
decreased
solid
feed
consumption
in
the
pre-wean
period
and
a
decrease
or
stall
in
growth
rate
in
the
period
following
the
withdrawal
of
milk
.
</s>
<s>
Practices
such
as
step-down
or
gradual
weaning
through
reduction
in
volume
of
milk
over
a
number
of
days
or
reduction
in
number
of
milk
meals
have
been
suggested
as
a
means
of
reducing
the
impact
of
weaning
stress
.
Sweeney
et
al.
examined
the
impact
of
weaning
duration
on
concentrate
intake
and
performance
of
calves
offered
high
levels
of
milk
.
</s>
<s>
Concentrate
intake
was
increased
in
calves
subject
to
10
or
22
day
weaning
durations
when
compared
to
those
weaned
either
abruptly
or
over
4
days
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
increased
intake
was
not
sufficient
to
compensate
for
the
reduced
intake
of
milk
,
leading
to
lower
digestible
energy
intakes
and
low
live
weight
gains
in
the
calves
weaned
over
22
days
.
</s>
<s>
Another
method
of
gradual
weaning
is
to
increase
dilution
of
milk
replacer
.
</s>
<s>
This
method
was
used
by
Overvest
et
al.
in
pair
housed
calves
as
it
was
considered
that
if
a
volume
reduction
method
had
been
implemented
there
could
have
been
greater
variation
in
milk
intake
between
calves
.
</s>
<s>
These
gradual
weaning
methods
have
been
shown
to
encourage
solid
feed
intake
at
an
earlier
age
which
is
thought
to
help
prepare
calves
for
a
solid
feed
diet
and
thus
lessen
the
impact
of
milk
removal
(
e.
g.
,
)
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
these
studies
also
highlight
the
importance
of
considering
calf
age
,
concentrate
intake
and
milk
feeding
system
when
choosing
a
weaning
method
so
as
to
ensure
calves
achieve
performance
targets
.

Calf
reaction
to
stressors
such
as
weaning
has
traditionally
been
assessed
using
behavioural
and
aural
observations
(
e.
g.
,
)
.
</s>
<s>
Recently
,
however
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
use
of
combined
remote
sensing
technologies
could
allow
measurement
of
several
behavioural
and
physiological
responses
,
which
,
when
compared
with
measuring
only
a
single
aspect
,
could
provide
a
more
accurate
aggregate
indicator
of
animal
well-being
.
</s>
<s>
The
use
of
automatic
milk
feeders
and
pedometers
has
provided
increased
opportunities
for
behaviour
monitoring
in
a
remote
,
non-invasive
manner
.
</s>
<s>
With
regard
to
long-term
measurements
,
automated
feeders
allow
precise
measurement
of
individual
feed
intake
(
e.
g.
,
)
and
the
recording
of
behavioural
traits
,
deviations
in
which
can
be
indicative
of
increased
stress
as
a
result
of
feeding
regime
.
</s>
<s>
Measurement
of
calf
activity
using
pedometers
or
accelerometers
has
previously
been
linked
with
hunger
,
with
De
Paula
Vieira
et
al.
finding
that
standing
time
was
increased
by
1
hr
in
limit
fed
calves
when
compared
with
those
fed
ad
libitum
.
</s>
<s>
With
regard
to
underlying
physiological
response
to
stressors
,
recent
research
has
highlighted
heart
rate
variability
(
HRV
)
as
a
viable
,
non-invasive
parameter
for
measuring
response
to
environmental
,
physiological
and
psychological
stress
load
.

<s>
With
an
increasing
range
of
on-farm
sensing
technologies
available
,
the
aim
of
this
study
was
to
determine
the
effect
of
gradual
versus
abrupt
weaning
on
group
housed
calves
using
non-invasive
,
automated
behavioural
and
physiological
parameters
.

A
further
objective
was
to
assess
the
impact
of
weaning
method
on
calf
performance
