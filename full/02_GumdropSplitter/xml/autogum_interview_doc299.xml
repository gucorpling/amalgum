A
criticism
of
the
Arab
states
is
that
back
in
the
1990s
they
had
squandered
the
wealth
that
they
were
making
on
the
high
oil
price
because
they
had
not
invested
it
wisely
.
</s>
<s>
It
seems
that
that
has
changed
,
that
the
Arabs
are
creating
these
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign%20wealth%20funds">
new
wealth
funds
</ref>
and
that
much
of
the
money
that
is
generated
in
the
Middle
East
is
now
coming
from
Arab
states
.

Are
you
worried
that
Israel
will
become
increasingly
marginalized
in
the
Middle
East

Look

I

One
of
the
things

that

Now

First
of
all

Tel

becoming
noisy

all
cities

It
has
all
the
flaws

a
city

the
crime

drugs

pollution

Today
,
a
young
boy
is
attending
three
schools
:
the
formal
school
in
the
morning
,
;
the
informal
school
—
television
—
in
the
afternoon
;

the
new
language

is
Internet

talk
all

school

What
keeps
them
up-to-date

the
television

<s>
They
look
upon
their
teachers
as
old-age

a
little
bit
boring

because
they
already
know
more

do

They
have
a

language

they
have
a
new
mind
,
they
have
a
new
sensitivity

</s>
<s>
In
my
judgment
,
the
greatest
thing
is
to
bring
over
people
from
the
old
past
that
was
slow
--
the
cultivation
of
land
--
to
a
new
future
,
which
is
as
quick
as
an
Internet
