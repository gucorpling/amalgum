The
extensive
use
of
industrial
generation
engines
worldwide
,
the
low
efficiency
(
which
does
not
exceed
42
%
)
,
and
the
potential
of
the
waste
gases
generated
,
makes
this
thermal
machine
a
central
research
issue
.
</s>
<s>
Several
methods
have
been
proposed
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
these
engines

One
has
been
the
implementation
of
an
organic
Rankine
cycle
(
ORC
)
as
a
waste
heat
recovery
system
from
the
exhaust
gases
,
where
the
working
fluids
play
an
important
role
in
the
optimization
study
to
obtain
better
performance
in
the
process

In
a
power
generation
system
,
several
thermodynamic
cycles
were
implemented
for
waste
heat
recoveries
,
such
as
the
ORC
,
the
Kalina
cycle
,
and
the
steam
Rankine
cycle
.
</s>
<s>
The
complex
structure
of
the
Kalina
cycle
,
the
operational
requirement
of
the
steam
Rankine
cycle
such
as
the
high
operating
pressures
and
high
risk
of
erosion
,
means
the
ORC
cycle
has
the
advantage
given
its
simplicity
,
high
reliability
,
and
easy
maintenance
,
which
uses
organic
fluids
for
its
operation
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
ORC
is
more
suitable
for
using
low
and
moderate
energies
(
coolant
engines
and
exhaust
gases
,
for
example
)
than
the
Kalina
cycle
and
the
steam
Rankine
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
different
waste
heat
recovery
configurations
based
on
ORC
cycle
should
be
studied
to
be
optimized
under
a
thermoeconomic
point
of
view
for
a
particular
heat
source

present
a

The
model
was
validated
by
comparing
the
results

experimental

an
exhaust

was
implemented
to
measure
engine
performance
within
the
framework
of
international

the

the

a

From
the
results
,
it
is
observed
that
about
5
%
of
annual
fuel
consumption
would
be
saved
for

system
without
ORC

improving
the

would
help

This
research

Additionally
,
Liu

proposed
different
modifications
to
the
configurations
of
the
ORC
cycle
and
how
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
this
cycle
,
where
they
presented
ORC
best
practice
,

with
these
proposed
modifications
a
thermal
efficiency
of
18.57
%
was
achieved
,
higher
than
the
other
models
evaluated
,
thus
the
study
provides
to
future
researchers
relevant
information
to
evaluate
the
cost-benefit
of
each
configuration

determine
which
direction
to
take
for
further
improvements

the
optimal

the
ORC

applied
only

diesel

industrial

In
order
to
increase
the
energy
efficiency
,
different
modifications
have
been
proposed
to
the
ORC
architecture
,
several
of
the
proposed
improvements
aim
to
optimize
the
temperature
profile
,
where
the
organic
working
fluid
follows
the
external
heat

to
reduce
the
exergy

</s>
<s>
One
of
the
modifications
to
the
architecture
of
this
system
is
known
as
RORC
,
where
research
has
been
carried
out
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
cycle
by
9.29
%
,
and
from
the
data
obtained
from
these
studies
it
can
also
be
appreciated
that
both
the
RORC
and
the
simple
ORC
(
SORC
)
work
better
with
drier
fluids
,
where
the
efficiency
of
the
cycle
was
also
affected
by
the
critical
temperature

</s>
<s>
These
studies
are
limited
to
compare
only
the
SORC
and
RORC
cycles
,
and
the
double-stage
ORC
(
DORC
)
study
is
not
integrated
with
exhaust
gases
from
a
natural
gas
engine
as
a
heat

<p>
<s>
In
addition
to
these
changes
,
more
than
one
stage
of
the
evaporation
of
the
working
fluid
was
added
,
where
each
stage
has
a
different
temperature

working

This
modification
is
considered
in

this
system
was
able
to
increase
the
efficiency

respect
to
SORC
between
8.97
%
and
25
%
depending
on
the
operating
conditions
described
according
to
Braimakis
et
al.
and
Yang

investigations
.

<s>
However
,
this
system
has
not
been
optimized
and
integrated
to
a
GE
Jenbacher
engine
type
6
as
a
bottoming
cycle
,
and
in
thermoeconomic
terms
,
some
indicators
of
this
thermal
engine
with
ORC
have
not
been
studied
in
a
real
operational
context
,
such
as
the
leveled
cost
of
energy
(
LCOE
)
,
the
specific
investment
cost
(
SIC
)
,
and
the
payback
period
(
PBP
)
,

allow
the
technical
and
economic
feasibility
of
this
solution
to
be
determined
