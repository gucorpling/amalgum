Conclusions

</head>
<p>
<s>
This
study
used
annual
data
to
investigate
the
impact
of
institutional
ownership
on
stock
return
volatility
,
idiosyncratic
risks
,
and
corporate
governance
in
China
.
</s>
<s>
In
order
to
identify
this
effect
,
We
employed
the
panel
regression
model
by
using
the
ordinary
least
squares
(
OLS
)
to
first
explore
the
relationship
between
institutional
ownership
and
stock
return
volatility
.
</s>
<s>
Then
,
this
study
used
the
CAPM
one-factor
model
and
the
Fama
–
French
three-factor
model
to
analyze
the
relationship
between
institutional
ownership
and
idiosyncratic
risks
and
the
binary
logic
panel
model
to
estimate
the
relationship
between
institutional
ownership
and
corporate
governance
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
this
study
compared
the
empirical
results
during
the
pre-crisis
,
during
crisis
,
and
post-crisis
periods
.
</s>
<s>
We
were
interested
in
whether
institutional
investors
have
a
different
effect
on
the
volatility
of
stock
returns
,
idiosyncratic
risks
,
and
corporate
governance
in
the
Chinese
market
.
</s>
<s>
We
tried
to
determine
what
type
of
institutional
investors
help
stabilize
the
individual
market
effectively
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
this
study
was
interested
in
which
type
of
institutional
ownership
has
the
role
of
stewardship
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
empirical
results
show
that
independent
institutions
and
domestic
institutions
reduce
stock
return
volatility
.
</s>
<s>
The
results
are
consistent
with
hypothesis
1a
and
2a
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
grey
institutions
and
foreign
institutions
have
no
significant
effects
on
stock
return
volatility
,
so
hypotheses
1b
and
2b
could
not
be
confirmed
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
For
the
effect
on
the
idiosyncratic
risks
of
stock
,
the
empirical
results
of
the
CAPM
one
factor
and
the
Fama
–
French
three-factors
models
show
that
independent
institutions
reduce
the
idiosyncratic
risks
of
stocks
in
the
periods
during
the
crisis
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
grey
institutions
and
foreign
institutions
have
no
significant
effect
on
the
idiosyncratic
risk
in
all
three
periods
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
empirical
results
of
the
effects
on
corporate
governance
show
different
effects
on
the
top
10
shareholders
,
senior
shareholders
,
and
the
personnel
change
of
the
first
shareholder
and
CEO
.
</s>
<s>
For
the
top
10
shareholders
,
all
institutional
ownerships
have
a
significantly
positive
effect
,
but
for
senior
shareholders
,
this
effect
is
reversed
,
and
independent
and
domestic
institutional
ownerships
have
a
significantly
negative
effect
.
</s>
<s>
The
effects
on
the
personnel
change
of
first
shareholder
and
CEO
are
not
significant
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
With
this
research
,
we
have
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
behavior
of
institutional
investors
in
the
Chinese
market
.
</s>
<s>
Independent
institutional
investors
have
exercised
their
supervisory
responsibilities
as
active
ownership
,
and
this
kind
of
stewardship
behavior
of
independent
institutional
investors
was
more
obvious
during
post-crisis
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
in
the
regression
of
the
CAPM
one-factor
models
,
domestic
institutional
investors
effectively
reduce
the
idiosyncratic
risks
before
the
financial
crisis
.
</s>
<s>
As
for
foreign
institutions
,
the
performance
of
their
supervision
in
the
periods
of
pre-crisis
,
during
crisis
,
and
post-crisis
is
not
obvious
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
for
corporate
governance
,
institutional
ownership
,
as
a
form
of
large
professional
ownership
,
improves
the
quality
of
corporate
governance
.
</s>
<s>
Institutional
investors
are
one
of
the
company
’s
most
important
shareholders
,
suppressing
the
equity
of
senior
shareholders
after
the
financial
crisis
,
while
maintaining
the
neutrality
of
supervision
.

<p>
<s>
We
sought
to
explore
the
sustainability
of
institutional
investors
and
stable
economic
growth
in
developing
countries
from
a
holistic
perspective
.
</s>
<s>
Continuing
the
previous
research
,
from
the
perspective
of
sustainable
development
,
Lin
et
al.
studied
the
behavior
of
institutional
investors
from
the
external
market
environment
.
</s>
<s>
This
study
explores
the
contribution
of
institutional
investors
in
the
market
environment
.
</s>
<s>
Both
parts
of
this
study
have
effectively
proven
that
,
in
independent
institutions
,
the
role
of
stewardship
in
both
the
external
market
environments
supports
national
policies
and
the
internal
market
environment
for
financial
stability
and
corporate
governance
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
However
,
foreign
institutional
investors
who
are
active
in
both
institutions
have
no
obvious
effect
on
the
role
of
housekeepers
in
China
,
which
is
inconsistent
with
previous
scholars
’
research
.
</s>
<s>
This
study
believes
that
the
reason
for
this
result
is
related
to
the
degree
of
China
’s
openness
to
foreign
investment
.
</s>
<s>
Although
the
amount
of
investment
in
foreign
institutions
has
increased
significantly
during
the
study
period
(
2005
–
2016
)
,
its
proportion
among
the
total
institutional
investors
is
still
small
(
1.68
%
)
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
in
order
for
foreign
institutional
investors
to
play
the
role
of
stewards
,
it
will
be
necessary
for
developing
countries
to
be
open
to
foreign
investment
institutions
.
</s>
<s>
The
continued
clarity
of
national
policies
is
also
an
indispensable
factor
for
attracting
foreign
institutional
investors
.
</s>
<s>
The
increase
in
active
institutional
investors
will
have
a
sustainable
effect
on
national
policy
and
market
stability
,
as
well
as
investor
profitability
.
