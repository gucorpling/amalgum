A

A

<hi rend="italic">
<s>
Frequent
handover
</hi>
:
Future
communication
systems
will
consist
of
heterogeneous
small
dense
networks
that
will
create
very
frequent
handovers
.
</s>
<s>
A
handover
will
be
between
optical
networks
and
between
optical
and
RF
networks
.
</s>
<s>
Optical
cells
are
very
small
and
may
trigger
many
unnecessary
handovers
.
</s>
<s>
Avoiding
an
unnecessary
handover
and
the
ping-pong
effect
is
also
an
important
issue
.
</s>
<s>
The
properties
of
the
physical
and
data-link
layers
differ
in
the
optical
and
RF-based
wireless
networks
,
thereby
bringing
about
a
great
challenge
for
the
mobility
support
in
RF/optical
hybrid
systems
.

Inter-cell
interference
</hi>
:
Managing
the
inter-cell
optical
interference
is
a
serious
issue
in
the
deployment
of
optical
VLC
and
LiFi
networks
.
</s>
<s>
The
dense
deployment
of
LEDs
for
the
OWC
technologies
may
create
high
interference
in
the
5G/6G
and
IoT
networks
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
the
inter-cell
optical
interference
is
a
challenging
issue
.
</s>

<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<s>
Atmospheric
loss
</hi>
:
The
performance
of
the
OWC
technologies
is
affected
by
scattering
,
refraction
,
air
absorption
,
free
space
loss
,
and
scintillation
of
the
atmosphere
.
</s>
<s>
In
an
outdoor
environment
,
fog
and
dust
obstruct
the
optical
signal
from
the
transmitter
to
the
receiver
.
</s>
<s>
The
communication
link
quality
in
the
FSO
is
degraded
because
of
bad
atmospheric
conditions
.
</s>
<s>
Hence
,
the
atmospheric
loss
mitigation
is
challenging
with
regard
to
reaching
the
goal
of
the
5GB
networks
,
especially
in
the
outdoor
condition

Limited
uplink
communication
using
OWC
technologies
</hi>
<b>
:
</b>
Most
of

user
equipment
is
designed
with
low-power
LEDs
to
reduce
the
drainage
of

.
</s>
<s>
Because
of
the
low-power
LEDs
,
VLC
and
the
LiFi
cannot
perform
well
in
uplink
communication
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
most
of
the
LEDs
of
the
user
equipment
produce
diffused
lights
with
low
power
that
are
easily
affected
by
downlink
high-power
lights
and
,
hence
,
limit
the
uplink
communication

</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
a
little
deflection
or
movement
of
the
receiver
of
a
user
equipment
can
easily
hamper
the
uplink
communication
link

</s>
<s>
Hence
,
this
is
an
important
issue
to
be
solved
in
future
to
efficiently
support
uplink
communication
using
VLC

the
LiFi

Low

One
of
the
most
important
drawbacks

the
existing
OCC
system

the
low
data
rate

<s>
It
is
challenging
to
provide
a
high
data
rate
because
of
its
low-frame

The
most
recently
achieved
data
rate

only
55

The
