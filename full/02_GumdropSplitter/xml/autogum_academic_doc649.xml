There
is
little
published
literature
considering
the
role
of
palliative
radiotherapy
in
metastatic
sarcoma
,
although
it
is
recommended
as
a
treatment
option
for
palliation
by
both
the
UK
bone
and
soft
tissue
sarcoma
guidelines
and
the
European
Society
of
Medical
Oncology
(
ESMO
)
guidelines

To
the
authors
’
knowledge
this
is
the
largest
retrospective
study
published
to
date
reviewing
the
use
of
palliative
radiotherapy
for
sarcoma
.

The
results
confirm
that
palliative
radiotherapy
can
successfully
provide
symptomatic
benefit
to
patients
with
metastatic
sarcoma
.
</s>
<s>
This
study
is
limited
by
being
retrospective
such
that
the
assessment
of
symptomatic
improvement
could
only
be
assessed
from
documentation
in
medical
records
.
</s>
<s>
It
was
therefore
not
possible
to
quantify
the
amount
of
symptomatic
improvement
seen
or
indeed
to
be
certain
of
the
accuracy
of
the
results
.
</s>
<s>
The
aim
of
this
review
,
however
,
was
to
confirm
that
radiotherapy
does
have
a
role
in
the
palliation
of
advanced
sarcomas
and
to
guide
future
prospective
studies
to
gain
more
accurate
evidence
of
the
use
of
palliative
radiotherapy
in
this
setting
.

<s>
In
addition
,
this
study
was
limited
by
the
heterogeneous
population
studied
.
</s>
<s>
Both
soft
tissue
and
bone
sarcomas
of
multiple
types
were
included
.
</s>
<s>
The
radiobiology
of
the
different
subtypes
of
sarcoma
has
not
been
well
studied
,
but
it
is
accepted
that
these
tumours
tend
to
be
relatively
radio-resistant
,
with
a
high
alpha
beta
ratio
.
</s>
<s>
There
have
been
several
publications
considering
the
role
of
palliative
radiotherapy
for
other
,
more
common
solid
tumour
types
.
</s>
<s>
A
meta-analysis
has
shown
that
when
treating
bone
metastases
from
a
number
of
different
primary
tumour
sites
and
histology
’s
,
there
appears
to
be
little
short-term
symptomatic
benefit
in
a
fractionated
course
of
radiotherapy
,
compared
to
a
single
fraction
.
</s>
<s>
Most
oncologists
therefore
advocate
the
use
of
a
single
fraction
to
control
pain
secondary
to
bone
metastases
.
</s>
<s>
With
longer
follow-up
,
however
,
it
seems
that
patients
treated
with
a
fractionated
course
of
palliative
radiotherapy
are
less
likely
to
need
retreatment
than
those
given
a
single
fraction
.
</s>
<s>
This
study
demonstrates
that
selected
patients
with
advanced
sarcoma
can
benefit
from
palliative
radiotherapy
provided
their
prognosis
is
long
enough
for
the
benefits
from
radiotherapy
,
in
terms
of
symptomatic
improvement
,
to
outweigh
the
inconvenience
of
undergoing
radiotherapy
and
the
associated
side
effects
that
they
may
suffer
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
As
sarcomas
are
felt
to
be
intrinsically
radio-resistant
,
it
can
be
hypothesized
that
a
single
fraction
of
palliative
radiotherapy
may
not
be
sufficient
to
offer
adequate
symptomatic
benefit
.

The
results
presented
here
suggest
a
higher
symptomatic
response
rate

a
biological
effective
dose

BED
)

greater

<s>
Beyond
this
point
the
response
is
maintained
but
does
not
appear
to
increase
further
,
suggesting
very
high
doses
of
palliative
radiotherapy
may
not
be
necessary
to
achieve
a
good
symptomatic
response
in
this
patient
group

The

the
100

likely
to
