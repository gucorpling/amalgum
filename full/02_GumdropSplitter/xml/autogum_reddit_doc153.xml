What
kinds
of
things
did
you
do
when
you
first
were
learning

solder
?

I
went
to
a
soldering
workshop
about
a
month
ago
where
I
learned
how
to
solder
.
</s>
<s>
I
'm
an
EE
student
so
I
figured
I
'd
be
doing
a
decent
bit
of
soldering
in
the
future
,
so
a
few
days
ago
I
ordered
a
soldering
iron
,
leadless
solder
,
a
solder
wick
,
brass
wool
and
some
flux
.
</s>
<s>
But
I
do
n't
even
know
what
to
do
with
them
.
</s>
<s>
I
know
how
to
use
them
(
at
least
on
a
basic
level
)
,
but
so
far
they
're
kinda
just
sitting
there
.
</s>
<s>
Do
any
other
EE
students/people
who
know
how
to
solder
have
any
ideas
as
to
what
would
some
good
things
to
do
for
practice
?
Thank
you
!

I
had
to
learn
to
solder
on
my
own
in
HS
thanks
to
drones
.
</s>
<s>
At
first
I
was
really
,
really
bad
...
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
My
first
advice
is
,
do
n't
use
lead-free
solder
.
</s>
<s>
You
might
think
it
's
good
for
your
health
but
what
you
really
want
to
avoid
is
the
smoke
of
the
flux
which
is
inside
of
the
solder
,
no
matter
what
type
it
is
.
</s>
<s>
It
might
cause
irritation
on
your
eyes
,
and
obviously
do
n't
inhale
it
lmao
.
</s>
<s>
Both
lead-free
and
60
40
have
it
so
why
do
n't
you
just
go
with
the
60
40
one
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Maybe
your
school
only
allows
lead-free
solder
,
if
that
's
the
case
then
there
's
nothing
to
do
.
</s>
<s>
But
if
you
're
allowed
to
use
whatever
you
want
then
definitely
get
the
other
.
</s>
<s>
Your
solder
job
will
look
superb
once
you
get
used
to
it
.
</s>
<s>
It
'll
be
shiny
and
you
'll
be
proud
of
yourself
when
you
see
your
reflection
on
the
blob
of
solder
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Jokes
aside
,
it
's
a
lot
easier
to
learn
to
solder
with
a
lead
based
solder
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
know
why
exactly
and
I
ca
n't
really
explain
the
difference
,
try
both
and
see
for
yourself
I
guess
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Also
,
most
people
do
n't
pay
attention
to
this
but
lead-free
solder
has
a
shelf
life
due
to
oxidization
.
</s>
<s>
However
you
can
use
lead
based
solder
that
your
grandpa
used
a
couple
of
decades
ago
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Finally
,
this
depends
on
your
soldering
iron
but
if
you
bought
a
cheap
plastic
one
then
the
tip
is
probably
a
very
soft
metal
.
</s>
<s>
If
you
use
excessive
heat
you
might
oxidize
it
and
it
'll
never
be
the
same
.
</s>
<s>
What
I
use
is
a
digital
DC
powered
TS100
soldering
iron
,
you
can
go
crazy
with
it
.
</s>
<s>
It
would
n't
make
a
big
difference
but
you
can
set
your
own
heating
curve
,
max
temp
,
set
a
timer
that
takes
it
into
a
standby
mode
so
when
you
leave
it
on
the
table
the
tip
wo
n't
be
damaged
from
the
heat
,
thanks
to
an
accelerometer
integrated
into
it
.
</s>
<s>
You
can
also
play
tetris
...
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Also
,
I
would
n't
recommend
using
a
steel
brass
wool
as
it
might
damage
the
tip
of
the
soldering
iron
,
especially
if
you
're
using
the
aforementioned
cheap
irons
.
</s>
<s>
Just
get
a
kitchen
sponge
soak
it
into
water
and
use
that
instead
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
For
practising
,
I
'd
just
go
to
an
old
computer
shop
and
ask
them
if
they
have
a
broken
board
.
</s>
<s>
A
CRT
TV
board
would
work
better
as
those
have
all
kinds
of
different
soldering
points
such
as
holes
,
pads
and
etc.
