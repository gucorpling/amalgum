If
you
look
at
what
Obama
said
,
it
was
n't
even
progressive
.

<s>
All
he
said
was
this
is
my
personal
statement
.
</s>
<s>
He
did
n't
say
that
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/North_Carolina">
North

was
wrong
[
for
passing
a

<s>
You
have
to
read
the
tealeaves
when
this
guy
talks
.
</s>
<s>
All
the
guy
said
was
I
think
that
gay
marriage
is
fine
with
me
personally
.
</s>
<s>
He
did
n't
say
that
we
're
going
to
make
a
federal
law
that
makes
it
incumbent
upon
the
states
not
to
outlaw
it
.
</s>
<s>
He
did
n't
do
that
.
</s>
<s>
He
's
fine
with
those
kind
of
laws
.
</s>
<s>
He
's
not
going
to
go
out
there
and
do
any
more
than
say
what
he
said
.
</s>
<s>
So
he
did
n't
give
us
an
agenda
like
:
are
you
going
to
go
ahead
and
have
it
where
you
're
going
to
have
a
situation
,
are
you
going
to
allow
homosexual
or
same-sex
couples
to
go
ahead
and
have
tax
deductions
?
</s>
<s>
Are
you
going
to
allow
them
to
have
the
same
kind
of
income
tax
return
as
a
traditional
family
?
</s>
<s>
He
did
n't
go
through
all
that
.
</s>
<s>
He
just
made
a
general
statement
.
</s>
<s>
Now
he
's
off
the
floor
as
some
kind
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%20(title)">
Caesar
</ref>
;
someone
vindicating
the
rights
of
gay
people
.
</s>
<s>
His
statement
was
very
vague
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
just
very
Obama-like
.
</s>
<s>
He
did
n't
really
commit
to
anything
.
</s>
<s>
He
just
said
that
was
his
personal
opinion
.

Wolfe
</hi>
:

But
I

something
that
I

to

I
'm
interested

in
three
things

My
interests
are
:
number
one
,
the
economy
.
</s>
<s>
You
get
people
back
to
work
,
then
we
can
quite
fighting
each
other
on
these
social
issues
.
</s>
<s>
Some
of
these
social
issues
are
accented
because
there
's
a
lot
of
unrest
with
the
economy
.
</s>
<s>
We
need
to
worry
about
three
things
I
think
:
getting
the
economy
back
right
,
getting
out
of
these
commitments
like
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Afghanistan">
Afghanistan
</ref>
and
dictators
abroad
,
we
need
to
get
out
of
that
,
then
we
need
to
protect
our
civil
liberties
at
home
.
</s>
<s>
Those
are
the
three
main
things
that
John
Wolfe
has
on
his
agenda
.
</s>
<s>
So
I
think
those
are
the
most
important
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
economy
is
<hi rend="italic">
the
</hi>
most
important
.
</s>
<s>
And
I
think
the
economy
ca
n't
be
reformed
until
you
reform
the
bank
.
</s>

You
noticed
yesterday
[
May

]
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan%20Chase">
JP
Morgan

lost
two
billion
dollars

they
're
pouring
billions

all
this
speculation

some

?

Now

coming
home

That
's
just
JP
Morgan

We
do
n't
know
what
the
next
bank
is
going
to
report
.
</s>
<s>
We
got
to
underwrite
all
that
.
</s>
<s>
See
,
Obama
's
never
made
an
effort
really
to
separate
that
out
because
he
's
so
ensconced
in
Wall
Street
money
,
and
so
persuaded
by
Wall
Street
advisers
right
there
in
the
oval
office

</s>
<s>
He
wo
n't
even
go
back
to
traditional
banking

make
these
people
separate
casino
capitalism
from
traditional
banking

<s>
He
has
n't
done
it
.

As
long
as
he
does
n't
,
we

have
to
underwrite

Obama

do
something

People
want

he

He
