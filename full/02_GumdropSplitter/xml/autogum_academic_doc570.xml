Waste
electrical
and
electronic
equipment
(
WEEE
)
is
one
of
the
fastest
growing
waste
categories
in
the
EU
,
with
the
growth
rate
of
3
–
5
%
per
year
,
as
a
result
of
massive
production
of
the
EEE
and
its
market
expansion
based
on
technological
progress
.
</s>
<s>
The
printed
circuit
boards
(
PCBs
)
present
in
almost
every
single
piece
of
electronic
equipment
,
and
account
for
roughly
5
wt
%
of
the
entire
e-waste
currently
produced
.
</s>
<s>
Nevertheless
,
they
carry
the
most
important
share
of
the
valuable
and
also
toxic
metals
.
</s>
<s>
This
creates
an
urgent
need
for
recovering/recycling
valuable
materials
from
PCBs
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
their
complex
and
heterogeneous
structures
(
e.
g.
,
mixture
of
number
of
different
metals
,
plastics
,
and
ceramics
in
different
sizes
)
and
their
diversion
with
time
raise
the
issues
associated
with
their
effective
pre-concentration
process
development
as
well
as
environmental
concerns
.
</s>
<s>
One
of
the
major
limitations
in
the
recycling
of
PCBs
is
a
lack
of
a
proper
characterization
method
to
quantitatively
evaluate
the
distribution
and
liberation
of
each
metal
without
destroying
the
heterogeneous
particle
status
at
each
separation/beneficiation
unit
operation
.

<s>
The
degree
of
liberation
,
indicating
how
much
the
target
component
is
liberated
from
the
non-valuable
components
,
is
a
key
factor
when
establishing
the
liberation
performance
of
the
comminution
to
determine
the
success
of
subsequent
process
for
valuable
material
recovery
.
</s>
<s>
The
study
of
the
degree
of
liberation
was
initially
introduced
in
the
mineral
processing
field
,
where
the
main
objective
was
to
achieve
selective
liberation
of
the
valuable
minerals
of
interest
aiming
for
the
coarsest
particle
size
possible
,
saving
energy
on
the
grinding
process
and
reducing
the
amount
of
non-desirable
fine
fractions
produced
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
One
of
the
methods
for
the
degree
of
liberation
for
mineral
grains
is
the
analysis
of
images
(
and
elemental
maps
)
obtained
by
optical
microscopy
or
scanning
electron
microscopy
.
</s>
<s>
For
instance
,
there
was
a
report
on
liberation
within
complex
assemblages
,
such
as
in
a
Galena-Sphalerite
ore
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
mineral
industry
,
the
image
analysis
has
shifted
towards
an
automatic
procedure
lately
,
using
automated
analyzers
coupled
with
the
electron
microscopes
,
such
as
MLA
and
QEMSCAN
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
applicability
of
the
automated
image
analyzers
algorithms
to
electronic
wastes
,
mostly
for
such
complex
assemblage
resulting
from
the
waste
PCBs
can
be
challenging
.
</s>
<s>
The
heterogeneous
nature
of
the
samples
,
in
terms
of
diverse
materials
used
(
i.
e.
,
metals
,
glass
,
ceramics
)
,
the
irregular
shape
of
the
particles
due
to
the
different
physical
properties
of
the
materials
(
e.
g.
,
round
ball-like
shaped
,
elongated
rod-like
shapes
,
cubic-like
)
and
associated
software
developed
for
mineral
analysis
are
some
of
the
issues
that
could
face
by
automated
analysis
.
</s>
<s>
Hence
,
particle
counting
method
is
preferred
for
the
conditions
and
heterogeneous
samples
of
our
study
in
order
to
evaluate
and
understand
the
liberation
degree
of
the
metals
of
interest
,
by
applying
a
non-destructive
characterization
.
</s>
<s>
The
importance
of
using
non-destructive
characterization
methods
and
how
it
can
be
helpful
to
understand
the
association
and
deportment
of
metals/plastics
in
the
different
size
fractions
was
alerted
in
our
previous
studies
e.
g.
,
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Comparing
with
the
primary
ore
beneficiations
,
in
a
waste
PCB
assemblage
,
a
specific
size
fraction
for
the
liberation
of
valuable
metals
from
non-metallic
fractions
is
still
not
clearly
understood
.
</s>
<s>
Some
previous
studies
investigated
the
effect
of
the
particles
size
and
shape
on
the
liberation
characteristics
,
and
high
liberation
degree
was
reported
with
the
particle
sizes
below
&lt;
100
μm
or
from
100
μm
up
to
3
mm
.
</s>
<s>
Such
discrepancies
are
likely
related
to
the
differences
in
the
PCB
material
compositions
and
the
grinding
mechanisms
used
in
the
comminution
processes
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Our
previous
work
reported
the
selective
metal
enrichment
and
agglomeration
of
metallic
components
(
e.
g.
,
Cu
,
Al
)
through
the
application
of
a
hammer
milling
for
PCBs
comminution
.
</s>
<s>
Based
on
our
results
and
abovementioned
research
gaps
,
the
objective
of
the
present
study
is
to
assess
the
degree
of
liberation
of
metals
within
the
products
of
hammer
milling
process
via
the
combination
of
image
acquisition
and
analysis
,
in
order
to
evaluate
their
selective
liberation
.

The
particles
produced
under
different
milling
conditions
(
i.
e.
,
feed
mass
,
milling
time
)
for
different
metals
(
i.
e.
,
Cu
,
Al
)
were
compared
as
a
function
of
particle
size
fractions
.
</s>
<s>
The
results
obtained
for
the
liberation
degree
using
digital
optical
microscopic
images
were
compared
with
the
analysis
of
backscattered
electron
(
BSE
)
images
and
elemental
maps
obtained
by
scanning
electron
microscope
coupled
with
an
energy
dispersive
spectroscopy
(
SEM-EDS
)
.

The
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
above
two
methods
for
investigating
the
liberation
degree
of
mechanically
processed
PCB
particles
will
be
discussed
in
the
paper

in
addition
to
their
methodological
developments
