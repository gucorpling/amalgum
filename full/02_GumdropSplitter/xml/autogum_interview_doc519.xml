Can
you
win
the

Presidential
election

Can

</hi>

<p>

Realistically
it
is
impossible
for
any
of
us
independent/third-party
candidates
to
win…and
for
that
matter
candidates
such
as
Edwards
whom
the
mainstream
media
labels
hopeless
.

It

not
really
about

<p>

First
of
all
a
large
number
of
states
either
out-right
ban
write-in
candidates
or
make
it
virtually
impossible
to
qualify
to
be
a
write-in
candidate
.
</s>
<s>
These
states
throw
out
the
entire
ballot
with
a
write-in
on
it
.
</s>
<s>
This
disenfranchises
the
voters
in
those
states
from
the
full
choices
.
</s>
<s>
It
freezes
in
place
not
only
the
2-party
system…which
is
a
product
of
evolution
,
not
of
the
Constitution…but
the
two
parties
that
happen
to
be
the
major
parties
at
the
present
moment
.
</s>
<s>
This
has
to
change
before
we
will
have
a
chance
of
winning

<s>
One
effect
of
my
campaign
has
been
forcing
several
states
to
clean
up
their
write-in
processes
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
The
mainstream
media
wants
to
simplify
the
story
down
to
as
few
candidates
as
possible
as
fast
as
possible…focusing
on
the
candidates
the
closest
to
the
corporate
interest
and
painting
the
rest
as
fringe
…
.
and
hence
not
worth
coverage
or
be
included
in
debates
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
But
the
indie
media
has
developed
as
a
meaningful
alternative
to
the
mainstream
media
.

<s>
And
it
will
get
much
more
powerful
in
the
coming
years

a
hammer
breaking
down
the
monopolistic
control

corporate
media

This
in-depth
interview
is
an
example
of
what
is
excluded
in
the
corporate
media

</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
when
I
received
your
email
asking
us
independent/third-party
candidates
for
this
interview…with
all
the
addresses
of
the
candidates…I
switched
my
candidate
hat
for
my
luver
hat
and
offered
my
fellow
candidates
luver
as
a
platform
to
get
their
messages
out
.
</s>
<s>
We
have
created
a
weekly
show
,
from
the
margins
,
for
that
purpose

<s>
It
is
politics
of
inclusion
rather
than
of
exclusion
