I
feel
quite
strongly
about
this
issue
because
this
type
of
media
coverage
unfairly
stigmatizes
the
residents
of
Scarborough
and
Ward
44
and
adversely
affects
property
values
and
the
quality
of
life
of
her
residents
,
and
makes
it
easier
for
downtown
politicians
to
deny
services
for
Scarborough
residents
.
