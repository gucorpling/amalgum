<s>
In
the
dynamic
and
competitive
business
world
of
today
,
where
the
exchange
of
ideas
is
proficient
,
a
“
sustainable
competitive
advantage
”
(
SCA
)
is
no
longer
deep-rooted
in
the
organization
’s
physical
resources
but
in
the
organization
’s
nonphysical
human
resources
.
</s>
<s>
In
view
of
these
findings
,
the
attention
of
scholars
has
been
on
the
factors
that
could
be
instrumental
to
the
achievement
of
SCA
.
</s>
<s>
O’Reily
and
Pfeffer
opined
that
the
world
we
are
in
today
is
the
one
wherein
“
knowledge
and
intellectual
capital
”
is
required
instead
of
“
physical
capital
”
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
the
study
believes
it
is
becoming
significant
in
the
business
world
where
people
can
be
effective
and
efficient
in
developing
innovative
goods
and
services
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
on
this
note
that
other
scholars
have
attempted
to
understand
the
particular
factors
that
could
enable
an
organization
to
achieve
SCA
.
</s>
<s>
Barney
investigated
the
relationship
between
SCA
and
organizational
resources
and
found
that
every
organization
operates
with
a
tacit
knowledge
and
has
the
potential
to
improve
,
SCA
.

Meanwhile
,
in
the
efforts
of
scholars
to
examine
the
nexus
in
strategic
human
resources
management
practices
,
a
behavioral
approach
has
been
commonly
used
.
</s>
<s>
Behavioral
approaches
,
which
identify
divergent
role
behaviors
as
significant
to
the
kind
of
strategy
that
is
being
pursued
by
an
organization
,
are
found
in
the
literature
to
be
the
most
often
used
theory
to
explain
the
nexus
in
strategic
human
resources
management
(
HRM
)
practices
.
</s>
<s>
Much
emphasis
is
placed
on
individual
employee
behavior
as
a
mediator
between
organization
strategy
and
the
result
by
this
approach
or
as
a
mediator
between
strategic
HRM
and
SCA
.
</s>
<s>
The
behavioral
school
of
thought
is
of
the
view
that
divergent
behavior
roles
are
important
in
determining
the
kinds
of
strategies
that
an
organization
engages
in
.
</s>
<s>
It
has
been
established
in
the
literature
that
an
employee
stands
out
as
one
of
the
major
sources
of
achieving
SCA
in
an
organization
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
the
integrative
model
for
strategic
HRM
,
which
combines
rational
and
progressive
approaches
and
is
ingrained
in
some
theories
—
for
instance
resource-based
view
(
RBV
)
,
social
exchange
theory
(
SET
)
,
and
behavioral-based
view
—
are
found
as
an
appropriate
approach
to
strategic
HRM
and
SCA
.
</s>
<s>
This
research
utilized
the
perception
of
HRM
practices
to
explain
in
detail
from
the
angle
of
human
capital
development
and
the
commitment
of
employees
to
their
organization
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
this
study
will
examine
the
relationship
between
the
strategies
deployed
by
the
universities
in
Iraq
and
the
sustainability
of
their
competitive
advantages
by
also
evaluating
the
mediation
role
of
human
capital
development
and
employee
commitment
.
</s>
<s>
In
accordance
with
the
theories
highlighted
above
,
this
study
aims
at
determining
the
impact
of
“
strategic
HRM
practices
”
on
the
SCA
within
academic
institutions
through
the
evaluation
of
the
mediating
function
of
human
capital
development

“
employee
