Intrusion
detection
mainly
includes
signature-based
intrusion
detection
and
anomaly-based
intrusion
detection
.
</s>
<s>
In
detail
,
signature-based
intrusion
detection
is
also
known
as
rule-based
intrusion
detection
.
</s>
<s>
Signature-based
intrusion
detection
has
a
high
detection
rate
for
known
attacks
,
but
has
no
ability
to
detect
attack
behaviors
that
are
not
in
the
rule
base
.

Anomaly-based
intrusion
detection
is
also
known
as
behavior-based
intrusion
detection
.

<s>
This
algorithm
has
the
ability

detect

behavior

<s>
Feature
extraction
based
on
accurately
preprocessed
network
packets
in
anomaly-based
intrusion
detection
is
the
basis
for
good
performance

</s>
<s>
At
present
,
it
is
easy
to
collect
a
large
amount
of
unlabeled
data
in
intrusion
detection
,
and
it
is
difficult
to
obtain
a
large
amount
of
labeled
data
.

Therefore
,
an
unsupervised
algorithm
for
intrusion

has
been
introduced

<p>

In
recent
years
,
there
have
been
some
studies
based

unsupervised

techniques

In
2007
,
Liu
et

used
a
hierarchical
PCA
model
to
detect
intrusion
behavior
on
the
KDD99
dataset

In

Gouveia

used
RBM

detect

In
2018
,
Farahnakian
et

used
Deep
Auto-encoder
to
detect
intrusion
behavior
on
the
KDD99
dataset
.
</s>
<s>
The
common
point
of
the
above
studies
is
that
the
preprocessing
ignores
the
similarity
between
network
packets
.
</s>
<s>
Network
packets
with
strong
similarity
relationship
are
closer
in
the
similarity
relation
graph
and
have
similar
local
proximity
embedding
.
</s>
<s>
The
preprocessing
algorithm
in
the
above
studies
ignores
the
similarity
relationship
between
network
packets
,
resulting
in
low
accuracy
of
intrusion
detection
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
we
introduce
a
graph
representation
leaning
algorithm
to
solve
the
above
problem
.
</s>
<s>
The
network
packet
is
preprocessed
by
using
a
graph
representation
leaning
algorithm
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
proposed
algorithm
,
the
original
features
of
the
network
packet
are
combined
with
the
local
proximity
features
describing
the
similarity
relationship
between
the
network

the
input

neural

Graph

leaning

the

This
algorithm
has
achieved
effects
in
the
application
of
approximate
semantic
classification
of

handwritten
character
classification

</s>
<s>
The
existing
graph
representation
leaning
algorithms
are
mainly
the
following
,
such
as
:
Node2vec
,
Deepwalk
,
LINE
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
Deepwalk
uses
a
simple
unbiased
random
walk
,
which
does
not
control
the
direction
of
random
walks
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
Deepwalk
is
easy
to
sample
into
the
higher-order
proximity
range
,
which
makes
it
impossible
to
accurately
describe
the
local
proximity
features
of
the
current
node
;
LINE
does
not
have
the
ability
to
simultaneously
sample
first-order
proximity
and
second-order
proximity
,
so
the
algorithm
has
limitations
;
Node2vec
uses
a
random
walk
based
on
breadth
first
search
(
BFS
)
or
depth
first
search
(
DFS
)
to
explore
the
neighbor
of
the
node
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
random
walks
based
on
BFS
or
DFS
are
blind
searches
.
</s>
<s>
In
other
words
,
BFS
lacks
constraints
on
the
range
of
random
walks
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
the
random
walk
has
the
probability
of
sampling
to
the
source
node
â€™s
higher-order
proximity
,
which
makes
it
impossible
to
accurately
extract
the
local
proximity
features
of
the
source
node
that
describe
the
similarity
relationship
between
network
packets
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
we
propose
a
node2vec
with
penalty
for
unsupervised
automatic
preprocessing
.
</s>
<s>
The
proposed
algorithm
limits
the
range
of
random
walks
so
that
the
sampling
of
random
walks
only
occurs
within
the
low-proximity
of
the
source
node
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
the

has
the
