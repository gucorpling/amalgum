Discussion

Recommendations

Stakeholders

<p>
<s>
At
first
glance
,
the
results
of
this
study
seem
comparable
to
similar
landscape
management
projects
,
supporting
the
idea
that
landscape
cannot
be
addressed
only
by
a
specific
landscape-oriented
policy
;
rather
,
its
management
must
take
several
sectoral
policies
(
i.
e.
,
forest
,
water
,
agriculture
—
see
)
into
account
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
However
,
the
concept
of
landscape
services
can
be
used
at
the
operational
level
as
a
coordination
tool
between
stakeholders
in
charge
of
the
management
and
planning
of
landscapes
.
</s>
<s>
By
naming
and
describing
the
relevant
LS
(
see
Table
1
)
it
is
possible
to
establish
a
shared
understanding
of
the
relevant
issues
and
the
ways
that
different
stakeholders
can
relate
to
them
.
</s>
<s>
Talking
about
“
identification
and
sense
of
place
”
or
“
recreation
and
health
”
in
specific
areas
can
reveal
more
concrete
needs
than
abstract
discussions
about
goals
of
visitor
guidance
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
within
one
of
the
study
sites
,
the
research
team
was
able
to
connect
different
stakeholders
based
on
their
similar
requirements
to
the
landscape
.
</s>
<s>
They
have
now
formed
a
project
team
that
develops
different
awareness-raising
projects
,
and
a
completely
new
visitor
guidance
for
the
study
site
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
On
a
more
analytical
level
,
using
the
LS
approach
can
help
find
co-operative
solutions
in
cases
where
conflicts
arise
between
resource-based
and
non-utility
conceptions
of
landscapes
,
as
discussed
by
Gerber
and
Knoepfel
.
</s>
<s>
In
particular
,
the
LS
“
aesthetic
pleasure
”
and
“
identification
and
sense
of
place
”
are
clearly
associated
with
non-utility
conceptions
of
landscape
.
</s>
<s>
These
two
LS
could
bridge
more
resource-oriented
conceptions
represented
by
the
“
recreation
and
health
”
and
“
attractiveness
of
location
”
LS
.
</s>
<s>
The
LS
concept
and
typology
have
therefore
demonstrated
to
be
useful
analytical
tools
for
landscape
research
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
We
furthermore
consider
that
LS
are
powerful
communication
tools
for
improving
awareness
of
the
qualities
of
the
landscape
amongst
the
public
,
the
visitors
and
the
inhabitants
.
</s>
<s>
By
formalizing
the
types
of
relationships
(
cf.
)
these
stakeholders
have
with
the
landscape
—
whether
a
relation
of
exploitation
of
resources
,
aesthetic
appreciation
,
or
symbolic
identification
—
LS
can
increase
people
’s
awareness
of
the
importance
of
landscapes
and
ultimately
their
willingness
to
protect
them
and/or
develop
them
sustainably
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
How
can
landscape
services
help
to
increase
landscape
appreciation
?
</s>
<s>
An
important
factor
is
the
interdisciplinary
and
cross-sectoral
engagement
with
landscape
services
.
</s>
<s>
LS
provides
three
types
of
opportunities
:
(
1
)
Communication
,
information
,
and
dialogue
:
to
communicate
about
the
special
characteristics
and
services
of
landscapes
,
and
to
encourage
the
population
to
engage
with
landscapes
.
</s>
<s>
(

)
Cooperation
between
landscape
actors
:
</s>
<s>
to
constructively
handle
conflicting
areas
and
options
for
further
development
,
exchanging
views
on
common
objectives
.
</s>
<s>
(
3
)
Support
from
public
authorities
:
to
develop
suggestions
for
dealing
with
LS
at
strategic
and
operational
levels
,
develop
a
set
of
best
practice
examples
,
and
(
co)finance
dialogue
processes
on
landscape
services
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Assigning
responsibilities
within
the
fields
of
action
outlined
above
is
challenging
because
there
is
often
a
lack
of
resources
and
expertise
for
a
proactive
approach
to
LS
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
much
more
common
to
react
when
problems
arise
,
e.
g.
,
when
the
pressure
on
land
use
in
an
area
has
become
too
great
.
</s>
<s>
For
this
reason
it
was
decided
to
support
the
interested
actors
from
the
five
pilot
regions
directly
in
their
work
on
LS
in
a
next
step
:
Specifically
,
various
smaller
pilot
projects
will
be
carried
out
in
2019
,
in
which
,
for
example
,
school
classes
will
tackle
the
special
landscape
characteristics
in
their
residential
communities
,
or
landscape
events
will
be
offered
to
the
interested
public
in
partnership
with
authorities
,
agricultural
organizations
,
and
nature
conservation
organizations
.
</s>
<s>
All
these
projects
will
be
documented
,
and
the
lessons
learnt
will
be
prepared
and
generalized
in
such
a
way
that
best
practices
can
be
transposed
to
other
regions
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
research
questions
examined
in
this
project
deal
with
a
highly
relevant
but
narrowly
defined
subject
area
by
focusing
on
landscapes
of
national
importance
in
Switzerland
.
</s>
<s>
They
thus
encompass
a
specific
political
and
institutional
context
as
well
as
certain
landscape
qualities
.
</s>
<s>
Consequently
,
the
following
questions
arise
:
How
can
the
findings
be
transferred
to
other
areas
,
e.
g.
,
to
non-protected
landscapes
?
</s>
<s>
What
services
do
densely
populated
or
intensively
used
landscapes
offer
,
for
example
?
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
application
of
LS
analysis
on
everyday
landscapes
should
help
answer
these
questions
.
</s>
<s>
With
our
focus
on
BLN
sites
,
we
already
established
that
it
does
not
make
much
sense
to
assess
every
kind
of
landscape
with
the
same
tool
.
</s>
<s>
Rather
,
we
found
that
the
specific
landscape
traits
and
services
that
different
stakeholders
see
in
a
certain
landscape
should
be
the
starting
point
from
which
a
landscape
service
assessment
can
be
developed
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
where
the
LS
approach
is
helpful
:
it
enables
stakeholders
to
express
the
benefits
and
the
needs
that
they
see
in
regards
to
a
specific
landscape
.
</s>
<s>
Subsequently
,
a
growing
collection
of
best-practice
examples
can
be
used
to
inform
the
analyses
of
different
kinds
of
landscapes
.
</s>
<s>
We
therefore
believe
that
not
only
special
,
such
as
protected
,
landscapes
will
receive
better
appreciation
with
such
an
assessment
but
also
every-day
landscapes
.
</s>
<s>
This
,
consequently
,
should
lead
to
a
more
sustainable
development
of
landscapes
.
