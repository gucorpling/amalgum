<s>
The
number
of
males
diagnosed
with
prostate
cancer
(
PCa
)
is
increasing
all
over
the
world
.
</s>
<s>
Most
patients
with
early-stage
PCa
can
be
treated
by
the
appropriate
therapy
,
such
as
radical
prostatectomy
or
irradiation
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
androgen
deprivation
therapy
(
ADT
)
is
the
standard
systemic
therapy
given
to
patients
with
advanced
PCa
.
</s>
<s>
ADT
induces
temporary
remission
,
but
the
majority
of
patients
(
approximately
60
%
)
eventually
progress
to
castration-resistant
prostate
cancer
(
CRPC
)
,
which
is
associated
with
a
high
mortality
rate
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Generally
,
well-differentiated
PCa
cells
are
androgen-dependent
,
i.
e.
,
androgen
receptor
(
AR
)
signaling
regulates
cell
cycle
and
differentiation
.
</s>
<s>
Loss
of
AR
signaling
after
ADT
triggers
androgen-independent
outgrowth
,
generating
poorly
differentiated
,
uncontrollable
PCa
cells
.
</s>
<s>
Once
PCa
cells
lose
their
sensitivity
to
ADT
,
effective
therapies
are
limited
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
last
few
years
,
however
,
several
new
options
for
the
treatment
of
CRPC
have
been
approved
,
e.
g.
,
the
CYP17
inhibitor
,
the
AR
antagonist
,
and
the
taxane
.
</s>
<s>
Despite
this
progress
in
the
development
of
new
drugs
,
there
is
a
high
medical
need
for
optimizing
the
sequence
and
combination
of
approved
drugs
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
identification
of
predictive
biomarkers
may
help
in
the
context
of
personalized
medicine
to
guide
treatment
decisions
,
improve
clinical
outcomes
,
and
prevent
unnecessary
side
effects
.

This

The
goal
of
this
symposium
was
to
discuss
the
biological
mechanism
of
the
development
and
progression
of
prostatic
proliferative
diseases
such
as
benign
prostatic
hyperplasia
(
BPH
)
and
PCa
.
</s>
<s>
Several
major
topic
areas
were
discussed
,
e.
g.
,
the
pathophysiology
of
BPH
,
the
tumor
microenvironment
of
PCa
,
AR
signaling
in
PCa
progression
,
and
the
development
of
PCa
detection
and
diagnosis
.
