Introduction

<p>
<s>
The
freight
movement
through
heavy
good
vehicles
(
HGVs
)
is
expected
to
grow
by
22
%
each
year
until
2050
in
the
United
Kingdom
.
</s>
<s>
The
increase
in
HGVs
number
causes
more
congestion
on
the
roads
and
also
increases
the
emission
of
green-house
gases
into
the
atmosphere
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
on
the
other
side
,
the
UK
has
legally
committed
to
reduce
the
carbon
emissions
by
80
%
by
the
year
2050
to
that
of
the
current
number
in
2016
.
</s>
<s>
The
forecasts
that
are
showing
an
increase
in
the
usage
of
motor
vehicles
for
freight
transport
does
not
seem
promising
as
the
transport
sector
is
already
being
accounted
for
17
%
of
the
UK
â€™s
total
domestic
GHG
emissions
.
</s>
<s>
Adapting
to
movement
of
urban
freight
by
rail
seems
to
present
a
greater
opportunity
to
overcome
the
emission
issues
as
well
as
the
road
congestion
problem
as
the
region
under
study
possesses
a
high
value
and
demand
for
freight
movement
.
</s>
<s>
Apart
from
this
,
providing
a
greener
option
to
move
goods
,
this
method
actually
has
the
capacity
to
match
up
the
trade-off
between
the
utilisation
levels
and
capital
costs
,
as
the
organisations
running
the
rail
services
largely
invest
in
spending
on
the
infrastructure
.
</s>
<s>
This
situation
was
the
motivation
to
evaluate
the
utilisation
levels
of
the
Cross-City
railway
line
in
the
West
Midlands
County
in
England
and
come
up
with
cases
to
accommodate
to
move
urban
freight
by
rail
in
one
of
the
busiest
industrial
hubs
of
the
country
.

<s>
There
are
three
main
objectives
for
this
paper
:
</s>
<s>
Firstly
,
to
analyse
the
current
Cross-City
railway
line
and
evaluate
the
utilisation
levels
of
the
line
using
the
timetable
as
a
reference
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
achieved
by
replicating
the
system
in
the
simulation
model
using
SIMUL8
software
;
secondly
,
to
propose
suitable
scenarios
by
identifying
gaps
in
the
evaluated
system
so
that
it
presents
with
a
case
to
improve
the
current
utilisation
levels
of
the
system
;
finally
,
to
evaluate
the
proposed
scenarios
if
they
are
feasible
to
operate
and
generate
the
expected
utilisation
levels
.
</s>
<s>
This
also
includes
studying
and
analysing
the
performance
of
those
proposed
systems
and
concluding
by
suggesting
the
best
fit
system
among
them
to
replace
the
currently
operating
system
.

This
paper
employs
a
systems
approach
:
</s>
<s>
Firstly
,
problem
formulation
that
is
achieved
by
understanding
the
freight
transport
scenario
in
the
UK
and
identifying
the
need
for
Urban
freight
movement
by
rail
in
a
robust
manner
;
secondly
,
evaluating
the
Cross-City
railway
line
to
study
the
utilisation
levels
by
developing
a
model
that
replicates
the
existing
railway
line
accurately
using
SIMUL8
software
;
thirdly
,
devising
solutions
to
propose
a
replacement
to
the
current
system
that
has
the
ability
to
move
freight
between
Lichfield
Trent
Valley
and
Birmingham
New
Street
station
by
rail
;
finally
,
evaluating
and
comparing
the
proposed
models
and
obtained
results
and
suggest
the
best
suitable
scenario
.

This
paper
is
organised
as
follows
.
</s>
<s>
Section
2
illustrates
the
literature
review
regarding
urban
logistics
freight
movement
and
the
trend
followed
by
several
countries
in
the
world
in
using
rail
to
move
urban
freight
.
</s>
<s>
Section
3
holds
the
discussion
for
the
state
of
practice
of
the
region
under
the
study
and
provides
an
overview
of
the
Cross-City
railway
line
.
</s>
<s>
Section
4
provides
description
of
the
proposed
system
.
</s>
<s>
A
brief
introduction
to
the
fundamentals
and
characteristics
of
SIMUL8
are
addressed
in
Section
5
.
</s>
<s>
In
Section
6
,
the
simulation
layout
of
the
railway
line
and
the
computed
utilisation
levels
for
different
scenarios
have
been
illustrated
and
the
results
obtained
from
the
simulation
model
were
analysed
and
the

suitable
scenario

.
</s>
<s>
