A
new
round
of
technological
and
industrial
revolution
is
reshaping
the
global
innovation
landscape
,
and
the
competition
for
the
first-class
scientific
and
technological
talents
to
seize
the
advantage
of
scientific
and
technological
innovation
has
already
become
a
key
support
for
increasing
comprehensive
national
strength
.

In
recent
years
,
the
flow
of
scientific
and
technological
talents
’
spatial
migration
has
been
scaling
up
.

For
example
,
talents
have
gravitated
to
developed
regions

first-class
research
resources
and
good
career

for
study
and
employment
.

In
addition
,
emerging
areas
,
with
rapid
economic
development

improvement
of
social
conditions

a
proactive
talent

have
begun
to
attract

Scientists

clusters

on
the
use

produce
a

effectively
promotes
knowledge
innovation
,
technological

,
and
scientific

technological
progress

regions

<s>
For
example
,
groups
of
multinational
scientists
have
built
important
technological
innovation
networks
in
Silicon
Valley

Hsinchu

Shanghai

the
1980s
and
1990s
,
Taiwan
pioneered
semiconductor

The
key
to
that

the

As

main
carriers

the
spatial

Against
