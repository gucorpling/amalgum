<s>
When
I
first
got
elected
to
the
legislature
,
my
pastor
's
wife
was
the
executive
assistant
to
the
commissioner
of
the
ISHAA
,
Blake
Ress
,
and
she
knew
how
I
felt
about
class
basketball
.
</s>
<s>
I
did
n't
like
it
and
I
wished
we
'd
go
back
to
single
class
[
basketball
in
Indiana
]
.
</s>
<s>
But
out
of
unity
to
my
church
and
not
wanting
to
cause
my
pastor
's
wife
consternation
,
I
decided
I
would
not
do
anything
or
pursue
anything
.
</s>
<s>
Then
she
left
the
IHSAA
and
then
I
had
an
opportunity
to
interject
this
multi-facet
education
proposal
.
</s>
<s>
And
then
I
met
Bobby
Cox
,
the
then
commissioner
of
the
IHSAA
,
and
I
told
him
,
&quot;
I
'll
table
this
proposal
,
but
let
's
see
what
the
public
has
to
say
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
And
he
said
,
&quot;
that
is
a
great
idea
.
</s>
<s>
Let
's
do
some
public
meetings
.
</s>
<s>
Let
's
go
around
the
state
together
,
let
's
hold
a
press
conference
and
tell
the
world
what
we
are
doing
,
and
let
's
take
a
vote
at
every
public
meeting
.
</s>
<s>
We
'll
give
the
public
a
chance
that
they
did
n't
have
at
the
time
when
we
made
this
decision
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
I
think
at
the
time
the
IHSAA
and
Commissioner
Cox
,
in
particular
,
thought
that
the
public
would
be
more
allow
the
lines
of
multi-class
basketball
.
</s>
<s>
We
probably
had
50
to
100
people
turn
out
at
every
one
of
our
meetings
.
</s>
<s>
We
even
went
to
former
historical
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore%20Roosevelt%20High%20School%20(Gary)">
Gary
Roosevelt
</ref>
up
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake%20County,%20Indiana">
Lake
County
</ref>
we
went
down
to
several
areas
in
Southern
Indiana
,
we
went
to

Pendleton

.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
have
the
list
in
front
of
me
,
so
I
'm
just
kind
of
doing
this
from
memory
.
</s>
<s>
I
emailed
it
to
Professor
Tew
.
</s>
<s>
I
think
the
turnout
or
vote
was
68
percent
for
restoration
towards
single
class
basketball
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
One
of
the
real
joys
of
that
whole
process
for
me
was
meeting
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby%20Plump">
Bobby
Plump
</ref>
and
going
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan,%20Indiana">
Milan
</ref>
and
meeting
the
[
19]54
basketball
team
.
</s>
<s>
They
all
turned
out
for
that
.
</s>
<s>
That
was
kind
of
a
turning
point
in
our
road
show
.
</s>
<s>
Because
up
until
that
point
,
the
turnout
was
mixed
in
terms
of
whether
it
was
single-class
or
multi-class
.
</s>
<s>
But
at
Milan
,
it
was
blowout
.
</s>
<s>
Everyone
there
wants
to
go
back
to
single
class
basketball
.
</s>
<s>
I
toured
the
Milan
high
school
,
and
the
athletic
director
tells
me
to
this
day
he
still
gets
calls
from
people
all
over
the
world
wanting
to
know
about
Milan
and
Hoosiers
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
He
actually
had
a
guy
call
him
once
and
say
how
do
I
get
to
the
high
school
,
I
â€™m
flying
in
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Cincinnati">
Cincinnati
</ref>
,
and
he
gave
him
directions
from
the
Cincinnati
airport
to
the
Milan
high
school
so
he
could
come
see
the
trophies
and
learn
more
about
the
history
because
he
had
just
seen
the
movie
Hoosiers
.
</s>
<s>
To
me
this
is
something
like
,
just
like
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway">
Indianapolis

Speedway

Indianapolis
on
the
map

spectacle

,
with

</s>
<s>
We
are
also
known
internationally
for
our
wonderful
single
class
basketball
tournament
,
which
lifts
up
and
extolls
the
virtues
of
the
underdog
and
the
little
guy
.
</s>
<s>
When
we
went
to
multi-class
basketball
we
lost
some
of
that
cultural
identity
that
Indiana
was
known
for
.
</s>
<s>
Not
only
nationally
but
throughout
the
world
.

And
I
want
to
try
to
bring
that
