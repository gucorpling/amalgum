Florida

<s>
Compared
with
the
overwhelming
role
of
capital
in
attracting
talent
,
talent
itself
is
also
a
more
and
more
effective
and
attractive
factor
to
attract
capital
.
</s>
<s>
Florida
pointed
out
that
the
great
metropolises
with
high
shares
of
skills
,
creativity
,
and
knowledge
would
inevitably
have
high
wages
and
housing
costs
borne
by
high-skill
and
low-skill
occupations
across
the
American
metropolises
.
</s>
<s>
Empirically
and
theoretically
,
the
most
creative
people
prefer
living
in
places
that
provide
better
housing
security
,
greater
freedom
,
and
more
cultural
opportunities
.
</s>
<s>
With
the
deepening
marketization
of
housing
system
and
the
increasing
housing
demands
in
the
developed
and
developing
countries
,
the
crisis
of
the
real
estate
bubble
has
generally
occurred
.

China
has
experienced
the
largest
massive
rural
to
urban
migration
in
human
history
,
of
around
250
million
internal
migrants
on
the
move
in
2015
.
</s>
<s>
Housing
is
an
important
aspect
of
the
basic
needs
of
urban
migrants
,
but
a
person
with
a
rural
<hi rend="italic">
hukou

status
is
still
not
fully
eligible
for
state-sponsored
housing
assistance
in
urban
areas
.
</s>
<s>
Many
studies
have
revealed
that
the
most
important
decision
for
migrants
is
rental
housing
.
</s>
<s>
The
housing
problem
is
quite
challenging
among
the
unskilled
migrants
,
who
are
limited
to
certain
lower-level
sections
of
the
urban
job
market
and
thus
have
lower
capacities
to
afford
the
urban
housing
market
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
the
flow
of
talent
has
effectively
affected
the
development
of
the
knowledge
economy
,
and
the
amenity-driven
mobility
of
talent
has
become
the
new
geographical
phenomenon
in
recent
years

The
announcement

the
National
New
Urbanization
Plan
(
2014
–
2020

by
the
Chinese
government
in
2014
has
marked
a
huge
change
of
Chinese
urbanization
policy
towards
a
more
inclusive
growth
pattern
.
</s>
<s>
The
regional
differences
of
urbanization
patterns
in
the
more
and
less
advanced
areas
in
China
will
persist
,
and
such
areal
heterogeneity
is
expected
to
bring
with
them
many
problems
with
housing
,
employment
,
medical
care
,
social
security
and
education
provisions
for
the
migrant
workers
.
</s>
<s>
The
great
variance
between
cohorts
has
attracted
much
attention
,
too
,
as
the
old
rural
workers
(
<hi rend="italic">
nongmingong

,
known
as
migrant
labors
from
rural
areas
)
and
the
new-generation
migrant
workers
(
those
born
in
the
1980s
and
afterwards
)
coexist
together
in
the
huge
labor
market
in
the
Chinese
metropolises
.
</s>
<s>
The
Chinese
internal
migration
pattern
has
changed
remarkably
due
to
the
inflow
of
a
new
generation
of
migrants
as
the
main
force
of
internal
migration
.
</s>
<s>
The
new-generation
migrants
who
are
motivated
by
the
superior
urban
lifestyle
and
prosperous
career
development
in
the
big
cities
are
generally
better
educated
and
skilled
,
and
are
more
likely
to
work
in
the
advanced
manufacturing
industries
and
the
well-paid
service
industries
than
in
the
traditional
construction
industry
,
based
on
Richard
Florida
’s
study
and
an
empirical
observation
on
China
’s
industrial
upgrading
.
</s>
<s>
At
the
same
time
,
as
Chinese
higher
education
is
undergoing
the
process
of
universalization
,
the
young
generation
has
gotten
better
trained
and
they
are
more
capable
of
engaging
in
skilled
jobs
.
</s>
<s>
For
this
reason
,
the
skilled
migrant
population
has
grown
and
is
better
equipped
for
the
great
economic
restructuring
in
Chinese
cities
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
apparent
that
the
skills
of
highly-educated
migrants
have
contributed
to
their
superior
positions
in
the
labor
and
housing
markets
compared
with
their
unskilled
peers
,
which
results
in
a
different
residential
distribution
in
cities
.
</s>
<s>
The
housing
affordability
capacities
,
the
consumption
preference
and
behaviors
in
the
housing
market
of
skilled
migrants
are
therefore
distinct
from
the
unskilled
ones
.
</s>
<s>
But
the
divide
of
migrant
rent
affordability
stress
between
skilled
and
unskilled
migrant
workers
and
the
regional
heterogeneity
of
this
stress
in
urban
China
have
rarely
been
reported
in
the
existing
literature
.

<p>

At
the
same
time
,
another
profound
institutional
reform
on
the
<hi rend="italic">
hukou
</hi>
system
is
proceeding
,
but
cities
of
different
administrative
ranks
in
China
have
taken
different
actions
as
to
how
to
better
attract
,
serve
,
and
manage
the
migrant
workers
in
the
destination
cities
.
</s>
<s>
The
releasing
of
<hi rend="italic">
hukou
</hi>
constraints
and
the
“
talent
war
”
between
second
tired
cities
are
believed
to
be
the
reactions
of
local
governments
towards
population
aging
and
an
impending
drop
in
China
’s
demographic
dividend
in
recent
years
in
urban
China
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
reported
that
the
decline
of
demographic
dividend
has
prompted
some
cities
to
introduce
a
young
and
high-skilled
labor
force
to
improve
the
demographic
structure
in
the
aging
regions
,
rust
belts
,
and
those
experiencing
industrial
upgrading
.
</s>
<s>
Interestingly
,
despite
the
very
strict
<hi rend="italic">
hukou
</hi>
regulation
and
housing
purchase
limits
on
migrants
in
first-tier
cities
such
as
Beijing
and
Shanghai
,
second-tier
cities
including
provincial
capital
cities
like
Wuhan
and
Zhengzhou
have
provided
very
generous
housing
subsidies
in
order
to
attract
the
young
high-skilled
migrants
who
have
a
bachelor
’s
degree
and
above
.
</s>
<s>
The
regional
variance
in
terms
of
housing
policy
towards
migrant
workers
has
been
a
new
policy
incentive
explaining
the
new
trends
of
internal
migration
in
China
now
