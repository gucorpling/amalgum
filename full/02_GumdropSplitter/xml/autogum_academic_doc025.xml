Understanding
mechanisms
of
viral
strategy
to
evade
from
host
antiviral
responses
is
critical
for
elucidation
of
the
pathogenesis
of
CSFV
infection
.

<s>
Type
I
IFNs
represent
one
of
the
first
lines
of
defense
of
the
innate
immune
system
and
are
produced
rapidly
upon
recognition
of
viral
factors
by
PRRs
.
</s>
<s>
CSFV
is
known
to
interfere
with
the
generation
of
type
I
IFNs
by
inducing
proteasomal
degradation
of
IRF3
.
</s>
<s>
Type
III
IFNs
play
a
critical
role
in
antiviral
innate
immunity
in
mucosal
epithelial
cells
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
little
information
is
available
as
to
whether
and
how
CSFV
modulates
type
III
IFN
response
.
</s>
<s>
The
present
study
demonstrates
that
the
Npro
protein
of
CSFV
inhibited
IRF1-mediated
type
III
IFNs
production
by
down-regulation
of
IRF1
expression
and
blockage
of
its
nuclear
translocation
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
Npro-deleted
mutant
showed
similar
growth
kinetics
to
its
parental
strain
,
indicating
that
CSFV
Npro
does
not
alter
the
replication
in
cell
culture
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
previous
study
.
</s>
<s>
Some
viruses
have
evolved
to
encode
viral
antagonists
for
evasion
of
type
III
IFNs
responses
.

<s>
Reid
et
al
showed
the
induction
of
type
III
IFNs
in
pDCs
upon
BVDV
infection
,
and
type
III
IFNs
contributed
to
suppression
of
cellular
immune
response
during
BVDV
infection
.
Cai
et
al
shows
that
CSFV
induced
the
expression
of
type
III
IFNs
in
PK-15
cells
,
but
with
a
limited
level
of
increase
,
suggesting
that
CSFV
might
have
a
strategy
to
suppress
expression
of
type
III
IFNs
.
</s>
<s>
We
also
found
limited
up-regulation
of
type
III
IFNs
transcription
upon
wtCSFV
infection
in
IPEC-J2
cells
,
though
the
transcription
level
peaked
at
24
hpi
and
decreased
thereafter
,
which
is
different
from
the
results
shown
by
Cai
et
al
that
the
mRNA
level
of
IFN-λ1
and
IFN-λ3
induced
by
wtCSFV
peaked
at
36
and
48
hpi
,
respectively
.
</s>
<s>
We
speculate
that
the
difference
might
be
due
to
different
cell
types
used
.
</s>
<s>
Because
CSFV
causes
enteric
pathologies
,
a
cell
line
from
the
intestines
could
be
a
good
choice
.
</s>
<s>
The
IPEC-J2
cell
line
was
from
non-transformed
cells
collected
from
the
jejunum
of
a
neonatal
piglet
and
suitable
for
infection
studies
for
enteropathogens
.
</s>
<s>
IPEC-J2
exhibited
robust
expression
of
type
III
IFNs
with
a
relatively
lower
type
I
IFNs
response
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
the
IPEC-J2
cell
line
was
chosen
in
this
study
.
</s>
<s>
Cell
lines
or
primary
cultures
from
other
intestinal
areas
or
from
adult
pigs
could
be
approached
for
further
investigation
of
the
interactions
between
CSFV
and
type
III
IFNs
.
</s>

<p>
<s>
We
found
that
the
∆Npro
mutant
induced
significantly
higher
transcription
of
IFNs
in
IPEC-J2
cells
from
24
to
48
hpi
than
its
parental
strain
,
suggesting
that
the
Npro
protein
might
be
antagonistic
to
expression
of
type
III
IFNs
.
</s>
<s>
Because
CSFV
Npro
has
been
found
to
subvert
the
type
I
IFN
response
,
we
speculated
if
Npro
might
have
similar
effect
on
type
III
IFNs
.
</s>
<s>
We
showed
that
wtCSFV
strongly
inhibited
expression
of
poly(I
:
C)-induced
type
III
IFNs
in
IPEC-J2
cells
and
Npro
deletion
abolished
such
an
inhibitory
effect
.
</s>
<s>
We
further
showed
that
Npro
over-expression
led
to
a
marked
reduction
of
mRNA
transcripts
of
type
III
IFNs
.
</s>
<s>
Either
infection
with
wtCSFV
or
over-expression
of
Npro
also
resulted
in
significant
reduction
of
the
IFN-λ3
promoter
activity
of
poly(I
:
C)-treated
IPEC-J2
cells
.
</s>
<s>
These
results
demonstrate
that
CSFV
employs
its
Npro
to
inhibit
type
III
IFNs
expression
probably
by
targeting
the
regulatory
elements
involved
in
transcription
of
IFN-λs
.

Activation
of
type
III
IFNs
,
as
the
case
with
type
I
IFNs
,
requires
IRF3
,
IRF7
and
NF-κB
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
expression
of
type
III
IFNs
does
not
need
all
components
of
the
enhanceosome

IRF1
is
a
predominant
antiviral
molecule
against
many
viruses
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
the
first
identified
member
of
the
IRF
family
,
but
it
does
not
induce
production
of
type
I
IFNs
.
Odendall
et
al
has
shown
that
IRF1
regulates
peroxisome-mediated
IFN-λ1
expression
.
</s>
<s>
Epithelial
cells
have
preference
of
producing
IFN-λs
over
IFN-α/β
upon
viral
infection
.
</s>
<s>
This
may
be
due
to
relatively
higher
expression
of
peroxisomes
in
epithelial
cells
.
</s>
<s>
Peroxisomal
MAVS
is
known
to
induce
type
III
IFNs
,
as
opposed
to
induction
of
type
I
IFNs
via
mitochondrial
MAVS
.
</s>
<s>
To
better
understand
the
regulation
of
type
III
IFNs
by
IRF1
,
we
attempted
to
regulate
levels
of
IRF1
expression
by
overexpression
or
RNA
interference
in
IPEC-J2
cells
.
</s>
<s>
Overexpression
of
IRF1
led
to
a
significant
increase
of
transcription
of
all
IFN-λs
and
IFN-λ3
promoter
activity
,
while
gene
silencing
showed
opposite
effects
,
indicating
that
IRF1
positively
regulates
expression
of
type
III
IFNs
