Tell
the
Difference
Between
Social
Media
and
Traditional
Marketing
</s>
</head>
<p>
<s>
Social
media
marketing
is
almost
taking
over
the
traditional
marketing
landscape
due
to
its
cost
effective
nature
and
interactivity
.
</s>
<s>
Unlike
traditional
marketing
,
social
media
campaigns
can
be
sculpted
and
toned
to
accommodate
a
specific
target
market
with
almost
continuous
updates
as
the
market
's
tastes
and
interests
change
and
evolve
.
</s>
<s>
Since
social
media
is
still
in
its
infancy
stages
,
some
consumers
have
a
difficult
time
discerning
between
traditional
versus
social
even
though
the
two
vehicles
are
light
years
apart
.
</s>
<s>
Here
are
a
few
steps
you
can
take
to
determine
the
difference
between
social
media
versus
traditional
marketing
.

<s>
Social
media
is
interactive
,
whereas
traditional
marketing
is
passive
.

Can
you
respond
or
“
talk
back
”
to
the
ad
?
</s>
<s>
Watching
television
,
listening
to
the
radio
or
reading
a
newspaper
,
for
example
are
all
forms
of
traditional
marketing
.
</s>
<s>
The
reader/viewer/listener
is
passively
reading
the
paper
,
watching
TV
or
listening
to
the
radio
and
is
confronted
with
an
ad
.
</s>
<s>
The
only
way
around
the
advertising
is
to
turn
the
channel
or
page
.
</s>
<s>
Whether
you
want
the
ad
or
not
,
you
get
it
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
with
social
media
you
are
prompted
to
interact
with
the
marketing
whether
it
's
clicking
on
the
ad
or
commenting
on
the
post
or
Tweet
.
</s>
</item>
<item>
<s>
Is
there
a
call
to
action
that
can
be
addressed
immediately
?
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
with
social
media
,
while
checking
your
Facebook
page
you
may
see
advertisements
running
along
the
side
of
your
page
.
</s>
<s>
These
ads
are
designed
especially
for
your
taste
based
on
your
interaction
with
Facebook
.
</s>
<s>
If
you
are
a
Cleveland
Browns
fan
,
you
may
see
opportunities
to
order
football
bobble
heads
or
sportswear
.
</s>
<s>
So
while
you
may
not
be
in
the
market
for
a
new
Cleveland
Browns
bobble
head
you
are
more
likely
to
click
on
the
ad
based
on
your
interests
.
</s>
<s>
With
a
traditional
campaign
there
is
no
“
immediate
gratification
”
and
the
reader/viewer/listener
must
wait
to
take
action
,
such
as
drive
to
or
call
the
store
to
obtain
the
product
.

Decide
if
the
ad
promotes
relationship
building
.
</s>
<s>
Traditional
media
will
often
present
the
product
or
offer
,
but
the
“
interaction
”
ends
there
.
</s>
<s>
When
it
comes
to
social
media
,
the
company
and
consumer
truly
interact
and
react
off
each
other
.

Can
you
prompt
discussion
and
networking
through
the
ad
?
</s>
<s>
In
today
's
social
media
society
,
it
's
all
about
networking
and
relationship
building
.
</s>
<s>
Consumers
can
actively
choose
to
follow
or
“
like
”
certain
businesses
and
may
be
prompted
to
act
based
on
incentives
or
the
receipt
of
ongoing
news
and
information
.
</s>
<s>
Traditional
media
is
simply
product
presentation
--
no
networking
or
relationships
can
be
built
with
the
company
or
amongst
consumers
.
</s>
</item>
<item>
<s>
Can
you
easily
encourage
friends
or
your
network
to
discover
the
ad
?
</s>
<s>
With
social
media
you
may
find
commonality
with
other
friends
or
family
members
as
you
build
a
relationship
with
the
company
.
</s>
<s>
One
example
is
with
the
site
Groupon
where
the
more
interest
conjured
up
from
friends
and
networks
,
the
more
likely
the
deal
will
come
to
fruition
for
all
.
</s>
<s>
Plus
social
sites
like
Groupon
can
be
shared
on
other
social
vehicles
like
Twitter
and
Facebook
.
</s>
<s>
When
it
comes
to
traditional
media
,
there
is
no
connectivity
.
</s>
<s>
If
you
choose
to
shop
with
a
certain
store
or
brand
you
can
possibly
sign
up
for
a
mailing
list
to
receive
coupons
or
other
correspondence
but
the
relationship
typically
stops
at
that
point
.
</s>
<s>
The
best
way
to
network
through
traditional
media
is
through
social
media
or
by
emailing
information
to
friends
and/or
cutting
out
ads
and
giving
them
to
friends
.

Determine
if
the
media
can
be
quickly
customized
to
accommodate
a
specific
audience

</s>
<s>
Unlike
traditional
media
,
most
social
media
vehicles
are
created
online
,
allowing
for
a
more
malleable
platform
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
social
media
campaigns
can
be
tested
for
only
a
few
dollars
.
</s>
<s>
The
business
may
find
that
upon
test
,
the
offer
is
too
weak
or
it
should
have
featured
a
different
product
.
</s>
<s>
Within
hours
the
offer
can
be
revised
and
tweaked
,
then
reissued
--
all
within
the
same
day
and
for
little
cash
outlay
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
when
it
comes
to
traditional
media
the
cost
to
print
or
produce
a
new
ad
(
print
,
radio
or
TV
)
it
comes
down
to
time
and
money
to
reproduce
,
reprint
and
redistribute
.

Both
social

traditional

can
be
relevant
for
numerous
years

For

ads

creative
impact

they
both
do
not
have
the

lifespan
