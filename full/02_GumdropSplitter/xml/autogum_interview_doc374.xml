Now
,
this
means
collaborating
in
some
cases
,
it
means
undertaking
statistical
activities
in
others
,
it
means
providing
advice

methodological
,
technological
,
around
standards
and
conceptual
frameworks
.

It
's
a
very
broad
range
of
building
capability
,
as
well
as
undertaking
ourselves
statistical
activity
,
building
capability
of
all
those
other
players
,
who
are
important
parts
and
play
an
important
part
in
what
I
call
the

total

of
official

And
of
course
that
change
was
made
before
you
became
Statistician
,
and
in
fact
you
were
n't
actually
in
the
Bureau
at
the
time
-
you
rose
through
the
ranks
here
and
then
went
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_Zealand">

for
a

That
's
right
,
I
had
six
years
as
the
Government
Statistician
in
New
Zealand
,
and
interestingly
there
were
parallel
processes
going
on
in
Australia
and
New
Zealand
around
the
national
statistical
agency
in
New
Zealand
,
called
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics%20New%20Zealand">
Statistics
New
Zealand
</ref>
,
here
the
Australian
Bureau
of
Statistics
,
taking
stronger
leadership
in
their
statistical
worlds
,
inside
their
own
nations
,
and
so
when
I
came
back
from
New
Zealand
it
was
not
unfamiliar
territory
that
I
was
coming
back
to
,
and
some
of
the
changes
that
had
occurred
in
the
period
that
I
'd
been
away
from
the
ABS
were
grappling
with
and
dealing
with
and
developing
strategies
to
take
that
leadership
forward
,
and
we
'd
done
similar
things
in
New
Zealand
so
,
from
my
point
of
view
,
it
was
really
positive
to
come
back
to
help
play
my
role
in
establishing
and
reinforcing
our
leadership
of
statistics
in
Australia
.

There
's
a
number

significant
differences
.

Of
course

scale
's
one

Australia
,
in
geography
,
in
population
,
is
a
much
bigger
place
,

that
has
its
benefits
and
challenges
.
</s>
<s>
Probably
the
biggest
difference
in
my
role
as
Australian
Statistician
and
my
previous
role
as
Government
Statistician
in
New
Zealand
is
that
we
're
a
federal
system
in
Australia
,
so
we
have
responsibilities
not
only
to
the
Australian
Government
but
to
the
states
and
territories
as
well
.
</s>
<s>
In
New
Zealand
,
of
course
,
you
have
unilateral
government
,
or
unimodal
government
,
so
there
was
only
one
government
and
there
was
only
one
bureaucracy
,
and
so
the
complexity
in
a
lot
of
fields
of
statistics
in
Australia
is
made
much
more
complex
by
the
very
nature
of
our
government
arrangements
,
and
that
's
a
big
difference
.
</s>
<s>
I
think
also
that
the
scale
means
that
in
some
cases
in
New
Zealand
we
had
to
try
and
meet
the
expectations
of
society
for
the
quality
in
the
breadth
of
the
statistical
services
we
provided
with
less
resources
and
less
depth
of
resources
in
a
lot
of
areas
,
so
that
had
its
challenges
as
well
,
but
the
biggest
difference
,
I
think
,
really
was
the
nature
of
the
government
relationships
.
