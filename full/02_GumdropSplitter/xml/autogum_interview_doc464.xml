Not

The
process
of
recording
music
,
for
me
,
is
very
insular
.

I
'm
just
recording
at

it
's
very
much
headspace
music

I
'm
escaping

I
'm
not
a
social
commentarian

anything

It
's
more
about
escaping
into
this

sound

I
do
n't

I
'm
an

I
live

UK

I
live
under
a
government
that
has
taken
troops
to
the
war

whatever
.

It
has
n't
changed
my
perspective
that
much
where
I
feel
there
have
been
lots
of
terrible
situations
like
this
in
the
past

you
just
have
to
do
whatever
is

Use

protest

I
think
manmade
things

specifically
ideas

I
'm
not
interested

the
real
world
as
much
as
I
am
interested

mental

mental
contexts

That

PhD
</ref>
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure%20maths">

,
this
elegance
of
pure
ideas
and
things
that
are
somewhat
intangible
and
about
ideas
.

<s>
Music
is
very
much
like
that

playing
around
with
ideas

creating
this
aesthetic

sound

In
mathematics
at
the
PhD
level
when
I
was
studying
was
about
constructing
these
elaborate
systems
and
concepts
,
playing
around
with
them
,
and
fitting
them
together
.
</s>
<s>
More
than
ideas
is
playing
around
with
the
ideas
,
constructing
them
,
and
creating
something
out
of
them
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
in
music
I
will
have
an
idea
to
put
some
different
sounds
together
or
a
melody
that
meshes
with
a
chord
sequence
or
a
sonic
mood
,
or
whatever
.
</s>
<s>
I
'm
not
the
type
of
person
who
takes
physical
things
apart
and
plays
around
with
them
,
but
I
like
taking
mental
ideas
apart
and
playing
around
with
them
.
</s>
<s>
That
's
what
appeals
to
me
about
what
I

spent
my

doing
