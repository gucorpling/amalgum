you

I

in

most
of

in

ways

we
think
of
ourselves
as
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion%20in%20the%20United%20States">

nation

,
but
in
fact
,
we
also
think
we
can
pick
and
choose
what
we
want
about
religion
.
</s>
<s>
Most
people
,
if
you
press
them
,
their
concept
of
God
is
something
like
a
divine
spark
within
them

something
that
we
all
share
.
</s>
<s>
Which
is
very
in
keeping
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnostic">
Gnostic

principle
--
we
call
it
Gnosticism
now

but
a
