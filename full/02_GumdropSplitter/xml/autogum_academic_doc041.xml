Waterborne
infections
emanate
from
the
transmission
of
pathogenic
microorganisms
(
bacteria
,
viruses
,
protozoa
)
by
both
direct
and
indirect
ingestion
of
polluted
water
.
</s>
<s>
Most
water-borne
pathogens
are
spread
through
the
fecal
â€“
oral
route
,
and
find
their
way
to
wastewater
treatment
plants
(
WWTPs
)
through
excreted
feces
in
raw
sewage
from
infected
people
or
in
drinking
water
,
or
by
eating
food
exposed
to
contaminated
water
,
which
could
lead
to
serious
health
complications
.
</s>
<s>
In
recent
years
,
bacterial
pathogens
have
been
recurrently
identified
in
wastewater
plants
,
based
on
the
impression
that
WWTPs
are
a
major
reservoir
for
the
growth
of
numerous
pathogenic
microbes
.
</s>
<s>
Regardless
of
tremendous
efforts
by
governments
and
water
management
facilities
to
improve
and
sustain
the
quality
of
water
treatment
systems
,
the
occurrence
of
waterborne
infections
remains
rampant
worldwide
.
</s>
<s>
Bacteria
,
which
are
abundant
in
WWTPs
,
play
significant
roles
,
such
as
breaking
down
organic
matter
,
being
a
source
of
nutrients
,
and
facilitating
energy
flow
and
biogeochemical
cycling
as
well
as
disease
transmission
.
</s>
<s>
Traditionally
,
the
main
treatment
processes
in
WWTPs
include
primary
,
biological
(
secondary
)
,
and
tertiary
treatment
.
</s>
<s>
Primary
treatment
is
a
preliminary
stage
which
makes
use
of
bar
screens
to
remove
large
solid
objects
from
water
.
</s>
<s>
It
can
also
include
the
use
of
sedimentation
basins
to
separate
solid
from
liquid
waste
by
means
of
natural
gravity
.
</s>
<s>
The
floating
materials
are
removed
while
the
remaining
liquids
are
laid
open
for
the
secondary
stage
of
treatment
through
the
use
of
biological
methods
(
either
aerobic
or
anaerobic
)
to
break
down
the
organic
waste
matter
.
</s>
<s>
The
organic
matter
in
the
waste
are
removed
through
the
use
of
a
bed
of
stones
(
trickling
filter
beds
)
or
the
activated
sludge
process
.
</s>
<s>
Finally
,
effluents
from
the
secondary
treatment
tank
are
then
disinfected
with
chlorine
,
which
is
assumed
to
kill
all
pathogenic
organisms
and
reduce
odor
,
before
being
discharged
into
distribution
channels
and
receiving
water
bodies
.
</s>
<s>
There
has
been
a
significant
effort
by
water
management
authorities
to
adopt
new
techniques
in
treatment
plants
such
as
UV
and
membrane
treatment
technology
,
mechanical
(
ultrafiltration
,
reverse
osmosis
,
nano-filtration
)
,
ultrasonic
(
ozonation
)
,
biological
(
active
filters
and
enzymes
)
,
adsorption
(
activated
carbon
)
,
and
combinations
of
these
processes
to
eliminate
and
partially
remove
microbes
in
wastewater
.
</s>
<s>
Despite
all
these
approaches
,
the
existence
of
pathogenic
microbes
in
raw
and
treated
wastewater
is
still
considered
a
potential
hazard
and
health
risk
to
the
public
.
</s>
<s>
At
present
,
most
WWTPs
assess
the
quality
of
water
based
on
biological
indicators
,
such
as
the
total
coliforms
and
fecal
coliforms
,
as
well
as
physical
and
chemical
indicators
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
these
assessment
techniques
do
not
directly
classify
the
variety
of
the
mixed
bacterial
populations
present
in
WWTP
systems
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Several
molecular
methods
have
been
reported
for
the
identification
of
bacterial
species
in
environmental
samples
.
</s>
<s>
There
is
,
however
,
another
challenge
with
regard
to
the
species
identification
of
microbes
,
in
that
a
widespread
selection
of
these
environmental
bacterial
species
cannot
be
cultured
.
</s>
<s>
Over
the
years
,
molecular
technologies
such
as
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
,
quantitative
real-time
PCR
(
qPCR
)
,
microarray
,
and
other
techniques
have
been
widely
used
to
target
microbial
species
in
environmental
samples
.
</s>
<s>
All
of
these
molecular
techniques
have
both
strengths
and
weaknesses
,
but
these
approaches
are
always
delegated
to
specifically
target
the
identification
of
a
pre-selected
group
of
microbes
or
virulence
genes
.
</s>
<s>
The
main
limitation
of
these
technologies
is
that
they
can
only
specifically
detect
certain
pathogens
,
and
cannot
provide
comprehensive
insight
into
the
potential
pathogens
in
the
environment
.
</s>

<p>
<s>
Current
approaches
in
microbial
detection
(
such
as
next-generation
sequencing
)
have
made
it
possible
to
extract
DNA
directly
from
environmental
samples
and
sequences
for
identification
,
diversification
,
diagnostic
,
clinical
,
and
monitoring
purposes
.
</s>
<s>
Recently
,
high-throughput
next-generation
sequencing
methods
applied
to
the
16S
rRNA
gene
have
produced
complete
descriptions
of
bacterial
communities
in
various
environments
,
due
to
the
increased
number
of
sequence
reads
that
can
be
obtained
and
analyzed

A
number
of
investigations
have
been
performed
into

microbial
diversity

pathogenic
indication
of
environmental
genomes
in
WWTPs

sequencing
of
the

amplicon

different
high-throughput

In
this

influent

effluent
wastewater
samples

three
WWTPs
in
South
Africa
