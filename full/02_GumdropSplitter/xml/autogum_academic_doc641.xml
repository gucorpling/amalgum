Over

New

Emerging
factors

innate
intestinal
immunity

the

play
a
key
role
in
the
development
of
gastrointestinal

GI

extra-GI
diseases
.

The
results

studies

For
example

Moreover

Another

</s>
<s>
It
is
not
surprising
when
we
recall
that
SB
endocrine
cells
secrete
glycemia-regulating
incretin
hormones
(
e.
g.
,
glucagon-like

,
GLP-1

this
process

The
human
digestive

enteric
nervous
system
(

communicate
with
the
central
nervous
system
(
CNS

through
the
gut-brain

This
bidirectional
communication
involves
diverse
neural
networks
through
the
X
cranial
vagal
nerve
—
dorsal
roots
of
the
sympathetic/
parasympathetic
nervous
system
.
</s>
<s>
Important
roles
in
the
regulation
of

are
played
by

The

Of
interest

the
structure

<s>
The
gut-brain
communication
is
mediated
via
blood
,
portal/hepatic
circulation
,
and
the
bone
marrow
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
Recently
,
it
has
been
described
that
the
alterations
of
the
intestinal
barrier
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
pathology
of
several
human
inflammatory
and
autoimmune
diseases
.
Mohanan
et
al.
documented
the
crucial
role
of
the
C1orf106
inflammatory
bowel
disease
(
IBD
)
susceptibility
gene
in
stabilizing
intestinal
barrier
function
and
intestinal
inflammation
.
Manfredo
Vieira
et
al.
evidenced
the
role
of
pathobionts
in
the
process
of
intestinal
barrier
alterations
,
which
were
followed
by
their
translocation
to
lymph
nodes
and
the
hepatic
portal
system
,
triggering
systemic
lupus
erythematosus
(
SLE
)
.
Thaiss
et
al.
reported
that
hyperglycemia
leads
to
disruption
of
the
intestinal
barrier
followed
by
intestinal
inflammation
and
systemic
infection
.
Spadoni
et
al.
recently
documented
that
the
presence
of
the
gut-vascular
barrier
(
GVB
)
in
the
small
intestine
controls
the
dissemination
of
bacteria
into
the
bloodstream
.
</s>
<s>
The
authors
reported
a
decrease

the
wnt/beta
catenin-inducible
gene
Axin2

marker

stem

renewal
)
in
gut
endothelium
under
the
presence
of
<hi rend="italic">
Salmonella
typhimirum

SB

</s>
<s>
The
GVB
was
modified
in
patients
with
coeliac
disease
(
CD
)
with
altered
serum
transaminases
,
which
suggests
that
GVB
deterioration
may
be
responsible
for
liver
damage
in
CD
patients
.
</s>
<s>
It
has
been
shown
that
disruption
of
epithelial
and
vascular
barriers
in
the
intestine
were
early
events
in
non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis
(
NASH
)
,

GVB
leakage
marker

be
identified
in
colonic
biopsies
in
patients

NASH

</s>
<s>
Of
importance
,
SB
epithelial

vascular
barriers
are
FXR-controlled
,
which
opens
avenues
to
clinical
trials
aimed
at
investigation
of
novel
FXR-agonists
as
future
therapeutics
.
</s>
<s>
Of
interest
,
intestinal
barriers
could
be
monitored

the
aid
of
confocal
laser
endomicroscopy
(
CLE

Therefore

the
SB
is
considered
a
key
player
in
metabolic
disease
development
,
including
diabetes
mellitus
and
NASH

other
diet-related
disorders

Another
major
field

</s>
<s>
Moreover

the
emergence

the
important
role

SB
in
the
pathogenesis

previously
unthought

GI-unrelated
conditions

neurodegenerative

cardiovascular
disease

The
SB
remains
an
organ
that

fully
access

accurate
diagnosis
often
poses
a
clinical
challenge

</s>
<s>
Undoubtedly

the
therapeutic
potential
remains
untapped

<s>
Therefore
,
it
is
now
time
to
direct
more
of

interest
towards
the
SB

unravel
the
interplay

SB
