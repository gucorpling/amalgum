I
think
that
if
Beck
had
never
started
the
legal
action
,
this
meme
would
have
died
out
after
a
couple
of
weeks
.

It
might
have
popped
up
in
the
occasional
place

I
do
n't
think
it
would
have
lasted
the
more
than
two
months
it
has
.

I
've
seen

anywhere

:
Beck
's

His
claim
is
that
the

the

has

name

I
do
n't
believe
that
was
his

motivation
in

get
the

I

he

stifle
free

I
think
he
looked
at
<hi rend="italic">

decided
he
could
n't
win
against
my
legally-protected
right

mock
him
,

that
he
might
be
able
to
use
other
means
to
get
my
point
of
view
shut
down
.
(
It
's
easy
to
come
to
this
conclusion
if
you
look
at
the
legal
documents
I
posted
on
gb1990.net/legal

I
posted
everything

What
I
'd
like
Beck
to
do
differently

simply
realize
that
the

effects

have

you
disagree
with
shutdown
would
ultimately
affect
his
rights
as
well

I
disagree
with
many
of
the
things
he
says
,
and
hope
to
put
pressure
on
him

change

ultimately
,
I
would
never
wish
to
stifle
his
first

rights
