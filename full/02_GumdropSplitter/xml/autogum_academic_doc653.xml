<p>

Ammonium
is
one
of
the
major
pollutants
found
in
water
sources
in
China
,
especially
in
groundwater
.
</s>
<s>
Excessive
ammonium
in
drinking
water
can
cause
nitrification
in
the
water
distribution
system
,
leading
to
many
problems
including
corrosion
,
aesthetic
issues
and
pH
decrease
.
</s>
<s>
In
China
,
the
maximum
permitted
concentration
of
ammonium
in
drinking
water
is
0.5
mg/L
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
it
is
meaningful
to
explore
various
techniques
that
can
efficiently
remove
ammonium
from
drinking
water
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Breakpoint
chlorination
is
an
effective
way
to
remove
ammonium
from
drinking
water
.
</s>
<s>
It
has
low
spatial
requirement
,
non-sensitivity
to
temperature
variations
and
adaptability
to
existing
facilities
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
it
can
lead
to
high
chlorine
consumption
and
stimulate
the
formation
of
undesirable
chlorinated
by-products
in
the
drinking
water
.
</s>
<s>
Biological
filter
and
catalytic
oxidation
are
good
methods
to
remove
ammonium
from
drinking
water
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
in
biological
filtration
,
the
removal
activity
is
limited
at
lower
temperatures
and
the
deficiency
of
some
required
nutrition
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
some
measurements
should
be
taken
to
improve
the
ammonium
removal
efficiency
in
biofiltration
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
An
alternative
method
to
biofiltration
would
be
abiotic
removal
of
ammonium
,
using
catalytic
oxidation
technology
.
</s>
<s>
Traditional
catalytic
oxidation
processes
can
remove
ammonia
from
municipal
wastewater
effectively
using
platinum
and
RuO2/Ti
anode
as
catalysts
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
these
processes
are
used
rarely
in
drinking
water
treatment
systems
.
</s>
<s>
Recently
,
studies
report
that
iron
–
manganese
co-oxide
filter
film
(
MeOx
)
can
remove
ammonium
from
drinking
water
by
chemical
catalytic
oxidation
.
</s>
<s>
It
has
good
tolerance
to
low
temperatures
and
requires
a
shorter
start-up
time
compared
to
the
conventional
biofiltration
method
,
making
it
a
good
alternative
for
ammonium
removal
from
drinking
water
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
application
of
chemical
catalytic
oxidation
technology
and
its
mechanism
for
ammonium
removal
has
been
studied
,
which
showed
that
ammonium
with
an
average
concentration
of
approximately
1.5
–
2.0
mg/L
could
be
removed
effectively
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
its
effectiveness
in
removing
high
concentrations
of
ammonium
has
not
been
investigated
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
the
ammonium
concentration
in
drinking
water
can
be
high
in
China
.
</s>
<s>
It
can
be
up
to
2
–
3.9
mg/L
in
ground
water
and
1.45
–
3.89
mg/L
in
surface
water
.
</s>
<s>
In
some
cases
,
it
can
reach
up
to
8.4
mg/L
in
raw
water
sources
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
exploring
new
methods
to
remove
high
concentrations
of
ammonium
is
significant
to
environmental
engineering
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
With
respect
to
the
low
concentration
of
ammonium
,
high
concentrations
of
ammonium
are
more
difficult
to
remove
based
on
the
limitation
of
the
inadequate
dissolve
oxygen
(
DO
)
concentration
in
water
sources
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
DO
concentration
is
generally
lower
in
groundwater
than
that
in
surface
water
and
the
DO
limitation
is
more
critical
for
ammonium
removal
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
one
hand
,
the
impact
of
oxygen
transfer
is
a
key
factor
that
influences
the
ammonium
removal
and
some
previous
researchers
suggested
that
increasing
irrigation
velocity
could
increase
the
oxygen
transfer
for
satisfying
the
metabolic
requirements
of
both
heterotrophs
and
autotrophs
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
required
oxygen
was
usually
supplied
by
multi-stage
water-dropping
and
spray
aeration
in
drinking
water
treatment
processes
when
the
concentration
of
ammonium
was
not
too
high
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
aeration
method
mentioned
above
cannot
supply
adequate
oxygen
to
meet
the
required
levels
of
ammonium
oxidation
,
especially
if
the
ammonium
concentration
is
higher
than
2
mg/L
.
</s>
<s>
Consequently
,
exploring
new
methods
to
provide
adequate
oxygen
to
remove
high
concentrations
of
ammonium
is
significant
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Different
from
the
traditional
multi-stage
water-dropping
and
spray
aeration
,
aeration
with
pure
oxygen
and
compressed
air
via
a
microporous
aeration
set
was
used
in
this
study
to
establish
a
new
way
for
removing
high
concentrations
of
ammonium
from
groundwater
by
chemical
catalytic
oxidation
filter
.
</s>
<s>
The
effects
of
aeration
types
,
aeration
rates
,
and
aeration
position
on
ammonium
or
turbidity
removal
were
investigated
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
ozone
,
which
can
inactivate
bacteria
effectively
,
was
also
fed
into
the
filter
system
to
investigate
the
role
of
the
abiotic
chemical
catalytic
oxidation
and
the
characteristics
of
the
filter
materials
were
examined
to
explore
the
removal
mechanism
of
high
concentrations
of
ammonium
