Alright
,
so
to
start
this
,
I
am
short
,
fat
,
and
do
n't
like
my
body
,
so
it
's
time
to
change
something
.
</s>
<s>
Honestly
tired
of
not
liking
the
way
I
look
(
naked
or
otherwise
)
,
not
being
able
to
buy
cute
clothes
,
and
getting
zero
male
attention
(
and
honestly
probably
being
unable
to
have
anyone
that
likes
me
,
because
yanno
...
fat
)
.
</s>
<s>
So
here
we
are
!
FWIW
,
I
am
214-218
lbs
@
5'4
&quot;
,
yikes
.
</s>
<s>
I
've
read
around
the
sub
but
have
been
struggling
with
this
one
thing
:
how
do
I
get
started
when
I
do
n't
know
...
anything
?
</s>
<s>
Like
I
do
n't
know
how
to
lift
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
know
form
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
even
know
what
half
these
routines
are
talking
about
lol
.
</s>
<s>
I
wanted
to
try
strong
curves
but
just
felt
like
?
?
?
?
?
</s>
<s>
When
I
looked
at
it
haha
Soooo
how
do
you
learn
?
</s>
<s>
How
do
I
know
I
'm
doing
it
right
?
</s>
<s>
And
where
do
I
learn
?
</s>
<s>
Is
my
only
option
to
go
and
make
an
ass
out
of
myself
alone
at
the
gym
?
</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
think
my
self
esteem
can
handle
that
...
</s>
<s>
I
am
already
terrified
of
other
people
even
looking
at
me
at
the
gym
,
let
alone
watching
me
fail
at
lifting
:(
I
do
n't
have
anyone
to
use
as
a
gym
buddy
,
so
I
'm
really
on
my
own
here
!
EDIT
:
thanks
everyone
for
the
advice
and
encouragement
!
I
woke
up
this
morning
feeling
really
awful
about
myself
.
</s>
<s>
I
still
do
n't
feel
great
,
but
I
feel
like
I
can
change
.
</s>
<s>
I
have
decided
to
start
with
diet
like
most
all
of
you
suggested
and
work
from
there
once
I
've
gained
some
momentum
.
</s>
<s>
I
think
I
will
try
some
basic
cardio
stuff
at
a
gym
first
before
lifting
to
get
comfortable
in
that
environment
.
</s>
<s>
Thanks
again
,
and
hopefully
I
'll
have
a
happier
update
in
the
future
.

Go
to
a
class
girl
.
</s>
<s>
That
changed
the
way
I
view
exercise
and
it
made
me
like
it
.
</s>
<s>
It
’s
a
community
and
the
people
there
wind
up
being
your
friends
and
rooting
for
you
.
</s>
<s>
Plus
the
instructor
will
tell
you
when
you
’re
doing
something
wrong
.
</s>
<s>
They
’ll
tell
you
when
you
’re
doing
something
right
too
!
</s>
<s>
And
there
’s
the
added
bonus
of
not
having
to
think
.
</s>
<s>
You
just
show
up
and
they
tell
you
what
to
do
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n’t
go
to
classes
anymore
because
I
do
n’t
have
as
easy
of
access
to
the
ones
I
liked
,
but
I
go
to
the
gym
five
days
a
week
and
I
use
every
bit
of
knowledge
I
gleaned
from
my
instructors
to
craft
fun
,
sustainable
yet
hard
ass
workouts
for
myself
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
And
diet
matters
for
sure
,
like
everyone
had
said
.
</s>
<s>
It
matter
a
lot
!
</s>
<s>
Start
slow
so
you
do
n’t
freak
yourself
out
and
do
n’t
give
up
.
</s>
<s>
If
you
fail
sometimes
,
just
try
again
.

The
times
gonna
pass
anyway
