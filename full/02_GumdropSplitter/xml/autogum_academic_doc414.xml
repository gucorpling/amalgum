The
promulgation
of
the
energy
efficiency
regulations
(
hereafter
REEIAE
)
in
Spain
together
with
the
growth
of
LED
technology
and
the
admission
of
the
contracting
of
energy
services
companies
(
Energetics
Services
Companies
)
(
ESC
)
by
the
public
administrations
are
milestones
that
have
emerged
in
recent
years
—
the
facilities
in
the
EU

their
method
of
management

In

With

an
