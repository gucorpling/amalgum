An
epic
round
sixteen
contest
between
Argentina
and
Mexico
was
won
by
a
work
of
genius
from
Maxi
Rodriguez
,
Saturday
.

<s>
Juan
Sorin
hit
a
cross-field
pass
to
the
midfield
player
at
the
top
right
edge
of
the
Mexican
box
.
</s>
<s>
Rodriguez
jumped
to
receive
the
ball
and
,
in
the
same
moment
,
chested
high
the
way
it
had
come
.

He
met
the
descending
ball
25
yards
out
with
a
perfectly
timed
left-footed
volley
and
the
ball
arrowed
over
Oswaldo
Sanchez
into
the
opposite
corner
of
the
net
.

The
evenness
and
excitement
of
the
match
might
easily
be
overshadowed
by
the
winning
goal
.
</s>
<s>
Though
the
shot
totals
were
not
high
-
Argentina
had
five
shots
on
target
to
Mexico
's
three
-
the
action
was
end
to
end
.

Part
of
the
reason
for
the
excitement
was
while
Mexico
tried
to
keep
a
fast
attacking
pace
Argentina
attempted
to
slow
the
game
down
.
</s>
<s>
There
could
have
been
more
goals

both
Argentina
and
Mexico
defended
well
and
had
timely
saves
from
their
goalkeepers

<p>

Mexico
got
off
to
the
best
possible
start

a
goal

five
minutes

Pavel
Pardo

cross
from

half
volley
at
the
far

For
Argentina
the
equalising
goal
five
minutes
later
was
the
best
possible
response

A
corner
kick
was
swung
in
low
to
the
near
post
;
Hernan
Crespo
raised
his
foot
,
Jared
Borgetti
stuck
out
his
neck

between
them
the
ball
sped
past
Sanchez

The
match
had
its
moment

controversy

Just
before
half
time
the
Argentine
goalkeeper
rolled
a
ball
to
Gabriel
Heinze

Somehow
his
defender
let
it
go
past
him
to
Mexican
striker
Jose
Fonseca

Heinze
lunged

bring
Fonseca
down

<s>
Massimo
Busacca
adjudged
Roberto
Ayala
to
be
the
last
defender

spared
Heinze
the
red
card
for
the
deliberate
professional
foul
.

On
53
minutes
Roberto

saved

defensive
a
clearance
that
deflected
off
Borgetti
six
yards
from

</s>
<s>
Five
minutes
later
Javier
Saviola
was
through
on
goal

he
went
high
and
hard
with
the
shot
but
Sanchez
stuck
out
a
strong
left
palm
and
batted
the
ball
away
for
a
corner

Lionel

Crespo

Saviola

A
minute
from
time
Tevez
thought
he
was
through
on
goal
but
Ricardo
Osorio
got
back
just
in
time

the
game
was
destined
for
another
30
minutes

that
special
moment
in
