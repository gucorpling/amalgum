For
a
moment
Ned
and
Mr.
Damon
gazed
at
the
farmer
in
his
rattletrap
of
an
auto
,
and
then
they
looked
at
the
fluttering
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
.

Thence
their
gaze
traveled
to
the
ragged
and
barefoot
lad
sitting
beside
the
farmer
.

<p>

&quot;
I

it

Without
asking
any
more
questions
,
reserving
them
until
they
knew
more
about
the
matter
,
Mr.
Damon
and
Ned
each
reached
out
a
hand
for
the
paper
the
farmer
held
.
</s>
<s>
The
latter
handed
it
to
Ned
,
being
nearest
him
,
and
at
a
sight
of
the
handwriting
the
young
bank
clerk
exclaimed
:

off

I
was
lookin

I
went
past
an

There
was
n't
nobody
in

place

as
far
as
I
knowed
,

all
at
once
I
heard
some
one
yell
,
and
then
I
seen
something
white
,
like
a
bird
,
sail
out
of
a
high
window
.

I

paused

</p>
<p>

&quot;
Well
,
after
a
while
I
went
to
where
the
white
thing
lay
,

I
picked
it
up

I
seen
it
was
a
piece

paper

brick

did
you
go

&quot;
Ned
queried

No

&quot;
He
come

as
soon

No.

I

the

letter

I
knowed

Shopton

I
'd
never
been

tradin

I
had
to
stop

ask

road

&quot;
We

he
mentioned

We

we
get
there

It

&quot;
Waal

said
the
farmer

a
bit
put
out
by
the
criticism

&quot;
But
I
figgered
it
would
be
better

look
up
this
young
man

friends

let
them
do
the
rescuin
'
,

not
lose
no
time

it

about

far

it

is
this
