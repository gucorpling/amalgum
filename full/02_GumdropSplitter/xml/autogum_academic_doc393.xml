This
study
aimed
to
describe
the
growth
of
research
publications
regarding
interventions
for
childhood
overweight
and
obesity
and
to
understand
the
current
research
landscape
by
grouping
publications
according
to
similarities
in
the
topic
areas
being
researched
.
</s>
<s>
By
quantifying
the
scientometrics
profile
of
publications
,
it
is
evident
that
over
time
,
there
has
been
a
gradual
increase
in
the
publication
of
research
related
to
interventions
and
treatments
for
children
with
obesity
.
</s>
<s>
Applying
the
LDA
technique
,
we
found
that
the
number
of
publications
related
to
school
and
community-based
intervention
has
increased
over
the
period
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
the
results
highlighted
the
importance
of
research
support
in
lower-middle-income
countries
(
LMICs
)
,
especially
,
where
the
prevalence
of
childhood
obesity
has
been
increased
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Unsurprisingly
,
the
majority
of
the
research
related
to
interventions
and
treatment
for
childhood
obesity
was
conducted
in
the
United
States
.
</s>
<s>
India
and
China
were
the
two
lower-middle-income
countries
that
appeared
the
most
in
the
abstracts
(
Table
2
)
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
it
should
be
noticed
that
the
majority
of
children
with
overweight
and
obesity
live
in
lower-setting
countries
,
where
the
rates
are
rising
faster
than
in
high-income
countries
.
</s>
<s>
The
possible
causes
of
this
are
various
,
including
the
Western
diet
,
the
low
activity
level
,
or
regarding
the
cultural
perspective
,
where
obesity
means
beauty
,
better
health
,
power
,
and
higher
socioeconomic
status
.
</s>
<s>
Each
LMIC
needs
to
investigate
the
causes
of
this
phenomenon
due
to
the
difference
in
the
contextual
background
.
</s>
<s>
Yet
,
due
to
the
limitation
in
research
funding
and
facilities
,
human
resources
,
or
communication
,
the
contextualized
evidence
might
not
be
found
in
the
short
term
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
LMICs
might
benefit
from
the
active
research
collaboration
with
developed
countries
or
countries
in
the
same
region
,
such
as
India
and
China
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
By
applying
our
proposed
approach
,
the
combination
of
scientometrics
and
content
analysis
,
the
present
study
has
identified
that
there
has
been
a
wealth
of
research
conducted
globally
focusing
on
the
development
of
the
pharmacotherapeutic
,
family-based
,
school-based
,
and
community-based
interventions
,
especially
in
the
last
five
years
.
</s>
<s>
Meanwhile
,
seemingly
unidimensional
approaches
,
such
as
diet
or
nutrition-related
interventions
,
have
reduced
.
</s>
<s>
This
suggests
a
definite
shift
in
research
towards
multifaceted
intervention
and
treatment
approaches
,
particularly
those
that
focus
on
children
’s
immediate
environments
.
</s>
<s>
Besides
,
our
studies
found
that
13.3
%
of
the
total
papers
mentioned
pharmacotherapeutic
interventions
and
related
chronic
conditions
.
</s>
<s>
Pharmacotherapy
is
recommended
as
a
combination
method
when
lifestyle
intervention
and
support
from
a
specialist
alone
are
not
enough
due
to
extreme
excess
weight
and
related
chronic
conditions
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
this
method
should
be
carefully
applied
under
the
supervision
of
health
staff
due
to
some
side-effects
this
may
cause
to
health
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
findings
suggest
some
implications
for
designing
interventions
,
health
research
,
and
policy
.
</s>
<s>
The
number
of
articles
related
to
the
treatment
and
intervention
in
poor-resource
countries
were
not
high
compared
with
that
of
high-income
countries
;
meanwhile
,
the
prevalence
of
obesity
and
overweight
in
those
settings
is
increasing
.
</s>
<s>
These
countries
should
actively
collaborate
with
other
developed
countries
and
countries
in
the
same
region
(
either
through
their
own
government
or
through
the
support
of
neighboring/higher-income
countries
)
in
order
to
combat
their
rising
rates
of
overweight
and
obesity
.
</s>
<s>
Health
system
strengthening
and
capacity
building
,
especially
in
developing
countries
,
will
remain
as
core
components
of
international
and
national
strategies
.
</s>
<s>
The
developed
countries
might
note
the
increasing
number
in
the
publication
regarding
the
interventions
and
treatment
of
childhood
obesity
.
</s>
<s>
Further
research
needs
to
be
done
to
find
the
most
effective
strategies
of
intervention
,
and
treatment
of
childhood
obesity
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Some
limitations
should
be
acknowledged
.
</s>
<s>
Firstly
,
the
Web
of
Sciences
was
the
only
database
used
in
the
analysis
.
</s>
<s>
There
is
a
likelihood
the
low-impact
journals
,
which
publish
articles
from
the
developing
countries
,
are
not
being
included
in
the
WOS
database
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
that
may
not
reflect
the
development
of
publications
on
interventions
among
children
with
obesity
in
developing
countries
.
</s>
<s>
Future
research
should
consider
expanding
to
other
databases
to
cover
the
larger
number
of
publications
,
which
contributes
more
meaningful
knowledge
to
the
research
field
.
</s>
<s>
Secondly
,
the
language
of
selected
papers
was
restricted
to
only
English
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
there
were
only
121
papers
in
other
languages
,
which
was
a
quite
small
number
compared
with
the
total
number
of
papers
associated
with
overweight
and
obesity
in
children
and
youth
.
</s>
<s>
Finally
,
only
titles
and
abstracts
were
used
in
the
content
analysis
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
by
quantifying
different
layers
of
information
(
documents
by
years
,
citation
,
and
countries
where
studies
conducted
)
and
applying
an
advanced
analytic
technique
,
the
Latent
Dirichlet
Allocation
for
titles
and
abstracts
analysis
,
we
could
discover
the
trend
and
hidden
themes
of
the
research
studies
.
