Internal
combustion
engines
(
ICE
)
are
the
main
propulsion
systems
in
road
transport
.
</s>
<s>
In
mid-2017
,
Serrano
referred
to
the
impossibility
of
replacing
them
as
the
power
plant
in
most
vehicles
.
</s>
<s>
Nowadays
,
this
statement
is
true
even
when
considering
the
best
growth
scenario
for
all-electric
and
hybrid
vehicles
.
</s>
<s>
The
arguments
supporting
this
position
consider
the
growing
demand
for
transport
,
the
strong
development
of
cleaner
and
more
efficient
ICEs
,
the
availability
of
fossil
fuels
,
and
the
high
energy
density
of
said
conventional
fuels
.
</s>
<s>
Overall
,
there
seems
to
be
strong
arguments
to
support
the
medium-long-term
viability
of
ICEs
as
the
predominant
power
plant
for
road
transport
applications
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
situation
has
changed
dramatically
in
the
last
few
years
.
</s>
<s>
The
media
and
other
market
players
are
claiming
the
death
of
ICEs
in
the
mid-term
.
</s>
<s>
Politicians
from
several
G7
countries
,
such
as
France
,
Spain
,
and
the
United
Kingdom
,
have
announced
the
prohibition
of
ICEs
in
their
markets
,
in
some
cases
,
as
early
as
2040
.
</s>
<s>
Large
cities
,
such
London
,
Paris
,
Madrid
,
and
Berlin
,
are
also
considering
severe
limits
to
ICE-powered
vehicles

What
Is
the
Problem
with
ICE
(
Internal

</head>
<p>
<s>
The
media
’s
arguments
against
ICEs
range
from
the
need
to
reduce
CO2
emissions
(
global
warming
)
to
the
need
to
improve
the
air
quality
in
cities
(
NOx
and
particulate
matter
emissions
)
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Much
of
this
debate
about
the
future
of
ICEs
has
arisen
from
the
Dieselgate
scandal
.
</s>
<s>
A
horrible
wrong
decision
from
a
management
and
engineering
point
of
view
at
a
specific
time
and
place
has
generated
a
worldwide
butterfly
effect
in
the
automotive
industry
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
making
the
problem
a
virtue
,
Dieselgate
has
forced
new
regulations
to
obtain
much
more
efficient
and
cleaner
ICEs
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
As
commonly
takes
place
,
old
and
lax
pollutant
regulations
have
now
resulted
in
a
pendular
effect
toward
radically
contrary
positions
,
delighting
the
media
and
generating
excessive
political
reactions
without
a
clear
scientific
basis

All
this

reflected

the
look

publish
a
sufficiently
popular
or
good
news
novelty

<s>
We
could
define
the
situation
as
energy
populism

</s>
<s>
Although
new
regulations
that
force
ICE
technology
to
be
more
environmentally
friendly
must
always
be
welcome
,
prohibitions
motivated
by
a
poor
diagnosis
of
the
situation
will
not
help
at
all
,
neither
to
improve
air
quality
nor
to
mitigate

Combining

a

After
all
,
one
might
ask
if
the
use

propulsive
systems
over
120
years
was
the

path

How
can
such
an
old
concept
be
innovative
?
How
can
the
ICE
be
great
and
technologically
advanced
at
burning
fossil

</s>
<s>
An
easy
but
wrong
conclusion
comes
without
the
need
of
reflection
:
Let
us
welcome
“
new
electric
motors
and
batteries
”
in
zero-emission
cars
!
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
bad
news
is
that
energy
is
neither
created
nor
destroyed
,
only
transformed
.
</s>
<s>
Electric
motors
and
batteries
are
not
new
,
nor
are
they
clean
and
,
in
general
,
are
not
free
from
problems
.
</s>
<s>
One
can
directly
identify
two
relevant
problems
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
first
problem
is
that
vehicle
propulsion
involves
energy
transformations
and
the
electric
motor
does
not
use
a
primary
energy
source
but
an
energy
vector
.
</s>
<s>
Although
public
opinion
has
a
clear
idea
of
how
some
processes
like
friction
can
negatively
affect
transport
applications
,
the
understanding
of
the
impact
of
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
is
limited
.
</s>
<s>
The
problem
is
that
electricity
must
be
produced
,
most
usually
from
non-renewable
energy
sources
,
which
equals
around
60
%
in
energy
losses
,
and
then
transported
,
which
adds
20
%
of
additional
losses
.
</s>
<s>
Unfortunately
,
renewable
sources
are
barely
10
%
of
the
global
energy
mix
,
as
observed

a
medium-term
forecast
of
significant
increase

</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
some
countries
like
the
USA
,
China
,
Russia
,
Poland
,
South
Korea
,
or
Germany
,
fossil
fuels
,
including
a
good
percentage
of
coal
,
remain
the
largest
source
of
energy
as
a
raw
material
for
electricity
production
.
</s>
<s>
In
a
first
approach
,
the
only
G8
country
with
real
alternatives
to
CO2-emitting
technologies
is
France
due
to
its
continued
commitment
with
nuclear
energy
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
with
the
current
energy
mix
and
with
an
analysis
of
the
complete
life
cycle
,
the
so-called
analysis
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
,
the
alternative
to
electric
motors
will
not
eliminate
global
CO2
emissions
.
