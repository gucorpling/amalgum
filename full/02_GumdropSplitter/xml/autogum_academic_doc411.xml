Recent
publications
have
explicitly
noted
a
lapse
in
knowledge
on
several
facets
of
vector
ecology
,
such
as
the
relationships
between
environmental
factors
and
disease
ecology
,
vector-host
interactions
and
virus
ecology
,
and
a
disparity
in
findings
that
precipitation
positively
or
negatively
correlates
to
human
infection
with
WNV
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
becoming
apparent
that
the
net
difference
in
vectorial
capacity
must
be
determined
by
understanding
both
the
ecological
effects
and
altered
biological
components
of
the
vector
.
An
improved
understanding
of
how
environmental
effects
,
heat
,
cold
,
and
dehydration
directly
affect
mosquito
physiology
should
be
emphasized
in
future
research
.

Specific
attention
should
be
placed
on
understanding
the
underlying
components
that
are
associated

stress
response
and
compensatory
mechanisms
that

biological

Rapid
dehydration
prompts
similar

thermal
stress

slower
dehydration
results
in
altered
trehalose
synthesis
in
other
fly
systems

is
a
major
blood
sugar
in
flies
,
and
it

its
desiccation-resistant
properties

Interestingly
,
dehydration
prompts
an
increase

These

desiccation

(

the
outcome
of

infection
with
arthropod-borne
disease

partially
dependent

the
metrics

ecological
consequences
of
the

As

Interestingly

Although

Stressors
,
such

starvation

</s>
<s>
Theoretically
,
these
stressors
(
disregarding
insecticide
exposure
)
have
acted
upon
mosquitoes
for
over
150
million
years
,
in
such
time
,
mosquitoes
have
become
exceptionally
efficient
vectors
for
a
plethora

</s>
<s>
Mosquitoes
still
possess
the
ability
to
establish
insecticide
resistance
and
persist
although
mosquito
control
methods
have
existed
for
less
than
a
millionth
of
that
time
.
</s>
<s>
It
may
be
—
through
inherent
susceptibilities
,
recurrent
exposure
,
and
conserved
responses
to
stressors
—
that
mosquitoes
have
developed
an
exceptional
ability
to
adapt
and
overcome
stress
.
</s>
<s>
These
adaptive
abilities
are
of
great
concern
regarding
insecticide
application
,
but
also
provide
a
unique
opportunity
to
study
how
mosquitoes
respond
to
a
relatively
new
stressor
in
reference
to
preexisting
stressors

</p>
<p>

Over
time
,
the
selective
pressures

resistance

are
prompted
by
pesticide
administration
begin
to
place
the
success
of
control
programs
at
risk

where
more
than
half
of

decade

By
researching
both
insecticide
and
conserved
stress
responses

mosquitoes

novel
strategies
