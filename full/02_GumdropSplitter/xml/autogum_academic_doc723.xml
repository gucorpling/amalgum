On
the
basis
of
previous
research
,
we
now
discuss
the
definitions
of
success
and
failure
and
how
to
measure
them
.
</s>
<s>
The
number
and
variety
of
recent
IT
services
provide
many
cases
where
success
and
failure
can
be
clearly
determined
,
whereas
it
is
difficult
to
make
individual
assessments
uniformly
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
when
determining
the
success
or
failure
of
IT
services
through
participants
using
a
questionnaire
,
the
constructs
were
measured
considering
the
mean
and
using
t-tests
to
determine
any
significant
difference
between
the
groups
investigated
within
this
study
.

Three
subjective
evaluation
factors
(
i.
e.
,
interests
established
by
the
research
hypothesis
,
ecosystem
establishment
,
and
technology
completeness
)
for
merchant
and
two-sided
models
,
which
are
separated
from
service
and
platform
businesses
,
were
applied
to
success
and
failure
analyses
via
logistic
regression
of
four
objective
evaluation
factors
(
i.
e.
,
scale
of
companies
examined
separately
,
PC
interworking
,
consumer

<s>
For
this
study
,
a
total
of
98
cases
of
ICT
convergence
were
obtained
from
65
ICT
experts
from
17
February
to
18
February
,
2018
.

<s>
Of
these
98
cases
,
46
were
cases
of
success
,
and
52
were
cases
of
failure

<s>
These
ICT
convergence
cases
were
re-classified
as
global
and
regional
releases
and
were
selected
as
original
Korean
IT
services
.
</s>
<s>
The
final
22
IT
service
cases
,
as
Table
1
shows
,
were
selected
by
removing
services
that
were
too
old
to
be
independently
verified
and
whereby
system
units
were
difficult
to
evaluate
individually
for
success
and
failure
factors
(
see
Appendix
A
and
Appendix
D
for
detailed
information
of
the
22
IT
service
cases
)
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
Furthermore
,
although
some
of
the
services
within
the
sample
were
well
known
in
the
market
via
advertising
and
media
coverage
,
in
some
cases
,
the
services
were
unfamiliar
due
to
the
fact
they
had
originated
from
start-ups
.

<s>
Additionally
,
in
attempting
to
choose
appropriate
cases
for
analysis
,
the
final
selection
of
services
was
not
performed
on
a
purely
market
recognition
basis
.
</s>
<s>
Instead
,
the
services
were
chosen
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
they
were
established
through
an
application

with
some
in
the
process
of
expanding
their
service
functionality
through
PC-based
platforms

Survey

A
survey
was
submitted
to
entrepreneurs
who
had
experience
in
similar
fields
of
this
study
and
who
showed
an
interest
in
creating
their
own
IT
start-up
.
</s>
<s>
To
assist
participants
who
were
lacking
awareness
of
IT
services
,
the
survey
introduced
each
service
and
their
assessments
of
success
and
failure
.
</s>
<s>
By
displaying
these
descriptions
of
the
IT
services
,
we
were
able
to
increase
the
understanding
by
introducing
a
detailed
overview
of
the
business
models
and
operating
methods
for
each
service
selected
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
we
introduced
detailed
cases
,
demos
,
and
competitive
services
to
participants
when
they
were
unfamiliar
with
the
presented
service
.
</s>
<s>
Individual
surveys
conducted
simultaneously
led
to
a
seven-point
evaluation
of
a
total
of
three
categories
:
establishing
interests
selected
as
factors
for
success
and
failure
of
mobile
IT
services
for
this
study
;
establishing
ecosystems
;
and
completing
technologies
.
</s>
<s>
A
pre-arranged
questionnaire
containing
survey
items
separated
into
each
service
was
distributed
to
the
participants
.
</s>
<s>
The
survey
participants
’
successes
and
failures
were
subsequently
judged
,
and
,
with
the
survey
items
,
the
participants
were
asked
to
list
factors
of
success
and
failure
for
the
services
they
chose
.
</s>
<s>
When
introducing
each
service
,
the
results
of
separate
judgments
about
success
and
failure
were
not
considered
,
so
that
the
actual
operational
results
would
not
be
reflected
in
the
survey
results
of
the
participants
