<s>
One
way
we
can
really
address
this
is
through
a
series
of
laws
,
and
perhaps
,
one
day
,
constitutional
amendments
,
which
would
truly
limit
Congress
in
their
ability
to
spend
,
create
and
maintain
programs
,
and
pass
new
laws
and
regulations
.

<p>
<s>
Congress
does
n't
read
their
bills
and
they
frequently
pass
these
long
un-read
bills
with
little
or
no
time
to
review
them
.
</s>
<s>
We
have
proposed
the
Read
the
Bills
Act
to
remedy
that
problem
.
</s>
<s>
The
Read
the
Bills
Act
has
the
added
benefit
of
requiring
Congress
to
post
their
bills
online
for
reporters
,
watchdog
groups
,
and
every
day
citizens
to
be
able
to
read
for
seven
days
before
the
final
vote
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Because
we
realized
that
to
get
around
the
Read
the
Bills
Act
,
Congress
might
cheat
,
abbreviate
their
proposals
,
and
just
delegate
the
nitty-gritty
details
into
the
hands
of
unelected
bureaucrats
who
are
n't
accountable
to
the
people
,
we
proposed
the
Write
the
Laws
Act
.
</s>
<s>
An
elected
Congress
should
sweat
the
details
and
then
be
accountable
to
their
constituents
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Congress
also
violates
the
rules
of
your
high
school
government
class
,
where
you
were
told
it
took
a
majority
to
pass
a
law
.
</s>
<s>
Congress
simply
combines
bad
proposals
that
would
n't
stand
on
their
own
,
like
the
Real
ID
Act
(
which
should
be
repealed
)
,
into
bills
that
are
certain
to
pass
,
such
as
a
troop
appropriation
bill
.
</s>
<s>
To
deal
with
that
problem
we
presented
the
One
Subject
at
a
Time
Act

<p>

And
in
the
future
,
we
'll
call

follow

own
accounting
and
reporting
rules
for
the
private
sector
,
ala
Sarbanes-Oxley

and
a
sunset
provision
requiring
all
taxes
and
programs
to
come
up
for
a
vote
for
re-authorization

with
the
requirement

they

it

Nearly
everyone

pass
bills
one
subject

a
time
