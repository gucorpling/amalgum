You
can
have
a
career

financial
stability
,
be
subjectively
attractive
,
fit
,
have
enough
hobbies
to
make
you
a
well-rounded
person
,
be
social
,
put
yourself
in
environments
where
you
'd
think
you
'd
meet
someone

join
all
the
dating
sites

use
all
the

still

nothing

I
'm
halfway
through
my
30s
now
,
and
the
spot
I
'm
in
is
where
it
's
like
of
course
I
want
to
meet
someone
,
but
at
this
age
,
I
get
easily
exhausted
at
the
thought
of
putting
in
a
ton
of
effort
only
to
realize
there
's
usually
little
to
no
reward
in
it
pertaining
to
resolving
my
dating
life
.

It
's
almost
as
if
there
's
more
unnecessary
stress
and
less
courtesy
when
all
you
're
trying
to
be
is
a
human
trying
to
genuinely
connect
with
another
human
.

<s>
This
is
not
being
pessimistic
either
,
but
just
a
fact
of
how
eventually
dating
wears
me
out
easily
at
this
stage
.

I
have
friends
where
the
process
has
been
pretty
easy

either

One
friend
of
mine
who
is
a
girl
who
never
dated
in
her
entire
life
until
two
years
ago
signed
up
for
Match
and
met
a
guy
within
two
months

They
're
living
together

happy

Another
friend
of
mine
married
a
girl
who
accidentally
messaged
him
on
facebook
because
he
had
the
same
name
as
a
former
college
friend
of
hers
,
and
one
thing
led
to
another

That
sort

easy

effortless
strike

luck
<hi rend="bold">
never

happens
to
me

<s>
I
still
put
myself
on
dating
sites
every
now
and
then
without
expecting
much
,
and
always
look
for
opportunities
out
there
in
the
real
world
to
potentially
be
introduced
to
someone
new
,
yet
I
would
be
lying
if
I
did
n't
say
there
's
also
those
nights
where
I
see
that
things
are
n't
changing
,
I
get
tired
by
that
thought
,
and
really
do
n't
care
