As

Hustler

case
to
this
case

I
think
the

application

fair

Parody

satire
are
protected
forms

free

On
September
29
,
2009
,
your
lawyer
Marc
Randazza
requested
that
Glenn
Beck
agree
to
stipulate
to
the
application
of
the
United
States
Constitution
,
and
also
especially
to
the
First
Amendment
to
the
U.S.
Constitution
.
</s>
<s>
In
an
October
19
interview
with
<hi rend="italic">
Wikinews
</hi>
,
Randazza
said
that
Beck
had
not
responded
to
this
request
.
</s>
<s>
Why
do
you
think
Beck
chose
not
to
stipulate
to
the
U.S.
Constitution
and
the
First
Amendment
in
this
case
?
</s>
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
<s>
E-H
</hi>
:
</s>
<s>
I
think
Beck
knew
that
doing
so
would
hurt
his
case
.
</s>
<s>
The
rights
of
free
speech
we
enjoy
in
the
United
States
are
broader
than
in
some
other
countries
.
</s>
<s>
WIPO
,
being
an
international
organization
,
could
well
have
assigned
an
arbitrator
from
a
country
that
does
n't
protect
speech
as
strongly
as
we
do
.
</s>
<s>
And
WIPO
,
not
being
bound
by
the
U.S.
Constitution
,
might
not
choose
to
consider
the
strong
protections
we
have
in
rendering
their
decision
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
We
also
felt
it
was
ironic
that
Glenn
Beck
,
who
is
on
record
as
being
against
an
international
body
making
judgments
that
might
overrule
the
U.S.
Constitution
,
would
himself
choose
to
use
an
international
body
to
try
and
stifle
speech
that
would
be
protected
under
the
U.S.
Constitution
.
</s>
<s>
So
ultimately
,
you
could
say
we
were
trying
to
help
him
retain
the
patriotic
image
he
has
worked
to
hard
to
present
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Ultimately
,
the
arbitrator
applied
the
First
Amendment
anyhow
.
</s>
<s>
We
felt
that
in
sending
that
letter
,
we
would
give
Beck
a
chance
to
show
that
his
purported
support
for
the
constitution
was
real
.
</s>
<s>
His
failure
to
respond
shows
everyone
that
he
is
full
of
shit
.
