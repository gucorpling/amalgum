This
study
examined
whether
the
combined
administration
of
6.0
g
of
glycine
and
0.4
g
of
tryptophan
suppressed
the
elevation
in
serum
uric
acid
levels
induced
by
purine
ingestion
and
increased
urinary
uric
acid
excretion
.
</s>
<s>
The
amino
acid
doses
used
for
single
ingestion
were
based
on
those
used
in
continual
supplementation
.
</s>
<s>
Both
glycine
and
tryptophan
are
present
in
dietary
proteins
that
are
ingested
in
normal
daily
living
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
glycine
at
doses
of
up
to
90
g
per
day
administered
over
several
weeks
were
reported
no
serious
adverse
effects
.
</s>
<s>
The
oral
administration
of
up
to
5.0
g
of
l-tryptophan
per
day
did
not
lead
to
any
adverse
effects
in
young
adult
females
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
no
adverse
effects
were
attributed
to
the
combined
administration
of
glycine
and
tryptophan
in
the
current
trial
.
</s>
<s>
This
study
confirmed
the
safety
of
combined
glycine
and
tryptophan
supplementation
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
current
study
demonstrated
that
the
combined
administration
of
glycine
and
tryptophan
significantly
suppressed
the
elevation
in
the
serum
uric
acid
levels
caused
by
purine
ingestion
in
healthy
subjects
.
</s>
<s>
The
effect
of
the
combined
amino
acid
administration
was
stronger
than
that
of
the
same
glycine
dose
alone
,
indicating
that
a
small
amount
of
tryptophan
provides
an
additional
benefit
to
glycine
alone
in
reducing
the
elevation
in
the
serum
uric
acid
levels
after
the
ingestion
of
dietary
purines
.

<s>
In
agreement
with
previous
reports
,
glycine
increased
urinary
uric
acid
excretion
and
enhanced
urate
clearance
in
the
current
study
.
</s>
<s>
The
authors
previously
reported
that
continual
supplementation
with
glycine
and
tryptophan
led
to
an
increase
in
urinary
pH
.
</s>
<s>
Glycine
exhibits
a
buffering
action
and
it
is
often
used
as
an
antacid
.
</s>
<s>
The
water
solubility
of
uric
acid
increases
with
increasing
pH
levels
and
uric
acid
excretion
is
more
favorable
in
alkaline
urine
than
in
acidic
urine
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
it
is
possible
that
the
elevation
in
urinary
pH
caused
by
glycine
and
tryptophan
supplementation
enhanced
the
solubility
of
urinary
uric
acid
,
thereby
elevating
urinary
uric
acid
excretion
and
urate
clearance
.

<s>
Previous
studies
provide
physiological
,
physicochemical
and
clinical
validation
for
the
use
of
citrate
salt
in
the
treatment
of
some
types
of
lithiasis

</s>
<s>
Citrate
salts
treatment
substantially
increased
urinary
pH
in
patients
with
uric
acid
lithiasis
,
however
,
there
was
no
significant
change
in
the
amount
of
urinary
uric
acid

</s>
<s>
The
mixture
of
amino
acids
might
be
superior
to
citrate
salts
in
the
prevention
or
treatment
of
hyperuricemia
.
</s>
<s>
Herein
,
although
the
elevation
of
urinary
pH
induced
by
the
ingestion
of
glycine
alone
was
not
significant
compared
with
the
effects
of
placebo
,
glycine
administration
enhanced
uric
acid
excretion
and
urate
clearance
,
raising
the
possibility
of
other
mechanisms

Urate
transporter
1

URAT1
)

a
primary
reabsorptive
urate
transporter
that
is
targeted
by
pyrazinamide
,

disables
glycine-induced
uricosuria

</s>
<s>
Pyrazinamide
may
reflect
the
enhanced
urate
reabsorption
following
the
exchange
of
its
active
metabolite
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
glycine
may
inhibit
the
reabsorptive
action
of
uric
acid
,
which
is
induced
by
URAT1
.
</s>

Further
studies
are
needed
to
elucidate
the
action
of
glycine
on
URAT1
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
In
the
current
study
,
the
supplementation
with
tryptophan
alone
had
no
influence
on
urinary
pH
,
urinary
uric
acid
excretion
or
urate
clearance
.
</s>
<s>
As
the
effect
of
tryptophan
on
URAT1
might
be
structurally
difficult
,
tryptophan
might
have
exerted
an
indirect
action
against
uric
acid
elevation
via
its
influence
on
the
action
of
glycine
.
</s>
<s>
Specifically
,
tryptophan
might
promote
the
direct
action
of
glycine
against
uric
acid
elevation
.
</s>
<s>
The
maximum
serum
levels
of
glycine
and
tryptophan
are
achieved
within
an
hour
of
ingestion
,
which
is
followed
by
rapid
decreases
as
the
amino
acids
are
metabolized
.
</s>
<s>
Glycine
metabolizes
various
end-products
,
namely
glutathione
,
nucleic
acid
bases
,
heme
,
creatine
and
bile
acids
.
</s>
<s>
The
increases
in
urinary
creatinine
excretion
and
creatinine
clearance
following
the
glycine
challenge
suggest
that
glycine
might
be
partially
absorbed
back
and
metabolized
to
creatinine
through
creatine
.
</s>
<s>
Conversely
,
these
urinary
parameters
did
not
change
in
response
to
the
simultaneous
supplementation
with
glycine
and
tryptophan
,
suggesting
the
suppression
of
the
conversion
of
glycine
to
creatinine
by
tryptophan
.
</s>
<s>
In
fact
,
the
increases
in
the
serum
glycine/creatinine
ratio
and
urinary
glycine
excretion
were
more
pronounced
in
response
to
supplementation
with
glycine
and
tryptophan
than
with
glycine
alone
.
</s>
<s>
Further
studies
are
required
to
clarify
the
mechanism
underlying
the
contribution
of
tryptophan
to
the
effects
of
glycine
on
uric
acid
excretion
.

</p>
<p>

Among
the
limitations
in
the
current
clinical
study
,
the
modest
sample
size
(
<hi rend="italic">
n

)
might
have
reduced
the
statistical
power
and
increased
the
risk
of
type
II
error
,
particularly
regarding
the
statistical
differences
in
multiple
comparisons
between
the
glycine
and
glycine
+
tryptophan
groups
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
the
current
study
included
only
male
subjects
because
of
the
known
effects
of
sex
differences
on
serum
uric
acid
levels
.
</s>
<s>
Further
studies
are
therefore
needed
,
although
our
preliminary
findings
suggested
that
there
were
no
effective
differences
between
males
and
females
in
response
to
glycine
and
tryptophan
supplementation
(
data
not
shown
