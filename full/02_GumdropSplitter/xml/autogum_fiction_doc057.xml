They
say
,
you
are
a
spot
among
Christians
;
and
that
religion
fareth
the
worse
for
your
ungodly
conversation
;
that
some
have
already
stumbled
at
your
wicked
ways
,
and
that
more
are
in
danger
of
being
destroyed
thereby
;
your
religion
,
and
an
ale-house
,
and
covetousness
,
and
uncleanness
,
and
swearing
,
and
lying
,
and
vain-company
keeping

The
proverb
is
true
of
you
which
is
said
of
a
whore
,
to
wit
,
that
she
is
a
shame
to
all
women
;
so
are
you
a
shame
to
all

Since
you
are
ready
to
take
up
reports
and
to
judge
so
rashly
as
you
do
,
I
cannot
but
conclude
you
are
some
peevish
or
melancholy
man
,
not
fit
to
be
discoursed
with
;
and
so
adieu

Then
came
up
Christian
,
and
said
to
his
brother
,
I
told
you
how
it
would
happen
:
your
words
and
his
lusts
could
not
agree
;
he
had
rather
leave
your
company
than
reform
his
life
.
</s>
<s>
But
he
is
gone
,
as
I
said
;
let
him
go
,
the
loss
is
no
man
's
but
his
own
;
he
has
saved
us
the
trouble
of
going
from
him
;
for
he
continuing
(
as
I
suppose
he
will
do
)
as
he
is
,
he
would
have
been
but
a
blot
in
our
company
:
besides
,
the
apostle
says
,
&quot;
From
such
withdraw
thyself
.

But
I
am
glad
we
had
this
little
discourse
with
him
;
it
may
happen
that
he
will
think
of
it
again
:
however
,
I
have
dealt
plainly
with
him
,
and
so
am
clear
of
his
blood
,
if
he
perisheth

You
did
well
to
talk
so
plainly
to
him
as
you
did
;
there
is
but
little
of
this
faithful
dealing
with
men
now-a-days
,
and
that
makes
religion
to
stink
so
in
the
nostrils
of
many
,
as
it
doth
;
for
they
are
these
talkative
fools
whose
religion
is
only
in
word
,
and
are
debauched
and
vain
in
their
conversation
,
that
(
being
so
much
admitted
into
the
fellowship
of
the
godly
)
do
puzzle
the
world
,
blemish
Christianity
,
and
grieve
the
sincere
.
</s>
<s>
I
wish
that
all
men
would
deal
with
such
as
you
have
done
:
then
should
they
either
be
made
more
conformable
to
religion
,
or
the
company
of
saints
would
be
too
hot
for
them

did
Faithful

How
Talkative
at
first
lifts
up
his
plumes

How
bravely
doth
he
speak
!

<s>
How
he
presumes
To
drive
down
all
before
him
!
</s>
<s>
But
so
soon
As
Faithful
talks
of
heart-work
,
like
the
moon
That
's
past
the
full

into
the
wane
he
goes

And
so
will
all

he
that
HEART-WORK
knows

<p>

{

Thus
they
went
on
talking
of
what
they
had
seen
by
the
way
,
and
so
made
that
way
easy
which
would
otherwise
,
no
doubt
,
have
been
tedious
to
them
;
for
now
they
went
through
a
wilderness
.

<p>

{

Now
,
when
they
were
got
almost
quite
out
of
this
wilderness
,
Faithful
chanced
to
cast
his
eye
back
,
and
espied
one
coming
after
them
,
and
he
knew
him
.
Oh
!
said
Faithful
to
his
brother
,
who
comes
yonder
?

Then
Christian
looked
,
and
said
,
It
is
my

Ay
,
and
my
good
friend
too

said
Faithful

it
was
he
that
set
me
in

way
to
the
gate

Now
was
Evangelist
come
up
to
them
,

thus
saluted
them
:

Then
Christian

told
him

had
happened

them
in

how
