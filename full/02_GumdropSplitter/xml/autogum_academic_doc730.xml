This
study
found
that
the
quality
of
an
online
shopping
logistics
service
influences
customer
satisfaction
,
which
drives
repeat

behavior
.
</s>
<s>
Five
hypotheses
were
established
to
represent
the
relationship
between
customer
satisfaction
and
each
factor
of
the
logistics
service
;
namely
,
quality
of
information
,
quality
of
order
,
quality
of
delivery
,
price
of
delivery
,
customer
service
,
and
customer
satisfaction
.

Each

from
a
sample
of
150

<s>
Chinese
customers
with
online
shopping
experience
was
sent
a
questionnaire
.
</s>
<s>
The
results
of
the
empirical
analysis
show
that
the
quality
of
a
logistics
service
has
a
statistically
significant
impact
on
customer
satisfaction
and
that
quality
of
delivery
is
the
main
factor
of
influence
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
the
results
show
that
customer
satisfaction
has
a
statistically
significant
impact
on
repeat

behavior
.
</s>
<s>
The
results
provide
insights
into
the
strategy
behind
China
’s
fast-growing
online
shopping
industry
,
which
focuses
on
maintaining
stability
through
long-term
customer
relationship
management
.
</s>
<s>
The
factors
affecting
customer

in
the

are
quality

quality

delivery
,
price

customer

In
conclusion
,
strategic

the

The
results
of
this
research
provide
various
theoretical
meanings
for
online
shopping
logistics
services
,
which
can
be
considered
for
empirical
analysis
.
</s>

This
,
in
turn
,
can
be
used
to
suggest
several
policies
and
solutions
to
assist
online
shopping
malls
in
establishing
customer-oriented
strategies
that
improve
quality
management
.

This
study
suggests
practical
semantics
to
direct
the
operations
and
management

to
effectively
pursue
customer-oriented

</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
implications
of
this
study
and
future
directions
for
research
are
as
follows
.
</s>
<s>
First
,
the
scale
of
online
shopping
in
China
is
increasing
gradually
.
</s>
<s>
Accordingly
,
the
number
of
Internet
users
is
increasing
.
</s>
<s>
China
joined
the
World
Trade
Organization
and
signed
a
free-trade
agreement
with
Korea
in
early
2016
,
and
,
thus
,
the
documented
information
related
to
the
Chinese
online
shopping
industry
is
important
for
businesses
attempting
to
enter
the
market
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Second
,
the
literature
on
the
logistics
services
of
online
shopping
is
insufficient
,
therefore
warranting
further
research
on
leading
variables
.
</s>
<s>
These
determinants
of
logistics
service
quality
were
found
to
yield
similar
results
to
the
factors
related
to
online
shopping
mall
success
as
well
as
the
factors
previously
related
to
service
quality
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
some
limitations
to
these
determinants
remain
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
future
,
various
determinant
factors
should
be
systematically
researched
and
analyzed
,
enabling
the
extraction
of
factors
constituting
logistics
service
quality
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Third
,
online
shopping
logistics
service
is
an
important
factor
in
competition
between
online
shopping
malls
.
</s>
<s>
Considering
that
the
cost
of
return
shipping
is
problematic
,
it
is
essential
that
this
topic
be
studied
further
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
To
extract
and
measure
the
determining
factors
of
logistics
service
quality
in
online
shopping
,
a
method
of
measurement
that
eliminates
subjectivity
must
be
developed
.

<s>
An
improved
measurement
index
for
customer
satisfaction
should
also
be
created

<p>

Fourth
,
the
prediction
by
the
2017
information
and
technology
(
IT
)
market
is
that
service
platforms
will
continuously
evolve
in
line
with
the
mobile
era
.
</s>
<s>
As
the
Chinese
market
transforms
,
many
mobile-based
online-to-offline
(
O2O
)
services
are
attracting
large-scale
investment
and
experiencing
rapid
growth

<p>

O2O
,
a

2017

market

converge
online

</s>
<s>
Based
on
ICT
,
O2O
attracts
customers
online

then
provides
them

offline

</s>
<s>
In
other
words
,
customers
purchase
products
and
services
online
,
and
the
actual

provided
offline

This
is

</p>
<p>
<s>
Many
countries
around

including
China

Korea
,
are
utilizing
O2O
services
that
serve
as
the
bridge
between
online
payment
and
offline
service
.
</s>
<s>
Examples
include
placing
an
order
for
food
delivery
,
reserving
a
taxi
,

As
O2O
services
grow
in
diversity

base

Future
studies
should
develop
indices

conduct
research
in

area

Lastly
,
due
to
the
small
sample
size

empirical
analysis

a
