Naturally
,
as
the
VAD
and
the
controller
are
implanted
in
humans
,
because
their
lifespan
depends
largely
on
the
suitability
of
the
pump
control
,
we
must
have
great
certainty
in
the
robustness
of
the
control
algorithms
.
</s>
<s>
Continuous
flow
for
VADs
may
allow
simulated
pulses
;
however
,
until
the
date
of
circulatory
assistance
,
despite
tolerance
to
left
ventricular
and
Pao
,
the
continuous
flow
rate
is
traditionally
of
a
medium
constant
rotation
,
which
always
decreases
the
pressure
pulse
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
These
types
of
devices
generally
require
precise
control
and
the
use
of
sensors
to
measure
flow
and
pressure
.
</s>
<s>
These
devices
are
not
reliable
,
owing
to
clinical
issues
such
as
routine
calibration
and
blood
clotting
.
</s>
<s>
These
concerns
regarding
the
reliability
of
implantable
sensors
have
led
to
the
search
for
non-invasive
,
sensorless
approaches
to
identifying
analog
cardiac
preload
.
</s>
<s>
We
now
believe
that
non-invasive
technology
has
advanced
to
a
level
where
it
can
be
considered
for
long-term
implantation
,
combined
with
sensorless
signals
,
to
form
a
robust
control
system
that
provides
physiological
behavior
to
RBPs
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
pulsatile
flow
pump
is
used
as
a
non-invasive
substitute
for
the
LV
filling
pressure
,
as
it
has
been
proven
to
be
closely
interrelated
.
</s>
<s>
The
pump
flow
pulsation
and
mean
flow
pump
used
in
the
current
controller
can
be
estimated
using
an
algorithm
for
flow
estimation
previously
established
in
our
laboratory
using
the
pump
speed
and
current
that
are
not
measured
invasively
.
</s>
<s>
The
current
control
approach
uses
flow
pulsatility
as
a
parameter
to
determine
the
required
flow
rate
compared
to
the
continuous
pulsatility
index
(
PI
)
control
strategy
,
which
regulates
PI
directly
at
a
specific
stage
.
</s>
<s>
This
allows
the
left
ventricle
to
automatically
adjust
the
RV
output
(
represented
by
the
increased
or
decreased
pump
pulsatility
)
,
thereby
decreasing
the
danger
of
suction
or
an
inefficient
pumping
aid
connected
to
improperly
defined
PI
target
values
.
</s>
<s>
The
optimal
target
PI
value
depends
on
heart
contractility
,
preload
,
and
afterload
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
methodology
of
this
work
is
proposed
to
evaluate
the
merits
of
a
full-state
feedback
control
method
involving
sensorless
and
non-invasive
approaches
in
a
range
of
identical
simulation
scenarios
.
</s>
<s>
The
results
of
this
method
show
that
the
controller
has
advantages
in
regulating
the
reference
signal
generated
with
the
safe
mode
at
a
variable
speed

The
software
simulation
model
currently
simulates
rest
and
exercise
with
changes
in
HR
,
cardiac
contractility
,
and
systemic
vascular
resistance
.
</s>
<s>
Clinically
,
it
is
observed
that
large
changes
in
pump
pulsatility
during
postural
changes
cause
patients
to
sometimes
feel
weak
during
Valsalva
maneuvers
(
e.
g.
,
when
coughing
or
straining
)
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
we
believe
it
is
important
to
improve
the
software
model
to
represent
these
events
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
the
aortic
valve
is
observed
to
be
closed
in
most
LVAD
patients
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
with
a
change
in
posture
,
cardiac
recovery
,
and
during
exercise
,
it
may
open
.
</s>
<s>
We
have
found
that
the
aortic
valve
offers
a
lower
resistance
pathway
than
the
LVAD
bypass
route
,
as
the
native
heart
sometimes
pumps
a
significant
flow
relative
to
that
of
the
LVAD
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
we
believe
that
this
different
pumping
state
could
greatly
impact
our
overall
control
strategy
,
and
therefore
requires
online
detection
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
addition
,
during
use
in
a
clinical
setting
,
it
was
found
that
controlling
the
pulsatility
index
to
a
pre-set
point
did
not
prevent
antagonistic
pumping
states
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
contrary
,
occasional
suction
occurred
,
which
led
to
the
development
of
algorithms
for
anti-suction
.
</s>
<s>
Another
drawback
is
that
the
pulsatility
index
(
PI
)
is
increasingly
dependent
on
heart
rate
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
For
real-time
clinical
studies
,
we
plan
to
validate
the
controller
built
in
the
above-mentioned
computer
simulation
studies
in
a
pulsatile
mock
circulation
loop
.
</s>
<s>
This
will
include
the
design
of
a
LabView/MATLAB
system
for
the
implementation
of
control
strategies
in
the
LVAD
physical
controller
.

This
computer
system
will
then
be

acute
animal
