There
is
an
abundance
of
publications
on
the
fields
of
architecture
,
communications
,
sociology
,
art
and
urban
planning
,
including
numerous
studies
of
the
relationships
between
these
fields
and
how
interaction
between
them
can
bring
about
transformations
and
new
creations
.

<s>
Such
studies
range
from
academic
articles
or
essays
to
photography
series
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
This
article
constitutes
an
attempt
to
go
a
step
further
and
examine
media
and
advertising
interventions
as
initiatives
capable
of
vesting
derelict
architectural
spaces
with
value
in
the
interests
of
promoting
sustainability
.

<p>

One
of
the
pillars
of
this
research
is
our
interpretation
of
the
sociologist
Lefebvre
’s
notion
of
the
right
to
the
city
.
</s>
<s>
Lefebvre
’s
work
offers
some
fascinating
insights
into
urban
space
,
which
he
understands
in
terms
of
the
future
,
the
possible
,
and
the
alternative
,
based
on
the
logic
of
the
immediate
and
the
tangible
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
Another
interesting
contribution
in
this
respect
has
been
offered
by
the
architect
Tschumi
,
whose
architectural
projects
are
notable
for
the
interrelation
he
establishes
with
events
.
</s>
<s>
Over
the
course
of
the
1970s
,
in
both
written
texts
and
drawings
,
Tschumi
highlighted
the
fact
that
architecture
does
not
exist
without
events
,
actions
,
or
activity
.
</s>
<s>
The
first
projects
he
developed
recognized
that
buildings
respond
to
and
intensify
the
activities
that
occur
within
them
,
and
that
events
creatively
change
and
extend
the
structures
they
contain
.
</s>
<s>
In
other
words
,
architecture
is
not
defined
by
its
“
formal
”
container
but
by
its
combinations
of
spaces
,
movements
and
events
.
</s>
<s>
Tschumi
’s
work
has
been
exhibited
in
individual
exhibitions
at
the
Museum
of
Modern
Art
in
New
York
City
,
the
Venice
Biennale
of
Architecture
,
the
Netherlands
Architecture
Institute
in
Rotterdam
,
the
Center
Pompidou
in
Paris
,
and
other
museums

art
galleries
in
the
United
States
and
Europe

The
imaginary
dialogues
or
references
that
Lefebvre
describes
so
precisely
tie
in
well
with
the
concept
of
New
Babylon
,
conceived
by
Constant
in
1956
in
parallel
with
his
participation
in
the
Situationist
International
.
</s>
<s>
We
therefore
refer
here
to
publications
on
the
exhibition
of
Constant
’s
work
that
was
held
at
Museo
Reina
Sofía
in
2016
.

<p>
<s>
With
the
intention
of
bringing
the
ideas
of
these
authors
into
the
contemporary
context
,
we
also
draw
on
short
essays
like
<hi rend="italic">
La
ciudad
en
Movimiento
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
Metrópolis
Visionarias
</hi>
,
which
help
us
to
understand
the
current
reality
of
urban
planning
and
sociology
,
as
well
as
publications
in
scientific
journals
and
doctoral
theses
,
of
which
Pinchart-Saavedra
’s
study
titled
<hi rend="italic">
Rascacielos
de
Tokio
a
Babilonia
la
arquitectura
como
propaganda
</hi>
stands
out
for
its
role
as
an
anchor
for
our
analysis
.

<p>
<s>
Moreover
,
bearing
in
mind
the
objective
of
promoting
sustainability
,
this
study
considers
the
current
scope
of
the
concept
of
sustainability
,
i.
e.
,
in
its
environmental
,
social
,
economic
,
and
cultural
dimensions
.
</s>
<s>
This
holistic
conception
of
sustainability
based
on
these
four
pillars
represents
a
redefinition
of
economic
policy
and
regional
development
for
the
reconstruction
of
urban
space
and
of
the
social
and
cultural
fabric
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
sense
,
Hawkes
(
p.
11
)
views
culture
as
playing
an
essential
role
in
public
planning
,
pointing
out
that
sustainability
has
four
objectives
:
environmental
responsibility
,
represented
by
ecological
balance
;
economic
viability
,
represented
by
prosperity
;
social
equity
,
represented
by
social
justice
,
engagement
,
cohesion
,
and
welfare
;
and
cultural
vitality
,
represented
by
creativity
,
diversity
,
and
innovation
,
and
also
by
social
well-being
.
</s>
<s>
Indeed
,
art
and
creativity
as
elements
of
expression
play
an
important
role
in
the
social
appropriation
of
the
concept
of
sustainability
,
through
the
effective
production
of
public
campaigns
.
</s>

<p>

The
vision
of
sustainability
offered
by
Hakimi
and
Firoozabadi
is
interesting
in
terms
of
its
way
of
looking
forward
to
the
generations
to
come
:
sustainable
development
is
one
of
the
issues
that
is
currently
given
great
importance
and
is
identified
by
the
United
Nations
as
a
key
part
of
the
21st
century
agenda
.
</s>
<s>
Sustainable
development
refers
to
a
kind
of
development
that
will
meet
today
’s
needs
without
reducing
the
ability
of
the
future
generations
to
meet
theirs

Olalquiaga
suggests
that

<p>

The
geo-socio-political
,
economic
,
cultural
,
and
technological
scenario
of
the
21st
century
exhibits
tensions
between
sustainable
regional
development
models
and
less
sustainable
models
.
</s>
<s>
This
process
is
producing
a
new
scenario
of
transition
,
in
which
sustainability
is
understood
as
a
fundamental
element
in
the
quest
for
new
,
responsible
forms
of
production
and
consumption
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
the
concept
of
sustainable
development
appears
to
be
associated
,
on
the
one
hand
,
with
democratic
governance
with
a
multidisciplinary
perspective
,
and
on
the
other
,
with
governance
that
promotes
sustainability

social
innovation

It
also
has
the
power

vulnerabilities

economic

environmental

institutional
