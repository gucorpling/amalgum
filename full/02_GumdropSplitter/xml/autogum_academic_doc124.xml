Methodology
</s>
</head>
<p>
<s>
The
main
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
describe
how
the
current
degrees
of
both
industrial
engineering
and
informatics
engineering
are
integrating
sustainability
competences
in
teaching
,
paying
special
attention
to
whether
it
is
done
holistically
and
systematically
throughout
the
curriculum
,
and
identifying
good
practices
and
reference
models
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
methodology
is
based
on
benchmarking
methods
,
used
in
the
competitive
analysis
of
companies
and
organizations
,
that
focus
on
best
practices
and
continuous
improvement
.
</s>
<s>
An
external
benchmarking
typology
has
been
chosen
,
comparing
the
behaviour
of
different
universities
that
offer
similar
degrees
.
</s>
<s>
This
approach
has
also
been
used
for
Sánchez
Carracedo
et
al.
—
with
a
lower
range
of
universities
—
but
it
is
different
from
other
studies
aimed
at
analyzing
the
performance
of
just
one
university
in
its
different
degrees
(
internal
benchmarking
)
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
a
functional
approach
has
been
adopted
,
focusing
the
study
on
two
specific
aspects
that
have
been
considered
critical
:
the
holistic
vision
of
sustainability
competencies
and
its
systematic
inclusion
in
the
curricula
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
study
has
been
carried
out
exhaustively
in
the
universities
of
the
Community
of
Madrid
(
13
universities
,
6
public
and
7
private
)
.
</s>
<s>
To
complete
it
,
other
Spanish
universities
have
been
selected
that
could
contribute
to
the
objectives
of
the
study
:
technical
universities
,
as
specialists
and
referents
in
the
field
of
engineering
,
and
other
universities
attending
to
their
involvement
in
the
field
of
sustainability
(
such
as
their
participation
in
the
Higher
Education
Sustainability
Initiative
)
.

Finally
,
27
degrees
of
computer
engineering
(
hereafter
,
Informatics
)
and
28
degrees
of
industrial
engineering
(
hereafter
,
Industrial

have
been
analyzed
