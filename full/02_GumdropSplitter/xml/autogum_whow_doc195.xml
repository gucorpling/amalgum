<list type="ordered">
<item>
<s>
Think
of
why
he
may
be
acting
the
way
that
he
is
.

Is
he
uncomfortable
with
the
relationship
?
</s>
<s>
Perhaps
you
said
something
to
him
that
he
took
the
wrong
way
?

Did
you
marry
his
mother
right
after
causing
the
death
of
his
father
?
</s>
<s>
These
are
all
good
questions
to
ask
yourself
in
trying
to
assess
your
relationship
and
understand
your
new
step
son

</item>
<item>
<s>
Since
you
are
new
to
the
child
,
let
them
set
the
pace
of
the
relationship
.
</s>
<s>
Younger
children
may
be
quicker
to
bond
with
you
,
while
older
children
may
be
more
reluctant
to
get
close
.
</s>
<s>
Do
n’t
force
them
to
become
close
to
you
,
as
you
cannot
force
trust
or
love
.
</s>
<s>
Remember
that
you
are
not
their
real
parent
and
that
they
will
still
feel
devoted
to
the
biological
parent
that
you
have
replaced
.
</s>
<s>
They
may
also
only
listen
to
your
spouse
before
warming
up
to
you
.
</s>
<s>
Do
not
begin
calling
them
“
son
”
or
“
daughter

Let
the
relationship
grow
before
jumping
into
that

Do
be
strong
in
the
household

whether
they
listen
to
you

not

Make
sure
the
stepchild
knows
that
they
are

respect
you

are
not
free

do
whatever
they
please

Your
spouse

your
back

encourage

Enforce
the
rules
