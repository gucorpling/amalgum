Bioactive
compounds
including
growth
factors
,
cytokines
,
drugs
,
and
nucleic
acids
can
be
easily
entrapped
in
the
fibrin
matrix
by
mixing
them
with
fibrinogen
or
thrombin
.
</s>
<s>
In
general
,
fibrin
matrix
remains
porous
regardless
the
conditions
and/or
thrombin
and
fibrinogen
ratios
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
increasing
fibrinogen
and/or
thrombin
concentrations
densifies
the
structure
of
a
fibrin
gel
and
reduces
its
degradation
rate
,
thus
slowing
down
the
diffusion
of
loaded
molecules
(
e.
g.
,
FGF
)
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
addition
,
the
release
profile
of
active
compounds
is
affected
by
their
physicochemical
properties
including
partition
coefficient
,
size
and
functional
groups
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
hydrophilic
molecules
readily
leach
out
(
e.
g.
,
erythromycin
,
mitomycin
C
,
fluorouracil
etc.
)
,
while
hydrophobic
molecules
,
or
those
which
display
a
strong
chemical
affinity
for
the
matrix
components
,
are
released
more
gradually
(
e.
g.
,
streptomycin
,
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim
,
cefazolin
,
enocitabine
etc.
)
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
some
compounds
need
to
be
modified
chemically
to
become
more
hydrophobic
,
resulting
in
a
prolonged
retention
within
the
matrix
.
</s>
<s>
Conversely
,
a
proteolytic
degradation
may
be
required
to
speed
up
the
diffusion
process
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
Lastly
,
fibrin
matrix
proteolysis
through
the
action
of
thrombin
or
plasmin
induces
the
release
of
entrapped
compounds
.
</s>
<s>
In
order
to
restrict
this
breakdown
of
the
matrix
,
the
co-entrapment
of
proteolysis
inhibitors
(
aprotinin
,
matrix
metalloproteinases
inhibitors
such
as
galardin
)
was
investigated
.
Ahmed
et
al.
identified
in
their
model
(
i.
e.
,
chondroprogenitor
clonal
cell
line
)
the
enzymes
responsible
for
fibrin
gel
breakdown
.
</s>
<s>
It
appeared
that
metalloproteinases
(
MMP-2
,
MMP-3
,
MMP-9
)
were
secreted
concomitantly
with
fibrin
hydrogels
breakdown
.
</s>
<s>
They
also
noted
high
plasmin
activity
in
the
conditioned
media
during
hydrogel
breakdown
.
</s>
<s>
Then
,
they
demonstrated
that
aprotinin
and
galardin
,
in
combination
or
separately
,
prevented
fibrin
hydrogels
degradation

In
some
instances

fibrin

growth
factors

cases
,
the
covalent

of

considered

</s>
<s>
This
generally
requires
chemical
modifications
with
reactive
functional
groups
(
thiols
,
azides
)
allowing
a
stable
association

Then
,
reduction/hydrolysis
reactions

cleavage

the

It

shown
that
this
approach
prolongs
the
delivery
phase

growth
factors

</p>
<p>
<s>
As
another
illustration

covalently
binding

Under

In
addition

upon
the
action

the
