Hello
everyone
,
</s>
<s>
I
'm
looking
for
some
advice
for
my
particular
situation
.
</s>
<s>
Last
year
,
in
August
2017
,
I
purchased
an
new
old
stock
15-inch
2016
</s>
<s>
MacBook
Pro
from
B&amp;H
(
was
a
new
computer
,
unopened
;
they
just
never
sold
it
so
they
were
discounting
it
to
make
room
for
new
shipments
)
.
</s>
<s>
I
had
opted
out
on
purchasing
AppleCare\+
,
as
I
did
not
think
I
would
ever
use
the
accidental
service
(
I
work
at
home
and
only
use
my
laptop
while
working
,
rarely
take
it
out
of
my
house
)
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
just
two
weeks
ago
,
I
started
having
an
issue
with
the
new
keyboard
mechanism
(
never
had
any
issues
with
the
laptop
prior
to
this
)
;
my
&quot;
A
&quot;
key
was
malfunctioning
and
would
either
print
out
&quot;
aa
</s>
<s>
&quot;
(
repeating
the
keystroke
)
or
nothing
at
all
when
pressed
.
</s>
<s>
With
my
1-year
original
warranty
running
out
in
a
few
months
,
I
made
an
appointment
with
the
Genius
Bar
to
get
the
issue
fixed
.
</s>
<s>
Took
it
in
4/18
,
and
got
a
call
4/20
after
stating
that
it
was
ready
for
pickup
.
</s>
<s>
I
go
to
pick
it
up
,
and
when
I
close
the
laptop
,
I
see
a
1-inch
scratch
on
the
lid
that
was
n't
there
when
I
dropped
it
off
.
</s>
<s>
Talked
to
the
employee
helping
me
,
and
after
checking
the
notes
to
confirm
that
the
scratch
was
n't
on
the
laptop
when
I
dropped
it
off
,
he
offered
to
remedy
the
issue
by
replacing
the
display
,
which
was
the
only
option
.
</s>
<s>
I
agreed
,
and
they
told
me
they
would
call
when
it
was
ready
for
pickup
in
&quot;
24-48
hours
&quot;
.
</s>
<s>
On
4/25
(
over
96
hours
later
)
I
call
them
,
as
I
never
got
a
call
or
email
that
it
was
ready
.
</s>
<s>
They
have
some
issues
finding
me
in
their
system
,
but
after
10
mins
on
hold
,
they
tell
me
that
it
is
ready
for
pickup
.
</s>
<s>
I
drive
over
,
and
when
I
go
to
pick
it
up
,
the
display
has
some
lines
running
across
the
screen
,
but
it
came
off
when
I
wiped
it
with
a
microfiber
cloth
.
</s>
<s>
There
was
also
some
left
over
adhesive
strips
on
the
bottom
of
the
display
.
</s>
<s>
No
worries
I
thought
,
as
long
as
everything
works
fine
.
</s>
<s>
Booted
up
the
laptop
and
saw
that
the
CAPSLOCK
button
function
was
inverted
;
it
would
light
up
when
not
pressed
,
and
when
I
pressed
it
to
activate
CAPSLOCK
,
the
light
would
go
off
.
</s>
<s>
Tried
logging
into
my
computer
and
it
went
to
a
black
screen
with
the
cursor
turning
into
the
spinning
pinwheel
.
</s>
<s>
Restarted
it
,
and
the
CAPSLOCKS
button
issue
was
remedied
,
but
I
still
could
n't
log
into
my
account
;
still
kept
getting
the
black
screen
with
spinning
pinwheel
.
</s>
<s>
Genius
Bar
Employee
told
me
to
log
into
the
other
accounts
on
my
laptop
(
to
see
if
it
was
a
hardware
of
software
issue
)
,
but
all
of
them
would
lead
to
the
black
screen
with
spinning
pinwheel
.
</s>
<s>
They
run
a
diagnostic
test
,
but
everything
hardware
related
checks
out
and
seems
to
be
working
fine
.
</s>
<s>
The
Employee
tries
running
an
OS
that
they
have
on
hand
using
a
dongle
,
but
when
he
tries
to
log
in
,
the
black
screen
with
the
spinning
pinwheel
persists
(
although
this
time
,
occasionally
the
top
left
portion
of
the
display
would
flicker
)
,
leading
him
to
believe
that
it
is
a
hardware
issue
.
</s>
<s>
He
has
no
idea
what
may
be
causing
the
issue
,
so
he
gets
his
Manager
.
</s>
<s>
Manager
states
that
it
could
possibly
be
a
graphics
card
failure
,
although
he
is
not
certain
.
</s>
<s>
He
tells
me
that
they
can
replace
the
logic
board/motherboard
(
and
transfer
over
my
SSD
to
retain
data
)
as
that
is
the
only
part
left
they
have
not
replaced
,
and
it
should
most
likely
solve
the
issue
.
</s>
<s>
I
ask
if
I
can
just
get
a
replacement
unit
(
as
this
point
,
they
would
have
replaced
everything
on
my
laptop
)
since
I
have
a
backup
of
my
data
,
but
he
states
that
unfortunately
,
Apple
's
policy
is
that
they
must
perform
3
major
repairs
before
exploring
the
possibility
of
a
replacement
unit
.
</s>
<s>
If
after
the
logic
board
replacement
my
laptop
is
still
acting
up
,
they
will
allow
for
a
replacement
unit
.
</s>
<s>
But
for
now
,
my
only
option
is
to
wait
another
5-7
days
to
pick
it
up
.
</s>
<s>
Currently
borrowing
a
friend
's
laptop
for
work
in
the
meantime
(
which
is
what
I
am
typing
this
post
on
)
,
while
I
wait
until
4/30-5/2
to
pick
up
the
MacBook
once
they
have
replaced
the
motherboard
.
</s>
<s>
Also
,
note
that
both
times
I
went
to
pick
up
my
MacBook
Pro
,
I
did
n't
leave
the
store
.
</s>
<s>
Ever
since
I
first
brought
it
into
the
store
on
4/18
(
for
the
keyboard
issue
)
,
it
has
never
left
the
store
.
</s>
<s>
My
MacBook
is
also
currently
updated
to
the
latest
version
of
OSX
.
</s>
<s>
My
question
to
you
all
is
:
1
)
Have
you
ever
encountered
someone
who
went
through
a
similar
situation
,
and
if
so
,
how
was
their
situation
handled
?
2
)
Is
what
the
manager
said
regarding
the
3
major
repairs
not
remedying
the
issue
before
replacing
the
laptop
unit
true
?
</s>
<s>
It
seems
a
tad
unreasonable
as
it
's
taking
them
more
work
and
time
to
fix
the
issues
in
the
long
run
.

)
As
I
said
earlier
,
I
did
not
purchase
AppleCare\+
when
buying
the
MacBook
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
now
that
my
warranty
is
running
out
and
all
these
issues
are
starting
to
occur
,
I
regret
that
decision
.
</s>
<s>
I
'm
worried
that
given
this
track
record
,
another
issue
will
arise
once
my
warranty
expires
,
and
I
will
be
stuck
paying
the
repair
costs
out
of
pocket
.
</s>
<s>
Also
(
no
offense
)
,
but
I
am
paranoid
of
the
quality
of
the
repairs
done
as
well
,
as
only
one
key
on
my
keyboard
was
not
functioning
properly
when
I
visited
the
Genius
Bar
the
first
time
,
and
now
all
these
issues
are
arising
back-to-back
AFTER
they
&quot;
repaired
&quot;
it
(
never
saw
any
signs
of
these
issues
before
)
.
</s>
<s>
That
and
the
fact
that
did
n't
bother
testing
to
make
sure
everything
worked
and
forgot
to
call
me
for
pickup
the
second
time
,
scratched
the
lid
without
telling
me
the
first
time
,
and
did
n't
clean
the
replacement
display
(
and
left
the
adhesive
strips
on
it
)
before
handing
back
my
laptop
leads
me
to
question
their
craftsmanship
and
quality
control
at
this
particular
location
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
want
to
end
up
holding
the
short
end
of
the
stick
when
my
1-year
warranty
expires
due
to
an
oversight
when
they
made
the
repair
.
</s>
<s>
My
question
is
,
is
it
possible
for
an
exception
to
be
made
and
purchase
AppleCare\+
for
my
Macbook
Pro
(
even
though
it
has
been
more
than
60
days
since
the
purchase
date
)
?
</s>
<s>
Especially
given
all
the
repairs
,
everything
on
my
laptop
that
can
be
replaced
has
been
replaced
(
and
it
technically
is
a
new
machine
)
.
</s>
<s>
Asked
the
manager
on
4/25
and
he
said
he
did
n't
have
the
authority
to
make
that
exception
,
although
he
has
never
dealt
with
a
scenario
like
mine
.
