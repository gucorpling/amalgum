I
am
bringing
with
me
a
new
way
to
undertake
the
development
of
Brampton
;
a
new
policy
that
would
see
the
reduction
of
the
gap
between
Bramptonians
and
the
council
actions
;
I
have
with
me
a
new
alternative
that
would
make
each
person
living
in
Brampton
really
feel
at
home
.

I
would
give
to
each
inhabitant

the
real
feeling

being
in
a
city

really
fit
his
desire

Much
of
Brampton
's
existing
council
is
seasoned
in
the
civic
political
process
.

What
could
you
bring
to
the
table

a

rookie

above

The
present
council
seems
to
be
away
of
the
reality
in
this
fast
growing
city
.
</s>
<s>
They
are
veterans
,
with
all
respect
,
they
are
in
urgent
need
of
retirement
.
</s>
<s>
We
're
grateful
of
their
effort
and
commitment
for
all
these
years
,
but
we
must
now
realize
that
they
are
all
running
out
of
ideas
.
</s>
<s>
They
've
been
cut
off
guard
by
the
population
growth
and
they
seem
to
be
trailing
behind
looking
desperately
for
ways
to
catch
up
with
a
train
speeding
away
.
</s>
<s>
The
best
way
to
give
a
better
future
to
our
city
is
to
give
the
chance
to
&quot;
rookies
&quot;
to
come
in
with
fresh
mind
and
fresh
ideas
that
would
help
our
city
to
cope
with
this
sudden
growth
.
</s>
<s>
We
need
to
rejuvenate
the
council
chamber
and
create
some
sort
of
positive
actions
that
would
consolidate
the
path
of
Brampton
in
this
twenty
first
century
.
</s>
<s>
We
all
appreciate
the
hard
work
done
by
our
predecessors
,
but
it
is
the
time
to
look
beyond
their
path
of
actions
and
act
accordingly
to
keep
Brampton
into
the
right
direction
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Brampton
has
now
a
diverse
culture
and
ethnicity
that
in
reality
should
be
our
strength
.
</s>
<s>
The
existing
council
,
despite
their
talk
,
is
not
really
walking
the
talk
.
</s>
<s>
There
are
no
actions
to
really
create
a
sense
of
belongings
to
these
newcomers
in
our
city
.
</s>
<s>
Without
a
doubt
there
is
need
of
new
energy
,
a
need
of
rejuvenation
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
There
are
obvious
actions
that
a
council
should
tackle
which
have
n't
been
done
properly
.
</s>
<s>
Certainly
they
've
been
there
so
long
that
they
do
n't
see
any
pressure
or
obligation
.
</s>
<s>
We
must
work
to
support
our
youth
,
seniors
and
people
with
special
needs
.
</s>
<s>
We
must
improve
on
the
present
infrastructure
and
develop
the
public
transit
within
Brampton
and
beyond
.
</s>
<s>
Of
course
,
the
safety
measures
are
paramount
and
it
is
important
to
create
a
great
atmosphere
of
respect
and
collaboration
between
Police
and
the
community
.
</s>
<s>
We
must
not
forget
that
the
community
is
important
in
solving
many
crimes
