Many
studies
show
the
problem
of
burnout
and
its
negative
impact
on
some
forms
of
addiction
.
</s>
<s>
We
found
that
if
a
lack
of
resources
appear
,
an
individual
becomes
burned
out
,
and
thus
,
the
risk
of
addiction
increases
.
</s>
<s>
Our
assumption
is
consistent
with
other
studies
in
which
burnout
may
cause
many
behavioral
addictions
,
such
as
Internet
Addiction
,
substance
abuse
or
alcohol
dependence
.
</s>
<s>
Additionally
,
similar
to
our
results
,
many
studies
have
revealed
that
the
risk
factors
of
IA
stem
from
feelings
of
a
lack
of
social
resources
,
and
is
manifested
by
poor
social
relationships
,
loneliness
,
lack
of
social
skills
,
and
lack
of
social
support
.
</s>
<s>
Following
the
Job
Demands
Resources
Model
chronic
stress
,
which
is
sparked
by
excessive
demands
and
lacking
resources
may
—
via
burnout
—
cause
negative
outcomes
such
as
poor
performance
and
health
.
</s>
<s>
What
is
more
,
by
increasing
resources
,
such
as
social
support
,
we
reduce
the
risk
of
burnout
syndrome
and
health
problems
.
</s>
<s>
One
of
these
health
problems
are
addictive
behaviours
,
such
as
problematic
Internet
use
.
</s>
<s>
Academic
burnout
heightened
the
potential
risk
of
addiction
among
adolescents
.
</s>
<s>
The
authors
suggested
that
symptoms
of
school
burnout
,
frustration
,
and
a
sense
of
disappointment
in
people
cause
maladaptive
behaviours
such
as
isolation
adaptations
,
and
addiction
to
alcohol
and
drugs
.
</s>
<s>
These
are
one
of
possible
ways
to
escape
from
the
present
difficult
situation
and
reduce
the
tensions
.

<p>
<s>
The
main
objective
of
this
research
was
to
test
for
gender
differences
in
school-related
predictors
of
Internet
addiction
.
</s>
<s>
Our
study
supplemented
the
existing
literature
by
examining
the
association
between
school
burnout
and
Internet
addiction
for
adolescent
girls
and
boys
separately
.
</s>
<s>
According
to
the
results
,
it
was
discovered
that
a
higher
level
of
school
burnout
is
related
to
higher
Internet
addiction
indicators
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
in
the
female
adolescent
group
these
relationships
were
weaker
(
we
noted
a
smaller
number
of
significant
Pearson
’s
correlations
,
all
significant
correlations
were
low
)
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
male
adolescent
group
,
we
found
a
larger
number
of
significant
correlation
coefficients
and
with
higher
effect
size
(
low
to
moderate
)
.
</s>
<s>
In
other
words
,
young
burnout
boys
are
at
a
higher
risk
of
suffering
from
Internet
addiction
than
girls
.
</s>
<s>
This
result
is
consistent
with
the
statement
that
gender-related
differences
exist
in
most
addictive
behaviors
.
</s>
<s>
Other
research
showed
differentiated
effects
on
Internet
addiction
by
gender
in
such
prevalence
of
IA
like
:
school
grades
,
parental
education
,
alcohol
drinking
,
smoking
consumption
,
and
substance
use
.
</s>
<s>
Many
previous
studies
showed
that
Internet
addiction
affects
boys
more
often
.
</s>
<s>
One
possible
explanation
is
that
they
try
to
cope
with
negative
school
pressure
and
stress
,
and
negative
feelings
and
thoughts
connected
with
burnout
syndrome
,
by
indulging
themselves
on
the
Internet
,
which
is
rather
an
avoidance
and
ineffective
strategy
of
problem
solving
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Secondly
,
gender
significantly
predicted
Internet
addiction
,
and
moderated
the
link
between
school
burnout
and
Internet
addiction
.

<s>
Hierarchical
multiple
regression
analyses
confirmed
different
predictors
of
Internet
addiction
for
female
and
male
students
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Our
findings
suggest
that
school
burnout
and
school-related
characteristics
have
greater
prediction
power
of
Internet
addiction
in
a
male
group
than
in
a
female
group
.
</s>
<s>
As
the
results
show
,
burnout
due
to
parents
appeared
to
be
a
significant
predictor
of
IA
for
both
male
and
female
high
school
students
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
in
the
female
group
also
,
burnout
due
to
study
and
loss
of
interest
were
significant
predictors
of
PUI
;
in
the
male
group
only
,
burnout
due
to
homework
was
significantly
associated
with
PUI
.
</s>
<s>
What
is
more
,
in
the
female
adolescent
group
,
quality
of
teacher-student
relationships
had
a
significant
connection
to
Internet
addiction
;
in
the
male
adolescent
group
it
was
quality
of
classmates

relationship
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
well
confirmed
that
parental
pressure
on
school
achievements
lead
to
stress
and
anxiety
in
students
.
</s>
<s>
Other
studies
prove
that
male
students
are
pressurized
by
parents
more
than
female
students
,
however
,
female
students
’
levels
of
stress
and
anxiety
were
higher
.
</s>
<s>
What
is
more
,
recent
research
has
confirmed
different
family
related
factors
of
IA
such
as
family
support
,
family
conflict
,
family
functionality
and
approaches
.
</s>
<s>
Perceived
parental
psychological
control
explained
18
%
of
the
IA
level
among
students
aged
14
–
18
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
peer
pressure
and
perceived
teacher
support
also
were
found
to
be
a
significantly
related
to
IA
.
</s>
<s>
There
is
an
agreement
between
researchers
and
findings
about
the
crucial
role
of
deficits
in
social
resources
in
the
developing

IA

<s>
Lack
of
“
face

interactions

others

lead
young
people

look

them

<s>
Numerous
studies
have
demonstrated
the
link
between
loneliness

</s>
<s>
The
results
of
studies
conducted
among
300
high
school
students
(
M
=
16.49
)
confirmed
that
perceived
social
support
from
significant
others
,
loneliness
,
cognitive
avoidance
,
and
problem
solving
were
among
coping
strategies
which
significantly
predicted
