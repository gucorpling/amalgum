What
you

doing

David
,
is
a
Satanic
example

<s>
The
whole
point
of
Satanism
is
again
to
choose
your
values
,
and
if
you
become
somebody
that
really
feels
you
want
to
work
for
hospitals
for
free
—
a
number
of
our
members
work
for
animal
organizations
because
we
generally
cherish
animals
and
think
they
are
far
less
polluted
than
people
with
values
that
are
anti-
their
nature
.
</s>
<s>
So
,
Satanists
are
often
very
giving
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Because
our
values
come
from
the
self
,
people
who
try
to
tell
themselves
that
they
must
be
selfless
,
they
ca
n't
really
understand
why
you
would
be
giving
if
you
’re
a
selfish
person
.
</s>
<s>
But
I
think
that
’s
more
a
revelation
of
their
<hi rend="italic">
own
</hi>
natures
,
meaning
if
they
did
n't
have
some
external
force
making
them
being
nice
to
people
,
they
would
be
bastards
!
We
Satanists
,
because
we
are
relaxed
,
we
love
our
lives
,
we
love
people
who
enrich
our
lives
and
things
that
are
around
us
that
we
enjoy
,
we
can
be
really
giving
.

<s>
Gods
can
be
beneficent

So
when
you
are
your
own
God

you
can
be
happy

give

So
anyone
