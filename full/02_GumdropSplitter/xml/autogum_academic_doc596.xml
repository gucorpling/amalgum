Introduction

<p>
<s>
In
the
course
of
performing
work-related
tasks
,
nurses
are
exposed
to
many
harmful
,
cumbersome
,
and
dangerous
factors
,
including
emotional
and
interpersonal
stressors
.
</s>
<s>
As
early
as
the
1950s
,
M.S.
Schwartz
and
G.T.
Will
described
the
case
of
a
nurse
working
in
a
psychiatric
ward
who
began
to
lose
energy
and
motivation
to
work
.
</s>
<s>
The
nurse
felt
mental
and
physical
fatigue
,
exhaustion
,
helplessness
,
skepticism
,
and
lack
of
joy
in
performing
nursing
tasks
as
a
result
of
intense
tension
at
work
caused
by
various
stressors
.
</s>
<s>
In
subsequent
studies
,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
observed
symptoms
were
evidence
of
burnout
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
Europe
,
Danish
researchers
from
Copenhagen
lead
by
T.S.
Kristensen
identified
three
components
of
burnout
:
personal
burnout
,
work-related
burnout
,
and
burnout
in
contacts
with
patients
.
</s>
<s>
Personal
burnout
was
defined
as
“
physical
and
psychological
fatigue
and
exhaustion
experienced
by
a
given
person
”
,
work-related
burnout
by
the
researchers
referred
to
“
physical
and
mental
fatigue
or
exhaustion
experienced
by
a
person
while
performing
work
”
,
whereas
burnout
in
contacts
with
patients
was
defined
as
“
a
physical
and
mental
fatigue
or
exhaustion
experienced
by
a
person
when
dealing
with
patients
”
.

An
overview
of
the
available
literature
clearly
highlights
the
variety
of
factors
associated
with
burnout
syndrome
.
</s>
<s>
Most
often
,
they
can
be
classified
into
three
groups
:
organizational
factors
,
socio-demographic
and
lifestyle
factors
,
and
personality
variables
and
coping
strategies
.
</s>
<s>
Worth
noting
is
the
study
by
Manzano-García
and
Ayala
with
a
group
of
40
experts
from
6
countries
.
</s>
<s>
The
study
identified
potentially
important
factors
in
explaining
burnout
in
nursing
that
have
been
insufficiently
studied
or
ignored
.
</s>
<s>
Among
the
many
analyzed
factors
,
the
authors
emphasized
the
importance
of
personal
factors
and
personal
resources
in
the
process
of
professional
burnout
.
</s>
<s>
Other
studies
show
that
personal
(
psychological
)
resources
,
often
considered
to
be
stress
moderators
,
such
as
optimism
,
high
self-esteem
,
effectiveness
,
and
the
ability
to
build
relationships
with
other
people
,
can
facilitate
an
individual
to
cope
better
with
stressors
.
</s>
<s>
This
effect
takes
place
even
if
the
encountered
events
are
evaluated
in
the
categories
of
stress
,
but
an
individual
does
not
experience
the
negative
effects
or
experiences
less
of
the
negative
effects
in
the
process
.
</s>
<s>
The
authors
of
this
paper
argue
that
there
is
a
need
to
continue
research
into
the
theory
of
positive
orientation
,
as
positive
orientation
refers
to
the
components
of
mental
well-being
in
everyday
life
and
may
play
a
significant
role
in
the
professional
burnout
of
nurses

Gian
Vittorio
Caprara
,
one
of
the
most
eminent
Italian
psychologists
,
formulated
the
concept
of
positive
orientation
,
which
fits
into
the
positive
psychology
of
the
last
quarter
century
.
</s>
<s>
Positive
orientation
is
defined
by
Caprara
as
“
a
fundamental
tendency
to
notice
and
to
attach
importance
to
the
positive
aspects
of
life
,
experience
and
self
”
.
</s>
<s>
The
results
of
the
Italian
and
Canadian
studies
confirmed
that
positive
orientation
is
a
latent
(
hidden
)
higher
order
variable
that
combines
three
components
:
self-esteem
,
optimism
,
and
satisfaction
from
life
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
literature
,
it
is
emphasized
that
positive
orientation
is
largely
responsible
for
adaptive
functioning
and
is
motivational
in
the
actions
of
individuals
.
</s>
<s>
It
signifies
“
natural
inclinations
towards
positive
self-esteem
,
high
satisfaction
in
life
,
and
a
high
evaluation
of
the
chances
of
achieving
goals
,
which
translates
into
commitment
to
life
’s
aspirations
and
a
high
quality
of
life
”
.
Alessandri
et
al.
investigated
the
relationship
between
positive
orientation
and
behavior
in
organizations
.
</s>
<s>
As
it
turned
out
,
positive
orientation
was
significantly
associated
with
selected
organizational
behaviors
that
brought
immediate
benefits
to
the
organization
as
a
whole
,
and
altruistic
behaviors
aimed
at
benefiting
individuals
.
</s>
<s>
The
results
of
Polish
research
have
shown
that
positive
orientation
and
self-efficacy
are
significantly
connected
but
distinct
variables
.
</s>
<s>
In
studies
conducted
by
Miciuk
et
al.
,
200
students
showed
moderate
correlations
between
positive
orientation
and
a
generalized
sense
of
effectiveness
,
positive
affect
,
sense
of
meaning
,
and
purpose
in
life
.
</s>
<s>
In
other
studies
,
there
was
a
positive
relationship
between
gratitude
,
self-esteem
,
and
positive
orientation
.
