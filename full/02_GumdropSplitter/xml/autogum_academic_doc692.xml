Modern
construction
works
,
such
as
green
buildings
,
with
increasing
complexity
and
immensity
involve
a
wide
range
of
stakeholders
,
such
as
consultants
,
contractors
,
material
suppliers
,
general
public
,
governmental
institutions
,
etc.
</s>
<s>
Coordinating
all
of
these
parties
simultaneously
in
the
execution
of
a
construction
project
is
a
big
challenge
.

Value
management
helps
to
improve
communication
between
the
project
’s
parties
,
accommodate
mutual
understanding
of
the
project
objectives
,
provide
better
quality
project
definition
,
build
innovation
,
and
eliminate
unnecessary
cost
.
</s>
<s>
Value
can
be
understood
in
a
multitude
of
dimensions
through
economic
,
cultural
,
and
social
interpretations

<s>
The
whole-life-cycle
value
exchange
mechanisms
are
risky
,
complex
,
might
have
an
effect
on
adding
value
,
and
are
composed
of
value
exchange
and
value
creation
(
VC
)
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
detailed
investigations
focusing
on
finding
mechanisms
for
achieving
sustainability
targets
over
the
entire
life
cycle
of
a
project
is
required
.

<s>
Globally
,
the
construction
industry
has
been
showing
greater
interest
in
sustainable
green
buildings
since
the
last
few
years
.
</s>
<s>
Although
,
the
primary
benefits
that
were
obtained
from
sustainable
development
have
been
defined
in
several
manners
,
their
financial
impacts
are
alike
,
including
sustainable
VC
and
premium
profits
.
</s>
<s>
Value
management
aims
to
achieve
the
desired
value
with
lower
prices
without
compromising
the
quality
and
function
of
the
building
.
</s>
<s>
Experience
of
several
organization
revealed
that
implementing
green
building
initiatives
by
simply
evaluating
the
existing
processes
efficiency
reduced
wastes

improved
drives

saved
money

<s>
Lützkendorf
and
Lorenz
identified
several
direct
and
indirect
benefits
for
investors
and
other
stakeholders
,
of
applying
value
creation
assessment
for
green
buildings
,
such
as
:
(
i
)
drastic
reduction
in
the
operational
cost
and
an
increase
in
marketability
,
(
ii
)
increase
in
useful
life-spans
,
(
iii
)
more
stable
cash
flows
,
(
iv
)
reduced
exposure
to
increasingly
stringent
environmental
legislation
,
and
(
v
)
significantly
increased
occupant
productivity
and
well-being
.

Presently
,
the
building
sector
in
Saudi
Arabia
is
also
aiming
to
attain
the
advantages
like
the
developed
countries
that
have
already
benefited
from
the
use
of
green
buildings
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
there
is
a
need
to
set
up
a
framework
for
improving
the
creation
of
value
during
the
building
development
stage
in
Saudi
Arabia
by
integrating
value
with
project
management
.

It
has
been
widely
recognized
that
all
of
the
projects
have
opportunities

improved
VC

The
primary
aim
of
value
engineering
is
to
deliver
quantifiable
improvements
in
the
value
by
reducing
the
cost
,
getting
better
quality
,
and
improving
the
design
features
of
the
building
for
the
customer
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
a
systematic
process
to
gather
a
team
of
multidisciplinary
professionals
with
experience
in
the
construction
industry
to
perform
functional
analysis
of
a
system
for
providing
the

Improving
the
VC
in
a
green
building
development
project

improving
the
function

Kelly

CAPEX
)

<s>
They
go
on
to
suggest
that
measuring
and
optimising
an
asset
’s
performance
involves
economic
performance
(
to
obtain
value

money
)
,
functional
performance
(

physical
performance
(
concerns
about

service
performance

The
Construction
Industry
Council
(
United

has
produced
design

the

the

Kelly
described
the
performance
variables
for
a
client
’s
VC
system
as
nine
non-correlated
performance
variables
,
which
are
:
CAPEX
,
OPEX
,
time
,
esteem
,
environment

exchange

The
tangible
value
of
the
initiatives
is
hard
to
assess
in
green
buildings
,
but
improved
productivity
is
certainly
a
valuable
factor
.
</s>
<s>
Even
a
minor
improvement
in
productivity
leading
to
the
corresponding
increase
in
firm
value
would
make
more
green
building
initiatives
worth
the
investment
.
</s>
<s>
Although
several
tools
have
been
developed
to
assess
the
environmental
performance
of
a
green
building
,
disconnect
between
the
design
community
and
the
investment
community
still
exists
on
the
tangibility
of
VC
over
the
short
,
medium
,
or
long-term
.
</s>
<s>
Conducting
value
analysis
can
identify
project
development
contextual
issues
and
thus
provide
opportunities
for
optimising
the
design
and
operation
of
the
green
building
asset
during
early
stages
of
the
development
