Over
the
last
few
decades
,
accumulating
evidence
has
demonstrated
that
numerous
Interferon
(
IFN
)
stimulate
genes
(
ISGs
)
can
be
directly
upregulated
following
virus
infection
independent
of
IFN
signaling
.
</s>
<s>
Indeed
,
whereas
typical
ISGs
are
driven
by
JAK-STAT
signaling
,
other
virally-stimulated
genes
are
upregulated
through
the
IRF3
and
NF-κB
pathways
.
</s>
<s>
These
genes
can
be
called
virus
stimulated
genes
(
VSGs
)
,
and
IFNs
themselves
are
VSGs
.
</s>
<s>
Interestingly
,
VSGs
have
natural
anticancer
activities
,
and
they
may
cause
diseases
in
humans
when
induced
chronically
.

<s>
To
understand
their
role
in
host
defense

pathogenesis

excellent

been
developed

However
,
there
are
still
important
gaps
in
our
understanding

VSGs

host
defense

Recently

detected
by

Asmi

<s>
Rhabdoviruses-induced
interferon
production

the
activation
of
interferon
signaling
pathways
,
as
well
as
the
expression

are
discussed

Ashley

reported
that
by
using
cells
engineered
to
block
either
the
response
to
,
or
production
of
,
type-I
IFN
,
the
regulation

IFN-independent
ISGs

examined
in
the
context
of
human
cytomegalovirus
(
HCMV

infection

Several
ISGs

IFIT1

IFIT2

IFIT3

CXCL10

ISG15

HCMV

type-I
IFN

</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
by
using
IRF3

CRISPR/Cas-9
clones

they
were
able
to
demonstrate
IFN-independent
control

absolutely
dependent

Finally

He

revealed
that
the
THO
complex
subunit
7
homolog
(
THOC7
)
negatively
regulates
type-I
IFN
production
by
promoting
TBK1
proteasomal
degradation

subsequently
decreases
IRF3
activation

Despite

Clearly

IFN
