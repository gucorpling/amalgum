Cutaneous
squamous
cell
carcinoma
(
cSCC
)
is
the
second
most
common
type
of
cancer
with
an
annual
incidence
of
over
one
million
globally
.
</s>
<s>
Chronic
ultraviolet
(
UV
)
exposure
was
suggested
to
be
responsible
for
DNA
damage
of
normal
keratinocytes
in
the
epidermis
,
which
leads
to
the
development
of
skin
cancers
including
cSCC
.

However

the
detailed
underlying
molecular
mechanisms
for
this

Apoptosis
is
one
type
of
programmed
cell
death
,
which
is
initiated
by
intrinsic
or
extrinsic
signals
and
finely-tuned
by
many
factors
including
BCL-2
family
proteins
.
</s>
<s>
BCL-2
family
members
,
including
both
anti-apoptotic
and
pro-apoptotic
BCL-2
family
proteins
,
govern
mitochondrial
outer
membrane
permeabilization
(
MOMP
)
to
regulate
apoptosis
.
</s>
<s>
When
apoptotic
cell
death
program
starts
,
MOMP
releases
cytochrome
c
to
cytosol
and
activates
caspase-family
proteases
for
initiating
apoptotic
events
.

<s>
Tumors
develop
effective
mechanisms
to
resist
apoptosis
and
thus
become
one
of
the
hallmark
features
of
cancer
.

<s>
The
lead
member
BCL-2
and
its
homologue
BCL-XL
(
BCL2L1

are
featured
by
the
presence
of
four
conserved
BH
domains
,
three
of
which
,
BH1
,
BH2
,
and
BH3
domains
,
are
responsible
for
their
antiapoptotic
role
mainly
by
interactions
with
other
proapoptotic
members
of
the
BCL-2
family

Inhibiting
the
activities
of
anti-apoptotic
BCL-2
members

drugs

neutralizing

BH3
peptides

cells

death

been
regarded
as
effective
therapeutic
modalities

In
another
way
,
transcriptionally
or
post-transcriptionally
repressing
the
expression
levels
of
anti-apoptotic
BCL-2
members
in
cancer
is
also
promising

the
mechanism
regulating
the

Autophagy
is
an
evolutionarily-conserved
catabolic
process
,
during
which
“
useless
”
proteins
and
damaged
organelles
are
sequestrated
into
autophagosomes
and
fused
with
lysosomes
to
form
autolysosomes
for
bulk
degradation
of
embedded
components
.

Except
the
dysregulated
autophagic
process

type
II
programmed
cell
death

autophagy
is
generally

protective
cellular
process
