Yeah
,
well
that
--
and
also
,
it
reflects
sort
of
where
people
are
at
in
their
lives
,
and
so
,
you
know
,
romances
will
perennially
be
interesting
to
people
because
most
people
that
are
really
actively
looking
for
movies
and
books
are
in
their
twenties
and
thirties
,

they're

that
's
what
their
life
is
all
about

But
I
want
to
say
one
other
thing
,
which
I
--
I
actually
ran
a
symposium
at
the
Public
Library
a
couple
of
years
ago
,
which
nobody
seemed
to
find
very
important
,
but
I
really
think
is
important
,
which
is
:
If
you
really
want
to
look
for
the
new
literature
,
you
got
to
look
at
graphic
novels
,
which
are
wildly
popular
.

look
