This
exploratory
study
developed
an
MEC
analysis
of
consumers
’
cognitive
structures
regarding
eco-design
packaging
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
the
research
process
was
based
on
(
1
)
data
triangulation
(
i.
e.
,
combining
two
data
collection
approaches
:
A
focus
group
and
individual
interviews
with
two
comparative
heterogenous
demographic
samples

and
(

method
triangulation
(
i.
e.
,
analyzing
academic
and
professional
literature
,
content
analysis
,
and
an
analysis
of
cognitive
chaining
)
to
obtain
more
robust
results
,
thereby
strengthening
the
research
’s
validity

<p>
<s>
However
,
due
to
the
exploratory
nature
of
this
study
,
several
limitations
remain
.
</s>
<s>
Firstly
,
due
to
the
sample
(
n
=
19
)
of
individual
interviews
,
this
study
cannot
generalize
its
findings
related
to
consumers
’
cognitive
chains
to
all
consumers
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
this
study
revealed
four
risk-oriented
consumption
patterns
associated
with
eco-design
packaging
(
i.
e.
,
functional
and
physical
risks-oriented
consumption
patterns
,
life
standard
risk-oriented
consumption
patterns
,
financial
risk-oriented
consumption
patterns
,
and
socio-environmental
risk-oriented
consumption
patterns
)
.

Through
a
hierarchical
map
linking
attributes

,
and
values

)
.
</s>
<s>
Note
that
this
representation
of
static
cognitive
chaining
cannot
lead
to
an
inference
of
causality
.
</s>
<s>
Future
research
may
seek
to
establish
a
representative
of
cognitive
chaining
to
build
a
dynamic
causal
model
of
A-C-Vs
with
a
representative
sample
(
around
fifty
)
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Secondly
,
this
study
focused
upon
the
negative
reactions
of
consumers
,
namely
their
perceived
risk
.
</s>
<s>
Future
studies
focusing
upon
the
positive
reactions
of
consumers
(
e.
g.
,
perceived
benefits
and
perceived
quality
)
through
an
MEC
approach
are
recommended
to
gain
a
complete
understanding
of
the
topic
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Another
limitation
is
that
this
study
focused
upon
food
packaging
in
a
Canadian
context
.
</s>
<s>
A
survey
of
Eco
Entreprises
Quebec
shows
that
Canadian
consumers
have
a
higher
awareness
of
eco-design
packaging
in
food
categories
(
57.1
%
)
than
in
other
product
categories
,
including
medication
(
10.6
%
)
and
cleaning
products
(
9.0
%
)
.
</s>
<s>
The
findings
for
individual
cognitive
chains
may
be
different
across
divers
product
categories
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
a
future
study
may
investigate
consumers
’
perceptions
towards
eco-packaging
across
different
product
categories
(
e.
g.
,
cleaning
products
and
cosmetic
products
)
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
we
expect
similar
findings
to
the
food
packaging
sector
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Lastly
,
the
results
of
this
exploratory
study
have
demonstrated
the
socio
–
environmental
risks
related
to
packaging
.
</s>
<s>
In
particular
,
26
%
of
consumers
interviewed
stated
that
eco-design
packaging
could
cause
food
waste
because
of
its
simplicity
,
reduction
,
or
poor
quality
.
</s>
<s>
These
results
seem
to
contradict
most
of
the
findings
of
previous
consumer
studies
on
the
influence
of
packaging
on
food
waste
behaviors
,
which
showed
instead
that
reduced
packaging
reduces
food
waste
.
</s>
<s>
These
inconsistent
results
may
be
due
to
the
particular
sample
and/or
an
oversight
of
some
effects
of
key
variables
(
e.
g.
,
the
effects
of
time
)
.
</s>
<s>
Hence
,
it
is
necessary
to
perform
a
confirmatory
study
of
these
experimental
studies
by
integrating
the
effect
of
time
,
to
investigate
the
causal
relationship
between
consumers
’
perceptions
towards
eco-design
packaging
and
their
food
waste
behaviors
.
