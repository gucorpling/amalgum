<s>
Dementia
is
a
global
health
problem
,
as
the
number
of
people
with
dementia
worldwide
may
exceed
82
million
by
2030
.
</s>
<s>
Dementia
and
the
decline
of
cognitive
function
greatly
contribute
to
disability
,
health
problems
,
and
social
care
needs
among
older
people
.
</s>
<s>
Because
there
is
no
current
cure
for
dementia
,
there
is
increasing
interest
in
the
identification
of
modifiable
factors
to
delay
or
prevent
dementia
onset
and
the
decline
of
cognitive
function
among
older
people
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
According
to
the
World
Health
Organization
’s
(
WHO
)
policy
framework
on
active
aging
,
social
relationships
are
a
key
factor
in
achieving
active
aging
and
a
potentially
important
modifiable
factor
that
can
decrease
cognitive
decline
.
</s>
<s>
Several
epidemiological
studies
have
suggested
that
rich
social
relationships
are
protective
against
cognitive
decline
and
the
onset
of
dementia
.
</s>
<s>
Rich
social
relationships
may
increase
cognitive
activity
and
prevent
low
mood
,
which
is
linked
to
delays
in
cognitive
decline
.
</s>
<s>
Studies
of
social
relationships
and
health
have
used
various
measurement
strategies
to
assess
social
relationships
.
</s>
<s>
One
type
of
strategy
uses
a
quantity-based
approach
to
measure
factors
such
as
the
number
of
social
ties
or
the
amount
of
participation
in
organizations
.
</s>
<s>
The
other
type
of
strategy
uses
a
quality-based
approach
to
measure
characteristics
such
as
the
nature
of
social
support
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Social
support
can
be
defined
as
an
exchange
between
persons
and
is
embedded
in
people
’s
social
networks
.
</s>
<s>
Social
support
is
exchanged
in
the
form
of
daily
assistance
,
care
,
financial
assistance
,
gift-giving
,
counseling
,
or
emotional
assurance
.
</s>
<s>
Previous
studies
have
suggested
that
social
support
has
protective
effects
against
cognitive
decline
and
dementia
onset
.
</s>
<s>
The
health
and
psychological
impact
of
social
support
may
vary
according
to
the
source
of
support
.
</s>
<s>
For
instance
,
social
support
from
friends
may
contribute
to
net
subjective
well-being
,
because
friends
are
typically
about
the
same
age
and
often
share
similar
cohort
experiences
,
lifestyles
,
and
residential
proximity
.
</s>
<s>
Support
within
the
family
,
particularly
from
spouses
,
is
often
the
main
source
of
support
in
old
age
and
has
positive
effects
,
but
there
may
be
gender
differences
in
support
.
</s>
<s>
Additionally
,
support
from
adult
children
is
not
necessarily
positive
,
as
relationships
with
children
are
often
stressful
and
sometimes
fraught
with
unwelcome
reciprocal
obligations
.
</s>
<s>
Although
it
is
important
to
understand
differences
in
the
effects
of
social
support
by
differentiating
between
support
sources
inside
(
coresiding
family
)
and
outside
(
non-coresiding
family
and
relatives
,
neighbors
,
and
friends
)
the
family
,
few
studies
have
examined
these
social
support
sources
separately
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
A
few
previous
studies
have
shown
that
different
sources
of
social
support
have
different
effects
.
</s>
<s>
One
cross-sectional
study
reported
that
family
support
was
protectively
associated
with
cognitive
function
among
older
people
,
but
support
from
friends
was
not
.
</s>
<s>
Another
study
found
that
support
from
friends
had
a
positive
effect
on
cognitive
function
.
</s>
<s>
In
a
longitudinal
study
,
Murata
et
al.
reported
that
social
support
from
family
,
but
not
from
relatives
and
friends
,
was
protective
against
cognitive
decline
.
</s>
<s>
In
contrast
,
Chen
and
Chang
found
that
emotional
support
from
friends
or
relatives
had
a
protective
effect
.
</s>
<s>
There
is
little
consensus
in
these
findings
owing
to
the
small
number
of
reports
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
we
aimed
to
examine
the
prospective
effect
of
different
sources
of
social
support
on
cognitive
function
among
community-dwelling
older
people
through
a
one-year
follow-up
.
