Nurses
play
a
major
role
in
managing
patients
,
and
the
nature
of
their
work
exposes
them
to
back
pain
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
present
study
,
the
one-year
prevalence
of
LBP
among
the
nurses
working
in
public
hospitals
was
74.8
%
.
</s>
<s>
The
finding
is
almost
similar
to
the
study
among
the
nurses
in
Switzerland
,
which
ranged
from
73
%
to
76
%
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
also
in
line
with
the
studies
in
Kuwait
,
Tunisia
,
and
Nepal
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
prevalence
was
lower
in
developed
countries
such
as
Canada
,
Ireland
,
and
Japan
.
</s>
<s>
The
prevalence
of
LBP
among
nurses
may
differ
between
developed
and
developing
countries
,
within
countries
,
and
across
the
region
.
</s>
<s>
The
differences
of
the
findings
could
be
due
to
the
difference
in
the
research
methodology
,
questionnaire
used
,
history
of
back
pain
among
nurses
,
and
self-report
of
the
disease
having
a
pattern
of
recurrence
and
reduction
.
</s>
<s>
On
top
of
that
,
the
application
of
back
hygiene
policy
and
workplace
interventions
also
play
a
major
role
in
the
differences
.
</s>
<s>
Despite
the
modernization
of
the
health
care
system
,
the
studies
in
Taiwan
and
South
Africa
reported
that
the
lifetime
prevalence
of
LBP
among
nurses
working
in
hospitals
was
82
%
and
84
%
,
respectively
.
</s>
<s>
It
indicates
that
regardless
of
the
modernization
status
of
the
country
,
pain
could
occur
if
there
were
no
preventive
measures
taken
while
working
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
present
study
shows
that
working
hours
play
a
significant
role
in
the
development
of
LBP
.
</s>
<s>
It
was
found
that
those
who
work
more
than
seven
hours
a
day
were
at
risk
of
LBP
as
compared
to
others
.
</s>
<s>
It
can
be
due
to
the
repetitive
exposure
to
excessive
work
,
such
as
lifting
a
heavy
object
,
which
leads
to
injury
to
the
lower
back
region
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
sometimes
they
need
to
work
a
few
hours
more
covering
for
their
colleagues
on
emergency
leave
or
when
there
is
lack
of
manpower
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
in
line
with
a
study
in
Jeddah
,
Saudi
Arabia
,
which
describes
that
nurses
who
worked
more
than
10
hours
a
day
had
an
increased
risk
of
LBP
compared
to
those
who
did
not
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
Shieh
et
al.
described
that
the
risk
of
LBP
increases
by
35
%
for
every
additional
daily
working
hour
.
</s>
<s>
As
a
result
,
it
was
suggested
that
the
work
schedule
of
nurses
needs
to
be
relooked
into
,
as
it
plays
a
significant
role
in
the
development
of
back
pain
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Nurses
usually
worked
longer
than
their
normal
schedule
because
of
the
shortage
of
registered
nurses
.
</s>
<s>
With
a
big
ratio
between
nurses
and
patients
,
the
risks
of
making
errors
were
significantly
increased
.
</s>
<s>
Fatigue
is
one
of
the
symptoms
that
arises
because
of
work
exhaustion
,
which
can
contribute
to
accidents
and
injuries
at
the
workplace
.
</s>
<s>
On
top
of
that
,
it
was
reported
that
the
incidence
of
LBP
is
increased
with
an
increase
in
working
hours
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
a
study
found
that
prolonged
working
hours
exposed
nurses
to
repeated
manual
handling
and
,
thus
,
sustained
the
accumulation
of
wears
and
tears
of
the
back
muscles
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Another
important
factor
in
the
development
of
LBP
is
manual
handling
performed
by
nurses
.
</s>
<s>
Many
nurses
in
Malaysia
are
still
required
to
manually
lift
patients
from
one
place
or
one
position
to
another
.
</s>
<s>
All
nurses
in
Malaysia
are
required
to
use
small
aids
like
sliding
sheets
to
move
patients
in
the
hospitals
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
present
study
found
a
significant
association
between
manual
handling
and
LBP
.
</s>
<s>
The
repetitive
work
exposes
them
to
injuries
,
especially
in
the
lumbar
area
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
caused
by
the
kinetic
imbalance
and
pressure
exerted
on
this
area
.
</s>
<s>
The
repeated
load
application
by
lifting
a
patient
may
result
in
cumulative
fatigue
and
reduction
in
the
stress-bearing
capacity
of
nurses
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Apart
from
lifting
patients
,
nurses
often
conduct
patient
handling
by
bending
their
waists
and
maintaining
an
uncomfortable
posture
toward
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
or
chair
.
</s>
<s>
This
position
increases
the
risk
of
back
pain
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
supported
by
a
study
in
the
Netherlands
and
Iran
,
which
found
that
the
bending
position
increases
the
risk
of
back
pain
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
in
the
present
study
,
the
bending
position
was
not
significantly
associated
with
the
development
of
LBP
.
</s>
<s>
This
difference
could
be
due
to
the
recall
bias
of
the
respondents
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Nurses
frequently
need
to
twist
their
bodies
while
handling
patients
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
present
study
,
this
has
a
significant
association
with
LBP
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
in
line
with
the
studies
in
India
and
Brazil
,
which
found
that
twisting
of
the
body
was
associated
with
LBP
.
</s>
<s>
On
top
of
that
,
back
muscle
fatigue
is
found
to
be
strongly
associated
with
decreased
postural
stability
especially
in
standing
position
.
</s>
<s>
The
present
study
revealed
that
there
was
a
significant
association
between
fatigue
and
LBP
.
</s>
<s>
This
can
be
explained
by
the
negative
influence
of
fatigue
on
the
muscle
receptors
and
thereby
on
proprioception
.
