<s>
The
principle
of
an
information
market
with
micropayments
is
simple
and
it
is
not
new
(
the
French
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel">
Minitel
</ref>
has
had
it
since
the
early
80s
)
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
There
are
currently
three
ways
to
put
info
on
the
web
:
</p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
for
free
(
but
who
pays
my
time
?
)
</item>
<item>
by
subscription
with
a
name
and
password
valid
for
a
certain
length
of
time
</item>
<item>
by
soliciting
advertisers
to
put
their
ads
on
the
site
</s>
</item>
</list>
<p>
<s>
Manner
1
can
only
if
I
have
other
sources
of
income
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Manner
2
is
used
often
but
puts
off
people
because
of
the
high
level
of
the
subscription
.
</s>
<s>
That
bars
the
reader
from
using
many
different
sites
,
e.g.
to
browse
many
newspapers
.
</s>
<s>
The
sum
of
the
subscriptions
is
too
high
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
For
example
:
I
sometimes
want
to
look
up
a
word
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">
Oxford
English
Dictionary
</ref>
,
but
not
so
often
that
I
find
it
worth
my
while
to
pay
for
the
subscription
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
I
ca
n't
use
it
at
all
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Manner
3
is
the
most
used
even
if
that
is
not
pleasant
for
the
user
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViaMichelin">
Via
Michelin
</ref>
,
an
excellent
service
,
has
recently
become
very
irritating
because
it
carries
so
much
advertising
,
in
addition
animated
as
well
so
that
it
is
difficult
to
concentrate
on
what
I
want
to
do
there
for
all
the
moving
stuff
.
</s>
<s>
Adverts
,
especially
the
animated
variety
,
is
a
pest
on
useful
sites
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
With
micropayments
and
digital
money
I
would
be
able
to
pay
Oxford
a
tiny
sum
for
each
time
I
consult
the
dictionary
,
but
without
having
to
pay
a
full
subscription
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
A
good
implementation
of
micropayments
must
also
provide
comfort
:
I
should
not
have
to
log
in
or
agree
,
my
computer
automatically
pays
behind
the
scenes
.
</s>
<s>
We
are
talking
here
of
sums
of
less
than
a
eurocent
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
And
I
could
of
course
set
limits
by
telling
the
browser
to
warn
me
if
I
spend
more
than
10
Euros
a
day
or
when
a
site
charges
more
than
a
cent
for
a
page
,
etc.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
this
way
I
could
read
the
news
in
several
papers
without
having
to
pay
a
complete
subscription
to
each
and
having
to
log
in
.
</s>
<s>
If
they
want
,
sites
can
of
course
also
distinguish
between
a
paying
entrance
after
which
there
are
no
more
adverts
and
things
work
faster
,
and
an
entrance
that
is
free
but
full
of
adverts
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
short
,
there
is
then
a
true
market
for
information
,
directly
between
the
seller
and
the
customer
.
</s>
<s>
Nothing
is
obligatory
,
but
a
lot
more
is
possible
.
</s>
<s>
With
the
Euro
it
is
now
perhaps
time
to
try
an
experiment
with
micropayments
.
