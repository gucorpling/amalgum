Sounds
a
bit
formal
but
that
is
how
politicians
usually
talk
,
guarded
and
a
totally
correct
response
,
the
trouble
is
that
if
they
spoke
from
the
heart
it
might
come
back
to
bite
them
one
day
,
but
I
did
talk
to
one
of
her
aides
privately
and
she
said
they
were
all
really
impressed
and
loved
the
concept
,
I
really
should
have
offered
to
paint
her
too
but
I
was
probably
flat
out
all
day
—
I
always
am
at
the
South
African
shows
.

about
the
quality

&quot;
[
Pricasso

achieved

good

I

painted
it
without

equipment

Most
people
are
impressed
when
they
see
it
done
,
skeptical
at
first
but
after
the
initial
shock
they
all
usually
stop
to
watch
until
I
finish
that
particular
painting
,
usually
they
take
about
15
minutes
