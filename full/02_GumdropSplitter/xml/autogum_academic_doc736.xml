Research

This

there

</s>
<s>
The
fact
that
the
majority
of
boys

speaking
turns
were
responses
to
the
teacher
indicates
a
more
passive
engagement
during
robotics
instruction
,
where
boys
primarily
speak
only
when
prompted
,
in
direct
response
to
a
teacher
’s
question

On
the
other
hand
,
the
girls
display
more
variation
in
their
speaking
turns
.
</s>
<s>
The
girls
speak
more
without
being
prompted
by
the
teacher
and
they
ask
more
questions
,
suggesting
a
more
active
engagement
with
the
teachers
during
instruction

</s>
<s>
The
types
of
responses
provided
by
children
to
teachers
further
support
gender
differences
in
level
of
engagement
.
</s>
<s>
Boys
provided
more
low-level
responses
to
teachers
’
questions
,
while
girls
provided
more
high-level
responses
and
responses
indicating
understanding

<s>
The
boys
are
interacting
with
teachers
in
a
reactive
way
,
providing
a
minimal
amount
of
detail
,
only
when
prompted

Alternatively
,
girls
are
more
interactive
with
teachers
,
expanding
the
discussion
,
and
providing
feedback
on
their
level
of
understanding

<s>
These
gender
differences
in
interaction
style
are
consistent
with
findings
from
typically
developing
children
showing
that
,
during
robotics
lessons
,
girls
ask
more
questions
and
initiate
more
conversation
in
STEM
classrooms

When
we
examined
the
types
of
instruction
and
feedback
provided
by
teachers
,
gender
differences
emerged
that
seem
to
align
with
gender
differences
in
children
’s
interaction
style
.
</s>
<s>
Teachers
asked
the
boys
more
questions
to
gather
information
,
while
they
asked
the
girls
more
rhetorical
questions
,
with
no
response
expected
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
possible
the
teachers
asked
more
questions
of
the
boys
to
counter
their
passive
role
,
trying
to
elicit
more
interaction
during
the
lesson
.
</s>
<s>
Given
that
the
girls
were
observed
to
be
more
actively
engaged
during
the
lesson
,
the
use
of
rhetorical
questions
seems
to
reflect
a
method
of
confirming
the
understanding
that
the
girls
display
in
their
speaking
turns
.
</s>
<s>
Teachers
also
confirmed
understanding
through
their
feedback
to
girls
,
as
they
provided
more
indications

correctness

praise

and
reassurance

Overall
,
gender
differences
observed
in
the
types
of
instruction
and
feedback
used
by
teachers
seem
to
be
in
response
to
the
differences
in
the
level
of
engagement
observed
between
boys
and
girls
in
the
robotics
lesson
.
</s>
<s>
The
speaking
turns
displayed
by
the
boys
suggests
they
are
passive
and
reactive
when
interacting
with
teachers
.
</s>
<s>
They
are
unlikely
to
have
a
speaking
turn
without
being
prompted
,
and
they
provide
minimal
detail
when
they
are
directly
prompted
to
provide
a
speaking
turn
.
</s>
<s>
Accordingly
,
in
the
all-boys
workshop
,
the
teachers
provided
more
prompts
to
gather
information
and
feedback
to
elicit
further
speaking
turns
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
speaking
turns
used
by
the
girls
indicate
interactive
engagement
in
the
robotics
lesson
,
providing
more
unprompted
contributions
to
the
lesson
,
and
high-level
responses
to
teacher
questions
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
the
teachers
in
the
all-girls
workshop
were
less
likely
to
prompt
speaking
turns
,
and
instead
they
provide
confirmation
of
the
girls
’
understanding
.
</s>
<s>
These
findings
are
consistent
with
research
showing
that
,
rather
than
reflecting
gender
bias
,
gender
differences
in
teacher
–
student
interaction
reflect
a
functional
response
from
the
teachers
to
differences
in
the
behaviours
of
boys
and
girls
