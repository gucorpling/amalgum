STAMP
treats
safety
as
a
control
problem
,
and
the
focus
of
system
safety
is
changed
from
preventing
failures
in
implementing
safety
constraints
.
</s>
<s>
It
still
contains
component
failures
,
but
it
extends
the
concept
of
accidental
causes
to
include
component
interactions
.
</s>
<s>
It
contains
three
main
concepts
:
safety
constraints
,
hierarchical
control
structures
,
and
process
models
.
</s>
<s>
The
most
basic
concept
in
STAMP
is
not
an
event
but
a
constraint
.
</s>
<s>
The
main
causes
of
safety
issues
in
the
new
theory
are
component
failures
,
system
external
disturbances
,
interactions
between
components
,
and
component
behaviors
that
lead
to
dangerous
system
states

The
safety
of
a
complex
system
is
more
than
component
failure
or
reliability
decline
.
</s>
<s>
In
STAMP
,
safety
is
an
emergent
or
system
property
,
rather
than
a
component
property
.
</s>
<s>
In
system
theory
,
complex
systems
are
viewed
as
a
hierarchy
of
organizational
levels
.
</s>
<s>
A
hierarchical
multilevel
model
of
stakeholders
is
posited
in
STAMP
,
like
the
model
of
Rasmussen
,
but
more
expanded
.
</s>
<s>
Another
basic
concept
in
STAMP
is
safety
constraints
.
</s>
<s>
In
system
theory
,
safety
can
be
regarded
as
an
emergent
which
is
originated
from
interactions
between
components
.
</s>
<s>
The
method
of
controlling
the
emergent
is
to
impose
constraints
on
the
behavior
of
the
components
and
the
interactions
between
the
components
.
</s>
<s>
Meanwhile
,
due
to
the
constraint
property
of
hierarchical
structure
,
the
accidents
will
happen
if
the
higher
layers
cannot
provide
enough
constraints
or
the
lower
layers
violate
the
safety
constraints
when
the
high-level
constraints
control
the
behavior
of
the
lower
layers
.
</s>
<s>
With
the
development
of
the
equipment
toward
automation
and
intelligent
,
the
system
becomes
more
and
more
complex
,
and
the
difficulty
in
identifying
and
executing
safety
constraints
in
design
and
operation
has
been
increased

Besides

models

a
third
basic
concept

that
of

models

The
process
model
is
an
important
part
of
the
control
theory

</s>
<s>
A
typical
process
model
consists
of
the
controller

the
controlled
object

controlled
process

<s>
When
the
controller
sends
a
command
to
controlled
process
,
the
corresponding
feedback
which
is
generated
by
controlled
process
will
be
sent
to
controller
to
form
a
complete
controlled
process

Component
interaction
accidents

often
be
interpreted
