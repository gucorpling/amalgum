Conclusions

<p>
<s>
Based
on
the
panel
data
of
Chinese
prefecture-level
cities
from
2007
to
2015
,
taking
the
large-scale
state-level
upgrade
of
HIDZ
in
2010
as
a
quasi-natural
experiment
,
the
paper
uses
the
PSM-DID
method
to
examine
the
impact
of
the
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
on
urban
innovation
efficiency
and
its
dynamic
effect
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
heterogeneity
analysis
based
on
the
scientific
research
level
of
local
higher
education
institutions
in
the
cities
is
conducted
.
</s>
<s>
The
conclusions
are
as
follows
:
First
,
the
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
has
significantly
promoted
the
urban
innovation
efficiency
,
the
positive
effect
gradually
being
strengthened
with
the
implementation
of
the
state-level
upgrade
policy
.
</s>
<s>
Second
,
the
higher
the
scientific
research
level
of
higher
education
institutions
in
the
cities
,
the
greater
the
positive
policy
effect
of
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
.

Urban
innovation
efficiency
is
an
appropriate
indicator
to
evaluate
fulfillment
of
the
state
mission
of
state-level
HIDZ
.
</s>
<s>
Compared
to
the
born
state-level
HIDZ
,
the
upgraded
one
faces
more
significant
opportunities
and
challenges
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
evaluating
the
policy
effect
of
the
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
from
the
perspective
of
urban
innovation
efficiency
,
the
paper
not
only
fills
a
gap
left
by
previous
studies
which
have
focused
mostly
on
the
total
or
originally
established
state-level
HIDZ
,
but
also
evaluates
the
state-level
upgrade
policy
more
accurately
,
thus
providing
more
effective
support
for
policy
adjustment
or
optimization
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Conclusions
of
this
paper
offer
two
policy
implications
:
</s>
<s>
First
,
the
state-level
upgrade
policy
of
province-level
HIDZ
should
be
unswervingly
implemented
in
China
.
</s>
<s>
Although
the
performance
of
the
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
is
weaker
than
the
born
ones
due
to
many
developmental
challenges
,
their
policy
effect
on
urban
innovation
efficiency
is
a
significant
positive
.
</s>
<s>
Additional
reasons
include
the
following
:
On
the
one
hand
,
the
state-level
upgrade
is
a
strategic
arrangement
for
optimizing
the
spatial
layout
of
HIDZ
,
and
it
will
help
to
speed
up
the
development
of
cities
with
weaker
growth
(
e.
g.
,
some
resource-based
cities
,
western
cities
,
and
other
poor
or
border
cities
)
,
thus
promotes
coordinated
regional
development
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
state-level
upgrade
is
also
an
incentive
and
“
spur
”
for
province-level
HIDZ
.
</s>
<s>
Before
the
upgrade
,
the
province-level
HIDZ
will
be
encouraged
to
make
it
eligible
for
state-level
upgrading
.
</s>
<s>
After
the
upgrade
,
the
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
will
be
spurred
to
grasp
huge
opportunities
as
they
ensue
,
making
good
use
of
the
latecomer
’s
advantages
to
fulfill
the
mission
of
leading
innovation
and
promoting
balanced
development
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Second
,
the
scientific
research
level
of
the
higher
education
institutions
in
the
cities
should
be
considered
in
the
development
of
the
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
,
as
well
as
the
qualification
assessment
of
the
province-level
HIDZ
to
upgrade
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
one
hand
,
for
the
existing
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
,
in
addition
to
taking
better
advantage
of
the
state-level
identity
based
on
their
own
characteristics
,
local
governments
should
also
pay
attention
to
the
cultivation
of
scientific
research
capabilities
of
higher
education
institutions
in
their
cities
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
way
,
the
innovative
factors
such
as
talents
and
achievements
in
scientific
research
will
be
continuously
prepared
for
the
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
to
boost
their
real
upgrade
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
for
the
province-level
HIDZ
who
intends
to
apply
for
state-level
upgrade
in
China
,
except
for
the
economic
performance
and
development
potential
,
the
scientific
research
level
of
the
local
higher
education
institutions
should
also
be
included
in
the
evaluation
criterion
of
the
upgrade
qualification
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
in
order
to
upgrade
the
province-level
HIDZ
,
the
local
governments
would
be
motivated
to
raise
the
scientific
research
level
of
higher
education
institutions
in
the
cities
,
and
this
will
help
to
achieve
a
virtuous
cycle
of
regional
innovation
and
development
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
There
are
also
several
limitations
in
the
paper
that
future
research
can
address
.
</s>
<s>
First
,
this
paper
’s
focus
is
on
the
state-level
upgrade
of
HIDZ
in
2010
,
while
there
are
more
than
100
HIDZ
that
were
upgraded
in
batches
since
2009
.
</s>
<s>
Future
research
can
further
expand
the
sample
to
evaluate
the
policy
effect
comprehensively
based
on
the
data
from
all
of
the
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
in
China
.
</s>
<s>
Second
,
due
to
the
problem
of
data
availability
,
the
paper
does
not
conduct
empirical
examination
on
the
mechanism
of
how
the
upgraded
state-level
HIDZ
affects
urban
innovation
efficiency
.
</s>
<s>
Future
work
can
further
optimize
research
design
and
provide
empirical
support
for
the
impact
mechanism
.
</s>
<s>
Finally
,
as
elaborated
in
the
report
of
the
19th
National
Congress
of
the
Communist
Party
of
China
,
it
is
necessary
to
build
a
coordinated
pattern
of
regional
development
based
on
city
clusters
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
the
policy
effect
of
the
establishment
and
upgrade
of
HIDZ
can
further
be
evaluated
at
the
dimension
of
city
clusters
.
