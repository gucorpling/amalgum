To

manufactured
in

In

Korea

studies
on

mostly
related
to
architectural
planning
,
such
as
planning
requirements
for
temporary
housing
facilities
,
construction
methodology
,
and
functional
demands
.
Kim
et

examined
different
types

plans
for
temporary
housing
relief
as
architectural
countermeasures
for
disaster
refugees
.
</s>
<s>
In
particular
,
they
classified

examined
time-series-type
structures
and
construction
methods
and
then
proposed
a
relief
housing
system
suitable
for
open
system
modular
housing
.
Moon
et
al.
mentioned
that
temporary
housing
is
affected
by
climate
,
structure
,
material
,
and
duration
of
use
,
with
structure
being
the
most
important
factor
.

They
demonstrated
that
fixed

portable
housing

The
relief

development

as
a
representative
study

Similarly

been
developed

In

need

actively

It

Zubair

showed

be
reduced
