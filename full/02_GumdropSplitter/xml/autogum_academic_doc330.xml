Urban
built-up
areas
are
generally
defined
as
the
urban
administrative
region
where
the
majority
of
the
area
has
been
developed
,
and
the
municipal
public
facilities
are
widely
available
.
</s>
<s>
These
areas
tend
to
have
a
higher
population
density
and
more
social-environmental
problems
than
their
surroundings
.
</s>
<s>
One
of
the
main
advantages
of
remote
sensing
technology
is
that
information
about
the
extents
and
elements
of
the
built-up
areas
can
be
identified
and
extracted
for
urban
planning
and
resource
management
,
risk
assessment
,
and
disaster
warning
.

<s>
Methods
for
extracting
and
analyzing
the
traditional
optical
remote
sensing
image
data
for
urban
built-up
areas
from
QuickBird

Systeme

Observation

la
Terre
(
SPOT
)
,
and
Moderate
Resolution

Spectroradiometer

MODIS
)
are
emerging
continuously
.

<s>
It
is
worth
stressing
that
the
Defense
Meteorological
Satellite
Program-Operational
Linescan
System
(
DMSP-OLS
)
nighttime
light
data
can
effectively
detect
city
lights
and
extract
information
about
cities
,
and
the
related
theories
and
technologies
have
driven
great
achievements
in
many
fields
,
such
as
the
extraction
of
urban
scope
,
the
monitoring
of
urban
expansion
changes
,
and
the
prediction
of
socioeconomic
factors
,
such
as

High-resolution
optical
remote
sensing
images
and
other
high-quality
land
cover
data
products
are
important
data
sources
for
the
extraction
of
urban
information
.
Li
et
al.
proposed
an
approach
to
detect
built-up
areas
by
using
unsupervised
learning
technology
,
which
was
based
on
remote
sensing
images
with
high
resolution
.
Chen
et
al.
developed
a
field-based
method
to
automatically
detect
built-up
areas
from
high-resolution
satellite
images
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
most
of
the
available
data
have
a
limited
temporal
coverage
,
which
limits
its
usefulness
for
dynamic
spatial
or
temporal
analysis
.
</s>
<s>
Problems
arise
when
the
same
object
exhibits
different
spectra
and
different
objects
exhibit
the
same
spectrum
.
</s>
<s>
If
results
are
interpreted
accurately
,
an
analysis
usually
requires
complex
computations
or
limited
accuracy
,
leading
to
time
consumption
and
instability
.
</s>
<s>
Additionally
,
most
high-resolution
data
and
the
associated
extraction
methods
are
mainly
limited
by
their
temporal
coverage
or
spatial
characteristics
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
labor-intensive
and
time-consuming
disadvantages
will
become
increasingly
obvious
when
considering
a
large
number
of
scenarios
.
</s>
<s>
Undoubtedly
,
these
are
the
manifestation
of
the
limited
usefulness
of
large-scale
studies
,
especially
those
predicated
on
urban
remote
sensing
,
such
as
urban
dynamic
analysis
and
geographical
condition
monitoring
.

Recent
advances
related
to
the
data
fusion
of
nighttime
light
data
and
other
daylight
images
aim
to
enable
feature
complementation
and
information
enhancement
and
are
potentially
useful
for
compensating
for
the
disadvantages
of
the
abovementioned
single
data
sources
in
extracting

information

Bhatti
proposed
a
novel
method
to
extract
built-up
areas
by
integrating
temperature
data
,
normalized
difference
vegetation
index
(
NDVI
)
,
and
the
modified
normalized
difference
water
index
(
MNDWI
)
,
which
improved
the
overall
accuracy
of
the
extraction
.
Lin
et
al.
proposed
a
maximum-entropy
method
for
extracting
urban
areas
from
data
collected
in
2000
,
2005
and
2010
by
combining
MODIS
surface
reflectance
,
MODIS
NDVI
,
and
DMSP-OLS
data
based
on
the
maximum-entropy
model
(
MAXENT
)
.
Zhou
et
al.
developed
a
cluster-based
method
to
estimate
the
optimal
thresholds
and
map
urban
extent
from
the
DMSP-OLS
NTL
data
based
on
the
cluster
size
and
overall
nighttime
light
magnitude
,
which
can
be
used
to
map
urban
areas
at
different
levels
.
</s>
<s>
Although
these
methods
can
reduce
the
issues
of
over-
and
underestimation
,
the
deficiencies
of
nighttime
light
data
resolution
,
such
as
the
overlapping
of
adjacent
pixels
,
geolocation
error
,
and
the
limited
temporal
coverage
of
the
data
products
,
can
still
be
considered
unavoidable
influencing
factors
.
Shi
et
al.
proposed
an
improved
Neighborhood
Focal
Statistic
(
NFS
)
method
based
on
nighttime
light
data
,
NDVI
data
,
and
water
vector
data
in
accordance
with
the
approximation
of
the
characterization
trend
of
each
urban
area
in
the
nighttime
light
data
and
digital
elevation
model
(
DEM
)
.
</s>
<s>
The
improved
NFS
method
primarily
identifies
central
and
marginal
urban
areas
using
maximum
and
minimum
NFS
calculations
based
on
the
DMSP-OLS
data
while
eliminating
vegetation
features
and
water
bodies
with
multisource
geographic
data
integration
to
optimally
extract
the
urban
areas
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
abovementioned
research
mainly
achieved
data
fusion
at
a
single
level
or
only
discussed
data
integration
from
the
perspective
of
GIS
(
i.
e.
,
an
overlay
analysis
)
.
Huang
et
al.
proposed
a
novel
ensemble
support
vector
machine
(
SVM
)
method
,
which
combined
multisource
data
(
including
remote
sensing
and
socioeconomic
data
)
.
</s>
<s>
The
core
concept
of
his
method
is
an
adaptive
thresholding
technique
,
which
can
be
used
to
identify
the
diverse
urban
characteristics
for
mapping
urban
areas
,
especially
for
prefecture-level
cities
.
</s>
<s>
Substantial
achievements
have
been
obtained
by
the
abovementioned
fusion
methods
,
especially
for
urban
information
extraction
from
high
resolution
images
,
nighttime
light
data
,
and
various
other
products
.
</s>
<s>
The
following
challenges
may
still
be
encountered
:
(

)
Since
urban
elements
are
characterized
from
different
remote
sensing
data
,
the
features
dependent
on
the
relevant
sample
selection
and
training
parameters
or
indices
have
not
been
comprehensively
considered
;
(

)
The
issue
of
differences
in
the
resolution
among
multisource
data
has
not
been
addressed
properly
.
</s>

Specifically
,
the
adverse
influences
of
the
extraction
result
accuracy
may
still
occur
regardless
of
the
adopted
fusion
method
