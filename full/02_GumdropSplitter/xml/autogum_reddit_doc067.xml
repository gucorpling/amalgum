So
I
’ll
do
my
best
to
keep
this
brief
.
</s>
<s>
My
son
is
8
months
old
and
has
been
going
to
daycare
2
days
a
week
for
about
a
month
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
a
really
nice
facility
with
large
classrooms
a
gym
and
a
playground
.
</s>
<s>
Aesthetically
speaking
it
is
a
10/10
.
</s>
<s>
My
wife
and
I
are
first
time
parents
so
we
are
n’t
sure
if
we
are
overreacting
and
so
I
guess
I
’m
looking
for
your
opinions
.
</s>
<s>
I
handle
drop
offs
in
the
morning
and
my
wife
“
Jen
”
does
pickups
on
her
way
home
from
work
.
</s>
<s>
We
have
been
noticing
things
lately
that
are
minor
but
when
put
together
seem
to
paint
a
worrisome
picture
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
:
</s>
<s>
It
took
them
2
weeks
to
assign
him
a
cubby
for
his
stuff
.
</s>
<s>
The
daily
report
is
n’t
always
filled
out
when
Jen
picks
him
up
.
</s>
<s>
Jen
then
has
to
ask
a
bunch
of
questions
about
the
day
in
order
to
know
how
things
went
.
</s>
<s>
We
live
in
the
northeast
and
finally
got
some
nice
weather
but
They
did
n’t
take
the
kids
outside
even
though
they
have
a
beautiful
fenced
in
playground
.
</s>
<s>
And
there
are
some
other
things
that
all
together
show
laziness
.
</s>
<s>
Now
for
what
I
consider
to
be
the
really
bad
part
.
</s>
<s>
Yesterday
the
school
sent
us
an
email
informing
us
that
teacher
appreciation
week
is
coming
up
.
</s>
<s>
They
have
events
planned
which
consist
of
Things
like
“
bring
breakfast
for
the
teachers
on
Monday
”
</s>
<s>
“
bring
flowers
on
Tuesday
”
</s>
<s>
“
lunch
on
Wednesday
”
etc
</s>
<s>
I
thought
this
was
a
little
strange
and
inconvenient
but
then
it
got
worse
.
</s>
<s>
Attached
to
the
email
was
what
I
can
only
describe
as
Christmas
lists
for
each
teacher
.
</s>
<s>
The
stores
they
want
gift
cards
to
.
</s>
<s>
Favorite
restaurants
etc.
</s>
<s>
The
lists
also
included
things
like
“
Victoria
secrets
gift
card
”
</s>
<s>
“
Jack
daniels
”
</s>
<s>
“
cash
money
”
.
</s>
<s>
ARE
YOU
KIDDING
ME
!
</s>
<s>
How
unprofessional
is
this
?
</s>
<s>
Do
other
daycares
do
this
?
</s>
<s>
This
place
seems
bad
and
I
think
we
are
pulling
him
out
.
</s>
<s>
Am
I
overreacting
?
</s>
<s>
It
feels
like
they
are
holding
me
hostage
.
</s>
<s>
If
I
do
n’t
buy
you
a
nice
gift
are
you
not
going
to
change
my
kids
diaper
?
I
’m
obviously
happy
to
participate
in
the
week
.
</s>
<s>
I
would
get
you
a
Starbucks
gift
card
or
something
but
this
just
seems
crazy
.

<s>
Thanks
for
listening
to
a
concerned
daddy

<s>
I
guess
I
must
be
in
the
minority
too
because
I
think
the
teacher
appreciation
week
is
completely
inappropriate
.
</s>
<s>
Do
n't
get
me
wrong
.
</s>
<s>
We
've
given
gift
cards
as
a
token
of
our
appreciation
at
Christmas
time
,
brought
the
teachers
chocolates
at
Valentine
's
Day
,
etc.
</s>
<s>
However
,
flat
out
asking
for
specific
gift
cards
and
making
a
whole
week
of
it
sounds
so
gift
grabby
.
