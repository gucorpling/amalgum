Most
of
us
have
played
sport
all
our
lives
,
but
there
's
a
difference
between
playing
sport
and
playing
sport
at
a
high
level
,
and
the
higher
level
you
go
,
the
more
specialized
you
tend
to
become
.

I
'm
not

five

performance

's
what
you

So
I
'll
play
everything

Going
to
a
completely
different
issue
,
blind
sports
have
three
classifications
,
that
are
medical
,
unlike
everybody
else
,
who
've
got
functional
ability
[
classifications
]
.

You
've
got
the
only
medical
ones

Do
you
think
the
blind
classifications
are
fair

how
they
operate

be
changes

I

the
system

is
good

in

three

<s>
I

those

work
really
well

</s>
<s>
I
guess
one
of
the
difficult
things
with
vision
impairment
is
that
there
are
so
many
diseases
and
conditions
that
everyone
's
sight
is
completely
different
,
and
they
have
that
problem
with
the
other
classes
as
well

But
in

sighted

one
's

the

just
outside
