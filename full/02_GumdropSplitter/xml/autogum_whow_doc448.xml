Take
care
in
choosing

</s>
<s>
Living
with
friends
can
either
be
a
very
rewarding
experience
or
a
very
trying
experience
,
depending
on
your
relationship
history
.
</s>
<s>
Some
of
the
benefits
of
living
with
friends
include
knowing
whether
or
not
they
're
reliable
.
</s>
<s>
You
have
an
idea
of
their
financial
history
and
whether
you
can
trust
them
to
pay
the
apartment
rent
on
time
.
</s>
<s>
With
friends
,
you
’re
more
likely
to
have
common
interests
and
even
common
friends
,
which
can
make
your
apartment
more
welcoming
for
visitors
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
knowing
each
other
well
brings
higher
expectations
,
which
can
sometimes
lead
to
disappointment
.
</s>
<s>
Often
it
is
better
to
share
an
apartment
with
acquaintances
-
people
you
know
enough
to
trust
–
rather
than
close
friends
.
</s>
<s>
Seeing
each
other
every
day
might
grate
on
each
other
’s
nerves
and
a
once
strong
friendship
might
quickly
sour
.
</s>

You
might
also
find
your
friendship
suffers

you
stop
spending
time
together
outside

<s>
Trust
your
instincts
when
it
comes
to
living
with
strangers
.
</s>
<s>
This
type
of
living
arrangement
is
a
good
way
to
expand
your
social
network
,
and
it
also
grants
you
more
independence
to
do
your
own
thing
–
strangers
are
less
likely
to
worry
about
your
comings
and
goings
.
</s>
<s>
But
if
their
social
skills
or
integrity
are
questionable
,
choose
another
apartment
or
another
roommate
.
Ask
for
personal
references
before
making
a
final
decision
on
a
potential
roommate
.
