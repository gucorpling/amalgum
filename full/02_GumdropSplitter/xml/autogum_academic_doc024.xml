Oxygen
deprivation
during
parturition
,
as
the
main
cause
of
stillbirth
,
may
be
caused
by
stretching
and
even
rupture
of
the
umbilical
cord
during
stage
II
(
expulsion
of
piglets
)
of
parturition
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
cumulative
effect
of
repeated
contractions
compressing
the
placenta
and
reducing
blood
flow
to
the
foetus
is
probably
more
important
.
</s>
<s>
Obstruction
of
blood
flow
to
the
foetus
induces
a
temporary
drop
in
heart
rate
,
which
in
itself
is
probably
harmless
and
an
adaptive
mechanism
of
the
foetus
to
reduce
its
oxygen
consumption
.
</s>
<s>
Repeated
episodes
of
obstructed
blood
flow
,
however
,
can
result
in
anaerobic
metabolism
,
the
cumulative
effect
of
which
is
an
increasing
lactate
level
in
foetal
blood
and
a
decreasing
foetal
blood
pH
as
buffering
capacity
is
exhausted
.
</s>
<s>
This
was
demonstrated
by
van
Dijk
,
et
al.
,
who
clamped
the
umbilical
cord
of
unborn
piglets
for
5
–
8
min
during
caesarean
section
,
to
simulate
the
cumulative
effect
of
oxygen
insufficiency
.
</s>
<s>
In
observational
studies
with
no
interventions
,
the
cumulative
effect
of
oxygen
deprivation
is
reflected
in
the
profound
effect
of
birth
order
on
asphyxia
symptoms
,
with
piglets
later
in
the
birth
order
showing
increasingly
higher
lactate
and
lower
pH
in
umbilical
cord
samples
at
birth
.
</s>
<s>
In
a
more
recent
study
,
the
total
duration
of
farrowing
was
shown
to
exacerbate
the
effect
of
birth
order
on
measures
of
asphyxia
and
on
the
risk
of
stillbirth
.
</s>
<s>
This
explains
why
stillbirth
rate
increases
with
birth
order

,
especially
in
sows
that
experience
a
prolonged
duration
of
farrowing
.
</s>
<s>
From
this
,
it
is
questionable
whether
birth
intervals
contribute
to
stillbirth
,
as
is
sometimes
suggested
.
</s>
<s>
In
fact
,
a
recent
study
showed
that
risk
of
stillbirth
only
started
to
increase
significantly
when
birth
interval
exceeded
90
min
,
whereas
the
duration
of
farrowing
increased
the
risk
cumulatively
with
every
2
h
that
elapsed
.
</s>
<s>
The
importance
of
the
cumulative
effect
of
contractions
is
supported
by
observations
from
Zerobin
and
Kündig
,
showing
that
inhibition
of
contractions
at
the
start
or
just
before
parturition
,
using
a
tocolytic
,
prolonged
parturition
without
increasing
stillbirths
.

<p>
<s>
It
is
not
clear
how
exactly
the
mechanics
of
foetal
expulsion
work
in
the
pig
.
</s>
<s>
Both
tubo-cervical
and
cervico-tubal
contractions
occur
during
parturition
,
the
first
obviously
serving
to
transport
foetuses
to
the
birth
canal
.
</s>
<s>
The
function
of
the
latter
is
less
clear
,
but
have
been
proposed
to
shorten
the
uterine
horn
and
to
prevent
accumulation
of
foetuses
at
the
caudal
end
,
thus
reducing
the
premature
rupture
of
the
umbilical
cord
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
respect
,
we
do
not
know
whether
before
being
expelled
,
foetuses
gradually
travel
through
the
uterine
horn
,
or
remain
positioned
at
their
implantation
site
and
only
travel
to
the
birth
canal
once
it
is
their
turn
.
</s>
<s>
These
two
scenarios
have
different
implications
for
the
oxygenation
for
the
foetus
.
</s>
<s>
In
prolonged
parturitions
,
placentae
may
also
start
to
detach
,
since
van
Rens
and
van
der
Lende
reported
that
in
contrast
to
short
parturitions
where
placentae
are
expelled
after
the
last
piglet
has
been
born
,
in
prolonged
parturitions
the
first
set
of
membranes
are
expelled
while
some
piglets
are
still
to
be
born
.

<s>
With
the
cumulative
duration
of
farrowing
and
birth
order
being
the
predominant
factors
determining
the
risk
of
stillbirth
,
other
piglet-related
factors
that
increase
this
risk
are
a
ruptured
umbilical
cord
,
breech
position
and
meconium
staining
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
percentage
of
piglets
born
with
a
ruptured
umbilical
cord
varies
widely
from
around
20
%
to
70
%
,
and
also
that
in
some
studies
this
percentage
increases
with
birth
order
,
whereas
in
others
it
is
constant
.
Around
50
%
or
more
of
stillbirths
are
associated
with
a
ruptured
umbilical
cord
,
which
suggests
that
this
is
an
important
risk
factor
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
when
expressed
as
the
relative
risk
,
a
ruptured
umbilical
cord
increases
the
risk
of
stillbirth
approximately
three-fold
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
much
less
compared
to
birth
order
and
length
of
parturition
.
</s>
<s>
In
short
parturitions
(
&lt;3
h
for
example
)
,
stillbirth
increased
ten-fold
between
the
first
and
the
last
piglets
in
the
birth
order
;
in
long
parturitions
,
stillbirth
increased
forty-fold
(
from
1
%
to
37
%
)
between
the
first
and
the
last
piglets
.
</s>
<s>
The
same
applies
to
meconium
staining
which
occurs
frequently
and
increases
the
relative
risk
by
around
three-fold
.
</s>
<s>
With
meconium
staining
it
is
also
difficult
to
assess
whether
it
is
a
consequence
of
asphyxia
,
or
whether
it
contributed
to
the
factors
leading
up
to
stillbirth
.
</s>
<s>
According
to
Randall
,
posterior
delivery
is
a
physiological
condition
in
pigs
and
not
associated
with
increased
risk
of
stillbirth
.
