My
sister
and
I
are
twins
,
and
have
never
been
very
close
.
</s>
<s>
We
’re
very
different
people
and
grew
up
under
really
difficult
circumstances
.
</s>
<s>
Our
parents
were
divorced
,
our
mom
was
a
drug
addict
,
and
our
dad
did
n’t
have
much
time
for
us
.
</s>
<s>
They
lived
on
opposite
sides
of
the
country
,
but
we
still
got
shuffled
between
us
because
our
mom
just
could
<hi rend="bold">
not
</hi>
take
care
of
us
when
we
were
kids
.
</s>
<s>
When
we
were
six
,
she
overdosed
and
we
got
transferred
to
our
dad
’s
care
.
</s>
<s>
She
got
sober
when
we
were
about
twelve
,
and
we
were
given
back
to
her
with
full
custody
since
our
dad
could
n’t
handle
us
anymore
.
</s>
<s>
He
was
always
busy
,
never
very
interested
in
either
of
us
,
but
my
sister
was
really
close
to
him
.
</s>
<s>
They
’re
really
similar-
my
sister
is
an
athlete
and
dancer
,
lots
of
energy
and
always
on
the
move

</s>
<s>
I
’m
more
of
a
bookworm
,
I
’m
a
little
antisocial
,
more
like
my
mom
.
</s>
<s>
My
sister
and
I
really
started
to
split
apart
when
we
went
back
with
our
mom
,
since
I
warmed
up
to
her
more
easily
and
my
sister
just
never
forgave
her
.
</s>
<s>
We
fought
a
lot
about
it
,
and
I
admittedly
did
n’t
respect
her
very
much
but
we
were
also
12
and
she
did
n’t
respect
me
either
.
</s>
<s>
We
still
loved
each
other
,
but
were
just
at
odds
.
</s>
<s>
After
she
moved
out
,
our
relationship
just
slowly
got
worse
and
worse
,
and
now
it
’s
like
acquaintances
instead
of
sisters
.

My
mom
and
I
are
really
close
,

I
’ve
fully
forgiven
her
.

<s>
She
’s
apologized
,
cared
for
us
,
and
I
felt
it
was
fine
.
</s>
<s>
I
’ve
also
since
come
to
understand
that
my
sister
is
n’t
obligated
to
love
our
mom
,
but
for
other
reasons
,
I
have
n’t
really
worked
to
repair
our
relationship
.

My
sister
has
made
a
life
for
herself

we
see
each
other
at
holidays

stuff

act
very
civilly
.

My
sister
has
continued
to
dance

play
sports

has
made

nice
career

it

I
’m
actually
super
proud

her

I
’ve
said
so

My
sister
was
in
a
really
rough
accident

ended
up
just
destroying
her
leg

the
bone
was
just
shattered

Her
doctors
have
told
her
that
it
’s
a
50-50
shot
she
’ll
be
able
to
do
what
she
used
to
do
,
especially
without
worries

pains

I
went
to
visit
my
sister
in
the
hospital

I
wanted
to
be
sure
she
was
okay

<s>
She
was
on
a
ton
of
painkillers
,
and
from
the
moment
I
walked
in
the
door
,
she
was
super
grumpy
and
angry
.
</s>
<s>
I
tried
to
see
if
I
could
do
anything
,
and
she
told
me
she
did
n’t
want
to
see
me
.
</s>
<s>
I
got
kind
of
confrontational
,
and
I
told
her
I
just
wanted
to
help
.

<s>
And
we
just
got
into
it
,
it
was
like
we
were
12
again
.
</s>
<s>
She
was
yelling
that
I
never
want
to
help
,
I
just
ruin
her
life
and
I
try
to
guilt
her
into
having
a
relationship
with
our
mom
(
I
’ve
done
it
when
I
was
much
younger
)
.
</s>
<s>
And
I
shouted
that
she
and
our
dad
just
excluded
me
when
we
were
kids
(
which
,
yeah
,
they
did
)
and
I
’d
never
felt
happy
with
her
.
</s>
<s>
And
she
starts
yelling
that
I
did
the
same
to
her
with
our
mom
,
and
she
does
n’t
even
feel
like
she
has
a
family
because
of
me
,
and
then
a
nurse
came
in
and
I
got
asked
to
leave
,
and
both
of
us
were
crying
,
and
I
was
just
SO
mad
.
</s>
<s>
Like
,
I
was
just
feeling
that
“
how
dare
she
?
”

<s>
But
I
feel
like
that
’s
not
right
.
</s>
<s>
It
was
3
days
ago
,

it
’s
just
been
eating
me
up

Should
I
apologize
?

Send
something

What
can
I
do

TL
;
DR
:
I
think
I
torpedoed
my
relationship
with
my
sister
for
good

<p>
<s>
No
doubt
she
's
in
a
lot
of
physical
pain
from
the
accident
,
and
emotional
pain
from
this
very
likely
being
a
career
ending
injury
(
even
if
she
is
in
the
lucky
50
%
,
it
will
be
a
long
road
back
and
a
huge
career
setback
)
.
</s>
<s>
And
in
that
state
,
she
lashed
out
at
you
because
you
were
there
.
</s>
<s>
I
'm
not
saying
it
was
fair
of
her
to
do
that
,
but
it
's
also
not
entirely
surprising
or
unexpected
.
</s>
<s>
That
's
why
she
dared
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
It
sounds
like
you
have
done
some
work
to
understand
your
past
,
and
that
's
great
that
you
do
n't
expect
her
to
ever
have
the
relationship
with
your
mom
that
you
have
rebuilt

</s>
<s>
If
you
are
still
seeing
a
therapist
,
I
think
what
happened
here
with
your
sister
would
be
a
great
thing
to
go
over
with
them
.

<s>
If
you
have
n't
ever
seen
a
therapist
,
I
would
seriously
consider
seeing
one
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
not
your
fault
that
your
sister
lashed
out
,
but
you
also
should
n't
expect
to
be
a
source
of
comfort
for
her
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
long
term
,
the
best
case
scenario
is
that
you
and
your
sister
see
a
family
therapist
together
to
work
through
everything
that
happened
so
you
can
see
each
other
as
victims
of
the
circumstances
that
you
endured
growing
up
.
