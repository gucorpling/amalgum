Klab
why
are
you
doing
that
to
my
poor
baby

<sp who="#naayo">
<p>

So
with
the
release
of
the
absolutely
gorgeous
new
set
I
could
n't
hold
it
anymore
and
I
went
full
salt
,
because
I
am
a
grown
up
woman
\*thumbs
up\*
</s>
<s>
Why
does
it
feel
like
Hanamaru
always
end
up
with
the
short
stick
in
every
set
she
's
the
UR
;
;
;
;
;
some
unidolized
are
still
good
(
but
honestly
,
the
school
uniform
?
?
even
YouDia
had
an
alternative
version
like
...
)
,
but
the
idolized
,
which
supposedly
are
the
big
ones
,
are
so
underwhelming
that
...
ugh
(
with
the
exception
of
Halloween
v2
in
my
opinion
,
but
in
5
UR
she
's
bound
to
have
at
least
one
good
lmao
)
.
</s>
<s>
I
'm
not
even
talking
about
quality
,
as
the
amount
of
detail
in
her
last
idolized
UR
is
astounding
but
...
it
seems
like
whenever
it
's
time
for
one
of
Maru
's
UR
,
they
decide
to
do
an
unpopular
or
seasonal
theme
.
</s>
<s>
It
happened
with
Animal
(
hoo
boi
do
n't
let
me
get
started
with
animal
)
,
between
Job
and
Angel
which
honestly
to
this
day
I
still
consider
them
one
of
the
best
sets
~~and
often
forget
about
Animal~~
,
and
it
happened
again
with
Teacher
.
</s>
<s>
Like
,
after
sets
like
Valentines
v2
and
Rock
,
you
give
me
a
teacher
set
?
</s>
<s>
and
right
after
that
they
go
on
again
with
the
beautiful
sets
?
</s>
<s>
Klab
what
has
Maru
done
to
you
.
</s>
<s>
And
ultimately
,
I
feel
like
even
her
SRs
have
been
dropping
in
quality
(
do
we
have
an
explanation
why
both
Mari
and
Maru
are
the
only
ones
in
the
Valentines
v2
set
without
and
alternative
hairstyle
?
</s>
<s>
Klab
do
you
even
try
)
.
</s>
<s>
I
sweat
to
god
if
in
the
second
half
of
the
set
she
does
n't
have
an
alternative
hairstyle
I
'm
gonna
flip
my
shit
.
</s>
<s>
ALSO
STOP
GIVING
HER
THAT
UGLY
ASS
GREEN
IT'S
NOT
EVEN
HER
COLOR
.
</s>
<s>
And
stop
with
the
boobs
and
ass
poses
she
's
like
,
15
.
</s>
<s>
I
know
this
is
all
very
subjective
and
I
am
be
the
only
one
raging
like
this
,
but
Maru
is
my
fave
and
besides
Halloween
and
Xmas
,
I
never
wanted
to
scout
for
any
of
her
other
URs
;
;
There
are
still
4
UR
left
in
their
first
cycle
of
sets
,
so
let
's
see
how
it
goes
.
^(hope
this
is
n't
violating
any
rules
.
was
n't
sure
if
i
could
make
a
post
on
its
own
or
put
it
in
the
weekly
free
talk

<s>
I
agree
that
best
girl
's
URs
are
cute
,
though
like
others
have
mentioned
,
underwhelming
.
compared
to
2nd
and
3rd
best
girls
Yohane
and
Dia
,
who
have
consistently
beautiful
,
popular
(
?
)
URs
,
none
of
Maru
's
URs
have
<hi rend="bold">
really
</hi>
impressed
me
.
part
of
it
I
think
is
the
3
generic
sets
she
's
gotten
,
but
Dia
got
Halloween
and
Job
URs
and
those
were
executed
well
imo
so
I
'm
not
sure
what
else
it
is
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
I
like
her
Halloween
UR
idolized
,
but
the
background
in
the
idolized
version
is
too
cluttered
for
me
and
detracts
from
Maru
herself
.
</s>
<s>
Animal
is
sadly
my
least
favorite
even
though
it
's
the
set
with
my
2
best
girls
and
my
OTP
,
because
of
things
often
complained
about
:
general
dislike
for
animal
sets
and
poor
execution
.
</s>
<s>
I
like
the
YohaMaru
scissors
reference
though
!
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
her
Teacher
UR
is
my
favorite
so
far
.
even
though
it
's
a
school
uniform
card
she
looks
adorable
,
it
's
a
set
that
fits
her
,
and
her
shorts
are
fine
so
it
does
n't
seem
fanservice-y
to
me
.
I
'm
hoping
we
get
that
stunning
,
gorgeous
Maru
UR
soon
.
