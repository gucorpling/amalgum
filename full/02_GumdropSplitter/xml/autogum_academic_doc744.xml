<p>
<s>
This
research
provides
insight
from
a
pre-
and
post-occupancy
longitudinal
study
of
low-carbon
development
residents
and
with
a
focus
on
tracking
the
pre-occupancy
practices
of
residents
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
as
this
research
has
shown
,
an
understanding
of
pre-occupancy
practices
allows
an
assessment
of
how
resident
practices
change
post-occupancy
when
interacting
with
the
design
and
technological
elements
of
a
low-carbon
development
.
</s>
<s>
There
were
distinct
changes
in
practice
occurring
when
the
technology
changes
in
households
.
</s>
<s>
Lower
household
water
consumption
levels
are
primarily
due
to
low
flow
fixtures
and
a
smaller
garden
to
water
.
</s>
<s>
Energy-efficient
lights
were
also
installed
to
reduce
operational
running
costs
of
the
home
.
</s>
<s>
The
changes
in
the
technology
used
to
heat
and
cool
the
home
also
influence
the
household
energy
use
.
</s>
<s>
Reverse
cycle
air
conditioners
have
less
energy
demand
when
running
on
the
heating
setting
than
gas
or
electric
oil
heaters
when
used
to
heat
a
large
space
.
</s>
<s>
Along
with
a
change
in
technology
used
in
the
practice
,
a
change
in
the
skills
of
the
resident
performing
the
practice
are
also
required
.
</s>
<s>
This
was
highlighted
through
the
personal
hygiene
practices
of
residents
.
</s>
<s>
Those
who
had
previously
had
access
to
a
bath
and
used
this
for
cleanliness
and
relaxation
,
post-occupancy
had
to
rely
on
a
shower
to
perform
this
task
instead
.
</s>
<s>
Some
residents
then
changed
their
practice
for
relaxation
to
a
visit
to
the
beach
.
</s>
<s>
The
HSOP
influence
on
household
energy
consumption
patterns
was
outlined
over
two
of
the
hottest
weekdays
and
weekends
of
the
monitoring
period
for
three
households
with
different
routines
.
</s>
<s>
The
marked
difference
in
energy
use
based
on
time
of
day
and
the
practices
being
performed
enable
an
understanding
of
the
increase
in
renewable
energy
and
battery
storage
options
.
</s>
<s>
The
HSOP
and
energy
consumption
patterns
will
often
remain
the
same
,
regardless
of
where
the
energy
is
sourced
from
,
which
will
be
a
consideration
for
builders
and
designers
of
low-carbon
development
and
energy-efficient
homes
and
technology
.

As
with
any
research
,
there
are
limitations
to
this
study
,
although
the
authors
have
tried
to
minimise
them
where
possible
.
</s>
<s>
The
limited
sample
size
may
have
affected
the
wider
implications
of
the
study
.
</s>
<s>
Residents
who
had
not
moved
in
to
the
low-carbon
development
by
the
beginning
of
2019
were
unable
to
participate
.
</s>
<s>
Future
research
might
include
a
larger
sample
size
of
residents
in
a
low-carbon
development
to
see
how
these
early
adopters
interact
with
the
design
and
technology
.

The
use
of
household
level
data
was
chosen
to
be
able
to
assess
the
influence
of
the
house
as
a
system
,
in
relation
to
the
social
practice
theory
development
of
a
HSOP
.
</s>
<s>
Without
intensive
monitoring
of
the
residents
,
accurate
individual
energy
and
water
use
is
difficult
to
estimate
.
</s>
<s>
The
authors
did
originally
divide
the
household
level
data
by
the
number
of
occupants
in
the
household
,
but
this
resulted
in
discrepancies
with
the
qualitative
findings
reported
by
residents
.
</s>
<s>
For
instance
,
household
C
had
three
adults
pre-occupancy
â€”
two
teenage
sons
and
their
mother
.
</s>
<s>
The
individual
data
showed
high
consumption
levels
per
individual
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
interview
revealed
that
the
mother
had
low-energy
and
water
consumption
levels
,
while
the
sons
would
have
long
showers
,
use
the
tumble
dryer
,
use
their
computers
extensively
and
leave
the
lights
on
.
</s>
<s>
This
highlights
the
intra
home
heterogeneity
in
the
performance
of
practices
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
There
were
a
number
of
households
pre-occupancy
who
did
not
have
access
to
their
energy
or
water
consumption
data
,
or
the
data
they
provided
was
only
for
a
few
months
a
year
.
</s>
<s>
The
authors
chose
not
to
use
this
incomplete
data
as
it
does
not
provide
an
accurate
reflection
of
household
energy
and
water
consumption
levels
.
</s>
<s>
This
has
reduced
the
households
with
available
pre-occupancy
data
and
influenced
the
extent
to
which
the
authors
could
comment
on
the
possible
impact
of
rebound
effects
.
</s>
<s>
Future
studies
might
aim
to
obtain
more
detailed
energy
and
water
data
both
pre-
and
post-occupancy
to
allow
for
this
area
of
research
to
be
explored
.
</s>
<s>
This
would
allow
for
the
statistical
analysis
of
changes
in
energy
and
water
consumption
to
be
undertaken
with
confidence
.
</s>
<s>
It
may
also
provide
an
opportunity
to
consider
other
methods
of
analysis
such
as
multi-criteria
analysis
or
the
model
