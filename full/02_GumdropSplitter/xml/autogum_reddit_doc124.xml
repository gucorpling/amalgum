Out
of
74

only
4
can
be
earned
in
game

95
%

you
must
pay

I
was
wondering
are
there
any
other
mounts
you
can
earn
in
game
or
are
the
4
horses
all
you
can
get
?
</s>
<s>
Currently
the
majority
of
mounts
released
are
all
through
Crown
Crate
.
</s>
<s>
Look
at
the
<ref target="https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/8dasjl/crown_crate_statistical_analysis_how_much_do/">
percentages
</ref>
they
are
absolutely
dreadful
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
not
a
F2P
game
.
</s>
<s>
You
have
to
buy
the
game
and
the
many
expansions
that
go
with
it
.
</s>
<s>
I
am
totally
fine
with
an
in
game
Shop
but
at
least
be
fair
to
us
.
</s>
<s>
Really
feels
like
they
do
n't
care
at
all
and
just
want
to
nickle
and
dime
us
as
much
as
possible
.

<s>
When
crown
crates
first
came
out
you
could
easily
get
400
Gems
with
15
or
so
crates
maybe
20
.
</s>

Now
you
are
lucky
to
get
100
gems
out
of
15
crates
.

To
the
people
saying
the
game
needs
to
make
money

<s>
I
am
not
asking
for
the
Store
to
be
taken
away
just
for
them
to
treat
us
fairly
.
</s>
<s>
We
do
purchase
the
game
and
expansions
so
this
is
not
a
f2p
game
there
is
no
reason
we
should
be
treated
like
it
s
a
f2p
game

</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
mind
having
a
store
at
all
it
is
actually
nice
for
quite
a
few
things
but
there
should
be
some
methods
to
earn
things
in
game
as
well
.
</s>
<s>
The
mounts
are
just
one
example
of
many
.

<s>
Since
2014
the
only
mounts
you
can
purchase
in
game
are
the
same
4
from
when
the
game
was
released
.
</s>
<s>
Also
with
recent
rulings
in
other
countries
I
imagine
crown
crates
would
be
deemed
gambling
in
those
countries
.

Which
it
obviously
is
.
</s>
<s>
I
consider
SWTOR
to
be
one
of
the
worst
F2P
models
in
the
history
of
gaming
yet
somehow
ESO
is
much
worse
in
some
ways
.
</s>
<s>
At
least
with
SWTOR
you
can
purchase
the
items
from
crates
on
the
auction
house
from
other
people
.
</s>
<s>
On
top
of
all
this
ESO
is
not
a
F2P
game
.
</s>
<s>
Just
because
it
s
been
around
a
while
does
not
mean
we
should
not
be
able
to
talk
about
it
.
</s>
<s>
I
respect
peoples
argument
and
defense
of
the
Crown
Crate
system
.
</s>
<s>
But
please
realize
we
are
allowed
to
critique
it
just
as
much
as
the
people
defending
it
