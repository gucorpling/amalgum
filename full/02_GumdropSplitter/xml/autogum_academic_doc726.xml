Introduction

<p>
<s>
Food
waste
reduction
efforts
are
motivated
by
concerns
over
resource
depletion
,
food
security
,
economic
costs
,
and
greenhouse
gas
mitigation
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
one
of
the
key
elements
of
the
sustainable
development
goals
(
SDG
)
is
targeting
the
food
waste
challenge
.
</s>
<s>
According
to
SDG
12
,
by
2030
,
per
capita
global
food
waste
among
consumers
and
retailers
should
be
cut
in
half
,
while
efforts
should
be
put
into
reducing
upstream
food
losses
.
</s>
<s>
Reducing
food
waste
is
also
a
prominent
measure
of
emissions
mitigation
,
as
part
of
SDG
13
,
which
calls
to
combat
climate
change
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
cutting
food
waste
will
contribute
to
reducing
the
adverse
environmental
impact
of
waste
management
within
cities
as
part
of
SDG
11
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
achieving
these
ambitious
goals
requires
improving
our
knowledge
on
reasons
behind
food
waste
,
especially
among
households
,
which
are
the
main
contributors
to
food
wastage
.
</s>
<s>
Acquiring
a
good
understanding
of
what
drives
food
waste
will
help
policy
makers
,
scholars
,
and
practitioners
to
design
and
share
good
prevention
practices
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
though
essential
for
designing
prevention
measures
,
evidence
on
why
food
waste
occurs
is
still
very
limited
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Current
studies
present
mixed
and
rather
contrasting
evidence
regarding
food
waste
determinants
.
</s>
<s>
They
also
rarely
provide
quantitative
measures
to
indicate
the
effectiveness
of
different
interventions
and
those
that
do
,
report
only
a
5
%
to
20
%
reduction
in
food
waste
generation
.
</s>
<s>
These
rather
low
performances
also
question
our
understanding
of
what
drives
households
to
waste
food
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
more
evidence-based
research
is
needed
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
A
major
barrier
toward
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
food
waste
drivers
is
the
fact
that
most
studies
rely
on
self-reports
,
which
are
difficult
to
verify
.
</s>
<s>
More
specifically
,
the
relationship
between
different
behaviors
,
attitudes
,
and
food
waste
quantities
has
been
almost
exclusively
explored
by
questionnaires
,
of
which
validity
has
been
recently
questioned
.
</s>
<s>
The
underlying
assumptions
of
self-reporting
is
that
respondents
(
1
)
are
able
to
recall
specific
waste
events
;
(
2
)
provide
a
proper
generalization
about
the
total
produced
amount
;
and
(
3
)
are
aware
of
all
food
waste
generated
by
other
household
members
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
some
degree
of
divergence
between
the
behaviors
and
attitudes
of
different
household
members
exist
,
and
therefore
responses
of
one
person
may
not
fully
reflect
the
household
as
a
whole
.
</s>
<s>
Another
critique
on
the
use
of
questionnaires
is
that
they
are
strongly
affected
by
the
‘
social
desirability
bias
’
,
i.
e.
,
participants
are
prone
to
report
on
what
they
believe
is
the
socially
desirable
behavior/attitude
,
which
leads
to
biased
waste
estimates
.
</s>
<s>
Biased
assessments
might
also
be
affected
by
a
‘
self-serving
bias
’
,
the
tendency
to
perceive
oneself
in
a
favorable
manner
,
which
leads
individuals
to
deny
responsibility
for
negative
environmental
behaviors
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Another
limit
of
self-reports
is
that
there
is
no
common
practice
to
assess
food
waste
behaviors
,
hence
,
cross-study
comparisons
are
practically
unfeasible
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
participants
in
Stefan
et
al.
and
Stancu
et
al.
were
asked
to
assess
the
relative
amount
of
food
waste
of
the
total
food
purchases
,
i.
e.
,
‘
food
waste
proportion
’
,
while
in
other
studies
‘
discarding
frequencies
’
were
recorded
and
respondents
were
asked
to
indicate
how
often
food
is
disposed
(
e.
g.
,
daily
,
weekly
,
never
,
most
mealtimes
)
.
</s>
<s>
Another
common
practice
is
reporting
‘
food
waste
amounts
’
,
expressed
by
different
measures
(
e.
g.
,
weight
,
cooking
units
,
Likert
scale
)
.
</s>
<s>
Other
researchers
chose
to
focus
on
‘
food
practices
’
(
e.
g.
,
to
what
extent
prevention
measures
are
taken
)
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
concern
about
biased
reports
has
led
researchers
to
call
for
field
work
involving
objective
measurements
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
so
far
,
only
two
studies
exploring
the
relation
between
food
waste
and
its
proposed
drivers
have
used
an
alternative
approach
that
does
not
rely
merely
on
self-reports
.

In
the
first
study
,
Grainger
et
al.
analyzed
the
Waste
and
Resources
Action
Program
database
.
</s>
<s>
This
database
included
statistics
regarding
objective
amount
of
avoidable
household
food
waste
(
the
terms
‘
avoidable
food
waste
’
,
‘
food
waste
’
,
and
‘
food
wastage
’
are
being
used
alternately
throughout
the
paper
to
describe
edible
,
avoidable
food
discarded
by
households

through
a
physical

<s>
Household
size
,
the
presence
of
fussy
eaters
,
employment
status
,
home
ownership
status
,
and
the
local
authority
were
all
identified
as
main
drivers
of
food
waste

Grainger

found
no
significant
effect
of
any
of
the
behavioral
factors
