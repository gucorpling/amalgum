I
spend
most
of
my
free
time
alone
and
i
do
nt
mind
it
much
,
untill
i
start
seeing
friends
or
people
i
know
hang
out
and
go
to
fun
places
on
facebook
.
</s>
<s>
I
'm
not
really
a
hated
person
and
i
have
a
few
friends
,
but
i
'm
just
never
invited
anywhere
,
therefore
i
have
no
solid
or
true
friendships
,
i
honestly
feel
sad
sometimes
.
</s>
<s>
So
whats
the
reason
for
that
?
</s>
<s>
Sometimes
i
think
its
because
i
'm
not
that
interesting
,
or
maybe
just
look
unfriendly
,
or
maybe
because
i
do
n't
follow
people
and
leave
a
social
gathering
faster
than
anyone(
its
more
of
an
escape
because
i
'm
sacred
they
find
me
uniteresting
)
So
do
you
guys
know
a
reason
for
this
?
</s>
<s>
Or
have
any
solutions
?

<s>
How
can
i
build
solid
relationship
and
get
invited
to
event
like
most
people
?

<s>
the
best
advice
i
can
give
is
to
go
out
alone
and
just
approach
people
.

<s>
If
the
people
in
your
life
do
n't
give
a
damn
,
you
do
n't
owe
them
anything

Go

places

events
you
're
interested

have
genuine
fun

Life
is
suffering
homie
.
plain
and
simple
,
we
bond
over
our
mutual
struggles
and
interests
,
what
people
seek
out
the
most
is
someone
who
can
make
their
life
bearable
and
entertain
them
.
</s>
<s>
The
key
is
if
you
can
make
yourself
happy
you
can
make
others
happy
,
that
's
how
you
take
control
of
your
life
,
your
circle
and
your
social
interactions
.
</s>
<s>
Make
people
rise
to
your
level
,
do
n't
grovel
for
their
attention
or
seek
it
out
if
they
're
not
seeking
you
.
the
best
gift
you
can
give
to
others
is
to
make
the
most
of
yourself
remember
that
and
repeat
it
.
let
the
fakes
and
haters
stay
where
they
are

love
is
not
possible
without
personal
growth

self
respect

love
actually
develops
naturally

those
2
things
are
a
solid
part
of
your
personality
and
life

I
think
you
need
to
stop
thinking
you
're
uninteresting
first
.
</s>
<s>
When
you
're
out
hanging
out
,
remember
that
it
's
also
for
you
,
so
try
to
enjoy
it
in
whatever
way
you
like
,
while
still
maintaining
polite
manners
.

<s>
You
are
n't
out
there
to
entertain
and
perform
,
you
're
there
to
hang
out
and
have
fun

<s>
Basically
,
do
n't
force
it
too
much

Try
what
jokes
stories
you
may
have
in

do
n't
necessarily

do

I

the
only

<s>
It
's
really
tough
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
socialise
intially
because
the
problem
can
be
very
hard
to
pinpoint
sometimes
,
but
just
keep
trial
and
error
and
im
sure
you
'll
get
closer
to
figuring
it
out
.
