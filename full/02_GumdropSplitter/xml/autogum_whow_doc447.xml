Living
with
strangers
,
or
even
friends
,
can
be
challenging
–
especially
if
it
's
your
first
time
living
away
from
home
.

Compromise
on
the
bedrooms
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
rare
that
apartments
have
rooms
of
equal
size
.
</s>
<s>
As
a
result
,
some
people
might
feel
they
've
got
the
short
end
of
the
stick
when
they
do
n't
end
up
with
the
master
bedroom
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
there
is
a
happy
solution
for
helping
roommates
opt
for
smaller
or
less
attractive
rooms
–
make
them
cheaper
.
</s>
<s>
You
know
what
you
're
collectively
expected
to
pay
for
monthly
rent
,
but
how
you
divide
this
cost
is
up
to
you
.
</s>
<s>
People
with
larger
bedrooms
pay
more
;
people
with
smaller
bedrooms
pay
less
.
</s>
<s>
Usually
this
works
out
because
there
is
always
somebody
who
has
more
possessions
to
accommodate
in
the
apartment
and
somebody
else
who
is
trying
to
save
money
.

<s>
Divide
up
the
bills
evenly
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
the
most
important
,
and
divisive
,
issue
in
every
apartment
–
who
pays
for
what
and
when
.
</s>
<s>
There
are
several
strategies
to
handle
the
apartment
bills
.
</s>
<s>
All
roommates
could
take
responsibility
by
having
a
bill
in
their
name
so
each
person
receives
a
bill
,
rather
than
all
bills
being
directed
to
just
one
person
.
</s>
<s>
This
avoids
the
risk
of
one
roommate
being
left
to
pay
out
of
their
own
pocket
if
others
miss
payments
or
leave
the
apartment
.
</s>
<s>
Setting
up
automatic
payments
for
each
individual
's
monthly
expenses
takes
the
hassle
out
of
remembering
or
encouraging
your
roommates
to
pay
on
time
.
</s>
<s>
Another
solution
is
to
open
an
apartment
bank
account
,
which
everybody
automatically
pays
into
each
week
to
cover
bills
and
expenses
,
including
food
.
</s>
<s>
Set
up
a
day
every
month
,
perhaps
the
last
Sunday
,
to
reconcile
your
bills
and
issues
so
you
can
feel
confident
that
the
rent
and
bills
will
be
paid
on
time
.

Divvy
up
the
duties
.
</s>
<s>
Nobody
likes
doing
the
dishes
or
taking
out
the
garbage
,
but
it
needs
to
be
done
.
</s>
<s>
Have
a
duties
roster
with
clearly
assigned
roles
for
each
day
.
</s>
<s>
Your
roommates
will
learn
to
get
into
the
groove
of
doing
chores
and
will
understand
that
everyone
must
pull
their
weight
.
</s>
<s>
Dishes
can
be
a
subject
of
contention
.
</s>
<s>
Make
it
clear
whether
people
are
responsible
for
just
their
own
dishes
,
or
if
they
are
all
assigned
particular
dish
days
.

Make
sure
everyone
is
comfortable
.
</s>
<s>
Maybe
one
roommate
likes
listening
to
heavy
metal
,
one
is
a
TV
addict
and
another
likes
to
smoke
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
important
to
find
the
balance
between
enjoying
your
interests
and
hobbies
and
respecting
others
'
rights
not
to
share
in
these
.
</s>
<s>
Smokers
should
smoke
outside
,
especially
if
your
apartment
is
smoke-free
.
</s>
<s>
Your
music
should
not
interfere
with
your
roommates
,
unless
by
agreement
.
</s>
<s>
Do
n't
let
any
one
person
dominate
the
TV
.
</s>
<s>
If
the
TV
is
a
concern
for
you
,
buy
or
borrow
an
additional
TV
for
your
room
.
</s>
<s>
Respecting
each
other
's
privacy
and
comfort
,
and
taking
the
time
to
get
to
know
each
other
,
will
go
a
long
way
towards
creating
a
harmonious
apartment
environment
.
