I

When

the

actually
sent
out
a
list

made

I

not

I

When
I
found
out
about

I
reached
out
on
my
own
to
the
bankruptcy

said
,
&quot;
Hey
,
Tim
gave
me
$
10,000

I

need

do

&quot;
And
they
were
shocked

They
could
n't
believe
it

they
were
trying
so
hard
to
get
all
this
other
money
that
you
mentioned
back

they
were
not
getting
much
cooperation

I

all

I
also
believe
only
one
man

Earth
