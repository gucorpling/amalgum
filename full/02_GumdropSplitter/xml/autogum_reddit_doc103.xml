Please
do
n't
take
this
post
as
a
knock
on
the
game
,
quite
the
contrary
-
I
'm
super
interested
in
this
game
,
I
know
what
it
's
about
and
how
it
will
play
.
</s>
<s>
My
mmorpg
roots
span
back
to
very
beginnings
UO
and
EQ
,
I
remember
those
games
well
and
the
time
commitment
they
took
.
</s>
<s>
I
've
played
basically
all
the
major
mmorpgs
since
then
,
stuff
like
SWG
,
L2
,
Shadowbane
,
FFXI
,
WoW
and
so
on
.
</s>
<s>
I
remember
how
EQ
played
and
I
have
extensive
experience
with
Lineage
2
a
few
years
later
which
was
a
similar
camping
type
of
game
(
in
my
opinion
)
.
</s>
<s>
I
know
you
guys
are
passionate
so
here
comes
the
controversial
part
.
</s>
<s>
I
know
what
this
game
is
,
but
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
being
able
to
jump
into
a
game
if
you
only
have
an
hour
or
two
and
feel
like
you
had
a
good
play
session
.
</s>
<s>
I
understand
the
grouping
aspect
and
I
'm
not
asking
them
to
change
it
and
I
'm
not
saying
it
should
be
any
different
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
if
I
ca
n't
solo
at
all
-
would
this
game
even
be
worth
trying
to
get
into
with
1-2
hours
of
play
in
a
session
?
I
have
memories
of
desperately
wanting
to
play
a
game
like
FFXI
(
back
when
I
had
a
lot
of
time
)
but
not
being
able
to
find
a
group
,
nudging
along
by
killing
what
enemies
I
could
alone
.
</s>
<s>
That
's
not
to
say
I
do
n't
have
very
fond
memories
of
that
game
as
well
when
things
were
going
well
and
I
had
time
and
I
had
a
good
group
.
</s>
<s>
The
one
caveat
could
be
,
while
it
may
not
be
my
first
choice
,
I
do
n't
mind
playing
a
tank
or
healer
or
maybe
even
a
support
class
to
help
find
groups
faster
.
</s>
<s>
So
,
while
I
'm
very
interested
in
this
game
and
truly
ca
n't
wait
to
play
it
,
my
biggest
fear
is
I
wo
n't
have
time
to
.
</s>
<s>
I
am
considering
getting
an
alpha
pledge
but
if
you
guys
think
this
will
be
all
for
not
,
I
would
probably
look
elsewhere
.
</s>
<s>
I
'm
really
interested
to
see
how
they
help
facilitate
grouping
in
this
game
.
</s>
<s>
Trust
me
I
do
n't
want
to
hit
a
button
and
be
pug
'd
into
some
random
dungeon
for
a
daily
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
want
that
at
all
.
</s>
<s>
Is
there
a
middle
ground
?
tldr
;
So
,
to
the
question
.
</s>
<s>
Fast
forward
to
today
,
I
have
an
office
job
,
typically
45-50
hours
per
week
.
</s>
<s>
Typical
day
once
I
get
home
and
settled
I
can
typically
game
from
9-11:30ish
.
</s>
<s>
So
,
2.5-3
hours
max
per
night
,
most
nights
.
</s>
<s>
Sometimes
more
,
sometimes
less
.
</s>
<s>
Knowing
what
everyone
knows
about
this
game
,
is
that
enough
?
</s>
<s>
Should
I
bother
getting
excited
about
this
game
?

Just
need
to

<s>
Play
at
your
own
pace
,
make
friends
,
join
a
casual
guild

</s>
<s>
If
you
like
crafting
that
can

be
a
way

spend
days

you
are
short
on
playtime

<p>
<s>
I
still
remember
a
dwarf
I
asked
to
join
our
group
and
he
said
“
Thanks
,
but
today
is
my
day
at
the
forge
”
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Point
is
,
put
in
some
time
here
and
there
,
set
smaller
goals
and
use
weekends
to
put
in
some
real
work
:
)
If
you
find
some
friends
and
coordinate
a
bit
its
always
possible
to
set
up
a
full
group
run
and
get
assembled
in
minutes
after
logging
in
to
maximize
time
in
dungeons
.
