a
teenager
in

sixties

protesting
with
the
long
hair
,
running
around
with
the
hippies
—
I
realized
when
I
looked
at
all
the
guys
we
were
supposed
to
hate
so
much
and
resent
,
I
kind
of
analyzed
what
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/complacency">
complacency
</ref>
was
,
and
they
seemed
complacent
to
me
.
</s>
<s>
They
reached
a
point
in
their
lives
where
they
felt
good
about
themselves
and
just
cause
a
bunch
of
kids
come
along
that
were
popping
drugs
and
accusing
you
of
this
and
that
and
being
the
man
and
everything
,
you
think
your
feelings
states
are
never
going
to
change
.
</s>
<s>
And
I
used
to
say
they
’re
complacent
.
</s>
<s>
But
the
thing
is
that
everybody
that
’s
born
pretty
much
has
to
reach
that
point
where
they
’re
looking
down
the
barrel
of
their
own
complacency
