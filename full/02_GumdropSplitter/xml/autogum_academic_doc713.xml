As
acknowledged
by
the
Commission
of
the
European
Communities
(
2007
,
18
)
,
“
accounting
for
deferred
taxes
…
is
very
burdensome
for
companies
in
general
,
”
whereas
“
it
has
been
confirmed
by
preparers
and
users
,
e.
g.
,
credit
institutions
and
rating
agencies
,
that
deferred
tax
information
(
whether
recognized
in
the
balance
sheet
or
provided
in
the
notes
)
often
is
not
considered
a
relevant
input
for
the
decisions
to
be
taken
”
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
We
examine
the
incremental
effect
of
IFRS
relative
to
the
usefulness
of
information
content
of
deferred
tax
balance
for
loss
reporting
firms
using
evidence
from
Korea
.
</s>
<s>
We
expect
that
if
IFRS
adoption
allows
a
firm
greater
flexibility
in
recognizing
as
deferred
tax
balance
,
then
deferred
tax
disclosures
will
provide
little
information
about
the
potential
earnings
sustainability
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
We
develop
a
classification
scheme
that
uses
deferred
tax
expense
according
to
Dhaliwal
et
al.
(
2013
)
.
</s>
<s>
We
also
first
examine
whether
IFRS
adoption
affects
the
information
about
loss
reversal
or
loss
persistency
,
including
multiple
determinants
of
tax
categories
,
and
their
control
variables
.
</s>
<s>
Both
the
loss
reversal
model
and
the
loss
persistence
model
results
show
that
tax
categories
provide
incremental
information
before
IFRS
,
but
after
IFRS
information
about
loss
reversal
or
loss
persistency
disappears
in
its
usefulness
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Finally
,
we
extended
previous
research
on
the
pricing
of
tax
information
.
</s>
<s>
Our
results
suggest
that
investors
generally
underweight
their
deferred
tax
balance
before
IFRS
,
but
after
IFRS
adoption
,
investors
cannot
obtain
buy-and-hold
returns
by
buying
GN
firm-years
and
selling
BN
firm-years
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
this
is
not
because
investors
understand
the
information
of
DTAs
,
but
because
the
usefulness
of
the
information
of
DTAs
deteriorates
after
IFRS
adoption
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Our
study
has
two
important
limitations
.
</s>
<s>
First
,
although
we
try
to
control
the
various
effects
associated
with
adopting
IFRS
,
our
research
is
probably
not
free
of
endogeneity
issues
.
</s>
<s>
Second
,
our
tests
are
based
on
only
4
years
of
post-adoption
data
.
</s>
<s>
The
information
effect
we
suggest
may
not
persist
in
the
long
period
as
user
’s
familiarity
with
the
implementation
of
standards
increases
and/or
the
quality
of
financial
reporting
improves
due
to
the
monitoring
effect
of
users
of
financial
information
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
We
believe
our
findings
have
implications
for
the
application
of
IFRS
.
</s>
<s>
First
,
although
existing
research
analyzes
the
overall
impact
of
introducing
IFRS
,
our
research
focuses
on
specific
issues
related
to
tax
accounting
.
</s>
<s>
Specifically
,
this
study
shows
that
the
flexible
interpretation
of
accounting
standards
related
to
tax
accounting
can
reduce
the
quality
of
information
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
We
use
a
unique
setting
because
,
under
IAS
No.
12
,
only
the
recognition
criteria
related
to
the
tax
information
were
relaxed
in
Korea
,
while
the
estimation
method
for
deferred
taxes
remains
unchanged
.
</s>
<s>
We
suggest
that
our
setting
provides
evidence
regarding
the
inherent
flexibility
of
IFRS
.
