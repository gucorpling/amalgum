The
letters
of
my
friend
Mr.
Stark
Munro
appear
to
me
to
form
so
connected
a
whole
,
and
to
give
so
plain
an
account
of
some
of
the
troubles
which
a
young
man
may
be
called
upon
to
face
right
away
at
the
outset
of
his
career
,
that
I
have
handed
them
over
to
the
gentleman
who
is
about
to
edit
them
.
</s>
<s>
There
are
two
of
them
,
the
fifth
and
the
ninth
,
from
which
some
excisions
are
necessary
;
but
in
the
main
I
hope
that
they
may
be
reproduced
as
they
stand
.
</s>
<s>
I
am
sure
that
there
is
no
privilege
which
my
friend
would
value
more
highly
than
the
thought
that
some
other
young
man
,
harassed
by
the
needs
of
this
world
and
doubts
of
the
next
,
should
have
gotten
strength
by
reading
how
a
brother
had
passed
down
the
valley
of
shadow
before
him
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
I
have
missed
you
very
much
since
your
return
to
America
,
my
dear
Bertie
,
for
you
are
the
one
man
upon
this
earth
to
whom
I
have
ever
been
able
to
unreservedly
open
my
whole
mind
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n’t
know
why
it
is
;
for
,
now
that
I
come
to
think
of
it
,
I
have
never
enjoyed
very
much
of
your
confidence
in
return
.
</s>
<s>
But
that
may
be
my
fault
.
</s>
<s>
Perhaps
you
do
n’t
find
me
sympathetic
,
even
though
I
have
every
wish
to
be
.
</s>
<s>
I
can
only
say
that
I
find
you
intensely
so
,
and
perhaps
I
presume
too
much
upon
the
fact
.
</s>
<s>
But
no
,
every
instinct
in
my
nature
tells
me
that
I
do
n’t
bore
you
by
my
confidences
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Can
you
remember
Cullingworth
at
the
University
?
</s>
<s>
You
never
were
in
the
athletic
set
,
and
so
it
is
possible
that
you
do
n’t
.
</s>
<s>
Anyway
,
I
’ll
take
it
for
granted
that
you
do
n’t
,
and
explain
it
all
from
the
beginning
.
</s>
<s>
I
’m
sure
that
you
would
know
his
photograph
,
however
,
for
the
reason
that
he
was
the
ugliest
and
queerest-looking
man
of
our
year
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Physically
he
was
a
fine
athlete
--
one
of
the
fastest
and
most
determined
Rugby
forwards
that
I
have
ever
known
,
though
he
played
so
savage
a
game
that
he
was
never
given
his
international
cap.
</s>
<s>
He
was
well-grown
,
five
foot
nine
perhaps
,
with
square
shoulders
,
an
arching
chest
,
and
a
quick
jerky
way
of
walking
.
</s>
<s>
He
had
a
round
strong
head
,
bristling
with
short
wiry
black
hair
.
</s>
<s>
His
face
was
wonderfully
ugly
,
but
it
was
the
ugliness
of
character
,
which
is
as
attractive
as
beauty
.
</s>
<s>
His
jaw
and
eyebrows
were
scraggy
and
rough-hewn
,
his
nose
aggressive
and
red-shot
,
his
eyes
small
and
near
set
,
light
blue
in
colour
,
and
capable
of
assuming
a
very
genial
and
also
an
exceedingly
vindictive
expression
.
</s>
<s>
A
slight
wiry
moustache
covered
his
upper
lip
,
and
his
teeth
were
yellow
,
strong
,
and
overlapping
.
</s>
<s>
Add
to
this
that
he
seldom
wore
collar
or
necktie
,
that
his
throat
was
the
colour
and
texture
of
the
bark
of
a
Scotch
fir
,
and
that
he
had
a
voice
and
especially
a
laugh
like
a
bull
’s
bellow
.
</s>
<s>
Then
you
have
some
idea
(
if
you
can
piece
all
these
items
in
your
mind
)
of
the
outward
James
Cullingworth
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
But
the
inner
man
,
after
all
,
was
what
was
most
worth
noting
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n’t
pretend
to
know
what
genius
is
.
Carlyle
’s
definition
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
very
crisp
and
clear
statement
of
what
it
is
NOT
.
</s>
<s>
Far
from
its
being
an
infinite
capacity
for
taking
pains
,
its
leading
characteristic
,
as
far
as
I
have
ever
been
able
to
observe
it
,
has
been
that
it
allows
the
possessor
of
it
to
attain
results
by
a
sort
of
instinct
which
other
men
could
only
reach
by
hard
work
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
sense
Cullingworth
was
the
greatest
genius
that
I
have
ever
known
.
</s>
<s>
He
never
seemed
to
work
,
and
yet
he
took
the
anatomy
prize
over
the
heads
of
all
the
ten-hour-a-day
men
.
</s>
<s>
That
might
not
count
for
much
,
for
he
was
quite
capable
of
idling
ostentatiously
all
day
and
then
reading
desperately
all
night
;
but
start
a
subject
of
your
own
for
him
,
and
then
see
his
originality
and
strength
.
</s>
<s>
Talk
about
torpedoes
,
and
he
would
catch
up
a
pencil
,
and
on
the
back
of
an
old
envelope
from
his
pocket
he
would
sketch
out
some
novel
contrivance
for
piercing
a
ship
’s
netting
and
getting
at
her
side
,
which
might
no
doubt
involve
some
technical
impossibility
,
but
which
would
at
least
be
quite
plausible
and
new
.
Then
as
he
drew
,
his
bristling
eyebrows
would
contract
,
his
small
eyes
would
gleam
with
excitement
,
his
lips
would
be
pressed
together
,
and
he
would
end
by
banging
on
the
paper
with
his
open
hand
,
and
shouting
in
his
exultation
.
</s>
<s>
You
would
think
that
his
one
mission
in
life
was
to
invent
torpedoes
.
</s>
<s>
But
next
instant
,
if
you
were
to
express
surprise
as
to
how
it
was
that
the
Egyptian
workmen
elevated
the
stones
to
the
top
of
the
pyramids
,
out
would
come
the
pencil
and
envelope
,
and
he
would
propound
a
scheme
for
doing
that
with
equal
energy
and
conviction
.
</s>
<s>
This
ingenuity
was
joined
to
an
extremely
sanguine
nature
.
</s>
<s>
As
he
paced
up
and
down
in
his
jerky
quick-stepping
fashion
after
one
of
these
flights
of
invention
,
he
would
take
out
patents
for
it
,
receive
you
as
his
partner
in
the
enterprise
,
have
it
adopted
in
every
civilised
country
,
see
all
conceivable
applications
of
it
,
count
up
his
probable
royalties
,
sketch
out
the
novel
methods
in
which
he
would
invest
his
gains
,
and
finally
retire
with
the
most
gigantic
fortune
that
has
ever
been
amassed
.
</s>
<s>
And
you
would
be
swept
along
by
his
words
,
and
would
be
carried
every
foot
of
the
way
with
him
,
so
that
it
would
come
as
quite
a
shock
to
you
when
you
suddenly
fell
back
to
earth
again
,
and
found
yourself
trudging
the
city
street
a
poor
student
,
with
Kirk
’s
Physiology
under
your
arm
,
and
hardly
the
price
of
your
luncheon
in
your
pocket
.
