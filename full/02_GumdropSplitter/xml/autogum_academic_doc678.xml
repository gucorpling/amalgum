This
section
explores
the
general
lessons
that
can
be
elicited
from
the
disparate
results
outlined
above
.
</s>
<s>
One
way
to
attempt
a
global
interpretation
of
results
of
this
experiment
is
to
differentiate
between
a
user
’s
general
beliefs
and
attitudes
regarding
technology
,
and
a
specific
perception
to
a
particular
application
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
case
of
our
participants
,
how
they
approached
the
system-specific
tasks
—
especially
in
the
face
of
difficulty
or
negative
feedback
,
for
example
,
at
the
hands
of
the
error
message
in
the
map
,
or
the
unexpected
navigation
screen
—
might
be
indicative
of
their
a
priori
attitude
towards
digital
or
mobile
use
in
general
.
</s>
<s>
Only
with
encouragement
from
the
researcher
and
with
successful
iterations
were
the
participants
enabled
to
develop
an
application-specific
opinion
and
comfort
level
that
allowed
for
greater
ease
of
use
.
</s>
<s>
Due
to
the
fact
that
universally
accepted
mobile-native
affordances
were
used
throughout
this
app
,
such
as
the
text
and
appearance
of
the
buttons
,
the
map
functionality
,
and
user
interface
touch/swipe
movement
patterns
,
one
can
infer
that
either
the
specific
participant
group
may
have
not
had
as
much
exposure
to
standardised
mobile
digital
experiences
as
others
,
and/or
that
their
intrinsic
motivation
levels
for
interacting
with
mobile
applications
was
predisposed
to
waning
in
the
face
of
negative
feedback
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Despite
differences
in
layout
,
design
and
input
mechanisms
,
one
result
was
similar
to
prior
work
undertaken
on
web
interfaces
.
</s>
<s>
The
propensity
to
choose
the
top
two
photos
when
deciding
on
which
attraction
to
locate
,
reflects
work
undertaken
by
the
author
on
web
site
design
and
usability
on
static
devices
,
where
he
developed
the
idea
of
‘
serial
access
’
.
</s>
<s>
This
can
be
defined
as
the
practice
of
linearly
absorbing
each
unit
of
information
,
without
skipping
any
phrases
or
words
that
may
be
irrelevant
and
without
looking
beyond
the
immediate
content
encountered
.
</s>
<s>
Such
behaviour
leads
to
content
being
so
absorbed
from
left
to
right
and
top
to
bottom
.
</s>
<s>
Interestingly
,
in
the
mobile
environment
,
the
easiest
content
with
which
to
interact
for
people
using
their
thumb
to
interact
may
not
be
at
the
top
,
but
on
the
right
of
the
screen
(
for
right-handed
people
)
.
</s>
<s>
Nevertheless
,
results
showed
that
the
top
two
photos
were
by
far
the
most
chosen
,
representing
10
out
of
18
iterations
.
</s>
<s>
Indeed
,
the
photo
on
the
right
(
The
London
Eye
)
was
chosen
6
times
—
30
%
of
all
iterations
.
</s>
<s>
At
the
other
end
of
the
scale
,
those
photos
only
visible
(
or
fully
visible
)
on
swiping
were
only
chosen
twice
,
and
then
only
in
third
iterations
,
tentative
indications
that
the
reluctance
to
scroll
identified
in
the
author
’s
prior
work
is
in
evidence
in
a
mobile
environment
,
despite
the
fact
that
the
swipe
action
required
may
be
easier
than
using
either
a
mouse
or
arrow
keys
.
</s>
<s>
We
classified
this
as
an
affordance
difficulty
due
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
visible
indicator
(
such
as
an
arrow
pointing
down
)
to
indicate
a
downward
swipe
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
photos
themselves
were
not
strictly
controlled
variables
and
may
have
played
a
part
in
the
selection
(
for
example
the
natural
visual
attractiveness
of
the
London
Eye
)
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
There
were
also
other
limitations
to
the
study
.
</s>
<s>
First
,
the
lack
of
prior
research
on
which
to
build
is
a
constant
limitation
where
innovative
technology
is
an
area
of
interest
.
</s>
<s>
By
the
time
the
research
cycle
of
finding
a
topic
,
obtaining
funding
,
carrying
out
the
study
,
writing
up
,
and
publishing
has
been
undertaken
,
the
technology
will
have
moved
on
and
other
areas
appearing
for
study
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
the
author
’s
PhD
on
website
design
for
people
with
learning
disabilities
,
completed
only
five
years
ago
,
is
unlikely
to
be
replicated
or
built
upon
,
as
the
world
of
IT
is
now
mobile
and
dominated
by
apps
rather
than
by
web
pages
on
large
screens
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
,
indeed
,
one
reason
we
decided
to
create
an
app
which
tested
interactions
likely
to
be
used
over
a
long
period
of
time
(
tap
,
swipe
,
etc.
)
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Second
,
as
with
the
studies
by
McKenzie
et
al.
and
Ho
et
al.
</s>
<s>
cited
earlier
,
the
study
relied
on
gatekeepers
to
interpret
a
given
participant
profile
.
</s>
<s>
Archibald
and
Munce
describe
how
gatekeepers
may
limit
access
to
potential
participants
to
those
of
their
choice
,
such
as
those
likely
to
have
‘
an
above
average
understanding
of
the
[
research
]
instead
of
participants
with
a
more
typical
profile
’
(
p.
35
)
.
</s>
<s>
Participants
had
varied
experience
with
technology
,
although
in
a
way
this
could
be
seen
as
a
strength
,
permitting
a
wider
spectrum
of
user
behaviour
to
be
observed
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
A
longer
time-lapse
between
app
demonstration
and
the
usability
test
may
have
elicited
more
usability
issues
,
as
the
participants
would
not
have
been
able
to
rely
on
memory
so
much
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
this
heightened
possibility
for
errors
may
not
have
been
justified
purely
in
terms
of
participant
wellbeing
.
