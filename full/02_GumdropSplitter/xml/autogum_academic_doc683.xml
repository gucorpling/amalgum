In
the
current
period
of
super-dynamic
changes
,
serious
fundamental
education
is
essential
.
</s>
<s>
The
question
arises
,
however
,
what
fundamental
knowledge
,
what
content
and
depth
of
study
are
needed
?
</s>
<s>
How
to
transform
this
knowledge
into
the
necessary
competencies
?
</s>
<s>
Should
a
wide
range
of
knowledge
be
gained
and
specific
(
at
least
initial
)
experience
and
the
ability
to
reflect
on
your
actions
be
acquired
to
develop
the
essential
competencies
and
to
successfully
operate
in
the
conditions
of
uncertainty
and
changeable
external
environment
?
Leading
universities
are
actively
developing
research
and
managerial
training
in
such
areas
as
systems
engineering
,
future
technologies
,
complex
systems
â€™
stability
and
adaptability
,
network
technologies
and
distributed
architectures
,
data
science
,
conceptual
design
,
chaos
management
,
self-organization
,
etc.

<p>
<s>
The
fundamental
principle
of
modern
university
education
is
the
application
of
an
interdisciplinary
approach
that
integrates
subject
knowledge
into
a
new
quality
(
mathematics
,
physics
,
biology
,
engineering
and
technology
,
economics
and
finance
,
ecology
,
law
,
management
)
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
it
is
technology
in
a
broad
sense
,
from
targeted
research
and
engineering
to
the
introduction
of
innovation
,
that
interdisciplinary
interrelations
concentrate
on
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
knowledge
of
the
engineering
fundamentals
of
production
and
scientific
and
technical
trends
is
an
indispensable
condition
for
a
manager
to
successfully
fulfill
their
functions
.
</s>
<s>
Hence
,
in
management
education
,
the
share
and
content
of
scientific
,
technical
,
engineering
and
technological
,
technical
and
economic
training
should
be
substantially
strengthened
,
as
this
is
what
contributes
to
the
development
of
the
relevant
competencies
.

<p>
<s>
We
should
emphasize
that
interdisciplinarity
is
not
so
much
a
joint
consideration
of
problems
by
experts
from
different
fields
of
science
and
practice
,
but
a
synthesis
of
various
knowledge
in
order
to
obtain
a
new
solution
to
a
complex
problem
.
</s>
<s>
It
can
be
assumed
that
the
trend
towards
interdisciplinarity
will
become
stronger
as
the
flow
of
new
complex
tasks
,
differentiation
and
integration
of
knowledge
intensify
.
</s>
<s>
When
training
managers
,
it
is
important
not
only
to
demonstrate
the
capabilities
of
an
interdisciplinary
methodology
as
a
way
of
organizing
teamwork
for
a
comprehensive
analysis
of
the
situation
and
increasing
heuristic
efficiency
,
but
also
to
provide
them
with
the
tools
for
interdisciplinary
decisions
.

The
continuously
arising
new
tasks
,
the
need
for
their
understanding
,
systematization
and
schematization
,
taking
into
account
the
requirements
of
numerous
stakeholders
,
frequent
restructuring
of
teams
to
adjust
to
the
changing
requirements
,
makes
relevant
the
interdisciplinary
competencies
that
are
crucial
in
achieving
strategic
goals
of
technological
breakthrough
:
engineering-managerial

engineering-economic
competencies

take
anticipatory
action

The

it
cannot

acquiring
engineering-managerial

Even

As
the
systems
become
more
complex
,
the
contradictions
increase
between
the
objectives
of
research

technological
activity
(
the
field
of
science
)
,
users
of
technology
(
the
field

the
interests

As
a

coordinated

<s>
Under
such
conditions
,
it
is
impossible
to
predict
the
consequences
of
decisions
made
at
early
stages
that
have
a
significant
effect
on
the
efficiency
of
the
development
process

on

It
is
necessary
,
on

one
hand

to
evaluate
options

into
account
the
entire
life
cycle

system
and
the
changes
in
the
external
environment
that
can
significantly
influence
it

,
on

other
hand

to
separate
the
design

of
the
system

a
whole

the
detailed
work
on
its
individual
components

develop
iteratively

Thus

these

mastered
