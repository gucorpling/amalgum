<s>
Addiction
represents
an
enormous
challenge
to
society
.
</s>
<s>
Worldwide
,
it
has
been
estimated
that
alcohol
,
tobacco
,
and
illicit
drugs
were
responsible
for
more
than
10
million
deaths
,
with
a
higher
impact
in
developed
countries
where
substance
use
disorders
have
been
identified
as
responsible
for
life
expectancy
reversals
.
</s>
<s>
Societal
and
medical
responses
to
the
problem
are
far
from
optimal
,
but
the
appearance
of
new
technologies
offers
room
for
improvement
,
with
lots
of
new
initiatives
launched
and
developed
.
</s>
<s>
This
special
issue
is
intended
to
describe
and
discuss
how
these
new
tools
are
helping
to
improve
the
assessment
and
treatment
of
such
old
problems
(
addictive
disorders
)
,
covering
a
wide
diversity
of
novelties
that
are
being
applied
in
the
field
.

Digital
health
entails
the
possibility
to
overcome
existent
problems
around
addictive
disorders
like
stigmatization
,
addiction
identification
,
treatment
access
,
adherence
and
treatment
efficacy
by
facilitating
the
improvement
in
knowledge
,
assessment
,
diagnosis
,
and
treatment
of
addictive
disorders
.
</s>
<s>
Assessment
is
one
of
the
areas
where
new
solutions
have
probably
reached
furthest
.
</s>
<s>
Think
,
for
example
,
about
transdermal
sensors
and
ecological
momentary
assessment
:
a
clear
example
of
how
new
technologies
can
reach
the
core
of
a
patient
’s
drinking
pattern
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
special
issue
,
Barrio
et
al.
investigate
patients
’
attitudes
towards
transdermal
sensors
in
real
clinical
settings
.
</s>
<s>
Digital
technologies
might
be
useful
to
assess
brain
damage
,
and
they
bring
us
closer
to
understanding
the
mechanism(s)
underlying
addiction
.
Herreros
et
al.
present
a
visuomotor
rotation
task
which
might
be
the
first
step
towards
developing
a
useful
tool
for
the
detection
of
cerebellum
dysfunction
by
assessing
alterations
in
implicit
learning
among
chronic
cannabis
users
.
</s>
<s>
New
technologies
have
opened
up
the
possibility
of
not
only
assessing
patients
“
right
here
right
now
”
but
also
of
creating
new
realities
,
or
should
we
better
say
virtual
realities
?
Ghiţă
et
al.
show
us
that
virtual
reality
can
enhance
the
assessment
of
alcohol-induced
craving
and
anxiety
.
</s>
<s>
Technological
advances
in
neuroimaging
and
genetics
have
allowed
deepening
in
the
understanding
of
some
learning
processes
involved
in
substance
use
disorders
.
Garbusow
et
al.
provide
knowledge
on
how
important
processes
,
such
as
instrumental
responses
to
relevant
stimuli
,
are
influenced
by
drinking
patterns
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
same
line
,
Heinz
et
al.
conduct
a
review
that
starts
with
how
Pavlovian
and
instrumental
learning
mechanisms
interact
in
drug
addiction
and
finishes
with
how
these
learning
mechanisms
and
their
respective
neurobiological
correlates
can
contribute
to
losing
versus
regaining
control
over
drug
intake
.

<s>
Paradoxically
enough
,
new
technologies
do
also
have
their
own
risks
.
</s>
<s>
Take
,
for
example
,
internet
gaming
disorder
.
Ryu
et
al.
present
the
development
of
a
new
assessment
instrument
for
internet
addiction
,
the
Diagnostic
Interview
for
Internet
Addiction
.
</s>
<s>
And
keeping
in
mind
that
new
psychometric
instruments
are
also
new
solutions
to
old
problems
,
Chen
et
al.
investigate
an
interesting
phenomenon
in
addiction
:
the
intensity
of
memory
addiction
.
</s>
<s>
They
present
us
the
development
of
the
Addiction
Memory
Intensity
Scale

<p>
<s>
In
the
treatment
area
,
this
special
issue
offers
an
interesting
combination
of
modalities
:
newly
designed
pharmaceutical
compounds
(
nalmefene
)
,
naturally
occurring
psychoactive
substances
(
cannabidiol
)
,
and
non-pharmacological
,
biological
therapies
(
rTMS
)
.
Barrio
et
al.
report
the
main
effectiveness
analysis
of
a
phase-IV
study
conducted
among
alcohol
dependent
outpatients
taking
nalmefene
,
the
only
approved
medication
for
alcohol
reduction
aims
.
</s>
<s>
The
use
of
rTMS
is
presented
by
Cardullo
et
al.
in
a
sample
of
cocaine
and
gambling
patients
.
</s>
<s>
The
stimulation
of
the
left
dorsolateral
prefrontal
cortex
yields
promising
results
.
</s>
<s>
Finally
,
Batalla
et
al.
review
the
potential
use
of
cannabidiol
in
addictive
and
comorbid
psychotic
disorders
,
pointing
to
a
prominent
role
in
the
treatment
of
cannabis
addiction

Scientific
advances

new
technologies

expand

treatment
of
addictive
behaviors
