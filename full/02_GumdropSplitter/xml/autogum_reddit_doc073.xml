So
although
my
little
brother
’s
birth
was
the
most
dramatic
(
see
BB
)
,
according
to
my
mother
mine
was
the
most
<hi rend="bold">
traumatic
</hi>
.
</s>
<s>
She
was
ill
with
me
as
well
,
and
I
managed
to
be
born
premie
with
my
hand
on
my
cheek
-
my
elbow
crushed
her
sciatic
nerve
and
sent
such
extreme
pain
down
to
her
feet
that
she
pleaded
with
my
father
to
amputate
both
of
her
legs
.

(
He
,
being
quite
pragmatic
,
pointed
out
that
doing
so
would
n’t
stop
the
nerve
pain
.
Mum
’s
feet
were
spared
the
knife
.

</s>
<s>
I
was
n’t
breathing
very
well
,
as
might
be
expected
from
an
undercooked
LO
.
</s>
<s>
I
was
whisked
off
to
NICU
,
where
I
was
plied
with
oxygen
and
screamed
so
much
that
they
fed
me
a
little
just
to
calm
me
down
.

pMIL
and
pFIL
hurried
to
see
me
,
naturally
.

<s>
This
was
back
when
smoking
was
allowed
almost
everywhere
,
and
my
gran
was
a
pack-a-day
kinda
gal

So
,
when
meeting
your
brand
spanking
new
,
premature
,
sick
grandchild
in
the
neonatal
intensive
care
ward
,
that
’s
probably
a
moment
to
snuff
out
the
cig
,
right
?
Nope
.
</s>
<s>
Gran
bent
over
to
see
me
,
opened
the
oxygen
crib
(
a
kind
of
enclosed
plexiglass
box
with
hand
holes
to
pet
the
baby
and
a
lever
top
)
,
took
her
lit
cig
out
of
her
mouth
,
and
blew
a
cloud
over
smoke
over
me
.
</s>
<s>
My
mother
did
n’t
even
go
cataplectic
.

<s>
Not
until
she
got
over
the
shock
of
what
had
just
happened
,
which
she
did
n’t
for
a
few
solid
hours
.
</s>
<s>
As
it
was
,
she
stared
in
a
hypnotized
kind
of
horror
as
Gran
hovered
over
me
,
puffing
out
cloud
after
cloud
into
my
crib
,
and
I
began
to
choke
.
</s>
<s>
She
was
stuck
in
a
wheelchair
(
see
above
pain
,
proposed
leg
amputation
)
and
had
to
bang
the
call
button
like
a
mad
woman
until
someone
came
to
lift
me
out
of
the
enclosed
tank
full
of
tobacco
smoke
.
</s>
<s>
To
this
day
,
Gran
is
n’t
sure
why
she
was
shown
out
by
my
father
so
quickly
.

She
did
n’t
even
get
a
chance
to
hold
me
