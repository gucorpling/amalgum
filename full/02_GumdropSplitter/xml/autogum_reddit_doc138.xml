<s>
Before
marriage
</s>
<s>
I
used
to
read
a
lot
of
books
about
spirituality
,
law
of
attraction
and
anything
that
had
to
do
with
good
vibes
or
personal
development
.
</s>
<s>
This
would
always
push
me
to
maintain
my
awesome
job
,
travel
,
buy
whatever
I
needed
,
pay
my
own
rent
and
of
course
I
loved
that
feeling
of
being
an
independent
women
!
</s>
<s>
Once
married
,
I
started
to
realize
things
were
n’t
as
planned
.
</s>
<s>
I
put
my
effort
all
the
way
in
,
I
think
I
over
gave
myself
too
much
which
was
no
good
because
I
got
so
hooked
on
my
husband
he
began
to
do
whatever
he
wanted
with
me
and
I
let
one
problem
pass
then
another
.
</s>
<s>
Forgave
him
over
and
over
.
</s>
<s>
I
knew
that
was
n’t
me
not
even
50
%
!
I
started
to
miss
my
own
self
!
I
started
to
miss
how
I
would
laugh
about
things
,
I
started
to
wonder
when
did
I
loose
myself
?
!
</s>
<s>
I
felt
like
this
whole
year
I
’ve
been
married
I
became
somebody
else
,
I
changed
in
the
worst
and
best
(
because
I
’m
a
mommy
now
,
she
’s
my
pride
and
joy
!
)
ever
!
I
used
to
be
positive
about
everything
!
</s>
<s>
My
negative
thoughts
started
to
invade
me
more
and
more.
.
</s>
<s>
I
started
to
have
sleeping
disorders
!
Eating.
.
</s>
<s>
As
I
realized
this
about
me
,
I
started
to
read
again
then
I
came
across
an
article
about
N
’s
and
I
felt
so
related
to
it
I
just
wanted
to
read
more
and
more
.
</s>
<s>
I
knew
it
was
my
case
each
time
I
read
an
article
or
even
reviews
!
</s>
<s>
This
is
when
I
opened
my
eyes
for
the
very
first
time
.

<s>
When
did
you
open
yours
and
how
did
you
solve
your
situation

I
had
no
idea
what
a
narcissist
was
until
we
broke
up
and
I
found
myself
at
a
woman
’s
help
center
for
abuse
.
</s>
<s>
I
opened
up
to
a
counselor
and
told
stories
of
why
I
felt
the
way
I
did
—
-disrespected
and
constantly
belittled
to
the
point
where
I
almost
began
to
believe
I
was
a
bad
person
.
</s>
<s>
The
therapist
opened
my
eyes
and
made
me
aware
of
mental
abuse
.
</s>
<s>
I
started
reading
and
realized
that
my
ex
displayed
every
symptom
of
a
full
blown
narcissist
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
I
have
always
had
morals
and
am
kind
to
people
but
he
always
told
me
I
was
just
a
mean
person
that
would
never
find
anyone
to
love
me
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
I
am
glad
to
say
that
with
time
—
I
am
back
to
myself
with
confidence
that
I
am
in
fact
a
good
person
and
have
found
an
amazing
man
that
respects
and
treats
me
the
way
anyone
in
a
healthy
relationship
should
be
treated
.

<p>
<s>
I
have
learned
that
empathetic
people
with
big
hearts
are
easily
walked
over
and
taken
advantage
of
by
someone
such
as
a
Narc
.
</s>
<s>
We
trust
too
easily
and
love
hard
which
makes
it
easy
for
a
narc
to
control
.
