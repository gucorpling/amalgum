,
you

that
is
actually
when
I
got
into
it

So
,
brown
is
a
colour
we
associate
with
with
Indians
,
and
,
on
top
of
that
,
in
these
old
cartoons
,
people
used
to
put
this
brown
paper
bag
on
the
top
of
their
head
with
two
eye
holes
and
that
symbolises
shame
or
embarrassment
,
which
is
an
overarching
theme
all
over
my
comics

I
have
read
your

most
of
them
are
related
to
satire

you
never
entered

politics

So
,
the
thing
is
,
most
of
the
comics
that
I
have
read
that
are
form
Indians
that
are
in
newspapers
are
all
political
and
not
enough
importance
has
been
given
to
just
Indian
daily
lives
,
just
the
families
and
how
they
interact
with
society
.
</s>
<s>
So
I
have
decided
to
stay
away
from
politics
in
this
comic
just
because
I
am
not
trying
to
send
a
message
across
,
I
am
just
trying
to
appeal
to
people
's
nostalgia
,
make
them
remember
something
that
they
experienced
and
just
relate
to
it
.
