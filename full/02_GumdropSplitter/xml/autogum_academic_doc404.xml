There

First
,
we
can
naturally
extend
this
fixed
amount
of
water
resources
to
a
variable
.
</s>

In
other
words
,
the
overall
disposable
water
resources
could
be
more
or
less
in
the
following
step
.
</s>
<s>
In
case
of
more
disposable
water
resources
,
if
the
hydropower
is
included
,
water
quantity
and
water
quality
will
not
be
reduced
.
</s>
<s>
If
hydropower
is
considered
,
the
two
water
users
will
also
need
to
consider
the
secondary
distribution
of
water
resources
,
which
makes
for
another
incentive
mechanism
from
the
water
user
j
’s
point
of
view
.
</s>
<s>
The
participants
need
to
balance
between
making
the
cake
bigger
and
getting
a
larger
slice
of
it
in
the
future
at
the
same
time
,
as
illustrated
by
Huck
et
al.
.
</s>
<s>
Under
this
situation
,
the
three
participating
parties
have
a
common
goal
at
first
,
that
is
,
getting
more
disposable
water
resources
.
</s>
<s>
Then
,
all
the
parties
try
to
maximize
their
own
interests
.
</s>
<s>
In
case
of
less
disposable
water
resources
,
due
to
extreme
drought
weather
,
like
what
happened
in
Meikong
River
Basins
in
2011
,
the
overall
supply
water
will
be
less
than
normal
year
.
</s>
<s>
Under
this
situation
,
the
governor
will
need
another
incentive
mechanism
or
an
emergency
mechanism
,
which
will
be
another
interesting
research
direction
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
second
extension
is
the
multi-principal
and
multi-agent
model
,
including
many
governors
and
many
water
users
,
existing
in
transboundary
river
basins
,
such
as
Lancang
River
,
Nu
River
,
Yalu
River
.
</s>
<s>
There
are
also
competitions
between
governors
whose
aims
may
not
be
the
same
.
</s>
<s>
The
conflicts
of
water
users
involve
various
agricultural
users
and
industrial
users
,
which
will
be
another
complicated
model
.
</s>
<s>
As
this
paper
only
presents
a
one-principal
and
two-agent
model
,
we
can
naturally
extend
this
model
to
multi-principal
or
multi-agent
(
more
than
two
agents
)
.
</s>
<s>
In
fact
,
in
addition
to
the
water
user

allocation

the
players
could
get
water
resources

channels

such
as
water
reuse
,
buying

other
players

so
on

<p>

There
are
also
uncertainties

the

substantially

In
fact

the
uncertainty
of

research

What
is
left

research

the
distribution

that
these
water

have
private

Conclusions
</s>
</head>
<p>
<s>
The
current
paper
,
based
on
cross-subsidy
mechanism
,
explores
the
issue
of
efficient
water
resources
allocation
management
between
the
governor
and
two
competing
water
users
under
the
AS
.
</s>
<s>
The
two-stage
performance-based
allocation
mechanism
presented
in
the
paper
has
four
novel
aspects
.
</s>
<s>
First
,
from
the
governor
’s
perspective
,
we
focus
on
allocation
rules
covering
two
stages
,
including
production
and
environment
aspects
,
which
is
consistent
with
sustainability
.
</s>
<s>
Even
though
this
two-stage
allocation
is
just
a
small
part
of
the
long-term
allocation
cycle
,
it
could
reflect
the
real
allocation
process
and
reflect
the
requirement
of
water
resources
sustainability
under
the
current
social
–
environmental
–
economic
development
.
</s>
<s>
Second
,
the
performance-based
incentive
mechanism
will
induce
competition
between
the
two
users
based
on
the
penalty
–
incentive
system
to
motivate
them
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
governor
’s
goals
.
</s>
<s>
Users
’
payoff
depends
on
their
own
performances
and
their
relative
performances
,
covering
production
and
environment
aspects
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
this
mechanism
involves
not
only
the
interactions
between
the
government
and
users
,
but
the
interactions
between
two
users
,
which
could
help
the
governor
balance
the
economic
and
environment
developments
,
and
balance
the
short-term
development
and
long-term
development
.
</s>
<s>
This
paper
also
covers
the
internalization
of
the
external
costs
,
another
innovative
aspect
in
this
paper
.
</s>
<s>
The
internalization
of
the
external
costs
could
help
the
governor
transfer
the
costs
to
the
users
,
which
could
further
motivate
the
two
users
to
act
according
to
the
governor
’s
interests
rather
than
their
own
interests
.
</s>
<s>
At
last
,
these
perspectives
could
also
provide
a
new
insight
for
agricultural
water
resources
allocation
management
and
relative
decision
support
for
the
governor
,
such
as
the
sustainable
development
of
water
resources
,
the
interactions
between
the
governor
and
users
,
competition
between
users
,
penalty
–
reward
mechanism
,
multi-stage
multi-agent
and
multi-objective
decision-making
,
and
so
on
.
