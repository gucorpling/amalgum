Aging
and
migration
of
agricultural
labor
,
especially
of
young
and
middle-aged
people
,
have
become
two
of
the
most
prominent
demographic
characteristics
in
developing
countries
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
there
is
growing
attention
given
to
the
impact
of
labor
migration
on
the
health
of
elderly
.
</s>
<s>
As
a
result
of
the
lack
of
a
pension
system
,
family
support
remains
the
main
pension
model
in
developing
countries
such
as
China
,
especially
in
rural
areas
,
by
means
of
the
intergenerational
support
of
family
members
for
the
security
of
the
elderly
.
</s>
<s>
The
research
suggests
that
labor
migration
not
only
exacerbates
rural
population
aging
,
but
also
changes
the
traditional
family
intergenerational
support
structure
,
and
thus
affects
the
health
of
left-behind
elderly
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Intergenerational
support
mainly
includes
three
parts
,
economic
,
instrumental
,
and
emotional
support
.
</s>
<s>
Current
studies
generally
address
the
effects
of
change
caused
by
labor
migration
on
the
elderly
health
via
two
paths
.
</s>
<s>
The
first
is
through
economic
support
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
one
hand
,
some
scholars
believe
that
labor
migration
can
improve
the
overall
ability
of
the
family
to
provide
economic
support
,
and
thus
improve
the
living
standard
of
family
members
,
including
the
medical
service
level
of
the
elderly
,
which
has
a
positive
impact
on
the
health
of
the
elderly
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
some
studies
argue
that
labor
migration
in
rural
families
weakens
economic
support
for
the
elderly
and
increases
their
workload
,
thus
,
harming
the
elderly
’s
health
,
because
migrant
labor
may
pay
more
attention
to
their
own
development
,
and
may
not
necessarily
provide
economic
support
to
the
elderly
left
behind
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
even
if
the
migrant
labor
remits
to
the
elderly
left
behind
,
little
is
known
about
the
extent
to
which
remittances
are
directed
to
the
elderly
;
especially
when
the
migrants
have
children
left
at
home
,
the
elderly
often
have
to
raise
grandchildren
in
exchange
for
economic
support
from
their
children
,
which
further
aggravates
the
labor
burden
of
the
elderly
.
</s>
<s>
The
second
path
is
through
instrumental
and
emotional
support
.
</s>
<s>
Most
scholars
who
focus
on
this
path
believe
that
labor
migration
reduces
the
accessibility
of
instrumental
and
emotional
support
that
the
elderly
receive
and
has
a
negative
impact
on
the
elderly
’s
health
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
in
China
,
most
studies
show
that
elderly
with
only
one
child
and
living
alone
are
most
affected
.
</s>
<s>
In
summary
,
existing
studies
have
shown
that
labor
migration
creates
disruptions
in
family
care
systems
and
affects
the
health
of
left-behind
elderly
,
however
,
the
existing
conclusions
are
not
consistent
,
and
there
are
still
some
important
limitations
that
may
affect
the
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
correlation
between
labor
migration
and
elderly
health
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
First
,
not
much
research
has
been
undertaken
to
analyze
the
impact
of
labor
migration
on
the
health
of
the
elderly
from
the
perspective
of
gender
structure
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
traditional
Chinese
rural
family
division
of
labor
,
men
tend
to
seek
work
through
migration
as
the
main
breadwinners
,
whereas
women
are
more
likely
to
act
as
caregivers
,
and
intergenerational
support
,
especially
economic
support
,
should
be
provided
mainly
by
sons
.
</s>
<s>
Nevertheless
,
currently
,
rural
female
labor
is
increasingly
inclined
to
seek
work
through
migration
for
higher
income
and
the
gender
differences
in
economic
support
for
the
elderly
by
sons
and
daughters
have
been
narrowing
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
although
son
preference
is
still
highly
prevalent
in
rural
China
,
daughters
tend
to
offer
a
greater
benefit
to
parents
who
have
reached
old
age
,
being
associated
with
greater
filial
piety
,
better
relationships
,
and
satisfactory
care
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
while
married
sons
usually
assume
social
responsibility
for
supporting
the
family
’s
elderly
,
their
spouses
(
daughters-in-law
)
are
,
in
fact
,
the
main
contributors
to
daily
care
.
</s>
<s>
In
other
words
,
daughters
and
daughters-in-law
often
play
a
more
important
role
than
sons
do
in
daily
instrumental
and
emotional
support
for
the
elderly
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
it
can
be
assumed
that
the
migration
of
male
labor
,
which
is
a
traditional
source
of
economic
support
,
can
improve
the
economic
support
for
the
elderly
,
but
might
not
have
a
significant
negative
impact
on
the
elderly
with
respect
to
instrumental
support
and
emotional
support
.
</s>
<s>
Although
the
migration
of
female
labor
can
also
increase
economic
support
for
the
elderly
,
it
may
remove
a
source
of
caregiving
and
companionship
for
the
elderly
who
are
left
behind
,
which
will
weaken
the
family
’s
daily
instrumental
and
emotional
support
for
the
elderly
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
differences
due
to
migrant
gender
of
the
impact
of
labor
migration
on
the
health
of
the
elderly
need
further
quantitative
analysis
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Secondly
,
only
a
few
earlier
studies
have
considered
the
differences
in
the
effects
of
labor
migration
on
different
aspects
of
the
elderly
’s
health
,
however
,
health
is
a
multidimensional
concept
,
and
the
effects
of
labor
migration
on
the
physical
and
mental
health
of
the
elderly
differ
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
Adhikari
et
al.
found
that
the
migration
of
adult
children
has
a
significant
negative
effect
on
the
mental
health
of
the
elderly
but
no
significant
effect
on
physical
health
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
most
research
to
date
has
focused
mainly
on
the
elderly
’s
physical
health
,
neglecting
the
interactions
between
physical
and
mental
health
,
however
,
if
the
elderly
feel
isolated
when
left
behind
,
their
physical
health
might
also
deteriorate
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
the
comprehensive
health
statue
of
the
elderly
other
than
physical
health
should
also
be
taken
into
account
.
