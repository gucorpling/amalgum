Who
do
you
think
is
the
Last
Jedi
?

So
far
,
there
are
five
things
that
could
have
a
possibility
of
being
the
last
Jedi
.
-
<hi rend="bold">
It
's
Luke
Skywalker
:
</hi>
Clearly
throughout
</s>
<s>
The
Force
Awakens
,
we
have
been
getting
enough
hints
that
say
that
Luke
is
the
last
Jedi
.
</s>
<s>
The
opening
scene
revealed
it
and
Snoke
mentioned
it
.
</s>
<s>
He
could
be
the
only
Jedi
left
and
now
the
First
Order
is
hunting
him
down
.
</s>
<s>
There
would
be
a
showdown
between
him
and
the
Dark
Side
but
I
believe
he
will
fall
and
the
Dark
Side
will
win
in
this
episode
.
-
</s>
<s>
<hi rend="bold">
It
's
Rey
:
</hi>
</s>
<s>
Yes
,
the
stereotypical
Rey
.
</s>
<s>
She
is
almost
too
perfect
.
</s>
<s>
She
knows
how
to
fight
,
she
can
fly
anything
,
she
can
fire
a
blaster
well
,
she
's
a
good
mechanic
and
she
is
force-sensitive
.
</s>
<s>
I
will
kind
of
admit
she
is
overpowered
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
movie
has
been
building
up
to
the
ending
where
Rey
uses
the
force
,
defeats
her
archenemy
,
goes
alone
to
Luke
without
Leia
or
anyone
else
and
only
she
gives
Luke
his
lightsaber
,
hinting
that
she
would
probably
finish
her
training
wit
him
.
</s>
<s>
I
believe
The
Last
Jedi
will
take
inspiration
from
Empire
Strikes
Back
and
A
New
Hope
.
</s>
<s>
Luke
will
train
Rey
like
Yoda
trained
Luke
,
while
the
Empire
soundly
crushes
the
Resistance
.
</s>
<s>
Then
,
Luke
will
battle
Kylo
Ren
and
die
like
Obi-Wan
did
in
A
New
Hope
,
leading
Rey
to
be
the
last
remaining
Jedi
.
-
</s>
<s>
<hi rend="bold">
It
's
Finn
:
</hi>
</s>
<s>
Now
,
not
many
accept
this
theory
because
he
got
his
ass
kicked
by
a
Stormtrooper
but
when
he
fought
Kylo
Ren
,
if
he
did
n't
have
the
force
,
he
would
've
died
within
seconds
compared
to
the
Stormtrooper
.
</s>
<s>
This
could
mean
that
Finn
is
a
little
Force-Sensitive
and
that
his
family
he
never
knew
was
also
Force-Sensitive
.
</s>
<s>
Also
,
he
spent
thirty
years
of
training
and
On
his
first
battle
,
he
never
fired
a
shot
at
the
innocents
.
</s>
<s>
He
immediately
defected
the
First
Order
after
being
raised
by
them
for
thirty
years
.
</s>
<s>
If
you
ask
me
,
that
's
long
enough
to
brainwash
any
soldier
to
be
loyal
.
</s>
<s>
So
he
could
have
the
force
to
help
him
resist
the
brainwash
of
the
First
Order
.
</s>
<s>
Then
,
without
warning
,
someone
will
point
out
to
Finn
proving
that
he
is
actually
the
last
Jedi
,
while
everyone
would
believe
it
's
Rey
or
Luke
.
</s>
<s>
So
the
real
chosen
one
was
him
this
whole
time
.
-
</s>
<s>
<hi rend="bold">
It
's
Kylo-Ren
:
</hi>
</s>
<s>
While
this
is
extremely
unlikely
,
some
believe
it
's
actually
Kylo
Ren
.
</s>
<s>
Some
how
,
he
still
has
some
good
in
him
and
is
the
only
Jedi
left
.
</s>
<s>
But
after
killing
his
own
father
,
he
is
clearly
on
the
full
course
of
the
Dark
Side
.
</s>
<s>
This
theory
is
the
most
unlikely
.
</s>
<s>
-
</s>
<s>
<hi rend="bold">
It
's
a
group
:
</hi>
</s>
<s>
And
lastly
,
we
have
the
idea
that
Jedi
is
also
a
plural
.
</s>
<s>
This
could
mean
there
could
be
a
group
of
Jedi
survivors
who
survived
the
massacre
of
Kylo
Ren
and
rise
from
the
shadows
as
an
army
of
Jedi
again
like
the
Republic
in
Attack
Of
The
Clones
and
fight
Kylo
Ren
and
the
First
Order
.
</s>
<s>
So
,
who
do
you
think
the
last
Jedi
is
?
</s>
<s>
In
my
opinion
,
I
would
say
it
most
likely
Rey
,
but
my
heart
wants
it
to
be
Finn
.
</s>

<sp who="#chutney44">
<p>
<s>
There
has
been
so
much
about
this
and
I
've
yet
to
see
anyone
mention
that
in
RotJ
during
the
last
scene
with
Yoda
,
he
tells
Luke
that
when
he
's
(
Yoda
)
gone
Luke
will
be
the
Last
Jedi
.
</s>
<s>
So
based
only
on
that
scene
I
figure
it
means
Luke
and
would
make
sense
I
feel
.
</s>
<s>
Like
some
other
people
mentioned
Luke
is
the
last
of
the
Old
Jedis
,
then
if
he
trains
Rey
or
Finn
or
whoever
hes
still
the
last
jedi
.
