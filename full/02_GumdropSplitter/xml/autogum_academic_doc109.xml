Satisfaction
is
a
key
concept
in
the

it
refers

mental
state
.
</s>
<s>
Before
purchasing
goods/services
from
cross-border
websites
,
such
as
Ebay
or
Amazon
,
people
tend
to
develop
some
kind
of
expectation
,
which
is
considered
as
a
function
of
satisfaction
.
</s>
<s>
If
the
expectation
is
confirmed
by
the
performance
of
the
product/service
,
people
show
a
degree
of
satisfaction
,
which
in
turn
results
in
continuance
intention
.
</s>
<s>
The
results
indicate
that
people
are
more
willing
to
continue
purchasing
commodities
from
cross-border
online
shops
if
satisfaction
is
high
.

This
insight

also

<p>

H1
demonstrates
that
eWOM
has
a
positive
impact
on
consumer
satisfaction
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
expected
since
the
rise
in
digital
channels
such
as
online
recommendations
and
customer
review
sites
made
it
easier
and
quicker
for
consumers
to
acquire
their
needed
information
from
the
internet
.

Consequently

more

Our

when
consumers
received
positive

they

show
a
satisfactory

<s>
For
instance
,
prior
to
purchasing
a
product/service
,
customers
can
read
other

According
to
the
expectation

confirmation

one

they

In

Customers

In

website

quality
is
conceptualized
using
three
components

factors

The

The

associated

,
such
as

asymmetry

and
the
impersonal
nature
of

environment
pose
threats
to
the
consumers

also
to
the
buyers

in
this
case
,
merchants
need
to
acquire
trust
from

The
positive
linkage

is
expected
by

H6

relations
between

UA
)

</s>
<s>
Based
on
Hofstede
’s
argument
,
people
from
a
high
UA
culture
prefer
to
utilize
the
traditional
way
of
living
and
they
tend
to
visit
offline
retail
environments
when
it
comes

In

words
,
they
are
reluctant
to
accept

new
technology
and
new
ICT
services
,

shopping
.
</s>
<s>
Online
shopping
is
inherently
associated
with
high
levels
of
uncertainty
compare
to
shopping
in
offline
retail
environments
,
for
potential
buyers
often
lack
information
about
the
legitimacy
of
the
store
prior
to
purchase
,
they
may
fall
into
the
trap
that
anything
could
happen
when
they
key
in
credit
information
,
and
they
are
also
worried
about
whether
the
product
will
arrive
on
time
.
</s>
<s>
Compared
with
findings
only
within
the
e-commerce
context
,
this
study
indicates
that
the
UA
is
still
vital
in
the
cross-border
e-commerce
setting
.
</s>
<s>
And
compared
with
other
factors
employed
in

,
the
UV
index
is
the
most
important
antecedent
of

this
research

<p>

Perceived
value
is
an
important
antecedent
in
the
marketing
research
and
lots
of
companies
utilize
it
as
a
strategy
to
attract
customers
.
</s>
<s>
Results
on
H2
show
that
the
relation
between
perceived
value
and
satisfaction
is
not
statistically
significant
.
</s>
<s>
This
probably
means
that
the
utility
of
a
product
or
service
that
the
consumers
want
to
purchase
has
already
been
highly
recognized
by
them
.

<s>
In
this
case

they
pay
more
attention
to
other
features

web
interface
features
.

<s>
They
may
be
very
interested
in
the
usefulness
,
informativeness
and
entertainment
of
the
website
.
</s>
<s>
Similarly
,
the
hypothesis
proposed
on
H5
is
not
supported
either
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
probably
due
to
the
likelihood
that
a
cross-border
e-commerce
website
has
already
gained
a
customers
’
trust
before
they
purchase
online
.
</s>
<s>
In
other
words
,
consumers
have
already
mentally
prepared
for
the
potential
risks
associated
with
online
shopping
.
</s>
<s>
This
inference
could
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
an
increasing
number
of
people
prefer
to
buy
commodities
from
cross-border
shopping
websites
.
