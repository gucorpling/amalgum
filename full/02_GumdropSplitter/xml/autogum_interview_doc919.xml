Well

everyone

As
far
as
Scientology
is
concerned
,
I
ca
n't
really
say
what
any

motivations
are
because
we
do
n't
have
motivations
as

Everybody
is
here
as
individuals

for
their
own
reasons

I
think
the
great
thing
is
the
fact
that
with
all
our
individual
motivations
and
reasons
we
still
manage
to
come
together
;
we
're
a
ton
of
people
from
the
Internet
,
we
do
n't
know
each
other
in
real
life
;
and
we
get
together
and
have
this
kind
of
giant
protest
