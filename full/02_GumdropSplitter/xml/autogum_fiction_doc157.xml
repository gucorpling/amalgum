It
was
about
the
beginning
of
September
,
1664
,
that
I
,
among
the
rest
of
my
neighbours
,
heard
in
ordinary
discourse
that
the
plague
was
returned
again
in
Holland
;
for
it
had
been
very
violent
there
,
and
particularly
at
Amsterdam
and
Rotterdam
,
in
the
year
1663
,
whither
,
they
say
,
it
was
brought
,
some
said
from
Italy
,
others
from
the
Levant
,
among
some
goods
which
were
brought
home
by
their
Turkey
fleet
;
others
said
it
was
brought
from
Candia
;
others
from
Cyprus
.
</s>
<s>
It
mattered
not
from
whence
it
came
;
but
all
agreed
it
was
come
into
Holland
again
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
We
had
no
such
thing
as
printed
newspapers
in
those
days
to
spread
rumours
and
reports
of
things
,
and
to
improve
them
by
the
invention
of
men
,
as
I
have
lived
to
see
practised
since
.
</s>
<s>
But
such
things
as
these
were
gathered
from
the
letters
of
merchants
and
others
who
corresponded
abroad
,
and
from
them
was
handed
about
by
word
of
mouth
only
;
so
that
things
did
not
spread
instantly
over
the
whole
nation
,
as
they
do
now
.
</s>
<s>
But
it
seems
that
the
Government
had
a
true
account
of
it
,
and
several
councils
were
held
about
ways
to
prevent
its
coming
over
;
but
all
was
kept
very
private
.
</s>
<s>
Hence
it
was
that
this
rumour
died
off
again
,
and
people
began
to
forget
it
as
a
thing
we
were
very
little
concerned
in
,
and
that
we
hoped
was
not
true
;
till
the
latter
end
of
November
or
the
beginning
of
December
1664
when
two
men
,
said
to
be
Frenchmen
,
died
of
the
plague
in
Long
Acre
,
or
rather
at
the
upper
end
of
Drury
Lane
.
</s>
<s>
The
family
they
were
in
endeavoured
to
conceal
it
as
much
as
possible
,
but
as
it
had
gotten
some
vent
in
the
discourse
of
the
neighbourhood
,
the
Secretaries
of
State
got
knowledge
of
it
;
and
concerning
themselves
to
inquire
about
it
,
in
order
to
be
certain
of
the
truth
,
two
physicians
and
a
surgeon
were
ordered
to
go
to
the
house
and
make
inspection
.
</s>
<s>
This
they
did
;
and
finding
evident
tokens
of
the
sickness
upon
both
the
bodies
that
were
dead
,
they
gave
their
opinions
publicly
that
they
died
of
the
plague
.
</s>
<s>
Whereupon
it
was
given
in
to
the
parish
clerk
,
and
he
also
returned
them
to
the
Hall
;
and
it
was
printed
in
the
weekly
bill
of
mortality
in
the
usual
manner
,

The
people
showed
a
great
concern
at
this
,
and
began
to
be
alarmed
all
over
the
town
,
and
the
more
,
because
in
the
last
week
in
December
1664
another
man
died
in
the
same
house
,
and
of
the
same
distemper
.

<s>
And
then
we
were
easy
again
for
about
six
weeks
,
when
none
having
died
with
any
marks
of
infection
,
it
was
said
the
distemper
was
gone
;
but
after
that
,
I
think
it
was
about
the
12th
of
February
,
another
died
in
another
house
,
but
in
the
same
parish
and
in
the
same
manner
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
This
turned
the
people
's
eyes
pretty
much
towards
that
end
of
the
town
,
and
the
weekly
bills
showing
an
increase
of
burials
in
St
Giles
's
parish
more
than
usual
,
it
began
to
be
suspected
that
the
plague
was
among
the
people
at
that
end
of
the
town
,
and
that
many
had
died
of
it
,
though
they
had
taken
care
to
keep
it
as
much
from
the
knowledge
of
the
public
as
possible
.
</s>
<s>
This
possessed
the
heads
of
the
people
very
much
,
and
few
cared
to
go
through
Drury
Lane
,
or
the
other
streets
suspected
,
unless
they
had
extraordinary
business
that
obliged
them
to
it

</p>
<p>
<s>
This
increase
of
the
bills
stood
thus
:
the
usual
number
of
burials
in
a
week
,
in
the
parishes
of
St
Giles-in-the-Fields
and
St
Andrew
's
,
Holborn
,
were
from
twelve
to
seventeen
or
nineteen
each
,
few
more
or
less
;
but
from
the
time
that
the
plague
first
began
in
St
Giles
's
parish
,
it
was
observed
that
the
ordinary
burials
increased
in
number
considerably
