This

highs

Well
,
James
'
section
is
titled
&quot;
Do
better
,
&quot;
a
pretty
typical
SJW
buzzword
,
and
he
manages
to
hit
some
classics
like
&quot;
gross
,
&quot;
&quot;
distasteful
,
&quot;
and
&quot;
erasure

throwing
in
mentions

for
good

Here
's
the
<ref target="https://archive.li/jxEoz">
puke-inducing
passage
</ref>
for
your
reading
displeasure
:
&gt;There
are
seven
reservations
in
Montana
,
some
as
big
as
US
states
,
home
to
eight
tribal
nations
.
</s>
<s>
None
are
represented
in
Far
Cry
5
.
</s>
<s>
It
’s
a
huge
oversight
.
</s>
<s>
Hope
County
nails
the
look
of
Western
Montana
,
but
its
people
and
priorities
are
off
base
.
</s>
<s>
Indigenous
peoples
are
often
forgotten
when
we
talk
about
diversity
and
representation
in
the
US
,
and
while
Far
Cry
5
features
a
diverse
cast
,
it
fails
to
include
the
most
important
people
in
Montana
’s
history
.
</s>
<s>
While
the
locals
fight
for
‘
their
land
’
against
the
cult
’s
colonial
agenda
,
I
found
it
increasingly
impossible
to
ignore
the
parallels
to
early
white
Americans
’
own
colonization
of
the
territory
.
</s>
<s>
It
’s
a
gross
narrative
framework
to
use
without
acknowledging
the
history
of
the
area
.
&gt;Native
people
were
massacred
,
bison
were
driven
to
the
brink
of
extinction
(
which
makes
gunning
them
down
for
perk
points
an
especially
distasteful
act
)
,
the
lands
were
claimed
by
the
US
Army
while
native
people
were
forced
onto
reservations
,
and
over
the
course
of
generations
the
they
were
essentially
brainwashed
into
adopting
Christianity
and
the
encompassing
imperialist
cultural
values
in
place
of
their
own
.
</s>
<s>
I
suppose
I
did
n’t
expect
Far
Cry
5
to
revisit
the
history
of
Montana
in
total
,
but
I
’ve
yet
to
run
into
an
epistolary
footnote
acknowledging
it
.
</s>
<s>
Indigenous
people
have
been
fighting
against
cultural
erasure
for
hundreds
of
years
now
,
and
failure
to
represent
them
in
Far
Cry
5
’s
rendition
of
Montana
contributes
to
that
process
.

Yes

really
thinks
that
putting
Indians
in

will
help
make
up
for
their
slaughter
and
displacement

Okay

I

I
am

They
've
been
erased

They
're
segregated

their

them
