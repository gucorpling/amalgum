<s>
But
,
most
importantly
;
the
main
target
of
our
project
was
not
only
to
create
a
3D
movie
short
,
but
to
experiment
with
ways
to
improve
the
efficiency
and
quality
of
open
source
development
.
</s>
<s>
On
this
aspect
only
,
this
project
was
just
a
huge
success
,
and
the
main
reason
for
our
sponsors
(
the
DVD
pre-sale
)
to
support
it
.
</s>
<s>
I
know
they
might
have
liked
a
cartoonish
funny
movie
with
furry
animals
better
,
but
for
that
you
get
already
pretty
well
served
by
the
bigger
3D
animation
studios
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
I
'm
the
first
to
admit
that
-
looking
back
especially
-
certain
aspects
worked
out
quite
weakly
;
there
's
loose
ends
and
questionable
decisions
,
especially
in
story
development
and
continuity
.
</s>
<s>
That
's
just
the
risk
of
doing
experiments
,
and
nothing
I
regret
really
.
</s>
<s>
The
five
artists
from
our
user
community
who
were
invited
to
make
the
movie
were
young
people
with
no
professional
background
in
filmmaking
.
</s>
<s>
Their
personal
incentive
to
participate
in
this
project
was
also
to
learn
from
it
,
and
to
create
a
good
portfolio
for
their
future
career
.
</s>
<s>
I
've
witnessed
them
grow
in
competence
in
the
past
year
enormously
,
something
I
'm
incredibly
proud
of
.

<hi rend="bold">
<s>
On
the
technical
level
,
the
only
major
criticism
I
've
seen
of
&quot;
Elephants
Dream
&quot;
is
the
character
animation
,
especially
in
the
opening
scene
--
many
reviewers
felt
that
the
movements
seemed
a
bit
unnatural
.
</s>
<s>
Do
you
agree
with
these
criticisms
?
</s>
<s>
If
so
,
what
do
you
think
can
be
done
to
improve
on
that
level
?
</s>
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Yeah
,
the
challenge
the
artists
set
themselves
-
to
use
quite
realistic
personages
-
is
also
something
that
easily
works
against
you
.
</s>
<s>
In
many
animation
movies
they
introduce
characters
in
the
beginning
in
a
way
you
get
used
to
their
specific
characteristic
movements
,
so
you
accept
a
certain
level
of
non-realism
easily
.

<s>
(
Check
the
weird
walk
cycles
in
<hi rend="italic">
The
Incredibles
</hi>
for
example
)
.
</s>
<s>
Another
aspect
is
that
we
've
started
work
on
the
first
scenes
,
and
ended
with
the
last
scenes
.
</s>
<s>
I
can
clearly
see
the
animation
quality
increase
,
and
that
whilst
the
ending
scenes
were
done
in
much
less
time
due
to
time
constraints
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
We
also
did
n't
schedule
to
do
9.5
minutes
of
animation
either
â€¦
.
</s>
<s>
Originally
it
was
more
like
6
.
</s>
<s>
But
,
it
's
always
easier
to
look
back
to
define
the
right
decisions
,
eh
?

</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
I
'm
very
happy
with
the
reviews
we
got
so
far
;
luckily
the
movie
was
perceived
as
a
professional
quality
product
,
and
reviewed
based
on
comparisons
with
what
the
big
studios
come
up
with
.
</s>
<s>
Even
when
we
could
n't
satisfy
all
these
quality
demands
,
it
has
luckily
not
been
branded
as
a
pathetic
presumptuous
attempt
by
amateurs
!

Do
you
think
there
is
hope
for
a
full-length
open
movie
project
in
the
near
future

Would
the
Blender
Foundation
be
interested
in
such
a
project

do
you
intend

continue
