Still , different challenges remain in anti-HIV drug therapy/prophylaxis , and these include the following , among others : ( i ) the onset of severe adverse effects leading to the discontinuation or interruption of therapy or even prophylaxis ; ( ii ) sub-optimal biodistribution and pharmacokinetics , particularly in reservoir sites or mucosae involved in sexual transmission ; ( iii ) the occurrence of viral resistance ; ( iv ) troublesome regimens and/or drug delivery routes that lead to poor adherence by patients/users ; ( v ) low stability and reduced shelf-life of active molecules , which may be particularly challenging in tropical climates and low-resource regions lacking adequate refrigerated distribution channels and storage ; ( vi ) lack of suitable dosage forms for particular populations ( e. g. , children and women ) ; ( vii ) costly drug products that are often inaccessible to populations in need of therapy/prophylaxis ; and ( viii ) social and legal constraints resulting in poor access to and the discontinuation of anti-HIV therapy/prophylaxis .

The development of antiretroviral drugs and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) in the mid-1990s — currently referred to as combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) — led to a dramatic shift of AIDS from a fatal disease into a chronic and often stable medical condition .
