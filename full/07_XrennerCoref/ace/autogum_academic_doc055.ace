Thus , the determination of the optimal cutoff ( threshold ) value at which signal can be discriminated from noise at an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio ( i. e. , maximum accuracy and sensitivity , lowest false discovery rate ( FDR ) ) is equivalent to a classification problem , a direct corollary to diagnostic detection .

As a consequence , these approaches do not have the ability to distinguish the DMP signal associated with a specific treatment ( or disease ) from DMPs deriving from natural variation within control ( or heathy ) individuals , and are thus not suitable for clinical diagnostics .

The probability of extreme methylation changes occurring spontaneously in a control group of samples by the stochastic fluctuations inherent to biochemical processes and DNA maintenance , requires the discrimination of this background variation from a biological treatment signal .

Stochastic fluctuation of the methylation process is expected , since methylation regulatory machinery participates , not only in organismal adaptation to micro- and macro-environmental fluctuations , but also in transitions across different stages of organismal ontogenetic development .
