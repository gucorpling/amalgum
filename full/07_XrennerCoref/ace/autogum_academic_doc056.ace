The quiescence of primordial follicles is maintained by several molecules including phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 ( Pten ) , tuberous sclerosis complexes 1 – 2 ( Tsc1 – Tsc2 ) complex , Forkhead box protein O3A ( Foxo3A ) , p27 , anti-Müllerian hormone ( AMH ) , and Forkhead box L2 ( FoxL2 ) .

Indeed , in genetically modified mouse models , it was observed that the PI3K – Akt – mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling pathway is crucial for the control of survival and activation of primordial follicles .

For example , Pten and Tsc1 – 2 are negative regulators of this signaling pathway and , in mice , the deletion of these genes from oocytes leads to primordial follicle activation and subsequent early follicular depletion .

At the antral stage , most follicles undergo apoptotic degeneration and only a few of them grow further to reach the preovulatory stage under the cyclic gonadotropin stimulation that occurs after puberty .

The transcription factor FoxO3A , mainly expressed in the oocytes of resting follicles , acts downstream of the PI3K signaling pathway and appears to be the main actor involved in follicular activation .
