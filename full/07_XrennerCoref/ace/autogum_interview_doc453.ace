I think this : the trauma that is caused by young kids -- and studies show now that a fairly substantial amount of young children are exposed to pornographic websites now -- just sighing and saying that 's life in modern America , well I think we should keep it from happening .

It might be argued to the jury that there are movies which put restricted labels and do n't go with the General Audience label because it actually intrigues young people and sometimes has proven to draw higher attendance if you have a label that implies there is something risque in the movie .

If the jury believes it was truly put in there in a way that the purveyor of the pornographic image set up his site to attract children , then he is going to be liable .

They are going to have to decide whether the key element in the Parents Empowerment Act , which is whether or not the purveyor of the pornography could reasonably expect children to see it .

Absolutely it would stop a pornographic website , if it is put out in a way that children should reasonably be expected to see it , it should be banned .

Would a website with a message at the front saying that a user confirms they are over 18 before they enter the site , would that be sufficient ?
