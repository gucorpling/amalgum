Thus , PROPERTY , which includes the fact that most of the surface of the farm is owned by the person in charge , has a positive parameter associated , consistent with literature , which points to the fact that the ownership of the farm favors investment in renewables ; although in this case this relationship is not statistically significant .

Although it may seem like an influence of reduced magnitude , it is a logical value , since the intra-class correlation tends to be smaller the larger the theoretical dimension of the group , its value oscillating between 0.05 and 0.85 % , for example , when the group identifies with the region .

Three of them , PROFES , PERMANENT and SIZE , which have a relevant and positive effect on the probability that the farm will invest in renewable energies , refer to the characteristics of the farm , while the fourth , EDUCATION , corresponds to a characteristic of the person in charge .

This result , together with the positive effect of the PROFES and PERMANENT variables that represent , respectively , their legal status and workforce stability , demonstrate that management professionalization and the solidity of the farm are elements that work in favor of investment in a renewable infrastructure .

In this case , it is observed that most of the variation in the dependent variable has its origin in the differences between farms , while 7.3 % of this said variance , based on the CCI value , can be attributed to differences in regional factors .

The inclusion of the regional characteristics results in a slight improvement of the Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) ( from a value of 457.45 to a value of 457.15 ) , while the goodness of fit measures considered ( pseudo-R2 ) exhibit an appreciable increase .

This could be in line with the opinion of authors who believe that this type of investment is favored by the farm â€™s orientation towards obtaining an economic profit , which would be achieved through a strategy of production diversification .

From these values it is possible to calculate the intra-class correlation ( ICC ) as a representative measure of the variation percentage of the dependent variable which is attributable to differences between the regions .
