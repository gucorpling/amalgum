When Gioseffo Zarlino took over the post of maestro di cappella from Cipriano de Rore in 1565 , Donato was demoted back to being a singer ; conflict between the two men seems to have been a feature of life at St. Mark 's , culminating in a climactic fight in 1569 , publicly and scandalously , during the Feast of St. Mark .

The progressive trend in the Venetian school was represented by composers such as Donato , Giovanni Croce , and Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli ; the conservative trend involved composers and theorists such as Zarlino , Cipriano de Rore , and Claudio Merulo , who tended to follow the Franco-Flemish style which was predominant almost everywhere else in Europe until after mid-century .

In 1588 he became assistant maestro di cappella at St. Mark 's , while Zarlino was still alive ( whether because of reconcilement or politics is not clear ) , and in 1590 he took over the post of his former antagonist , holding it until his death in 1603 .

In spite of his evident disdain for Zarlino 's conservatism , he clearly absorbed some of his style and teaching , as can be seen in his smooth mastery of counterpoint and Zarlinoesque use of dissonance , at least when he was deliberately composing in the Franco-Flemish style .

In 1577 Donato took a position at the Scuola Grande di S Rocco , another Venetian church with an impressive musical tradition and substantial performing ensemble ; however he failed to get along with his employers there as well , resigning by 1580 .

They are similar to the French chanson , often have a memorable melody in the topmost part , contain vigorous cross-rhythms , and avoid the polyphonic and chromatic complexity of the mid-century madrigal .

Donato 's sacred music is the most conservative portion of his output , usually using polyphony in the Palestrina style , but also using some of the grand polychoral effects of the Gabrielis .
