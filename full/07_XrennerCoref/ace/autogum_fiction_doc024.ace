There was one of the tribe of Tarzan who questioned his authority , and that was Terkoz , the son of Tublat , but he so feared the keen knife and the deadly arrows of his new lord that he confined the manifestation of his objections to petty disobediences and irritating mannerisms ; Tarzan knew , however , that he but waited his opportunity to wrest the kingship from him by some sudden stroke of treachery , and so he was ever on his guard against surprise .

But when one day a member of the tribe discovered the blacks in great numbers on the banks of a little stream that had been their watering place for generations , and in the act of clearing a space in the jungle and erecting many huts , the apes would remain no longer ; and so Tarzan led them inland for many marches to a spot as yet undefiled by the foot of a human being .

The periodic disappearance of their arrows , and the strange pranks perpetrated by unseen hands , had wrought them to such a state that life had become a veritable burden in their new home , and now it was that Mbonga and his head men began to talk of abandoning the village and seeking a site farther on in the jungle .

Tarzan led them by night to the fields of the black men , and there , warned by their chief 's superior wisdom , they ate only what they required , nor ever did they destroy what they could not eat , as is the way of Manu , the monkey , and of most apes .

But this method he realized to be too fraught with danger , and so he commenced picking up solitary hunters with his long , deadly noose , stripping them of weapons and ornaments and dropping their bodies from a high tree into the village street during the still watches of the night .

When the awe-struck savages saw that the food disappeared overnight they were filled with consternation and dread , for it was one thing to put food out to propitiate a god or a devil , but quite another thing to have the spirit really come into the village and eat it .

These various escapades again so terrorized the blacks that , had it not been for the monthly respite between Tarzan 's visits , in which they had opportunity to renew hope that each fresh incursion would prove the last , they soon would have abandoned their new village .

So , while the blacks were wroth at the continued pilfering of their fields , they were not discouraged in their efforts to cultivate the land , as would have been the case had Tarzan permitted his people to lay waste the plantation wantonly .
