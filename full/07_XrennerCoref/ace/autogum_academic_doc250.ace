The tolerance of ethanol producing bacteria for high substrate , inhibitor , and product concentration still needs to be improved ; its progress on developments of co-fermenting microbes have been slower than projected . Review on “ present technical issues ” hindering cellulosic ethanol production indicated microbial species had been engineered to ferment both C5 and C6 sugars , but ethanol yields were low , and the microbes had low tolerance to high ethanol contents compared to C5 fermenting microbes . Liu et al. further reported that there has been considerable work trying to improve co-fermenting bacteria for at least four decades to date , but still today , it ’s possible to recognize familiar difficulties amongst various projects .

Using feedstocks available in quantities large enough to supply a factory ( as opposed to tiny amounts upon which a laboratory test could be carried out ) brings its own technological challenges : the variability in quality and composition of the feedstock is clearly recognized as a key point , resulting in the need for a robust pretreatments section .

Alcohol producing strains with the ability to hydrolyze polymeric substrates have been in development for some time ; although high end product concentration and selectivity ( toward greater production of the desired alcohol ) , and insensitivity to inherent and generated inhibitors and process conditions remain major goals .
