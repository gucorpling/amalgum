In this section , the performance of the proposed scheme is investigated against several non-ideal channel conditions such as frequency offset , phase offset , timing offset , varying symbol number as well as different Doppler shifts .

The In-Phase-Quadrature ( I-Q ) samples of the received signal were sampled simultaneously to a frame of length N. They are combined later in a 2 X N matrix and input to CNN for feature extraction .

In this way , the proposed classifier would be independent of N. The range of AWGN noise with signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) = âˆ’8 dB to +8 dB in the dataset .

In the following experiment , the proposed classifier NSVM , which is a hybrid combination of CNN and SVM is trained and validated by using offline deployment .

For each modulation scheme and SNR values , 10,000 realizations of the received signal are generated according to the model described in Section 2 .

The performance of NSVM is better than the traditional CNN model as the accuracy and loss converges to their minima and maxima quickly .

However , in the case of CNN with softmax , the classifier performance is hardly stable and satisfactory , as can be seen in

Along with that , these results show that it smoothens as training progresses , which shows the effectiveness of the proposed scheme .
