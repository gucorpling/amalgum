To answer our research questions , we applied the following inclusion criteria to each of the considered manuscripts : ( 1 ) It was acknowledged as an original article ; we included experimental studies ( randomised and placebo-controlled trials ) and observational studies ( cohort , cross-sectional , and case-control studies ) ; ( 2 ) it was a full text published either in English , Portuguese , or Spanish ; ( 3 ) at least one of the sarcopenia criteria was measured : Muscular mass and/or muscular strength and/or physical performance ; ( 4 ) a description of how sarcopenia was evaluated was defined in the methods section ; ( 5 ) the concentration of leucine used in the intervention was specified or could be calculated .

We assessed the risk of bias in each randomised and placebo-controlled study according to the Cochrane Review guidelines , which cover the following bias domains : Selection bias ( random sequence generation and allocation concealment ) , performance bias ( blinding of participants and personnel ) , detection bias ( blinding the outcome assessment ) , attrition bias ( incomplete outcome data ) , and reporting bias ( selective reporting ) .

Two reviewers independently extracted the following data from each article : The country in which the study was conducted , number of participants , age of the participants at the time of inclusion , sex of the participants , amount of leucine administered , co-administration of other substances , sarcopenia evaluation methods , and the main and secondary outcomes of the study .
