There are numerous members of this group and among the SFKs Lyn , Fyn , and Src have been implicated in activation of the GPVI receptor and the integrin receptor signaling and are frequently studied proteins as they are present in both human and mouse platelets .

It was found that the most prominent dasatinib-targeted SFKs are Lyn , Fyn , and Src , kinases and their negative regulator C-terminal Src kinase ( Csk ) , but nilotinib does not bind to these kinases .

We found that at therapeutic concentration dasatainib , but not nilotinib , has a strong inhibitory effect on platelet procoagulant activity and on clot retraction both in non activated as well as in convulxin activated platelets .

It has long been known that second-generation TKIs may have side effects as nilotinib can potentiate a prothrombotic state while dasatinib is known to cause platelet dysfunction e.g. impaired collagen-induced platelet adhesion and aggregation .
