Moreover , the research process was based on ( 1 ) data triangulation ( i. e. , combining two data collection approaches : A focus group and individual interviews with two comparative heterogenous demographic samples ) and ( 2 ) method triangulation ( i. e. , analyzing academic and professional literature , content analysis , and an analysis of cognitive chaining ) to obtain more robust results , thereby strengthening the research ’s validity .

A survey of Eco Entreprises Quebec shows that Canadian consumers have a higher awareness of eco-design packaging in food categories ( 57.1 % ) than in other product categories , including medication ( 10.6 % ) and cleaning products ( 9.0 % ) .

Moreover , this study revealed four risk-oriented consumption patterns associated with eco-design packaging ( i. e. , functional and physical risks-oriented consumption patterns , life standard risk-oriented consumption patterns , financial risk-oriented consumption patterns , and socio-environmental risk-oriented consumption patterns ) .

Hence , it is necessary to perform a confirmatory study of these experimental studies by integrating the effect of time , to investigate the causal relationship between consumers ’ perceptions towards eco-design packaging and their food waste behaviors .

Future studies focusing upon the positive reactions of consumers ( e. g. , perceived benefits and perceived quality ) through an MEC approach are recommended to gain a complete understanding of the topic .

These results seem to contradict most of the findings of previous consumer studies on the influence of packaging on food waste behaviors , which showed instead that reduced packaging reduces food waste .

Firstly , due to the sample ( n = 19 ) of individual interviews , this study cannot generalize its findings related to consumers ’ cognitive chains to all consumers .

These inconsistent results may be due to the particular sample and/or an oversight of some effects of key variables ( e. g. , the effects of time ) .

Future research may seek to establish a representative of cognitive chaining to build a dynamic causal model of A-C-Vs with a representative sample ( around fifty ) .

Thus , a future study may investigate consumers ’ perceptions towards eco-packaging across different product categories ( e. g. , cleaning products and cosmetic products ) .

In particular , 26 % of consumers interviewed stated that eco-design packaging could cause food waste because of its simplicity , reduction , or poor quality .

Lastly , the results of this exploratory study have demonstrated the socio – environmental risks related to packaging .

Secondly , this study focused upon the negative reactions of consumers , namely their perceived risk .

This exploratory study developed an MEC analysis of consumers ’ cognitive structures regarding eco-design packaging .

Note that this representation of static cognitive chaining cannot lead to an inference of causality .

However , due to the exploratory nature of this study , several limitations remain .

Another limitation is that this study focused upon food packaging in a Canadian context .
