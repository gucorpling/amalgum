Additionally , a recent study of asexual women of color found that the identity construction processes tied to self-definition and acceptance are strongly shaped by the inseparability of race , gender , and asexuality ( Foster et al. 2019 ) .

While asexualities rest in the margins of unfamiliarity when considered against other queer identities such as lesbian , gay , bisexual , and trans identity categories , expectedly , within asexual identities , there are hierarchies of privilege .

As part of a call for critical sexuality studies , asexuality was situated as a necessary topic of further exploration to adequately explore power and privilege as they intersect with sexuality ( Fahs and McClelland 2016 ) .

These more recent academic calls to more broadly interrogate asexuality in theoretical explorations and clinical practice aim to improve general knowledge of asexuality and the interpersonal experiences of asexual folks ( Foster and Scherrer 2014 ) .

Asexuality as an orientation is social , biological , agentic , and not simply situated in whether or not a person has sex ; celibacy is more simply a choice to abstain ( Hanson 2014 ) .

While ( not ) performing sex because of celibacy or asexuality is a choice , asexuality is a sexual politic that is present regardless of one â€™s choice to engage in sex or not .

This is differentiated from the more frequent , medically pathologized people who have a lifelong disinterest in any sexual activity ( Chasin 2013 ; Cerankowski and Milks 2010 ) .
