Therefore , we performed a case-control study with first-episode and drug-naïve schizophrenia patients and healthy controls to identify the association between serum concentrations of the 4 THMs ( i. e. , Cr , Cd , Pb and As , selected as commonly surveyed heavy metals in schizophrenia studies ) and the risk of schizophrenia .

Moreover , it has been reported that THMs could cause oxidative stress and subsequently DNA damage , lipid peroxidation and protein modification , which play a role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases , including cancer , diabetes , neurological disorders and chronic inflammation .

For example , despite supporting evidence both in vitro and in vivo for the association between Pb and schizophrenia , a cross-sectional study among a Chinese population showed no significant difference in the concentration of Pb between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls .

For example , arsenic ( As ) -induced neurotoxicity has been reported to cause compositional changes and hyperphosphorylation on the cytoskeletal protein , leading to the disintegration of the cytoskeletal framework and causing neurodegenerative diseases .

Recent studies have suggested metabolic syndrome as a risk factor of schizophrenia , attributed to poor dietary habits , unhealthy lifestyle and physical inactivity of the patients and side-effects of the second generation-antipsychotics .

Epidemiological studies have suggested that urban environments could increase the risk of schizophrenia , which may be due to the exposure to the toxic heavy metals ( THMs ) in the environment .

On the other hand , THMs such as As and Pb were found to be associated with metabolic diseases , suggesting a role of abnormal metabolisms in linking THMs and schizophrenia .

The reason for the divergence may be related to the choice of the population , such as whether the schizophrenic patients have received antipsychotics drug during the time of study .
