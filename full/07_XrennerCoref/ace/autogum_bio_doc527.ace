I assure you that with the help of God I will enter powerfully against you , and I will make war on you in every place and in every way that I can , and I will subject you to the yoke and obedience of the church and their highnesses , and I will take your persons and your women and your children , and I will make them slaves , and as such I will sell them , and dispose of them as their highnesses command : I will take your goods , and I will do you all the evils and harms which I can , just as to vassals who do not obey and do not want to receive their lord , resist him and contradict him . And I declare that the deaths and harms which arise from this will be your fault , and not that of their highnesses , nor mine , nor of the gentlemen who have come with me here .
