As Ben Rozitis , a planetary scientist and a co-author of the study , told Space.com : " I was expecting to find a high-density metallic asteroid , as such an asteroid would n't require cohesive forces to hold itself together under its fast rotation .

This effect results in a change of the rotation rate of an asteroid ( either faster or slower ) , and is caused when the Sun heats up an object unevenly , due to asymmetric surface topography .

A team of researchers from the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , has confirmed that near-Earth asteroid ( 29075 ) 1950 DA is primarily held together by van der Waals forces rather than gravity .

Ben Rozitis clarified : " Mining missions intend to visit small asteroids about 10 meters ( 33 feet ) or less in size , as it is thought that they are predominantly solid bodies .

The balance between cohesion and negative gravity requires small grain sizes consistent with the grain size distribution on 1950DA , and similar to that of another rubble-pile asteroid , ( 25143 ) Itokawa .

An alternative is to use a ' gravity tractor , ' or a heavy spacecraft placed near the asteroid , which uses the force of gravity to pull the asteroid off course " .

The researchers found that the bulk density 1.7±0.7 g/cm³ of the asteroid is approximately two times lower than the value required for self-gravity to balance out the centrifugal forces caused by rotation .

However , its low optical albedo and low radar circular polarization ratio ( a very smooth surface at centimetre to decimetre scales ) showed that it cannot be an E-type asteroid .

It would have been puzzling , if it was not for the Rosetta observations of 21 Lutetia , which is also an M-type asteroid with very similar low radar albedo .

They have shown that the rotation rate of the 1.1 km asteroid is higher than could be possible if only gravity and friction were responsible for holding it together .

But as the spin rate increases due to YORP effect , the centrifugal force may cause the rubble pile to eventually separate as it happened with P/2013 R3 .

Unlike Itokawa , 1950DA does not have large boulder s on the surface ; they may have been lost as 1950DA 's rotation accelerated due to YORP effect .

According to Daniel Scheeres , an aerospace engineer at the University of Colorado , Boulder , understanding such cohesive forces may also be important for future asteroid mining .

Researchers have used for 1950DA the same meteorite analogue which was earlier found to fit best 21 Lutetia : enstatite chondrite with grain density of 3.55 g/cm³ .

Negative ambient gravity near the equator of the asteroid ( 48±24 % of its surface ) requires existence of cohesive forces to prevent loss of material .

As Ben Rozitis explained : " We found a low-density rubble pile that traditionally would be unable to hold itself together unless cohesive forces were present .

A small rubble-pile asteroid would be harder to interact with and collect , as it can easily deform or break up when subject to external forces .

The researchers find that a rubble-pile asteroid may have a high rotation rate , if it is held together by cohesive forces between the grains .

Taking into account thermal-infrared measurements of thermal inertia , presence of a fine-grained regolith is implied , primarily around 1950DA 's equator .

Spectral observations of 1950DA indicated that it is either an E- or M-type asteroid in the Tholen classification .

Unusually for an M-type asteroid ( which are mostly metallic ) , 1950DA has low radar albedo .
