At the Spanish court of Philip III ( r.1598 – 1621 ) , where they arrived in 1611 , a major misunderstanding arose ; Dengiz Beg had sold more than half of the total bales of silk for his own profit . [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ lower-alpha 2 ] De Gouvea , without any sort of compromise with the Iranian government , suddenly offered the remaining number of silk bales as a gift to the Spanish king , even though the Iranians had intended to sell them as a sample of the silk they intended to deliver in the future .

When Abbas later received de Gouvea , he also discovered that Dengiz Beg had received nothing of equal value in return ; the presents and goods were all a gift , and not payment for the silk ; and they were , reportedly , not even nearly as costly as the bales of silk that de Gouvea had given to Philip III .

Amongst others , Dengiz Beg was accused of treating the members of his mission extremely bad ; this had resulted in some of them converting to Christianity and staying in Europe . [ 4 ] Abbas ' anger with Dengiz Beg was most likely increased by Philip III 's meager responses and actions and for " reawakening " his dissatisfaction with the Portuguese occupation of Hormuz .
