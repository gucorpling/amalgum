I 'm trying to weigh the pro 's and con 's of if I am in a better situation by white knuckling through all the JW talk around me from my family , or just publicly stating my position via DA and letting them make a choice in regards to how our relationship will turn out after .

And as difficult as it may be to make that choice if it were to come to it , if both myself and my wife are happier in the long run by living separate lives , then it may be for the best .

My wife also suffers from a form of PTSD ( surprise surprise ) as a result of her upbringing and some abuse that happened to her ( yet again , no surprise ) that causes her to have extreme anxiety .

If that is the case I end up making , I would DA before divorcing so that at least I can leave on my terms , and not theirs by DF'ing me for getting a divorce .
