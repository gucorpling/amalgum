However , in addition to primary ( aging ) sarcopenia , a broader definition is taking hold , which includes as secondary sarcopenia the reduction in muscle mass and muscle strength and further muscle function loss , due to factors associated with activity , disease , and nutrition .

With respect to geriatric syndrome , often the viewpoint involves the purpose of sustaining the capability for activities of daily living ( ADL ) and improving the quality of life ( QOL ) , rather than just considering the disease condition according to the diagnostic name .

It has been suggested that interventions focused on the physical elements behind frailty ( weight loss , muscle weakness , exhaustion , slowness , low physical activity ) are effective , and comprehensive interventions incorporating as many of the elements as possible are desirable .

Notably , there are geriatric syndrome symptoms that are more frequent and are largely affected by long-term care , such as , disorders associated with mobility ( remain secluded , or bedridden ) , falls , incontinence , and cognitive impairment .

Geriatric syndrome refers to a series of symptoms and observations caused by a variety of factors associated with aging , where the older adults show the treatment consciously or otherwise , and long-term care becomes important at the same time .

“ Sarcopenia ” is a coined word , where “ sarx ( sarco ) ” means muscle and “ penia ” means “ loss and reduction ” in Greek , and it was first proposed by Rosenberg in 1989 .

Therefore , it is expected that appropriate intervention for frail older adults will lead to improvements in physical function and daily living capabilities , help reverse frailty , and prevent the onset of functional disorders .

In addition to strength training , multifaceted exercise programs that incorporate flexible exercise , balance exercise , and aerobic exercise have also been reported to improve muscle strength in frail older adults .

Frailty progresses as vulnerability to stress increases due to declining physiological reserves with aging , making one prone to unhealthy conditions .
