It might have been church-time on a summer ’s day in the reign of Queen Anne ; the stillness was too perfect to be modern , the nearness counted so as distance , and there was something so fresh and sound in the originality of the large smooth house , the expanse of beautiful brickwork that showed for pink rather than red and that had been kept clear of messy creepers by the law under which a woman with a rare complexion disdains a veil .

The servant went away , leaving the glass doors open into the gallery , and Paul Overt remained at the head of the wide double staircase , saying to himself that the place was sweet and promised a pleasant visit , while he leaned on the balustrade of fine old ironwork which , like all the other details , was of the same period as the house .

HE had been told the ladies were at church , but this was corrected by what he saw from the top of the steps — they descended from a great height in two arms , with a circular sweep of the most charming effect — at the threshold of the door which , from the long bright gallery , overlooked the immense lawn .

It marched across from end to end and seemed — with its bright colours , its high panelled windows , its faded flowered chintzes , its quickly-recognised portraits and pictures , the blue-and-white china of its cabinets and the attenuated festoons and rosettes of its ceiling — a cheerful upholstered avenue into the other century .

Our friend was slightly nervous ; that went with his character as a student of fine prose , went with the artist ’s general disposition to vibrate ; and there was a particular thrill in the idea that Henry St. George might be a member of the party .
