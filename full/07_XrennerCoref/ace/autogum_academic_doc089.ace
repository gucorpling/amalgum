Firstly , problem formulation that is achieved by understanding the freight transport scenario in the UK and identifying the need for Urban freight movement by rail in a robust manner ; secondly , evaluating the Cross-City railway line to study the utilisation levels by developing a model that replicates the existing railway line accurately using SIMUL8 software ; thirdly , devising solutions to propose a replacement to the current system that has the ability to move freight between Lichfield Trent Valley and Birmingham New Street station by rail ; finally , evaluating and comparing the proposed models and obtained results and suggest the best suitable scenario .

This is achieved by replicating the system in the simulation model using SIMUL8 software ; secondly , to propose suitable scenarios by identifying gaps in the evaluated system so that it presents with a case to improve the current utilisation levels of the system ; finally , to evaluate the proposed scenarios if they are feasible to operate and generate the expected utilisation levels .

Apart from this , providing a greener option to move goods , this method actually has the capacity to match up the trade-off between the utilisation levels and capital costs , as the organisations running the rail services largely invest in spending on the infrastructure .

This situation was the motivation to evaluate the utilisation levels of the Cross-City railway line in the West Midlands County in England and come up with cases to accommodate to move urban freight by rail in one of the busiest industrial hubs of the country .

Adapting to movement of urban freight by rail seems to present a greater opportunity to overcome the emission issues as well as the road congestion problem as the region under study possesses a high value and demand for freight movement .

In Section 6 , the simulation layout of the railway line and the computed utilisation levels for different scenarios have been illustrated and the results obtained from the simulation model were analysed and the best suitable scenario was presented .

The forecasts that are showing an increase in the usage of motor vehicles for freight transport does not seem promising as the transport sector is already being accounted for 17 % of the UK â€™s total domestic GHG emissions .
