She is indeed likeable ( unless for GraspHeart I guess ) since she comes around and understands what Ainz put forward to her , even if it is pure uncensored bullshit .

But the entire Nazarick cast is pretty much indestructible ( with exception of the maids , but i doubt something like this is going to happen again ) .

She has only made an appearance in one Volume(half volume ) so I do n't understand why I even like her that much .
