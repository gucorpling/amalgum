Thus , the integrative model for strategic HRM , which combines rational and progressive approaches and is ingrained in some theories — for instance resource-based view ( RBV ) , social exchange theory ( SET ) , and behavioral-based view — are found as an appropriate approach to strategic HRM and SCA .

Behavioral approaches , which identify divergent role behaviors as significant to the kind of strategy that is being pursued by an organization , are found in the literature to be the most often used theory to explain the nexus in strategic human resources management ( HRM ) practices .

In accordance with the theories highlighted above , this study aims at determining the impact of “ strategic HRM practices ” on the SCA within academic institutions through the evaluation of the mediating function of human capital development and “ employee commitment ” .
