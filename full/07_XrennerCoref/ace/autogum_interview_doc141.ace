Second of all , it 's not clear that North Korea actually has nuclear warheads that are small enough to actually put on top of missiles ; they tell us this but nuclear weapons are actually pretty heavy , which is why nuclear missiles are frequently quite large , so moving the weapon there does n't necessarily mean it 's pointed at the United States or Tokyo which I suppose would be the likely targets .

It is important , because it is a source of hard currency for the North , so its closure suggests that the North is willing to carry genuine costs over this feud .
