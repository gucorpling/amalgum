It 's tough for me to make an exact estimate on my dosage because I used pills rather than measuring out my kratom , but weighing several unfilled capsules and several filled capsules , it looks like I was on 11-ish grams two times daily , sometimes a third thrown in for good measure .

If I ca n't manage the RLS tomorrow night , I will likely go back on a small dose of kratom at night to stave it away until I can see a doc , and hopefully get some ambien or ... something .
