In general , the methods developed until now can be grouped in two categories depending on the direction of the manufacturing process : bottom up methods , which start from molecular precursor in that assembled together to build up objects of higher hierarchical level , and top down methods , in which macroscopic materials are reduced to the nano-size element of which are constituted or used as raw material , as in the case of graphite and waste plastic for graphene , respectively .

On its favor , it produces the highest quality of graphene because of the high purity of graphite , and moreover it is a relatively easy procedure since the vertical stacking of graphene sheets is assured only by weak van der Waals interactions .

Currently , the various methods show different and complementary characteristics , but none of them can comply all the possible requirements , for example large extension , large production , defect-free structure , functionalization , cleanliness from impurities , low costs .

However , some investigations have shown that this undesired effect can be avoided by putting in solution some specific chemicals , such as surfactants or intercalating molecules , which facilitate the exfoliation , thus requiring weaker sonication .

However , this method is limited by two main factors : the small amount of product and in the exiguous extension of graphene flakes , the latter factor bypassable by using of HOPG as raw material .

Since the first isolation carried out by Novoselov and Geim in 2004 , a plethora of methods have been developed to produce graphene , by exploiting a wide variety of physical or chemical phenomena .

Therefore , case by case the choice between them is driven by the evaluation of which method is better suitable for the specific application in which graphene must be implemented .

In detail , the direct manipulation of top graphene sheet on graphite can be performed both by scotch tape and by tips originally produced for scanning probe microscopy .

For this reason this technique can be extended to other van der Waals heterostructures , such as transition metal dichalcogenide ( , , , ) .

By contrast , the most critical issue consists of the damaging of the internal structure of graphene flakes in which some defects can be induced .

This procedure is preferable to the mechanical exfoliation since in comparison it produces a large quantity of graphene flakes with larger lateral size .

in this case the exfoliation procedure is performed in liquid-phase , and the separation of graphene sheets is obtained by sonication (
