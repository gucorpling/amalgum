The emergence of antibiotic resistance is a natural biological phenomenon , and even though numerous factors have been identified as the cause of this , such as clustering and overcrowding or increased elderly population , one of the most important factors is the inadequate use of antibiotics , a very worrying situation especially for healthcare professionals with high rate of antibiotic prescription such as primary care dentists .

However , taking into account that the control of antibiotic resistance requires a multidisciplinary approach , and that nursing staff play a key role in the rational use of antibiotics , as teachers of patients , and as future drug prescribers in our country , the training of nurses could have an important impact in reducing the incidence of antibiotic resistance .

According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , inadequate use of antibiotics includes the prescription of inappropriate antibiotics for a brief time , in low or insufficient doses and/or for diseases for which they are not indicated ; likewise , excessive therapeutic dosage regimens are also considered inadequate uses of antibiotics .

The inadequate use of antibiotics can be encouraged by self-medication , by the implementation of permissive policies in terms of regulation of the use of these drugs , by the relationship between the healthcare professional and the patient or by the knowledge and attitudes that one has towards them .

To date , the studies which have evaluated the training that healthcare students have about infectious diseases , antimicrobial resistance and safe use of antibiotics have been mainly carried out in students of medicine and pharmacy , besides students from other disciplines such as dentistry .

Regarding the latter , while it is true that a poor knowledge or negative attitude towards antibiotics leads inevitably to bad clinical practice , practical skills are not always a reflection of knowledge , a situation known as “ theory – practice gap ” .

Moreover , if the treatment fails or if the response to treatment is slow , the patient is contagious for longer , which increases the likelihood of resistant microorganisms being transmitted to other people .

In the specific case of Spain , the consumption of antibiotics for outpatients is above the European average , and in hospitals their prescription is increasing .

Infections by resistant microorganisms do not respond to treatment , so the duration of the disease is prolonged , and the risk of death increases .

Thus , the objective of this paper has been to determine the nursing students ’ knowledge and awareness of antibiotic use , resistance and stewardship .
