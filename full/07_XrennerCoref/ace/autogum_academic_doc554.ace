The shear modulus G and the damping ratio D are the key soil parameters in geotechnical issues in which the soil is subjected to dynamic loads , for example , machines foundation , city tram and subway traffic , driving of sheet pile or precast pile , or mechanical soil compaction at the bottom of the excavation .

These two mentioned parameters are also used in the soil-structure interaction when a large area of soil is employed to interaction with construction , e. g. , in diaphragm walls ’ construction , tunnel housing , or subway stations .

In engineering practices , several types of damping are used , i. e. , hysteretic damping , viscous damping , damping caused by wave scattering , radiation damping , numerical damping , and damping as an alternative .

Each one of the abovementioned geotechnical problems should be solved based on geotechnical parameters obtained in small and medium strain range , in which soil behaves like an elastic and elastic-plastic medium .

However , the damping process relates to several possible processes , not to a unique process , so it is challenging to model it properly .

Nevertheless , every abovementioned geotechnical problem is connected with significant damping , so its effect should be included in the dynamical analysis .
