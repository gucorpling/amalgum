As Sheldon rode about the plantation , acknowledging to himself the comfort and convenience of a horse and wondering why he had not thought of getting one himself , he pondered the various improvements for which Joan was responsible -- the splendid Poonga-Poonga recruits ; the fruits and vegetables ; the Martha herself , snatched from the sea for a song and earning money hand over fist despite old Kinross 's slow and safe method of running her ; and Berande , once more financially secure , approaching each day nearer the dividend-paying time , and growing each day as the black toilers cleared the bush , cut the cane-grass , and planted more cocoanut palms .

He forgot all the early exasperations , remembering only her charms and sweetnesses and glorying much in the traits he at first had disliked most -- her boyishness and adventurousness , her delight to swim and risk the sharks , her desire to go recruiting , her love of the sea and ships , her sharp authoritative words when she launched the whale-boat and , with firestick in one hand and dynamite-stick in the other , departed with her picturesque crew to shoot fish in the Balesuna ; her super-innocent disdain for the commonest conventions , her juvenile joy in argument , her fluttering , wild-bird love of freedom and mad passion for independence .

In these and a thousand ways Sheldon was made aware of how much he was indebted for material prosperity to Joan -- to the slender , level-browed girl with romance shining out of her gray eyes and adventure shouting from the long-barrelled Colt 's on her hip , who had landed on the beach that piping gale , along with her stalwart Tahitian crew , and who had entered his bungalow to hang with boy 's hands her revolver-belt and Baden- Powell hat on the nail by the billiard table .

There were times when he was dizzy with thought of her and love of her , when he would stop his horse and with closed eyes picture her as he had seen her that first day , in the stern-sheets of the whale-boat , dashing madly in to shore and marching belligerently along his veranda to remark that it was pretty hospitality this letting strangers sink or swim in his front yard .

He was sure of several things : first , that Tudor was not the right man for Joan and could not possibly make her permanently happy ; next , that Joan was too sensible a girl really to fall in love with a man of such superficial stamp ; and , finally , that Tudor would blunder his love-making somehow .

Often , after his morning ride over the plantation , or coming in from the store or from inspection of the copra-drying , Sheldon found the pair of them together on the veranda , Joan listening , intent and excited , and Tudor deep in some recital of personal adventure at the ends of the earth .

Sheldon noticed , too , the way Tudor looked at her and followed her about with his eyes , and in those eyes he noted a certain hungry look , and on the face a certain wistful expression ; and he wondered if on his own face he carried a similar involuntary advertisement .

And as he opened his eyes and urged his horse onward , he would ponder for the ten thousandth time how possibly he was ever to hold her when she was so wild and bird-like that she was bound to flutter out and away from under his hand .

This cessation of verbal sparring was like the breaking off of diplomatic relations between countries at the beginning of war , and , once Sheldon 's suspicions were aroused , he was not long in finding other confirmations .

And then , in spite of all his certitude , Sheldon could not forbear wondering if his theories of Joan might not be wrong , and if Tudor was not going the right way about after all .

And at the same time , with true lover 's anxiety , Sheldon feared that the other might somehow fail to blunder , and win the girl with purely fortuitous and successful meretricious show .

The first warning Sheldon had of the other 's growing interest in the girl was when Tudor eased down and finally ceased pricking him with his habitual sharpness of quip and speech .

All this he now loved , and he no longer desired to tame and hold her , though the paradox was the winning of her without the taming and the holding .

But of the one thing Sheldon was sure : Tudor had no intimate knowledge of her and was unaware of how vital in her was her wildness and love of independence .
