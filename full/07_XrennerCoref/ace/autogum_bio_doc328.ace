Paisius II 's fourth term was an interlude in the reign of Cyril V , and began in last days of May 1751 when Cyril was actually deposed by the Metropolitans both because of his regulations on taxes and because of his strong position in favor of the necessity of re- baptism of Armenian and Latin converts .

The first time that Paisius was elected as Patriarch of Constantinople was 20 November 1726 , the day when Callinicus III was found dead by heart attack before his enthronement : Paisius was immediately chosen by the faction that previously elected Callinicus to preclude a return to the throne of Jeremias III .

The complaints were due mainly to Paisius ' financial management of the millet , i.e. the Christian civil community ruled by the Patriarch : to reduce the high levels of debts , Paisius increased the taxation particularly of the laity , and this caused discontent with him . [ 3 ]
