Regarding quality of life , we again took a multidimensional approach and drew on the information published by Eurostat in the Flash Eurobarometer 419 to produce a measurement of European citizens ’ subjective quality of life based on four dimensions : life satisfaction , mobility , culture and sports , social integration , and public services .

In this regard , environmental structural capital was used to measure the environmental dimension ( ED ) , gross domestic product ( GDP ) and the labor market situation were used to measure the economic dimension ( EcD ) , and social human capital was used to measure the social dimension ( SD ) .

These variables were transformed into principal components ( PCs ) by means of Equation ( 1 ) : ( 1 ) where ui is the characteristic vector of each PC and xi is the variable used to build the capitals for the total of k variables considered .

According to the rankings of the general indices , we observed that the less populated cities offer better positions in terms of citizen ’s quality of life , with notable differences with respect to their sustainable development strategy ( see Table A1 in Appendix A ) .

Finally , on the basis of these PCs , a value for each of the proposed indicators can be determined by a weighted geometric mean , whereby weightings are assigned according to the percentage of variance retained by each component in the principal component analysis .

The economic dimension ( EcD ) is measured using gross domestic product ( GDP ) and labor market indicators such as unemployment rate , active population , and types of jobs ( self-employed , salaried , part-time , and full time ) .

The results showed that the cities of Hamburg , Kobenhavn and Bratislava occupy the top three positions in terms of sustainability , while Zurich , Kobenhavn and Stockholm stand out in terms of their citizens ’ assessment of quality of life .

To prevent any loss of relevance , since it is not possible to aggregate information on variables of different types , they were rescaled by assigning them a maximum value of 100 and a minimum value of 0 .

At the other end of the spectrum , the cities with the worst sustainability index score are Napoli , Bucharest and Oviedo , and the worst in terms of quality of life are Roma , Palermo and Lisbon .

Finally , the indicators obtained for each of the dimensions could be merged to obtain an overall quality of life index for each city , which we refer to as the quality of life ( QOL ) index .

A principal component analysis was used to construct these indices , as was done in a study López et al. ( 2014 ) , where the good performance of this technique for index construction was demonstrated .

The fact that there is no generally-accepted methodology for defining either sustainability or quality of life indicators led us to use the methodology developed in a study by Alfaro et al. ( 2017 ) .

Specifically , 17 environmental indicators , 8 economic indicators and 15 social indicators were used to measure the consequences of a sustainable governance for cities within a macroeconomic framework of intellectual capital .

According to Alfaro et al. ( 2017 ) , the environmental dimension ( ED ) includes four components : pollution , water consumption , waste management , and land uses .

These authors proposed a TBL sustainability indicator for 158 European cities that includes three dimensions related to the types of capital considered in the measurement of intellectual capital .
