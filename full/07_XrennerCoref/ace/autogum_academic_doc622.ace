All of the states can be ranked from most to least preferred according to their total scores , in which a state with a higher score is more preferred to a state with a lower score by DM i , and states with the same score are equally preferred .

In a given conflict , DM i ’ s preference over states can be intuitively expressed by a set of option statements ordered by priority , where k is the total number of statements , and the former statement is more important than the latter one .

Moreover , the remaining states can be ranked from most to least preferred according to their similarities and closeness to the best and worst states , which is similar to the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution ( TOPSIS ) .

When analyzing the preference of DMs in a dispute , we only need to acquire a set of option statements for each DM which are ranked from most to least important in a hierarchical order .

In many real-world conflicts , however , the most and least preferred states which can be easily and directly obtained may be not consistent with the results by using the option prioritization technique .

The option prioritization is from the option level instead of the state level , which can significantly improve the computational efficiency of preference ranking , especially for large-scale conflicts .
