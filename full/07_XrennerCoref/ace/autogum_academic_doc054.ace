The fact that an antigen generates a cellular response classified as type IV or late hypersensitivity implies that this antigen may be able to generate immune memory and trigger a response characterized by important cytokines , such as IFN-γ and TNF-α .

When we analyzed the epitope conservancy of these peptides among the proteome of other Leishmania species , it was observed that peptide PEP17 demonstrated to be the most conserved epitope among various viscerotropic and dermatotropic Leishmania species .

For this , we focused on the main biomarkers of protection , namely : lymphocyte proliferation after stimulation with L. infantum and IFN-γ production by subpopulations of T-lymphocytes ( CD4+ and CD8+ ) .
