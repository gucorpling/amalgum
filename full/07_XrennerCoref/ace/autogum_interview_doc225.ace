My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow . eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world . eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software .

You either 1 ) sacrifice on breadth and do n't produce the topics that wo n't interest advertisers , or 2 ) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that does n't cost much to write .

" If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction , they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere .

My hope is that over time , internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others .

I was n't interested in making either of these sacrifices , as I think the world 's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive .

When I discovered Wikipedia , I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs .

This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow , the company , will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community .

This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets .

I think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person .

In my opinion , people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the " right to leave .

However , paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices .

I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far .

I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world .

So ultimately I decided that eHow 's model would not build the resource I envisioned .

Imagine having detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do any activity you could imagine .

So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow .
