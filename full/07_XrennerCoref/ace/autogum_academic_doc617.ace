The main finding of our study is that the risk of AKI rose proportionally according to the amount of pRBC and FFP transfusions in both ABO-c and ABO-i LT , but this association of pRBC and FFP transfusions with post-transplant AKI was stronger in ABO-i LT than in ABO-c LT .

Given that the AKI rates increased in patients with preoperative anemia and that the influence of transfusion on AKI was more pronounced in ABO-i LT patients , any efforts to reduce perioperative transfusions may protect patients with ABO-i LT against AKI .

Patient mortality and graft survival after ABO-i LT have been reported to be comparable to ABO-c LT , although there is still concern regarding the high incidence of antibody-mediated rejection , including biliary stricture related to a high isoagglutinin titer .

In addition , the prevalent baseline metabolic alkalosis , low platelet count , and high incidence of mild arterial hypoxemia prior to transplantation surgery may contribute to the high incidence of intraoperative transfusion and low oxygen delivery to the kidney .

FFP has been reported to be a risk factor for AKI after surgery , including liver transplantation , and the risk of AKI may increase when patients with ABO-i LT receive intraoperative FFP transfusions .

Ischemic time was not identified as an independent predictor of AKI in our analysis , which could have been due to the relatively short ischemic time of LDLT .
