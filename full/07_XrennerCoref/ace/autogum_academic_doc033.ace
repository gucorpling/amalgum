Therefore , the aims of this research were : 1 ) to analyze the changes in the flora community after the introduction of perennial energy crops from different botanical groups onto arable land , and 2 ) to compare the structure of weed flora communities accompanying perennial energy crops with those in typical agricultural crops grown on arable land under different farming systems ( organic , integrated , conventional , monoculture ) .

In addition , there is growing interest in the cultivation of perennial grasses , mainly miscanthus ( Miscanthus sp . ) , but also other species : prairie cordgrass ( Spartina pectinata Bosc ex Link ) , reed canary grass ( Phalaris arundinacea L. ) , big bluestem ( Andropogon gerardii Vitman ) , and switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum L. ) .

Areas to be considered regarding the risks and opportunities of energy crop cultivation in relation to biodiversity include : variations in soil management , requirements for fertilization and plant protection , invasiveness , crop diversity , water footprint , climate change mitigation potential , and distortion of species interactions .

The intensity of plantation management also has a high impact on biodiversity , which in turn has an effect on plant yields , the diversification of farm crops , rural economies , the role as vegetation filters , water and soil quality , and CO2 emissions .

Some of the most promising biomass crops , e. g. , miscanthus , switchgrass , Reynoutria sp . , are not native to Europe and North America and so pose a risk of potential future invasions , so their spread will need to be monitored .

However , some authors suggest that the physical structure of the canopy , rapid growth rate , high density , chemical crop protection , and mineral fertilization caused energy crops to be not conducive to weed flora diversity .

Another group of plants that can be used for energy purposes is the perennial dicotyledons , such as Virginia mallow ( Sida hermaphrodita ( L. ) Rusby ) and Jerusalem artichoke ( Helianthus tuberosus L. ) .

The introduction of new perennial plants into agricultural areas for energy purposes creates habitats for various species of flora , including those threatened with extinction , and can be an alternative way of increasing biodiversity .
