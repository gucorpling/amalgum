A few hours later , the topic of Tinder comes up and me an W start talking about how hard it is for guys on there and how he got lucky snagging somebody as awesome and cool as B. Both B and W seem to be getting along well , they are flirting with each other and cuddling on the couch together .

All three of us decide it would be hilarious to troll some of these guys so B gives me her phone and we ( mostly me ) start coming up with stupid things to send these guys and just sitting on the couch laughing out butts off about it .
