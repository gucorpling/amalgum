I know that Nick Denton of Gawker Media has a kind of ' shoot first ask questions later ' stance — they say they value transparency and are fine to admit their mistakes and publish corrections immediately .

It seems to me that Wikinews is in a very good position to make real progress on participatory news/citizen journalism , etc. , because the WMF projects are extremely good at fostering collaboration .

There are lots of reasons for that , and there 's an interesting argument to be made that it 's the most respectful stance vis-a-vis the readers .

I think in general that 's the direction the media are moving in ; that we would publish and correct , rather than hold off publishing .
