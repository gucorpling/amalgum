In distribution networks with no or low penetration of RES , in which power flows from the high voltage ( HV ) / medium voltage ( MV ) substation to the MV/low voltage ( LV ) substations , the reinforcement and expansion plan of a distribution network was determined based on a given forecast of the maximum load demand of each year of the planning period without taking into account the variability of the output power of RES .

However , in distribution networks with high penetration of RES , the aforementioned approach is not adequate , since reverse power flows occur quite often during every year of the planning period , especially in periods of low demand and high RES generation , creating new technical challenges that need to be solved at the planning stage , such as line congestion and voltage rise issues .

Data clustering is a process that allocates a set of individual data into smaller groups ( clusters ) such that ( a ) the individual data with similar features are grouped into the same cluster and ( b ) the dissimilarity of each created cluster compared to the rest is high enough making each cluster distinct .

Thus , a planning method for ADNs with high penetration of DERs , especially RES , has to take into account a proper dataset of load demand and RES generation during each stage of the planning period in order to determine the optimal reinforcement and expansion plan .
