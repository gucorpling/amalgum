They were all three very well dressed ; two of them elderly gentlemen , the third a young man about my own age , or perhaps a year or two older : they called for coffee ; and , after two or three observations , the two eldest commenced a conversation in French , which , however , though they spoke it fluently enough , I perceived at once was not their native language ; the young man , however , took no part in their conversation , and when they addressed a portion to him , which indeed was but rarely , merely replied by a monosyllable .

Then , if he could not have written the article on which I now hold my forefinger -- and I do not believe he could -- why should I feel discouraged at the consciousness that I , too , could not write it ? I certainly could no more have written the article than he could ; but then , like him , though I would not compare myself to the man who wrote the book I saw upon the bridge , I think I could -- and here I emptied the glass of claret -- write something better .

In about ten minutes , finding nothing more worth reading in the newspaper , I laid it down , and though the claret was not yet exhausted , I was thinking of betaking myself to my lodgings , and was about to call the waiter , when I heard a step in the passage , and in another moment the tall young man entered the room , advanced to the same box , and , sitting down nearly opposite to me , again pronounced to himself , but more audibly than before , the same word .

It was a discovery , but I confess rather an unpleasant one ; for I said to myself , If literary talent is so very common in London , that the journals , things which , as their very name denotes , are ephemeral , are written in a style like the article I have been perusing , how can I hope to distinguish myself in this big town , when , for the life of me , I do n't think I could write anything half so clever as what I have been reading ?

Thereupon I resumed the newspaper ; and , as I was before struck with the fluency of style and the general talent which it displayed , I was now equally so with its commonplaceness and want of originality on every subject ; and it was evident to me that , whatever advantage these newspaper-writers might have over me in some points , they had never studied the Welsh bards , translated Kaempe Viser , or been under the pupilage of Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno .

Now , if that be the case , how must I have been surprised , who was reading a newspaper for the first time , and that one of the best of the London journals ! Yes , strange as it may seem , it was nevertheless true that , up to the moment of which I am speaking , I had never read a newspaper of any description .

I have never been a listener , and I paid but little heed to their discourse , nor indeed to themselves ; as I occasionally looked up , however , I could perceive that the features of the young man , who chanced to be seated exactly opposite to me , wore an air of constraint and vexation .

The others , having reached the door , turned round , and , finding that the youth did not follow them , one of them called to him with a tone of some authority ; whereupon the young man rose , and , pronouncing half audibly the word ' botheration , ' rose and followed them .

This circumstance caused me to observe him more particularly than I otherwise should have done : his features were handsome and prepossessing ; he had dark brown hair and a high-arched forehead .
