While I agree with you that trickle down economics , a.k.a. reaganomics , a.k.a. supply side economics , a.k.a. voodoonomics , a.k.a. wishful thinking , a.k.a. magic , is complete and utter nonsense , I would like to challenge your view on the following :

Now when the dogs ( or the peasants ) go hungry , voodoonomics says that instead of giving the dogs more food , we should hold more and more lavish banquets so that the bones that are thrown on the floor contain more meat .

While he 's eating the meat from the bones , he throws the bones he 's done with on the floor and the dogs will run to scramble for the remaining meat on the bones .

That way jobs are created for people that build and sell the yachts , people that perform maintenance on or clean the yachts , construction workers that build the ports and the docks .

Or in a more modern day example : if we want to fight poverty , instead of giving money to the poor , we should give more money to the rich .

The crux of the argument seems to be that if we make the rich richer , they will find the kindness that they currently lack , and raise working wages .

It does not assume any benevolence on the part of the rich , but it assumes that the poor are fed by the wastefulness of the rich .

So you are basically saying " the rich will stop being so greedy if we give them more money . " This is absurd .

There is no example of this actually working that I am aware of , and the entire idea behind it is patently ridiculous .

That way they can buy more over-the-top , luxurious yachts that they 'll visit only a few days every year .

By providing an inefficient working wage , they have already demonstrated their selfishness greed .

Of course the other possibility is that the lord becomes more greedy and gluttonous .
