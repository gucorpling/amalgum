Three subjective evaluation factors ( i. e. , interests established by the research hypothesis , ecosystem establishment , and technology completeness ) for merchant and two-sided models , which are separated from service and platform businesses , were applied to success and failure analyses via logistic regression of four objective evaluation factors ( i. e. , scale of companies examined separately , PC interworking , consumer billing , and introduction of new technologies ) .

The final 22 IT service cases , as Table 1 shows , were selected by removing services that were too old to be independently verified and whereby system units were difficult to evaluate individually for success and failure factors ( see Appendix A and Appendix D for detailed information of the 22 IT service cases ) .

Therefore , when determining the success or failure of IT services through participants using a questionnaire , the constructs were measured considering the mean and using t-tests to determine any significant difference between the groups investigated within this study .

Furthermore , although some of the services within the sample were well known in the market via advertising and media coverage , in some cases , the services were unfamiliar due to the fact they had originated from start-ups .

Individual surveys conducted simultaneously led to a seven-point evaluation of a total of three categories : establishing interests selected as factors for success and failure of mobile IT services for this study ; establishing ecosystems ; and completing technologies .

When introducing each service , the results of separate judgments about success and failure were not considered , so that the actual operational results would not be reflected in the survey results of the participants .

The survey participants â€™ successes and failures were subsequently judged , and , with the survey items , the participants were asked to list factors of success and failure for the services they chose .

Instead , the services were chosen on the basis of the fact they were established through an application , with some in the process of expanding their service functionality through PC-based platforms .

By displaying these descriptions of the IT services , we were able to increase the understanding by introducing a detailed overview of the business models and operating methods for each service selected .

The number and variety of recent IT services provide many cases where success and failure can be clearly determined , whereas it is difficult to make individual assessments uniformly .

For this study , a total of 98 cases of ICT convergence were obtained from 65 ICT experts from 17 February to 18 February , 2018 .

A survey was submitted to entrepreneurs who had experience in similar fields of this study and who showed an interest in creating their own IT start-up .

Additionally , in attempting to choose appropriate cases for analysis , the final selection of services was not performed on a purely market recognition basis .

To assist participants who were lacking awareness of IT services , the survey introduced each service and their assessments of success and failure .
