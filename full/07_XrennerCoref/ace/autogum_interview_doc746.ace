No further improvements to our lifestyles can be had be increasing the number of people driving nor by increasing the number of houses being built ( for we are paving over our very best farmland where we will need to grow more of our food in the not-so-distant future and/or destroying essential habitat that is necessary to maintain the proper functioning of our ecosystems ) , nor by increasing the density of houses ( for this only increases the concentration of the pollutants and increases the burdens on our infrastructure , including roads , transit , water , sewer , electricity and other essential services ) .

I believe that we need to rapidly wean ourselves from the one thing which makes our lives so convenient , pollutes our environment with toxic chemicals , sours our air , allows us to pave over our best farmland and expand outward incessantly in a manic urge to “ grow our economy ” for no other reason than to expand for the sake of expansion : oil .

We need to undertake a crash-course in ( energy ) “ conservation ” while at the same time looking at restoring the proper functioning of both our human and natural ‘ ecosystems ’ in order to come back into “ balance ” with the natural world ’s ( including the human mind ’s ) ability to accommodate our ( massive ) presence .

We are living further and further from where we work , shop and play , yet we insist on driving everywhere to do everything , not really because there are no options , but because this is generally the most convenient way to do it given the circumstances under which we insist on living .

The voters believe that transportation ( increased transit/easing gridlock ) , school funding ( faith-based , status-quo or merging the two systems ) and urban intensification ( development ) are the three most important issues , along with Health Care ( access to Doctors ) being of general concern .

Many of our health problems are a consequence of our sedentary and convenience-based ( service-based/fast-food ) lifestyles as well as the stresses we are putting on our bodies [ in various ways , including through chemical loading and self-induced ( mental ) stresses , among others ] .

The discovery of the power of oil has been on of the greatest assets to mankind this millennium , but we are at a juncture in human history where oil is now becoming our nemesis , and is no longer making our lives better .
