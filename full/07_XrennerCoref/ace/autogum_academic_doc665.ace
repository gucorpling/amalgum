Grounded on a review of the literature in relation to the creation of accessible multimedia contents for hearing-impaired people , accumulated evidence on how to design and deliver SHR information and experiences in running bespoke social networks targeted at certain social groups , we carried out an ethnographic study in 2016 to involve deaf women in the identification of guidelines for the creation of new materials to offer in our social network .

It is important to note that we could not have any native ESL signers do the signing on the videos , owing to the very problem that we were targeting : even the literate deaf women we contacted ( including the two key representatives mentioned above ) did not understand many of the SRH concepts appearing in the scripts , so they were unable to render them properly .

This task helps to substantiate the scripts , with a twofold objective : on the one hand , it allows supervising the sequencing of the different topics , aiming to ensure that the users will not experience any continuity gaps ; on the other hand , it facilitates the identification of a coherent set of visual styles and clues .

The following subsections present the most relevant aspects of ( i ) the guidelines we designed to conduct the content creation processes , plus our first experience with them , ( ii ) the content management system and its key elements of information , and ( iii ) the mobile and web user interfaces .

At this point , we found it was necessary to add new signs to the Ecuadorian Sign Language Dictionary ( see Appendix A ) to make sure that the deaf women would freely and voluntarily join the study and provide information about their experiences , knowledge and expectations .

We enjoyed the collaboration of two deaf women who served as key informants and representatives of the National Federation of Deaf People in Ecuador and the Association of Deaf People from the Azuay province , plus three qualified interpreters of Ecuadorian Sign Language ( ESL ) .

Working on the Drupal content management system ( https://www.drupal.org ) , these tutorials empowered the collaborating doctors , content producers and ESL interpreters to create rich materials efficiently , out of a sizeable set of content types and templates .

With their aid , we designed , implemented and translated semi-structured interviews that we applied later on with other deaf women , both literate and illiterate ( the same who participated in the quantitative studies of Section 4 ) .

The guide was supplemented with tutorials on the use of H5P ( https://h5p.org/ ) , a plugin for publishing systems that makes it easy to create , share and reuse highly interactive web content .

Firstly , a pre-production stage must be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of experts from areas of medicine , graphic design , education , social communication , computer science and sign language interpretation .

Among other tasks , the team determines the terminology and the interpretation techniques that will be used in the new contents , and designs conceptual and graphic scripts for the subsequent stages .

On the left hand side , in turn , we represent the doctors , content producers , educators and sign language interpreters who work together in content design and preparation .

The design and animation process is carried out , and accessible subtitling is added to help deaf women who have post-linguistic hearing loss and are able to read text .

The resulting materials must be evaluated by a group of deaf women , in order to check whether everything is understable for all age ranges .

The certified ESL interpreters , in contrast , were fully familiar with the concepts , which they used regularly , both orally and written .

Prior to the interviews , we requested informed consent from each participant , explaining the terms and conditions with the help of ESL interpreters .

From the analysis of the interviews , we created a guide for content producers and ESL interpreters that covers the following stages :

Finally , the post-production stage is needed to deal with the editing and optimization of graphics and animations .
