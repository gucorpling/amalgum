So obviously , we have n't achieved that yet ! I see the evolution towards a voluntary society as a mission for all of humanity in which no single one of us can accomplish anything alone , so I ca n't take credit for any of my successes , but I am very satisfied in what I have been able to accomplish as a media producer , author , and civil disobedience activist as a contribution to that mission .

As for failures , I could point to many , but I do n't think you 're asking for a deep personal psychoanalysis here !

Right now , I think about how I learned to distrust authority from my parents , courage from people like Ross Ulbricht , Ed Snowden , Chelsea Manning , and Julian Assange , patience from people like Ron Paul , intellectual persistence from people like Murray Rothbard , and compassion from people like my girlfriend .

This might sound semantic , but it 's a meaningful difference to me to have teachers instead of role models so we can get useful lessons and inspiration from many people and still be ourselves .

I identified as a " Libertarian " at the time , but I can look back now and see that I was really an arrogant militant minarchist with poorly thought out libertarian principles .
