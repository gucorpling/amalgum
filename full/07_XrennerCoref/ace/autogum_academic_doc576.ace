In order to explore different scenarios for the composition of the SPLD , the dielectric permittivity of pure water ice and dirty ice ( with different silicate dust volume fractions ) is reported below in terms of real part of permittivity ε ’ and attenuation factor α , estimated using the following formula :

The dielectric properties of pure water ice have been intensively measured in laboratory over a wide range of temperatures and frequencies ; however , the lack of a standard procedure in sample preparation and measuring methodology raises some questions about the reliability of the experimental data .

The real and imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity for dirty ice have been retrieved for four different values of silicate volume fraction ( 5,10 , 15 and 20 % ) considering the medium as a two-phase mixture ( ice/silicate ) .

The Maxwell Garnett mixing rule has been applied to determine the effective dielectric properties of the mixtures : the host medium is considered as pure water ice and the inclusions are Martian meteorite dust .

It is worth noting that the presence of the dust in the water ice also introduces a small variation in the real part of the dielectric permittivity ( ranging from 3.1 to 3.9 ) .

Since literature data are heterogeneous in terms of temperature intervals and frequency ranges , the complex permittivity of pure water ice is here assumed according to the data provided by Kawada .
