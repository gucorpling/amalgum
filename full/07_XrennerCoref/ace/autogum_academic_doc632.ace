Spain ’s climate varies across its geography , resulting in three broad regions : the North , where Atlantic weather characterized by a large proportion of humid days and the prevalence of precipitation ; the Center , distinguished by a continental plateau with less precipitation ; and the South , which is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with almost no precipitation , higher temperatures , and longer , sunny days .

In contrast with Toyoda et al. , who described a decline in the cases of nosocomial endocarditis , our findings highlight the paramount importance of NIE , the incidence of which steeply rose despite all the coordinated efforts to reduce hospital-acquired infections through mandatory continuous reporting , regulated interventions , or evidence-based consensus recommendations .

Concerning predisposing factors , a higher Charlson index ( reflecting more comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus , hemodialysis , coronary artery disease , peripheral artery disease , cancer , as well as major complications ranging from sepsis , shock , heart failure , and cerebrovascular disease ) were present in patients with NIE .

These microorganisms often have a healthcare-associated origin , widely recognized as virulent and resistant organisms , and are related to high rates of complications and high mortality rates . Selton-Suty et al. demonstrated Staphylococcus aureus as the only factor associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in healthcare-associated IE .

The growing incidence of NIE could be related to the increase in the prevalence of healthcare-associated interventional procedures in recent years ( e. g. , hemodialysis , catheterization , intravenous line placement , cardiac implantable electronic devices , prostheses ) .

The American Heart Association in 2007 revised and changed the consensus for antibiotic prophylaxis , recommending the withdrawal of routine antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures in low-risk and moderate-risk patients and most other invasive procedures in all patients .

This rise in underlying diseases might be related to the aging of the population and explains why those adults with NIE , especially those older than age 80 years , depicted the lowest survival rates .

We noted a constant increase in the incidence of IE in Spain , principally because of a dramatic rise in the proportion of NIE concurrent with a decline in the percentage of CIE .

The higher IE incidence in the North region may be due to the higher level of humidity experienced there compared to the Center or South regions of Spain .
