A subordinate with strong turnover intentions has effectively quit before officially leaving the organization and is emotionally disconnected from other employees and the organization , but such individuals should be less likely to be concerned about what their employer owes them or what they owe their employer in a relational sense .

Abusive supervision refers to a destructive leadership style where employees perceive treatment from their supervisor as hostile verbal and/or non-verbal expressions , such as ridiculing , yelling at , and intimidating subordinates ; taking credit for subordinates ’ achievements ; and attributing undesirable outcomes to subordinates ’ personal factors .

The relational component involves the more flexible aspects of the exchange relationship that presume a long-term relationship with the organization , such as training and development opportunities , promotion opportunities , and support from supervisors .

Not only will such subordinates be less likely to help others , we argue that they will be more prone to behaving in ways that are counter to organizational policies , practices , and norms .

It violates the exchange principle and ethics of “ equality and reciprocity ” between the two parties in the relationship , damages the positive image of the supervisors in the eyes of subordinates .

According to psychological contract theory , employees hold a specific set of beliefs regarding their relationship with the organization , which includes the reciprocal obligations of each party .

As noted by Robinson , “ psychological contracts refer to employees ’ perceptions of what they owe to their employers and what their employers owe to them ” .

That is , abusive supervision creates a low-quality relationship between supervisors and subordinates , which decreases the subordinates ’ attachment and loyalty to the supervisor and organization .

We accordingly propose that turnover intentions impact subsequent unethical behavior and ultimately serve as a critical mediating mechanism explaining the relationship between abusive supervision and unethical behavior .

1,2 person|5,7 abstract|8,11 abstract|15,19 abstract|20,28 abstract|23,28 abstract|26,28 abstract

Similarly , a number of empirical studies have confirmed the positive relationship between abusive supervision and the turnover intentions of subordinates Therefore , we hypothesize H1 :

Further , it has been proposed that reciprocity is central to explaining the relationships between the evaluation of the psychological contract and employee attitudes and behaviors .
1,2 person
8,9 abstract|13,22 abstract|16,22 abstract|19,22 abstract|23,24 person|23,25 abstract|23,27 abstract

Based on previous studies , we argue that psychological contract theory provides a new perspective in explaining subordinates who display unethical behavior in abusive organizational situations .

3,5 abstract|6,7 person|9,11 abstract|9,12 abstract|13,16 abstract|18,19 person|21,23 abstract|21,27 abstract|24,27 abstract

In this case , subordinates who do not feel that their supervisors care about them are unlikely to feel obliged to remain within the organization .
1,2 person
2,4 abstract|5,6 person|11,12 person|11,13 person|15,16 person

It stands to reason that , if an individual feels that this relationship has been breached , then they will develop strong intentions to quit .
1,2 person
1,2 abstract|8,10 person|12,14 abstract|19,20 person|22,24 abstract

For example , when supervisors show abusive supervision behaviors to subordinates , subordinates will regard it as disrespect , contempt and humiliation to themselves .

As abusive supervisors struggle to meet subordinates ’ expectations , the relational contract between subordinates and supervisors or organization will be difficult to maintain .

These mediated relationships are in line with research on psychological contract theory which has support the relationship between leadership and subordinates ’ behavior .

Psychological contract theory argued that organizational characteristics ( e. g. , organizational climate ) affect how individuals cope with decreased psychological contract .
1,2 person
1,3 abstract|1,4 abstract|6,8 abstract|6,14 abstract|12,14 abstract|17,18 person|20,23 abstract

Moreover , subordinates are concerned about whether supervisors can provide them with sufficient learning and development opportunities and a just climate .

Together , these hypotheses suggest that turnover intentions mediate the relationships between abusive supervision and subordinates ’ unethical behavior .

There is reason to believe that the mechanism proposed in the above hypotheses may vary in its strength .

The transactional component involves the more static aspects of the exchange relationship , such as pay and benefits .

We also hypothesize that there is a positive relationship between turnover intentions and subordinates ’ unethical behavior .
