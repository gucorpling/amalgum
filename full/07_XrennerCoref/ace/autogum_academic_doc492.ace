Ischemia presenting in diabetic patients due to a reduction in blood flow that occurs in both small vessels ( microvascular , such as capillaries ) and large vessels ( macrovascular , such as arteries and veins ) , or due to a decrease of angiogenesis , can be treated through revascularization of at least one of the foot arteries to try to restore blood flow in patients with a DFU whose toe pressure is <30 mmHg or transcutaneous oxygen pressure ( TcPO2 ) <25 mmHg , as well as in those who have a DFU that does not heal with pressure on the ankle of <50 mmHg or ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) <0.5 .

The use of multi-disciplinary teams ( MDTs ) that include all relevant specialties ( i. e. , nursing , orthopedics , plastic surgery , vascular surgery , nutrition , and endocrinology departments ) has shown an effect of decreasing the risks associated with DFUs and amputation by 50 – 85 % , lowering costs , and leading to a better quality of life for patients with DFUs .

A meta-analysis of four RCTs ( n = 653 ) showed that , compared with placebo , intravenous ALA ( 600 mg per day ) decreased symptoms of neuropathy when administered for three weeks , but symptom improvement with oral ALA ( >600 mg per day for 3 – 5 weeks ) was not clinically significant .
