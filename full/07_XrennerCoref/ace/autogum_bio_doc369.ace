It was probably due to the influence of William Elphinstone the Bishop of Aberdeen , who was engaged in preparing an adaptation of the Sarum breviary for the use of his diocese , that James IV on 15 September 1507 granted a patent to Walter Chepman and Androw Myllar " to furnis and bring hame ane prent , with all stuff belangand tharto , and expert men to use the samyne , for imprenting within our Realme of the bukis of our Lawis , actis of parliament , croniclis , mess bukis , and portuus efter the use of our Realme , with addicions and legendis of Scottis sanctis , now gaderit to be ekit tharto , and al utheris bukis that salbe sene necessar , and to sel the sammyn for competent pricis .

Chepman having found the necessary capital , and Myllar having obtained the type from France , probably from Rouen , they set up their press in a house at the foot of Blackfriars Wynd , in the Southgait , now the Cowgate , of Edinburgh , and on 4 April 1508 issued the first book known to have been printed in Scotland , The Maying or Disport of Chaucer , better known as The Complaint of the Black Knight , and written not by Chaucer but by Lydgate .

About two years later , in 1510 , the Aberdeen Breviary , the main cause of the introduction of printing into Scotland , was executed by the command and at the expense of Walter Chepman ; but doubt exists as to the actual printer of this , the last but most important work of the primitive Scottish press .

Two other pieces , The Tretis of the Twa Mariit Wemen and the Wedo , also by Dunbar , and A Gest of Robyn Hode , are contained in the same volume , but they are printed with different types , and there is no evidence to prove that they emanated from the first Scottish press .
