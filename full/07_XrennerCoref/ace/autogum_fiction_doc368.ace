He was glad , eager , yet suppressing himself , and the glances he sent back and forth from Duane to Longstreth were questioning , doubtful . Certainly Longstreth did not look the part of an outlaw .

Duane had left Fairdale with his party by night , passed through Sanderson in the early hours of dawn , and reached Bradford as he had planned .

The latter half of that ride Duane had observed a wagon-road running parallel with the railroad , sometimes right alongside , at others near or far away .

Duane had borne hours and weeks and months of waiting , had endured the long hours of the outlaw , but now he had no patience .

The station was a good deal larger than that at Bradford , and there was considerable action and bustle incident to the arrival of the train .

Then at closer look into Duane 's face his warmth fled -- something he saw there checked his enthusiasm , or at least its utterance .

When they were all inside Duane closed the door , and , drawing a deep breath as if of relief , he faced them calmly .

“ When I went after Longstreth , ” concluded Duane , “ it was either to kill him or offer him freedom on conditions .

Longstreth had turned over the whole of his property to Morton , who was to divide it as he and his comrades believed just .

This fellow 's look , too , was that of one who knew Duane , but was waiting for a sign , a cue .

They crossed the street , went through office and lobby , and then Duane asked MacNelly to take them to a private room .

A few moments later Duane followed MacNelly to a large room , like a hall , and here were men reading and smoking .

Then Duane briefly related Longstreth 's story , and , though he did not spare the rustler chief , he was generous .
1,2 person
2,3 person|5,7 person|5,8 abstract|12,13 person|16,19 person|17,19 person|20,21 person

He thought he recognized the clean-cut Blossom Kane , the black-bearded giant Boldt , the red-faced Panhandle Smith , and Fletcher .

Duane , disliking to face Longstreth and the passengers in the car , changed his seat to one behind his prisoner .

When the train was about twenty miles from Val Verde Duane espied a dark group of horsemen trotting eastward .

“ Miss Longstreth , you and Miss Ruth try to make yourselves comfortable now , ” he said .

Would Captain MacNelly be there with his rangers , as Duane had planned for them to be ?

When MacNelly saw that Duane intended to greet him , to meet him , he hurried forward .

Longstreth was with him . And Miss Longstreth and Ruth Herbert would not be left behind .

The gang ! He thought he recognized the tawny Poggin and felt a strange inward contraction .

“ MacNelly , shake hand with Cheseldine , ” said Duane , low-voiced .

MacNelly walked like a man in a trance .
