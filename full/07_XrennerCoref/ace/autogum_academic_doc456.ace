The compounding of an extemporaneous formula is not allowed if an authorized commercial pharmaceutical product ( adequate for a particular age group ) exists , but the reality in the clinical setting is that for some age groups , that is not the case , while extemporaneous formulation is still used as the only alternative to the therapeutic need .

Although solid products have higher stability than liquid formulations , this practice can solve the problem of swallowing capability and dose adjustments , but these manufactured preparations can be a risk to safety , efficacy and quality , because there is little or no information for compatibility between the original medicine and additional excipients or their effect in children .

The objective of this paper was using the Essential Medicines List for children by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to create a provisional pediatric biopharmaceutics classification system ( pBCS ) for oral drugs and to compare our results with the BCS for adults ( aBCS ) .

The excipients used in formulations designed for children should be appropriate for each age group because , as is known , these are not inert substances and cannot be supposed to have the same effects in pediatrics as in adults .

The gastric pH of the newborn is approximately neutral , and within the first 48 h of life , the gastrointestinal pH decreases to adult values and then for the first month increases back to values close to neutrality .

This fact lies in the therapeutic gap that originates from formulation development ( mainly focused on adults ) , low availability of commercial pediatric drugs for pediatric use and physiological and anatomical differences relative to the adult population .

On the other hand , another determinant of bioavailability is ontogenic changes in the expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters , which would mark the first pass effect and consequently would change the oral absorbed fraction .

Age-related changes in the characteristics of luminal fluids such as pH may lead to changes in drug solubility and , therefore , in absorption since only the dissolved drug would be available for absorption .

Developmental physiological differences ( as the composition of gastrointestinal fluids and the presence or activity of intestinal drug metabolizing enzymes and efflux transporters ) can markedly alter the bioavailability of drugs .
