It was plain to see that the statement that fireworks were about to be set off on a theatre stage , by an amateur , had rather startled some of the audience , and Loring hastened to explain that these were not real fireworks , but that they were contrivances made of colored glass , which were illuminated by the powerful lens of a lantern which was placed out of sight , and while the apparent pyrotechnic display would resemble fireworks of strange and grotesque designs , it would be absolutely without danger .

As the light was turned successively upon one and another of the clusters of glass , sometimes it would flash along the whole line so rapidly that all the various combinations of color and motion seemed to be combined in one , and then for a time each particular set of fireworks would blaze , sparkle , and coruscate by itself , scattering particles of colored light as if they had been real sparks of fire .

He brought out some little bunches of bits of colored glass , hung them at some distance apart on a wire which was stretched across the stage just high enough for him to reach it , and then lighted his lantern , which he placed in one of the wings , lowered all the lights in the theatre , and began his exhibition .

As Loring was a club-man , and belonged to a family of good social standing , his circle of acquaintances was large , and in this circle a good many unpleasant remarks had been made regarding the proposed entertainment -- made , of course , by the people who had not been invited to be present .

Little wheels of colored fire rapidly revolved , miniature rockets appeared to rise a few feet and to explode in the air , and while all the ordinary forms of fireworks were produced on a diminutive scale , there were some effects that were entirely novel to the audience .

Some of the gossip on the subject had reached Loring , who did not hesitate to say that he could not talk to a crowd , and that he did not care to show the curious things he had collected to people who would not thoroughly appreciate them .
