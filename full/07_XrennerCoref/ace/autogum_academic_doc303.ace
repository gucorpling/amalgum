Gao , et al. also showed that an evergreen needle leaf forest has a more constant geometric effect than that of deciduous and mixed forests , and the relationship at blue and red wavelengths is weak , which is consistent with the results of previous studies by Kimes , et al. , which show that the relationship at the near infrared wavelength is better .

Based on the result , the physics of the relationships between the multiangular signal and forest canopy structure parameters were studied and assessed using airborne LiDAR data , and multiangular remote sensing data were used to map the forest parameters at larger regions with more complete geographic coverage .

The BRDF vegetation structure retrieval works better in conifer forests , which indicates that forest biomass retrieval based on the NDMM index can be used to understand how to take advantage of the implied information between multiangular data and forest canopies .

As the Pearson correlation coefficient between the NDMM index and tree height , the gap fraction shows that the NDMM index for conifer forests is better than those of deciduous and mixed forests .
