Considering the feature of low turbidity and oligotrophic secondary effluent , biofiltration processes such as ceramsite grains , granular activated carbon and quartz sand were widely employed in the advanced treatment . Due to limited organic carbon source in secondary effluent , denitrification of secondary effluent is usually achieved by extra organic carbon addition ( e. g. , acetic acid , sodium acetate , glucose , ethanol , etc. ) .

However , comprehensive solid-phase denitrification processes are lacking and the results vary with the type , structure and molecular weight of BDPs . Rodrigues et al. found that the same type of BDPs showed different performance on volumetric nitrate removal rate when comparing with the previous literature since the BDPs employed in the different works have different physical-chemical properties .

Thus , a direct results comparison between solid-phase denitrification and conventional denitrification processes for the different denitrification performances between the two processes during the start-up period and under adverse running conditions ( i. e. , low carbon to nitrogen ( C/N ) ratio , short hydraulic retention time ( HRT ) and continuous shock nitrate loadings ) is essential .

However , the disadvantages of this treatment process are the necessity of a closed , sophisticated , and costly control process , the risk of overdosing , and the need for in-depth knowledge about the operation of this biological system .

Solid-phase denitrification can effectively avoid process risk resulted from carbon addition ( i. e. , excess or insufficient ) since denitrification of solid organic matter is only realized via enzymatic attack .
