However , this was a laboratory-based study that focused on the effect of temperature and did not inform about the degree of plasticity in nature ; it remains necessary to determine whether the patterns observed explain the variance observed in nature , or if other ecological parameters besides thermal adaptation drive the observed patterns .

A well-established natural system for evolutionary-ecological research is the European fire salamander ( Salamandra salamandra ) ; larvae of this species are capable of living in a variety of environments ( streams , ponds , and underground springs ) by changing their behavior and growth rate to the environmental conditions .

The Kottenforst represents a continuous old broad-leaf forest with streams and rain-filled bomb craters , in which adult salamanders can move freely and females deposit their larvae into small water bodies ( streams or ponds ) , in which the latter develop until metamorphosis is completed .

In this situation , natural selection should also favour prezygotic isolation mechanisms to prevent mating between the populations , in doing so , this process can result in adaptive speciation ( sensu Dieckman et al. ) , which has been demonstrated for various groups of organisms .

In Central Europe , S. salamandra larvae typically develop in small primary streams until metamorphosis , but females of some populations are known to deposit their larva in ephemeral water bodies , such as small ponds or ditches , and sometimes even in underground springs .

Reciprocal transfer experiments — also known as transplant experiments — are experiments in which individuals are translocated from their native or original habitat to a new or ecologically different habitat , which allows the testing of heritability and fixation of traits in the natural environment .

However , modern research demonstrates that — by reinforcing the survival of organisms under varying environmental conditions — phenotypic plasticity exposes other traits to natural selection that are related but not directly involved in a given plastic response ( plastic acclimatization ) .

Both habitat types are ecologically different in many biotic and abiotic aspects , including water dynamics , temperature regime , food availability , and intraspecific competition ; for instance , ponds tend to have lower oxygen content and higher temperatures than streams .

In changing environments , phenotypic plasticity allows organisms to conserve their genotypes and still produce alternative phenotypes , in contrast to local adaptations that incorporate changes at the genetic level producing long-lasting phenotypes and resulting in higher fitness in home habitats .

The aquatic larvae of amphibians are of particular interest because many of the easily measurable morphological traits ( such as size , weight , and gill length ) are plastic and related to metamorphosis and fitness .

The adaptation to different larval habitat conditions has promoted the adaptive divergence of the ancestral local population into two genetically differentiated subpopulations , thus potentially representing a case of early stage ecological speciation .

A previous study integrating results from gene expression in Kottenforst larvae under common environmental conditions revealed that the differential gene expression observed is mainly driven by transcriptional plasticity rather than local adaptation .
