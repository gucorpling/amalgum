Dietterlin was born at Pfullendorf in Württemberg ; his original name was Grapp and he may have been a member of a family of artists in Swabia , [ 2 ] spent most of his life in Strasbourg ( then Strassburg ) , where he married Catharina Sprewer on 12 November 1570 , and where he is known to have painted frescos for the Bruderhof , the Bishop 's residence , in 1575 , but he is later recorded in Hagenau in 1583 and in Oberkirch in 1589 .

According to the architectural historian Torbjörn Fulton , Dietterlin treats the orders " more as a basis or excuse for the development of a bizarre ornamental fantasy than as didactic examples of classical architectural ornamentation " . [ 7 ]
