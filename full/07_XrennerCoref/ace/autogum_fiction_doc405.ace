Nalasu would give Jerry a series of instructions , such as , going on a scout by himself , to go to the nest , then circle about it widely , to continue to the other clearing where were the fruit trees , to cross the jungle to the main path , to proceed down the main path toward the village till he came to the great banyan tree , and then to return along the small path to Nalasu and Nalasu 's house .

As , thus : at the nest nothing unusual save that a buzzard was near it ; in the other clearing three coconuts had fallen to the ground -- for Jerry could count unerringly up to five ; between the other clearing and the main path were four pigs ; along the main path he had passed a dog , more than five women , and two children ; and on the small path home he had noted a cockatoo and two boys .

He listened still more tensely through long minutes in which he heard nothing , at the same time whispering to Jerry for information and commanding him to be soft-spoken ; and Jerry , with whuffs and whiffs and all the short-hand breath-exhalations of speech he had been taught , told him that men approached , many men , more men than five .

They were above and beyond , in an unattainable paradise which he vividly remembered , for which he yearned , but to which he did not know the way , and which , dimly sensing the ending that comes to all things , might have passed into the ultimate nothingness which had already overtaken Skipper and the Arangi .

This man , who had slain four of the Annos , three of them after he had gone blind , who had slain still more men in his savage youth , never raised his voice in anger to Jerry and ruled him by nothing severer than the gentlest of chidings .

Almost might it be said that he and the man could talk by the hour , although few and simple were the abstractions they could talk ; very little of the immediate concrete past , and scarcely anything of the immediate concrete future , entered into their conversations .

And the Annos descended on Nalasu 's clearing , a dozen of them , armed with Sniders , horse pistols , tomahawks and war clubs , walking gingerly , despite their thick sandals , because of fear of the thorns which Nalasu no longer planted .

An easy time his half- year with the blind man had been , despite the fact that Nalasu was a rigid disciplinarian who insisted on training Jerry for longer hours , day in and day out , than falls to the lot of most dogs .

Possibly no dog in all the world had ever been so vocal as he , and for three reasons : his own intelligence , the genius for teaching that was Nalasu 's , and the long hours devoted to the teaching .
