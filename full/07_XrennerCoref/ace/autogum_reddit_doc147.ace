The first Darth Vader comic series that ran for 25 issues took place between ANH and TESB chronicled several major events in Vaders life such as his discovery that his son was alive , his fall from grace in the eyes of the Emperor after the Death Star debacle and his subsequent rise within the Empire to supreme commander of the imperial fleet .

Since lightsaber crystals are living beings and attuned to the light side and thus will only choose a Jedi as their master , Sith have to take such a crystal from a Jedi they have defeated and use the dark side to break and enslave the crystal to their will , making it " bleed " and thus turning it red .

Since the current films all take place long after Vader died , the character has instead been explored extensively in novels and comic books that fill the gaps in his story between the films and add quite a lot of depht and canonical material to it .

However Vader refuses to choose this path , believing that the dark side is truly the only thing he has left now and channels all his rage and countless memories of pain and loss into the crystal , ultimately enslaving it and turning it red .

Since Infila had taken the Vow long before Anakin ever became a Jedi , he was not involved in the Clone Wars or Order 66 and thus was still alive after the Purge .
