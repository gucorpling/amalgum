In this riding the Tory , Ms Taylor , is opposed although I have heard some waffling on ‘ philosophical support . ’ I think that the Liberal incumbent Mr. Smitherman ’s support of MMP is questionable at best , since his cabinet imposed a 60 % supermajority on MMP , but he is saying he supports MMP and it is on his flyer – this shows really the strong public support for MMP in Toronto-Centre .
