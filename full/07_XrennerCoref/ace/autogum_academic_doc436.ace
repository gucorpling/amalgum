On the basis of the obtained results , it is possible to predict an evolution of the proposed traceability systems merging the benefits of each technology into a syncretic one , aiming to preserve the bottle content ( DAB ) , the easy-to-use properties ( NFC and QR-code ) with the QR-B aforementioned qualities , and integrating other information , such as the preservation status from bottling to consumers adopting functional inks .

EVOO represents the one of the excellences of Italian products ; it is a basic ingredient of the Mediterranean diet ; for this reason , it must be protected from fraud and sophistication that could damage “ made in Italy ” and have repercussions both for producers and consumers .

The success of the QR-B could be ascribable to different aspects : the indubitable cutting-edge fashion trend of blockchain in the food sector , the use of incentives ( financial rewards mechanism ) , the easy-to-use QR-code , and the gamification strategy .

Although blockchains are not yet very widespread in EVOO traceability , their use may be an excellent solution to ensure reliability , transparency , and security , especially for those commodities susceptible to fraud such as EVOO .

This interesting result is not affected by the high level of education of the respondents ( 63 % graduated ) even if it may have influenced the considerable percentage ( 93.9 % ) of those interviewed .

However , it must be said that further studies should investigate the deeper costs that farms/industries etc. , would have to pay in relation to the business planning , prior the technological system adoption .

Following the questionnaire results , the high level of the respondent education could mainly due to the media ( a specialized online tool ) adopted to spread the questionnaire .
