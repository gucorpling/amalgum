Instantly my brain cleared and there swept back across the threshold of my memory the vivid picture of the horrors of that ghostly Arizona cave ; again , as on that far-gone night , my muscles refused to respond to my will and again , as though even here upon the banks of the placid Hudson , I could hear the awful moans and rustling of the fearsome thing which had lurked and threatened me from the dark recesses of the cave , I made the same mighty and superhuman effort to break the bonds of the strange anaesthesia which held me , and again came the sharp click as of the sudden parting of a taut wire , and I stood naked and free beside the staring , lifeless thing that had so recently pulsed with the warm , red life-blood of John Carter .

As I stood upon the bluff before my cottage on that clear cold night in the early part of March , 1886 , the noble Hudson flowing like the grey and silent spectre of a dead river below me , I felt again the strange , compelling influence of the mighty god of war , my beloved Mars , which for ten long and lonesome years I had implored with outstretched arms to carry me back to my lost love .

The vegetation was similar to that which covers the lawns of the red Martians of the great waterways , but the trees and birds were unlike anything that I had ever seen upon Mars , and then through the further trees I could see that most un-Martian of all sights -- an open sea , its blue waters shimmering beneath the brazen sun .

All these evidences of careful and systematic cultivation convinced me that I had been fortunate enough to make my entry into Mars on this second occasion through the domain of a civilized people and that when I should find them I would be accorded the courtesy and protection that my rank as a Prince of the house of Tardos Mors entitled me to .

The lesser attraction of this smaller planet and the reduced air pressure of its greatly rarefied atmosphere , afforded so little resistance to my earthly muscles that the ordinary exertion of the mere act of rising sent me several feet into the air and precipitated me upon my face in the soft and brilliant grass of this strange world .

The grass was as close-cropped and carpet-like as some old English lawn and the trees themselves showed evidence of careful pruning to a uniform height of about fifteen feet from the ground , so that as one turned his glance in any direction the forest had the appearance at a little distance of a vast , high-ceiled chamber .

This experience , however , gave me some slightly increased assurance that , after all , I might indeed be in some , to me , unknown corner of Mars , and this was very possible since during my ten years ' residence upon the planet I had explored but a comparatively tiny area of its vast expanse .

There was the same instant of unthinkable cold and utter darkness that I had experienced twenty years before , and then I opened my eyes in another world , beneath the burning rays of a hot sun , which beat through a tiny opening in the dome of the mighty forest in which I lay .

I lay upon a close-cropped sward of red grasslike vegetation , and about me stretched a grove of strange and beautiful trees , covered with huge and gorgeous blossoms and filled with brilliant , voiceless birds .
