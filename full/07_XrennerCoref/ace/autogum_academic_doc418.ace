Moreover , based on the exergy method proposed by Henriques et al. and Cenzi et al. , the objective is to expand the phenomenological and exergy model to a pregnant woman subjected to conditions usually found in urban ecosystems and during stress periods such as passive smoking or prolonged exposure to a tunnel environment .

The usual treatment of CO poisoning consists of reducing the inspired CO to zero and increasing the oxygen inspired , thus generating an increment in the gradients of these gases in the alveolar ventilation and increasing O partial pressure in the blood .

As proposed by Oliveira , one of the most interesting applications of the Second Law is understanding the functioning of living beings and use the physical property entropy generation ( or destroyed exergy ) as an indicator or diagnosis of pathology .

The gas CO is toxic because it has an affinity with the hemoglobin 200 – 300 times greater than O. Hence , even relatively small concentrations of CO inspired can reduce the delivered oxygen to the tissues , causing hypoxia .
