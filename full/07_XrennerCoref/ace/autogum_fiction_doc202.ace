The Captain of the ship was not afraid , because he had seen storms before , and had sailed his ship through them in safety ; but he knew that his passengers would be in danger if they tried to stay on deck , so he put them all into the cabin and told them to stay there until after the storm was over , and to keep brave hearts and not be scared , and all would be well with them .
