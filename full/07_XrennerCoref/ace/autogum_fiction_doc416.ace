He must moreover , with intermissions , still have been lifted and borne ; since why and how else should he have known himself , later on , with the afternoon glow intenser , no longer at the foot of his stairs -- situated as these now seemed at that dark other end of his tunnel -- but on a deep window-bench of his high saloon , over which had been spread , couch-fashion , a mantle of soft stuff lined with grey fur that was familiar to his eyes and that one of his hands kept fondly feeling as for its pledge of truth . Mrs. Muldoon 's face had gone , but the other , the second he had recognised , hung over him in a way that showed how he was still propped and pillowed .

They were cold , these marble squares of his youth ; but he somehow was not , in this rich return of consciousness -- the most wonderful hour , little by little , that he had ever known , leaving him , as it did , so gratefully , so abysmally passive , and yet as with a treasure of intelligence waiting all round him for quiet appropriation ; dissolved , he might call it , in the air of the place and producing the golden glow of a late autumn afternoon .

It had brought him to knowledge , to knowledge -- yes , this was the beauty of his state ; which came to resemble more and more that of a man who has gone to sleep on some news of a great inheritance , and then , after dreaming it away , after profaning it with matters strange to it , has waked up again to serenity of certitude and has only to lie and watch it grow .

-- was Mrs. Muldoon 's voice , coming to him from quite near , from so near that he seemed presently to see her as kneeling on the ground before him while he lay looking up at her ; himself not wholly on the ground , but half-raised and upheld -- conscious , yes , of tenderness of support and , more particularly , of a head pillowed in extraordinary softness and faintly refreshing fragrance .

He considered , he wondered , his wit but half at his service ; then another face intervened , bending more directly over him , and he finally knew that Alice Staverton had made her lap an ample and perfect cushion to him , and that she had to this end seated herself on the lowest degree of the staircase , the rest of his long person remaining stretched on his old black-and-white slabs .

He had come back , yes -- come back from further away than any man but himself had ever travelled ; but it was strange how with this sense what he had come back to seemed really the great thing , and as if his prodigious journey had been all for the sake of it .

It took her but an instant to bend her face and kiss him , and something in the manner of it , and in the way her hands clasped and locked his head while he felt the cool charity and virtue of her lips , something in all this beatitude somehow answered everything .

She had been turning away , all anxiety , from worrying the vain bell-handle -- her calculation having been of the hour of the good woman 's visit ; but the latter , blessedly , had come up while she was still there , and they had entered together .

Slowly but surely his consciousness grew , his vision of his state thus completing itself ; he had been miraculously carried back -- lifted and carefully borne as from where he had been picked up , the uttermost end of an interminable grey passage .
