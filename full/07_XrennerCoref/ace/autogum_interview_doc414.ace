Unfortunately , Ms. Cowbourne was not cut out for public life and delegated most of her duties to her paid assistants ( who failed miserably in the process ) and voted at City Hall according to the interests of the NDP bloc at City Hall and not for the residents of Ward 44 .

Unlike Ron Moeser , who had his chance and failed miserably ( Moeser was evicted from office by Ward 44 voters in 2003 due to his chronic absenteeism and his miserable voting record ) , I will be an extremely hard working councillor who will promote transparency and accountability at City Hall .

I feel quite strongly about this issue because this type of media coverage unfairly stigmatizes the residents of Scarborough and Ward 44 and adversely affects property values and the quality of life of her residents , and makes it easier for downtown politicians to deny services for Scarborough residents .

Our Ward 44 incumbent , Gay Cowbourne , won the 2003 election as a protest vote against the former councillor , Ron Moeser , who was known more for his chronic absenteeism and dismal voting record than in representing the people of Ward 44 .

I will be a strong voice for the people of Ward 44 at City Hall and will not be influenced by special interest groups or the agendas of political parties who rarely represent the local interests and concerns of a particular ward .

I am disappointed with Council for concentrating almost exclusively on the Toronto Island Airport issue while the City of Toronto is on the brink of financial ruin with no long term plan to invest in the infrastructure of the city .

The City of Toronto does not have the authority to stop the Toronto Airport Authority ( which falls under the authority of the federal government ) from expanding their operations thus wasting precious time and resources in the process .
