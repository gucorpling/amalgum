I still put myself on dating sites every now and then without expecting much , and always look for opportunities out there in the real world to potentially be introduced to someone new , yet I would be lying if I did n't say there 's also those nights where I see that things are n't changing , I get tired by that thought , and really do n't care .

I 'm halfway through my 30s now , and the spot I 'm in is where it 's like of course I want to meet someone , but at this age , I get easily exhausted at the thought of putting in a ton of effort only to realize there 's usually little to no reward in it pertaining to resolving my dating life .

You can have a career , financial stability , be subjectively attractive , fit , have enough hobbies to make you a well-rounded person , be social , put yourself in environments where you 'd think you 'd meet someone , join all the dating sites and use all the apps ... and still , nothing .
