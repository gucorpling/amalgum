Since the navigation sensors used in a PDR cannot measure the earth rate , the error models , including the position error , can be simplified as follows : ( 24 ) ( 25 ) ( 26 ) where is a rotation matrix from the body frame to NED frame , and is a skew-symmetric matrix corresponding to input acceleration which is defined as follows : ( 27 )

While ZUPT is performed repeatedly in a stance phase , the magnetic heading update and position update are carried out once in the stance phase because they are relatively less accurate than the zero velocity measurements .
