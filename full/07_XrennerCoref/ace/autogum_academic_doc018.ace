The main sex pheromone components of E. grisescens were Z3 , Z6 , Z9-18 : H and Z3 , epo6 , Z9-18 : H , correspondingly Z3 , Z6 , Z9-18 : H , Z3 , epo6 , Z9-18 : H and Z3 , epo6 , Z9-19 : H were sex pheromone components of E. obliqua .

Specifically , the 3.7 % genetic distance between E. obliqua and E. grisescens , based on cytochrome oxidase I ( COI ) sequences , was found to be a practical distinguishing method that can provide a basis for further research on sibling species of tea geometrids .

In China , two sibling tea geometrid species , Ectropis grisescens ( Warren ) ( Lepidoptera : Geometridae , Ennominae ) and Ectropis obliqua ( Prout ) , are the most serious pests chewing leaves of tea .

At the same time , they also found the reason why virus sensitivity showed that , despite differences between the two species , E. obliqua is more sensitive to Eo NPV than E. grisescens .

Though Ectropis grisescens and Ectropis obliqua were named by Warren and Prout several decades ago , the two sibling tea geometrids were always mistaken as one species because of their extremely similar morphology .

Afterwards E. obliqua nucleopolyhedrovirus ( Eo NPV ) , an effective natural biological agent , has been successfully developed as a bio-insecticide in China for the control of the tea geometrids .

Following that , Xi et al. found that some tea geometrid populations revealed diverse sensitivity to the virus but they did not know the reason at that time . Jiang et al.

Males of both E. grisescens and E. obliqua could interfere through the intraspecific mating of the other species , but the impact of the mating interference differed .

As sibling species , tea geometrids sharing the same effective components of sex pheromone mean that reproductive interference may exist in sympatry .
