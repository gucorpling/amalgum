I decided to preserve the general plot , change the names of the villains , the bad guy 's plan , a few scenes and re-introduced a well known terrorist organization and its chief from the Bond films and novels : S.P.E.C.T.R.E. and Ernst Stavro Blofeld .

The plot will stay close to Fleming 's literary works and will be derived from the short story Octopussy , the last third of the novel You Only Live Twice , hence the title , Shatterhand , which is Blofeld 's pseudonym in that adventure .
