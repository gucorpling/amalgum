“ As is the case for risk , safety may also be defined formally or technically in terms of minimizing errors and measurable consequences , but it is more appropriate to adopt the principle used by Slovic in his social studies of risk and note that safety does not exist ‘ out there ’ independent of our minds and culture , ready to be measured , but as a constructed human concept , more easily judged than defined ”

When this is the governing paradigm , it will also become possible to be the first in safety , managing both the positive and negative effects of the risks encountered , aiming at excellence because safety performance will also become an objective to be achieved and safe-guarded .

Consequently , to measure perceived unsafety , it is sufficient to capture all occurrences of negatively affected objectives , something that is aimed for in some of the highest risk and performing organizations , for instance , airline corporations , aircraft carriers , or nuclear installations .

As it is the purpose to provide a fundamental way of looking at the concepts of risk and safety , it should not matter from which perspective this foundation is regarded and , therefore , should cater to whatever viewpoint one has on science .

Amongst others , it permits to build systems that can measure safety instantly and holistically , or better said , to measure ‘ unsafety ’ instantly and holistically because measuring safety would require knowing all objectives present in a system and its sub-systems .

Any true foundation should be able to be inclusive in that regard , and we believe that the proposed foundation remains valid irrespective of the chosen scientific philosophy , as it can be used for either a qualitative or a quantitative approach .

On the other hand , it is much easier to discover unsafety because when an objective has failed and has incurred negative effects , it is likely to trigger a reaction , even when the “ loss ” is rather insignificant .

While , at the same time , it is also possible to regard the proposed foundation as the result of deductive reasoning , starting from the etymological overview on risk and safety and the chosen definition of risk .

Also , the observations concerning the historical evolution of the understanding of the concepts risk and safety can be seen as an inductive way of reasoning to come to the findings of the ontological and semantic foundation .

When safety is the prevention of bad things happening , this credo is a real showstopper , as the safest thing to do for avoiding losses is to do nothing and prevent any activity .

“ Safety first ” , then , means to achieve and protect objectives as a priority , aiming at a successful performance ( Safety II ) and calling to action instead of promoting inaction .

This is impossible , because most of the time , people are not aware of all of their objectives , and organizations are unable to know all the objectives of all their stakeholders .

As such , a focus on safety will also translate to a focus on performance , creating better results for those industrial parks that adopt this inclusive paradigm regarding safety and performance .

We are well aware of the fact that many different ontological and semantic foundations for safety science can be developed when different approaches and other specific viewpoints are used .
