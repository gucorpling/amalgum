The popularity of the latter poem was expressed by its survival “ in the manuscripts of the local scribal tradition , of which there are 6 known copies to-date in existence ranging from the earliest transcribed in 1759 up to the most recent in 1856 which was penned by one of our last local professional Gaelic scribes , Art Bennet of Ballykeel ” ( Trimble , 2018 , p. 93 ) .

Mac Domhnaill 's ability as a master poet was clearly appreciated , not just by Mac Cumhaigh and that later generation of poets , but also by his own contemporaries , and in addition to his joint-composition by Mac a liondain , his other good friend Niall og Mha ' Mhurchaidh [ who ] lauds him with the title Oide na nDán ( ' Tutor of the Poems ' ) .

Mac Domhnaill was incorrectly cited by both Rev. Paul O'Brien of Maynooth and Henry Morris as a native of Donegal , yet Art Mac Cumhaigh , “ clearly identifies Mac Domhnaill as a major local poet of the same stature of Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta and Pádraig Mac a Liondan . ” ( Trimble , 2018 , p. 99 ) .

Trimble attributes much of this to “ the absence of details on the poet himself in the extant manuscripts ... because no communal memory at all of Mac Domhnaill or his poetry was transmitted or preserved in the all-important oral tradition of the remaining native Irish speakers of the area . ” ( Trimble , 2018 , p. 100 ) .

More significantly , there is no evidence of a customary eulogy ever having been composed for Mac Domhnaill by any of his brother-poets but with the death fo his old friend Padraig Mac a Liondain in 1732 , his reputation among both the local community and the local Gaelic literati would continue to fade further into obscurity .
