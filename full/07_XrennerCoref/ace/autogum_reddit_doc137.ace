While I 'm sure the new Spider-man will be doing some new things , I 'm more excited by how Insomniac seems to have taken inspiration from the gameplay of the TASM games(Which had a lot of good ideas imo ) and elevated it to new heights .

Mass Effect 2 was still enjoyable but I noticed that the gunplay , powers , and movement felt a lot better to me in Mass Effect 3 which did much more for me than the new weapons and powers .

If you 're unaware in the original game you had to select a mode with a ui wheel ( which was uncommon in pc games at the time ) or bind buttons to switching modes .

It gets a lot of shit for other reasons , but the refinement of the controls from Crysis to Crysis 2 was one of the most impressive ux upgrades I can think of .

I think polish and refinement of gameplay mechanics is even more important than simply adding new things when it comes to the enjoyment of a video game sequel .

Certain game franchises get a lot of flak for having games that are too similar but the refinement of gameplay mechanics is just as important as new things .

Literally the only thing that ended up going away from the original game was being able to select speed mode while prone and power crawl , lol .

So instead of selecting power mode and kicking or throwing something , you just hold in the interaction button to get the ' power ' version .

Do n't care how many new costumes there are , as long as the game looks and feels good then I am more than satisfied .

I think extra polish and refinement is even more important for one 's enjoyment of a game than simply changing things up .

In the second game they took away the modes , but integrated all the effects into a more standard control scheme .

I loved the concept of the original State of Decay but my enjoyment was hampered by clunky controls and bugs .

Also , I think ELEX would have benefited immensely by a lot less " Euro-Jank " .

A single lost feature , but a much slicker and intuitive control scheme was really impressive .
