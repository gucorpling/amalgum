In our society we would take the position that it is , because we ca n't understand why someone would — we are n't talking about just sex play , where you might inflict a little pain to enjoy an erotic experience , or things of that sort — but if somebody is actually attempting to take his life or severely injure himself , or multiple self-cutting , we would fall back on a somewhat paternalistic position and say , ' Wait a minute , this is crossing the line , and this is a disorder because we are judging it is hurtful to yourself . ' We would judge that a disorder .

For instance , I 'm a cross-dresser and I do n't want to keep it confined to my circle of friends , or my party circle , and I want to take that to my wife and I do n't understand why she does n't accept it , or I take it to my office and I do n't understand why they do n't accept it , then it 's become a problem because it 's interfering with my relationships and environment .

No , because the term itself is a diagnosis and if you look at the current listing of diagnoses , the one thing you will find as a qualifier on every one of them for it to be considered a disorder is that it must interfere with functioning , personal interrelationships , career , etc.
