Another argument is that we do n't consider the casomorphins in cheese and milk to be opioids , which we totally do , but even if we did n't it is totally fucking ridiculous because you are comparing a natural protein found in mammal milk to a psychoactive , addictive drug .

People will then say that kratom is in the same family as coffee ( rubiacea ) because they think it makes it seem harmless , but also in that family is psychotria viridis , a DMT/MAOI containing plant that is often used in the preparation of ayahuasca .

There are a couple of papers that people will throw around that argue that it SHOULD be classified as something other than an opioid , but obviously a few scientists saying something SHOULD be does not mean it IS .

Opioid , a more modern term , is used to designate all substances , both natural and synthetic , that bind to opioid receptors in the brain ( including antagonists ) .

One big issue people have is that the alkaloids in kratom do not recruit beta arrestin 2 ( which is responsible in part for respiratory depression ) like opiates do .

It acts on the opioid receptors to produce a psychoactive effect that is not entirely dissimilar to alkaloids such as morphine and codeine and is even addictive .
