SistematX has a different relationship to the other databases available on the web , in that it is possible to use a browser to directly add and manage the data useful to the academic community about the secondary metabolites , such as research by chemical structure , SMILES code , compound names as well as information-specific species for taxonomic classification ( from family to species ) and the geographic location of the species from which the compounds were isolated .

The biological and physicochemical properties of the molecules can be predicted through molecular descriptors , which are the result of the conversion of the symbolic representation of a chemical structure into a useful number , and there are several software packages to generate molecular descriptors , such as Dragon 7.0 .

Thus , the aim of this work is to construct a database of diterpenes from the Lamiaceae family and extract information for chemotaxonomic analysis among the subfamilies , using the molecular descriptors and SOMs , and comparing the results with the phylogenetic classification proposed by Li et al. .

In the work of Harley et al. , it was observed that 236 genera are distributed in seven subfamilies : Ajugoideae , Lamioideae , Nepetoideae , Prostantheroideae , Scutellarioideae , Symphorematoideae and Viticoideae , although 10 genera were left unassigned at the subfamily level .
