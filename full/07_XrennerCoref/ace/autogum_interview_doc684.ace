What I 'm saying here is that it seems to me a good idea to look at a different model where you can get settlement of the Palestinian refugees and bring the Jordanians back into the picture on the West Bank , so you 're not -- you 're looking more at a stable country like Jordan being involved , rather than trying to have the Palestinian authority take over when they 've just shown no capacity to be able to govern .

No , I do n't think it 's necessarily a bad idea , but I also do n't think elections necessarily mean that you 're going to have an open , free society , as we 've seen taking place in the Palestinian authority and the activities of Hamas and now them even throwing out Fatah from the Gaza Strip , and this huge conflict that 's taking place there .

One of the things I think we 've gotta push a lot better , David , is to have the governments there provide services to the people , like health care and education , that are all too often being provided by these radical Islamic groups , so that people look more to the radical elements to meet their daily needs than the role that the government should be playing .

I think we 're just gonna have to be a lot more real politic about this in the Middle East and the Muslim region of the world , about how far you can push and how hard you can push the governmental systems without just going into the radical Islamic fascist regime .

DS : Do you think it 's a bad idea to have elections in countries if it 's possible that an Islamic extremist group will win , such as happened in Palestine with Hamas ?

You require an authorization before you can get an appropriation , so I think that 'll cut down more on those projects more than anything else .
