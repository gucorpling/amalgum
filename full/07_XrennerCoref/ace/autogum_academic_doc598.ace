We found only a weak relationship between mitotane dose and its plasma concentrations during the first phase of treatment , and this finding is in agreement with the concept that individual differences in mitotane metabolism and other still unknown factors influence plasma concentrations .

Severe toxicity leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was recorded in only five patients on chronic therapy , and this is likely due to the low doses ( median dose of 2 g/day ) used to continue treatment in the maintenance phase .

In our cohort , toxicity associated with adjuvant mitotane was acceptable , though we acknowledge the fact that due to the study inclusion criteria we did not capture the patients who eventually discontinued mitotane in the first six months .

In the present study , we calculated the TTR , which in our opinion gives a more adequate representation of chronic exposure to mitotane , and analyzed the results in a multivariate analysis without predefining arbitrary cutoff values .

Although it is plausible that lower mitotane concentrations may be effective in an adjuvant treatment , we analyzed only the level of 14 mg/L , because this was the target in our practice .

ACC recurrence portends a worse prognosis and has a huge impact on quality of life ; therefore , investigators have considered the use of adjuvant mitotane therapy following surgical operation .

Due to the very cautious dose titration in the starting phase of treatment employed in many centers , the time needed to get into the target range was exceedingly long .
