While between Milan and Naples ( including Bologna , Florence and Rome ) high-speed trains cut travel times in half , on other routes , such as between Rome and Genoa , Naples and Reggio Calabria , Venice and Trieste , high-speed trains travel on the traditional line rather than on a dedicated high-speed line , with only marginally shorter travel times compared to Intercity trains , thus taking them might be a waste of money .
