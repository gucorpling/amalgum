As I inferred , I wanted to connect low-budget filmmakers via a feeling of community , as many low-budget filmmakers often compete so viciously against one another in film festivals for coveted “ shots ” with Hollywood , that they can quickly forget their similarities . ( We also wanted to remind them that low-budget filmmakers actually substantially outnumber their counterparts in Hollywood , which can be an amazing source of power if we all work together , rather than in isolated groups . )

The best way we saw to do this was by providing a vast resource library of articles on low-budget filmmaking with a serious eye for stretching a dollar , in-depth reviews of software and equipment specifically evaluated from a low-budget perspective , DIY tutorials on building helpful equipment , listings of special readers-only discounts of different products , and an area for finding fully deferred musicians and score composers for your films .

As you can imagine , the name “ MicroFilmmaker ” came from a combination of the word “ Microcinema ” ( with its low budgets and community approach ) and Filmmaking ( which we specifically chose over “ videomaking , ” because we feel that filmmaking is able to be accomplished with any medium , since “ films ” are a product , not a recording medium ) .

( Although there is a charge , the amount is no more than the cost of a submission to a film festival with shorts running $ 25 and feature-length films running $ 50 , which is used to provide a small reimbursement to the critic for their hard , detailed work and is substantially less than the $300-$ 500 most film analysis companies charge . )

I was so blown away by an equipment manufacturer caring that much about low-budget filmmakers that it inspired me to create the first magazine aimed specifically to help other ultra-low budget filmmakers who had to struggle as much as I did .

Shortly after that , I found a company called Redrock Micro , which had built a 35mm lens adapter for less than $1K which allowed low-budget filmmakers to get film-like depth of field from $2000-$ 4000 cameras and SLR lenses .

It ’s always cool when we ’ll have a filmmaker submit a film that has problems and then , after the critique , change their approach for the next film so that the upcoming film has a much better score .

Not only that , but they had such a passion for low-budget filmmakers , that they were offering kits with plans and a key part so you could build your own 35mm adapter for $ 45 .

This last piece of our magazine ’s offerings is the only thing that we charge any money for , because it is so specialized to a specific filmmaker ’s film .
