These criteria have some weaknesses ; for example , they do not consider objective measures of the quality of products , but only consider the judgements/opinions of managers about the general performance of suppliers with respect to this issue .

, the second step is to carry out the supplier evaluation taking into account the scores ( indicators ) of all products provided by each supplier , as well as other relevant supplier criteria for the company .

Thus , the indicator of food safety from suppliers is measured through four sub criteria : food safety certification , withdrawal volume due to food safety issues , number of withdrawals , and withdrawals impact .

The performance of fresh food suppliers in supermarket chains depends on the quality of products provided by suppliers , in addition to other criteria needed to assess them from a sustainable perspective .

The “ product quality ” that a company evaluates is a subjective assessment of product quality made by a manager , followed by withdrawal when food safety problems occur .
