Specific instruments are available to measure quality of life in these patients , such as the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire ( AVVQ ) or the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Quality of Life Questionnaire ( CIVIC ) for patients with CVI , and the Charing Cross Venous Ulcer Questionnaire for patients with venous ulcers .

With the existing level of evidence of the importance of therapeutic compression of the lower limbs , it is unacceptable that 90 % of patients with CVI in Turkey and 54 % of patients with venous ulcers in Spain are not given compression stockings .

However , when completing the registry , healthcare professionals are reminded of important actions that can be carried out in people with risk factors such as older age , female sex , and obesity , which increase their likelihood of having CVD .

It is estimated that 80 % of the population have the mildest level of symptoms ( C1 – C2 , spider and varicose veins ) , while 5 % have the most advanced stages ( C3 – C6 ) .
