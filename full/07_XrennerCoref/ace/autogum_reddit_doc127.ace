That and the fact that did n't bother testing to make sure everything worked and forgot to call me for pickup the second time , scratched the lid without telling me the first time , and did n't clean the replacement display ( and left the adhesive strips on it ) before handing back my laptop leads me to question their craftsmanship and quality control at this particular location .

Also ( no offense ) , but I am paranoid of the quality of the repairs done as well , as only one key on my keyboard was not functioning properly when I visited the Genius Bar the first time , and now all these issues are arising back-to-back AFTER they " repaired " it ( never saw any signs of these issues before ) .

The Employee tries running an OS that they have on hand using a dongle , but when he tries to log in , the black screen with the spinning pinwheel persists ( although this time , occasionally the top left portion of the display would flicker ) , leading him to believe that it is a hardware issue .

I ask if I can just get a replacement unit ( as this point , they would have replaced everything on my laptop ) since I have a backup of my data , but he states that unfortunately , Apple 's policy is that they must perform 3 major repairs before exploring the possibility of a replacement unit .

My question to you all is : 1 ) Have you ever encountered someone who went through a similar situation , and if so , how was their situation handled ? 2 ) Is what the manager said regarding the 3 major repairs not remedying the issue before replacing the laptop unit true ?

He tells me that they can replace the logic board/motherboard ( and transfer over my SSD to retain data ) as that is the only part left they have not replaced , and it should most likely solve the issue .

It seems a tad unreasonable as it 's taking them more work and time to fix the issues in the long run . 3 ) As I said earlier , I did not purchase AppleCare\+ when buying the MacBook .
