He had no net , hook , or line , and he could not be a fisherman ; his boat had no cushion for a sitter , no paint , no inscription , no appliance beyond a rusty boathook and a coil of rope , and he could not be a waterman ; his boat was too crazy and too small to take in cargo for delivery , and he could not be a lighterman or river-carrier ; there was no clue to what he looked for , but he looked for something , with a most intent and searching gaze .

Half savage as the man showed , with no covering on his matted head , with his brown arms bare to between the elbow and the shoulder , with the loose knot of a looser kerchief lying low on his bare breast in a wilderness of beard and whisker , with such dress as he wore seeming to be made out of the mud that begrimed his boat , still there was a business-like usage in his steady gaze .

At every mooring-chain and rope , at every stationery boat or barge that split the current into a broad-arrowhead , at the offsets from the piers of Southwark Bridge , at the paddles of the river steamboats as they beat the filthy water , at the floating logs of timber lashed together lying off certain wharves , his shining eyes darted a hungry look .

In these times of ours , though concerning the exact year there is no need to be precise , a boat of dirty and disreputable appearance , with two figures in it , floated on the Thames , between Southwark bridge which is of iron , and London Bridge which is of stone , as an autumn evening was closing in .

The tide , which had turned an hour before , was running down , and his eyes watched every little race and eddy in its broad sweep , as the boat made slight head-way against it , or drove stern foremost before it , according as he directed his daughter by a movement of his head .

Allied to the bottom of the river rather than the surface , by reason of the slime and ooze with which it was covered , and its sodden state , this boat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that they often did , and were seeking what they often sought .

But , it happened now , that a slant of light from the setting sun glanced into the bottom of the boat , and , touching a rotten stain there which bore some resemblance to the outline of a muffled human form , coloured it as though with diluted blood .

Until now , the boat had barely held her own , and had hovered about one spot ; but now , the banks changed swiftly , and the deepening shadows and the kindling lights of London Bridge were passed , and the tiers of shipping lay on either hand .

The girl pulled the hood of a cloak she wore , over her head and over her face , and , looking backward so that the front folds of this hood were turned down the river , kept the boat in that direction going before the tide .

Always watching his face , the girl instantly answered to the action in her sculling ; presently the boat swung round , quivered as from a sudden jerk , and the upper half of the man was stretched out over the stern .

The figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled hair and a sun-browned face , and a dark girl of nineteen or twenty , sufficiently like him to be recognizable as his daughter .

The girl rowed , pulling a pair of sculls very easily ; the man , with the rudder-lines slack in his hands , and his hands loose in his waistband , kept an eager look out .
