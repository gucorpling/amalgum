In this work , we propose a quad-WRGB structure with spatial-deep trench isolation ( S-DTI ) and a spatial-tungsten grid ( S-WG ) to solve the small pixel problems , such as low sensitivity and high crosstalk .

Fifty percent of the total area of the RGBW CFA is occupied by the white CF , 25 % by the green CF , and 12.5 % by the red and blue CF .

The WRGB ( white , red , green , blue ) CFA indicates that one of the green pixels of the Bayer CFA was replaced with a white pixel .

Particularly good examples include new optical pixel structures , such as the stacked grid structure between color filters , the lensed CF , and the front-inner lens image sensor .

Therefore , the optical performance of a small-sized pixel deteriorates due to low sensitivity and high crosstalk , which lead to a lower performance of CMOS image sensors .

The front-inner lens is proposed to enhance the sensitivity by adding a lens to the front side to serve as the interconnection layer in a shallow photodiode .

However , the thickness of the CF has pigment limitations , and making the photodiode thinner is difficult because of the lower light absorption at long wavelengths .

However , the grids cannot be adapted to small pixels because the CF width reduces and adversely affects the sensitivity by shrinking the absorption area .

Because the white color filter transmits a lot of light , some of the light enters the other pixel ’s photodiode .

A CFA with a white color filter has been studied because a white color filter transmits incident light at all wavelengths .

If the pixel depth gets thinner , the color filter ( CF ) or the photodiode should also be thinner .
