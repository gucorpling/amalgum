And looking across space with instruments , and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of , they see , at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of them , a morning star of hope , our own warmer planet , green with vegetation and grey with water , with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility , with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow , navy-crowded seas .

No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man ’s and yet as mortal as his own ; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied , perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water .

Yet so vain is man , and so blinded by his vanity , that no writer , up to the very end of the nineteenth century , expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far , or indeed at all , beyond its earthly level .

Yet across the gulf of space , minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish , intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic , regarded this earth with envious eyes , and slowly and surely drew their plans against us .

Nor was it generally understood that since Mars is older than our earth , with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun , it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from time ’s beginning but nearer its end .

Its air is much more attenuated than ours , its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface , and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones .

The planet Mars , I scarcely need remind the reader , revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles , and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world .
