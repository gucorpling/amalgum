It is n’t really known why some people develop paraphilias , but as long as no one is actively getting hurt , assaulted , or killed , or as long as no crime is being committed ( like breaking into a morgue to have sex with a corpse or actually molesting a child downloading child porn ) , paraphilias are not necessarily harmful .

To me , it does seem as if you may have some psychopathic tendencies , namely lack of strong emotion , impulsive and thrill-seeking behavior , and a history of behavior that is harmful to others .
