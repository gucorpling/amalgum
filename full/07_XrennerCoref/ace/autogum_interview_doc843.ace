And conversely , to say it ’s not an individual right does n’t mean that gun owners are without all rights , and the ACLU has often collaborated with gun owners rights organizations to defend their rights to privacy , to defend their rights to due process ; in other words , they do n’t forfeit all of their Constitutional rights just because they are gun owners , even if the Second Amendment does n’t protect .

Ironically , the very first federal appellate court in recent history to hold that there was an individual right to bear arms under the Second Amendment , the Fifth Circuit , then went on to nevertheless uphold the particular restriction that was being challenged ! Mainly , that the guy was under a restraining order for domestic abuse and he was n’t allowed to possess a gun .

I actually do n’t think in reality that the difference is that profound , because when you look at the big debate , and you stated it well , does the government protect the individual right to bear arms , does it only protect a collective right through the state militias ?

Among other reasons , I think it would have the effect of placing disproportionate responsibility on to him when a lot of the blame for the violations I ’m talking about rests in the hands of Congress .

No right is absolute ; the government is always allowed to restrict the right if it can satisfy Constitutional strict scrutiny and show the restriction is narrowly tailored to promote a goal of compelling importance .

Let ’s assume for the sake of argument it does protect an individual right , it is no more absolute than freedom of speech or any other right in the Constitution .

Are the rights accorded to well-armed militias , or is it accorded to unfettered rights of individuals to own guns ?
