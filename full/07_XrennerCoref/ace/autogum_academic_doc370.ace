However , the observed in-stream time series demonstrate that the timing of the solute tracer release relative to the diurnal cycle is important in determining which age-ranked storage is sampled by the solute tracer , and how the tracer is ultimately stored in and released from the study reach .

Overall , we found a single parameterization of the SAS function provided a strong fit to observed data , which indicates that the same consistent diurnal cycles of transport processes were present during all four injections and varied systematically with diurnal fluctuations in discharge .

For the injections conducted on the rising and peak discharge conditions , the highest concentrations are advected through the study reach so rapidly that they do not experience minimum discharge conditions ( i. e. , peaks prior to minimum discharge ;

These differences are attributable to the timing of the study release , as all four injections were well-described by a single SAS function and did not exhibit wide variation in summary metrics such as temporal moments .

In all four injections ( falling , rising , peak , minimum ) , mass flux is reduced at the daily minimum discharge conditions , and rebounds rapidly when discharge and surface water extent increase .

Despite the differences in timing of advection of the highest concentration water relative to the time of minimum discharge , we found few differences between the injections with respect to calculated solute transport metrics .

Consistent with this preferential export , the late-time tail is no longer visible as the second rising limb of discharge occurs ( X = 60 h since 00:00 on day of injection ;

Thus , tracer injected at minimum discharge was predominantly stored in the reach , ultimately labeling older age-ranked storage that is more slowly and consistently exported from the study reach .

Indeed , the evolution of SAS functions , and particularly the conditions experienced shortly after each injection , may dominate overall transport and transformation dynamics in the study reach .

As a result , the highest concentration water was preferentially exported from the study reach under higher discharges rather than being stored .
