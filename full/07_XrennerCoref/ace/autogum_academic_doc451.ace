Third , the study has a relatively large sample size and there was no selection bias as we included all the individuals who were enumerated during the study reference period in 60 wards where ACF is implemented .

Sixth , wage loss , apprehension about the diagnosis , substance abuse , and male dependency of females for seeking care at health facilities were the major challenges for PTBPs to visit the referred health facility .

Fifth , the stigma about TB , suspicion about TA , lack of support from political leaders , and low salary for TAs were the major challenges in conducting house-to-house visit for identifying the PTBPs .

As explored in the qualitative study , the other potential reasons for low rate of PTBP detection are hesitancy to disclose the details of TB symptoms due to stigma and distrust about TAs .

First , the ACF activity had a low PTBP detection rate with only three out of 1000 apparently healthy individuals enumerated during house-to-house visits having symptoms that were suggestive of TB .

This is one of the first mixed methods studies to assess the “ care cascade ” and to explore the challenges associated with the implementation of ACF for TB in India .

Second , we used a mixed methods design , which provided considerable insights into challenges involved in the implementation of ACF and enabled us to interpret the quantitative results .

The informants might not be aware of the TB symptoms and thus , could have failed to identify the PTBPs among those who were absent during the interview .

Third , among PTBPs who undergo the diagnostic test , the sputum positivity rate was high , with one out of four having been diagnosed with TB .

As the ACF activity was conducted during the daytime , the symptoms of individuals who were away from home were enquired about by speaking to adult informants .

Second , there was high attrition of PTBP prior to diagnosis with only two out of three PTBP who were referred actually visiting the health facility .

Although the NNS is high , the activity is still worthwhile as it indirectly sensitizes households on TB symptoms and thus creates awareness in the community .

First , the study had a low rate of PTBP detection , whereas the previous studies on ACF have consistently shown high rates of PTBP detection .

3,5 event|6,12 abstract|10,12 event|14,19 abstract|18,19 abstract|22,27 abstract|25,27 abstract

Also , the TAs might have given more preference to referral and linkage of PTBPs with severe and multiple symptoms rather than those with mild symptoms .
1,2 person
3,5 abstract|11,12 abstract|17,21 abstract|23,27 abstract|25,27 abstract

Though PTBPs were identified by ACF activity , the decision to visit largely depended on the severity of symptoms and thus mimicked the passive case finding .

Fifth , we adhered to STrengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology ( STROBE ) and COREQ guidelines for reporting the study ’s findings .

The wage or work loss due to travel and visits to health facilities during the day time was one of the major reasons .

Studies in the past have shown that the detection rate of PTBP may be low if the symptoms are not elicited individually .
1,2 person
1,5 abstract|3,5 abstract|8,13 abstract|12,13 event|17,19 abstract

The rate was high in spite of repeated house visits by TAs to counsel and encourage PTBPs to visit the health facility .

Regular visits to the same community ( six days a week ) is gradually leading to good rapport building with the community .

Among females , the attrition rate was high as they were dependent on male family members to visit the health facility .

4,7 abstract|10,11 person|14,17 person|19,22 place

The TAs failed to individually enquire about symptoms that are suggestive of TB from all those who were enumerated .

Fourth , we used double data entry and validation using EpiData software and thus data entry errors were minimized .

Thus , these reasons warrant the provision of financial support and assistance to PTBPs to undergo diagnostic tests .

The second finding is the high attrition rate among PTBPs referred to health facilities for TB diagnosis .

The other important issue was general distrust and unhappiness about the public health system among the public .
1,2 person
1,5 abstract|6,8 abstract|6,15 abstract|11,15 abstract|16,18 person

A potential reason for high NNS might be the low detection and high attrition rate of PTBPs .

Previous studies have also reported similar findings with attrition rates ranging from 39 % to 80 % .
1,2 person
1,3 abstract|6,8 abstract|9,11 abstract|9,11 quantity|13,15 quantity|16,18 quantity

This could be due to the fact that only those with perceived need reached the health facility .

Third , the rate of TB diagnosis among those PTBPs visiting a health facility was high .

This might improve the overall case detection in the community and contribute to TB control efforts .

Fourth , the overall yield of ACF was low and NNS for TB was high .
