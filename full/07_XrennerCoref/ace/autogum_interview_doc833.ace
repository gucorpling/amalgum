Religious groups have the right to meet in public parks to pray , to give sermons in public parks ; in fact , if you look at every case that the Supreme Court has decided on these issues , the ACLU has always been in support of the rights of religious groups and a lot of the early free speech cases happened to be on behalf of religious groups who were seeking to use the streets , the sidewalks , the parks , other public forums to convey their messages .

If , for example , in a particular school there is theoretically an open forum and all student groups are free to meet , but in fact the only student groups that are meeting are religious or of a particular religion , you know enough law to know that the conclusion could be that a reasonable observer could look at as school endorsement of religion and not a school endorsement of an open forum .

But I have to add a qualification and stress that the ACLU ’s position here has been reflected not only under Supreme Court decisions under the First Amendment religious freedom , freedom of speech and nonestablishment of religion , but also through a federal statute that was passed in the 1980 ’s called the Equal Access Act .

If it is a public school that is having a public forum where the individual students and voluntary students groups can meet , then the school is simply providing a neutral forum .

It basically sets out the general principle I have stated , but the important qualification is that you always have to look at all the facts of the circumstances .

The key principle that unites the whole First Amendment including non-establishment and free exercise of religion and free speech , is that the government has to remain neutral .

The government can not squelch certain ideas because it disagrees with the ideas , and with respect to religion government can neither favor religion nor disfavor religion .

I completely support all the cases we ’ve taken in this area , a lot of which have to do with allowing religious symbology in public places .

It may not promote or encourage religion on the one hand , it may not stifle or discriminate against religion on the other hand .

So , when you are talking about a public place , it all depends on what kind of public place it is .
