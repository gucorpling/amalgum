( 3 ) Based on the results , in the self-weight state , there was a relatively large displacement near the support of the bridge and arch crown , causing the thrust line to be located outside the precast panels in the arch crown and the support .

This paper proposes a precast , panel-segmented arch bridge with outriggers that form the cross-section and shape of the arch , in which the precast panel members and outriggers resist the bending moment generated during construction and the compressive force generated during use .

In this study , the stability of the arch bridge was evaluated with respect to the construction step and rise ratio during construction ; the performances of the target arch bridges were determined by conducting a 3D , non-linear , finite element analysis .

( 2 ) Based on 3D structural analysis results of the proposed arch bridge , the stresses in the precast panels and outriggers were in accordance with the thrust line and deformation characteristics based on the behavior of the arch bridge .

Furthermore , the compressive stress of the precast panel and the tensile and compressive stress of the outrigger at the final construction step exhibited structurally stable stress distributions , because of the decreased difference in all of the members .

However , given that the deformation and member forces were very small , the proposed arch bridge was considered to have a stable structural behavior after increasing the construction step number and applying the upper soil mass load .

( 1 ) The proposed precast , panel-segmented arch bridge with outriggers consists of precast panel members subject to compressive force and continuous rib-type outriggers connected to the precast panels that resist the tensile force .

( 4 ) There was a relatively large horizontal displacement in the precast panels near the lower support in the self-weight state , and there was a vertical displacement in the upper crown precast panels .

In this bridge type , the compressive and tensile forces applied to the arch bridge , with respect to the construction step , were efficiently transmitted through the concrete panels and continuous rib-type outriggers .

However , the horizontal displacement in the arch bridge was reduced because of the backfill soil and soil mass load during construction , in addition to the vertical displacement in the arch crown .

The outriggers â€™ tensile and compressive stresses were caused by the horizontal displacement of the arch support and the vertical displacement of the crown in the self-weight state .
