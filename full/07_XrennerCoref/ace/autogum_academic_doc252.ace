For example , H. Ni et al. proposed a new method to achieve structured detection using a spatial light modulator , which modulates the Airy disk amplitude distribution according to the detection function in the collection arm and B. Wang et al. presented confocal microscopy with structured detection in a coherent imaging process to achieve a higher resolution with a comparably large pinhole , however , the systematic geometric errors which adversely affect the relative position and orientation between measuring probes and measurands are usually neglected .

The increasing demands for manufacturing accuracies and quality control due to the rapid development of nanotechnology , ultraprecision machining , micro- , and nanofabrications , etc. and the requirements for precision in surface finishing in different technologies such as additive manufacturing , mechanical parts with structured surfaces , etc. , require the use of increasingly sophisticated measurement systems and measurement traceability from a metrological point of view .
