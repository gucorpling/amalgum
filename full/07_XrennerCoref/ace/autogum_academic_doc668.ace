Polysaccharides with reactive functional groups ( carboxyl ( COOH ) ) , hydroxyl ( OH ) , amide ( NH2 ) , and sulphate groups ( SO4H ) ) are good candidates as carrier matrices . Furcellaran ( FUR ) is structurally connected with the algal polysaccharide κ carrageenan ; however , there is a major structural difference .
