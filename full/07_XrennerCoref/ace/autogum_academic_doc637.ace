In a recent study by Cho et al. , eggs were provided as a choline source , which contained comparable amounts of choline ( 479 mg ) as the herein investigated study products ( choline bitartrate : 620 mg ; Superba Boost TM : 572 mg ) . Cho et al. reported a 1.6-fold increase in free choline after consumption of the egg meal , in comparison to the fruit control meal .

Phosphatidylcholine and/or its isoforms may be absorbed intact and can also be hydrolyzed into phosphatidic acid and free choline by phospholipase D. Due to this conversion step , it supposedly takes longer to obtain free choline from phosphatidylcholine compared to choline bitartrate , where free choline from the salt structure is more rapidly available .

In addition , by implementing the control group , we were able to exclude possible circadian rhythm-dependent variations in choline levels , in contrast to Park et al. , who observed a slight elevation of free choline levels in the afternoon during a 12 h-lasting observation of endogenous choline levels .

It is well known that choline levels are influenced by nutrition , and choline sources depend on the diet , In a normal Western diet , choline can be obtained from eggs , liver , soybeans and pork , where choline is present primarily as phosphatidylcholine .

In the current study we observed a significant increase of choline after single doses of both phosphatidylcholine and the reference product choline bitartrate ; however , phosphatidylcholine was not more efficient , since there were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic endpoints AUC and Cmax .

It was shown that the consumption of a small breakfast led to 25 – 30 % higher choline levels compared to the fasting condition , and that a high choline-containing diet resulted in an up to two-fold increase in plasma choline .

In the literature , endogenous free fasting choline levels under physiological conditions range between 7 – 12 µmol/L , which could be confirmed in the present study with a mean choline concentration of 9.6 µmol/L before product intake .

Results show that free choline levels in plasma were comparable between Superba Boost TM and choline bitartrate , but peak choline concentrations were reached significantly later upon intake of Superba Boost TM compared to choline bitartrate .

Our findings are in agreement with former findings showing that choline levels after choline chloride reached peak levels earlier and were reduced to baseline earlier than after phosphatidylcholine intake , where levels remained elevated for 12 h.
