We have shown that contact hypersensitivity to the commonly used laboratory haptens oxazolone ( Ox ) on the labiar skin or dinitrofluorobenzene ( DNFB ) on the labiar skin or vaginal canal induces persistent tactile genital pain and increased accumulation of mast cells in the labiar tissues of outbred , female ND4 mice well beyond the resolution of visible inflammation .

Here , we repeatedly applied MI dissolved in saline ( a surrogate for water-based cleansers that typically contain MI as a preservative ) topically within the vaginal canals of mice and characterized consequent allergic inflammation , accumulation of mast cells , and ano-genital sensitivity to pressure .

Chemical depletion of labiar mast cells reduced Ox-driven painful responses and therapeutic topical administration of Î”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) in the vaginal canal alleviated DNFB-induced pain and reduced numbers of accumulated mast cells in the affected tissue .

Recent evidence suggests that a significant portion of people exposed to MI developed the capacity for an allergic response , showed exacerbated inflammatory responses , and experienced tissue injury in the skin or lungs after exposure .

Allergic responses to MI have also been linked to vulvar dermatitis , but no connections between such dermatoses and the later development of vulvar pain have been made in the published clinical literature .

Here , we examined the potential of a common household chemical , 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one/methylisothiazolinone ( MI ) , to induce contact hypersensitivity reactions and consequent allergy-driven genital pain in ND4 female outbred mice .

Debilitating , unexplained provoked localized vulvar pain or vulvodynia affects a significant proportion ( ~8 % ) of women and is epidemiologically linked to a history of both seasonal and contact allergies .

We also assessed the effects of therapeutic and preventive administration of topical THC treatments in the vaginal canal on mast cell abundance and painful sensitivity .

To recapitulate and dissect the pathobiology of allergy-driven tactile sensitivity and to inform novel therapies , we established mouse models of allergy-driven genital pain .

We suggest that MI is a plausible candidate for an environmental irritant/allergen , and that exposure to MI might drive allergy-provoked pain .
