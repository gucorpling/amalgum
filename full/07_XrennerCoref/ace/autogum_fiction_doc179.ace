A friend had repeated to me , with great appreciation , a thing or two said to him by a man of distinction , much his senior , and to which a sense akin to that of Strether ’s melancholy eloquence might be imputed — said as chance would have , and so easily might , in Paris , and in a charming old garden attached to a house of art , and on a Sunday afternoon of summer , many persons of great interest being present .

The observation there listened to and gathered up had contained part of the “ note ” that I was to recognise on the spot as to my purpose — had contained in fact the greater part ; the rest was in the place and the time and the scene they sketched : these constituents clustered and combined to give me further support , to give me what I may call the note absolute .

Such is the gist of Strether ’s appeal to the impressed youth , whom he likes and whom he desires to befriend ; the word “ mistake ” occurs several times , it will be seen , in the course of his remarks — which gives the measure of the signal warning he feels attached to his case .

For I think , verily , that there are degrees of merit in subjects — in spite of the fact that to treat even one of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time , for the feverish and prejudiced hour , at least figure its merit and its dignity as possibly absolute .

The situation involved is gathered up betimes , that is in the second chapter of Book Fifth , for the reader ’s benefit , into as few words as possible — planted or “ sunk , ” stiffly and saliently , in the centre of the current , almost perhaps to the obstruction of traffic .

What it comes to , doubtless , is that even among the supremely good — since with such alone is it one ’s theory of one ’s honour to be concerned — there is an ideal beauty of goodness the invoked action of which is to raise the artistic faith to its maximum .

The whole case , in fine , is in Lambert Strether ’s irrepressible outbreak to little Bilham on the Sunday afternoon in Gloriani ’s garden , the candour with which he yields , for his young friend ’s enlightenment , to the charming admonition of that crisis .

The remarks to which he thus gives utterance contain the essence of “ The Ambassadors , ” his fingers close , before he has done , round the stem of the full-blown flower ; which , after that fashion , he continues officiously to present to us .
