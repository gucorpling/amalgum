The initial development charges were not high enough to cover all of the costs of expanded services for these new developments , so it is likely that tax rates would need to be higher for the newer developments , however we also now have a situation where the older developments are undergoing the slow decay of their built infrastructure , which will potentially require a complete overhaul of their services [ primarily water and sewage systems , but also roads and other hard infrastructure ] , which may require the intervention of the Province to assist these communities in undertaking upgrades .

Party in essence , is attempting to bring a measure of direction and purpose back into the Political realm by re-establishing a set of base “ values ” from which we can move forward and agree upon as common goals for human society , and this , I believe , is where the electorate is missing the point .

No. Property taxes are likely not high enough for the new developments , for they are a burden on the downstream ( or upstream ) services [ like the electrical , water and sewer networks ] .
