, it can be seen that the variable , which is the one with the most data , and the variable are the ones with the greatest fluctuations , while the variables and behave in a more linear way and with less variations , although the values of are lower than those of .

In addition , the values of the standard deviation shown in Table 1 confirm that the variability of is similar to the variability of , that the dispersion of the values of and is small , and that there is some similarity between the fluctuations of and the fluctuations of .

Based on the previous figures , at first sight it is observed that the sizes of the six variables under study are different , with having almost double the observations compared to each of the rest of the variables .

When comparing the summary statistics presented in Table 1 with those presented in , it can be said that the difference between both studies is that in , the skewness and kurtosis were not studied .

The lack of normality is reaffirmed for most of the variables , since almost all the kurtosis values are much greater than 3 , in particular the kurtosis values of and .

Here , it has been considered that these graphs will allow a simple comparison between the data and , on the other hand , highlight differences between the variables under study .

However , in this article , it is important to study these third and fourth moments , because it is important to analyze whether the data comes from heavy-tailed distributions .

In accordance with , in this research work , there is a set of data that is going to be analyzed in order to properly interpret the relationships between them .

To perform the analysis , a graph of each of the datasets was first considered , where these were treated as if they were a time series ( see

Furthermore , in this subsection , different types of graphs will be used with the intention of showing a simple transmission of the analysis and conclusions .

The MA technique was used to soften the data of the time series , in order to reduce the influence that each individual data had .

Next , in order to see the trends of the variables under study , the technique of moving average ( MA ) was used .

Finally , the section ends using robust estimators to analyze measures of centralization and dispersion of the data of the variables under study .

Moreover , it can be seen that all the variables present a great lack of normality due to the high skewness values .

According to , heavy-tailed distributions are those probability distributions whose density tails are not bounded by the normal density tails .

In addition , it is observed that the means are higher than the medians in all cases , except for .

The latter is justified by the fact that robust estimators are relatively insensitive to small changes in the data .

All the skewness values shown in Table 1 are positive , so the distributions are lengthened to the right .
