Since natural cyclic peptides are proven to inhibit various proteases , and to consider the beneficial aspects of cyclic peptides in comparison to small chemicals , like less toxicity , no accumulation in organs , and rapid degradation of peptides , we hypothesized that cyclic peptides from natural sources could be an alternative source of therapeutics to inhibit serine protease DPP4 for treatment of diabetes mellitus .
