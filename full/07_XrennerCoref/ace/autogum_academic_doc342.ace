Towards this end , it supplements the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea ( SOLAS ) and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships ( MARPOL ) to account for Arctic-specific safety hazards , such as sea ice , icing , low temperatures , darkness , high latitude , remoteness , the lack of relevant crew experience and difficult weather conditions .

For instance , as per the Polar Code , for a Category A ship to meet FR(s) regarding structural strength , the ship must be constructed in accordance with PC 1 – 5 , whereas a Category B ship must be constructed in accordance with PC 6 – 7 .

Many of the prescriptive regulations of the Polar Code , in particular , those related to a vessel ’s structural strength , include references to the International Association of Classification Societies ’ ( IACS ) Polar Class ( PC ) ice class standards .

Because many of the assumptions are empirically determined , the PC standards can be considered semi-empirical , meaning that they might not be efficient when applied on design and operating conditions different from those for which the assumptions were determined .

A prescriptive design is a design that meets all of the prescriptive regulations associated with the FR(s) , whereas an equivalent design is a design that is approved in accordance with Regulation 4 of SOLAS Chapter XIV .

Per regulation 4 — “ Alternative design and arrangement ” of SOLAS Chapter XIV , where alternative or equivalent designs or arrangements are proposed , they are to be justified by the following IMO Guidelines :

These consist of in total seven PC notations , ranging from PC 1 ( highest ) to PC 7 ( lowest ) , corresponding to various levels of operational capability in ice and hull strength .

For the assessment of design ice loading , the PC standards apply a method based on the principle of the conservation of momentum and energy in collisions , presented by Popov , et al. .

In addition to the ship ’s category , the ice certificate determines detailed operational limits concerning , for instance , the minimum temperature and the worst ice conditions in which a ship can operate .

Because the ship – ice interaction process is complex , stochastic and not fully understood , predicting the level of ice loading that a ship will be exposed to is challenging .

However , to date , none of the existing methods can be considered complete and sufficiently validated to enable them to support direct goal-based structural design following the Polar Code .

Thus , in practice , designers are dependent upon the application of the PC standards to obtain regulatory approval for ships designed for operation in ice-infested waters .
