Kodama says the “ uranium equivalent ” of the radiation from Fukushima amounts to “ 20 Hiroshima bombs ” , while the natural decrease in radioactivity caused by the disaster is far slower than that caused by an atomic bomb : one-tenth against one-thousandth of original levels after a year .

Further criticism was levelled against authorities this week when The New York Times revealed that shortly after the initial disaster Tokyo bureaucrats had failed to warn evacuees in the Tsushima district that wind patterns were blowing radiation spewing from the Fukushima site towards them .

His criticism centered on inadequate radiation measurement methods and the failure to properly protect communities potentially affected by radioactivity from the stricken plant , citing the example of school bus routes passing through areas , such as Iitate-Mura , with unsafe levels of radiation .
