That said , when we 're outside or even inside and there 's a funny noise , he is distracted beyond all control ( including dangling a delicious steak in front of his nose ) .

I have also moved forward from simpe pet training and AKC obedience to more intense high drive sports like PSA , personal protection and do detection ( exp . and narc , etc ) .

Ideally , it 's not a punishment tool ; it is taught with a combination of negative reinforcement and positive reinforcement ( negative and positive has nothing to do with bad or good .

We just want our dog well behaved and responsive to us in distracting situations , which seems like will be damn near impossible given how distracted he can be .

I had been working with and training dogs for over twenty years , yet it was n't until four years ago that I learned how to use an e-collar .

She explained that all the trainers there go through extensive education on proper use , and that they only use it at the lowest threshold where the dog responds .

There 's no degree of waving , jumping around , calling his name , throwing raw steak at him that will get his attention back on you .

However , the idea that we should actually learn how to use equipment instead of just read about it , seemed like a good one .

And while I never even considered that he might go off leash some day , this seems like a real possibility with the e-collar .

Aside from that , I have seen amazing results with aggressive dogs and with an e-collar , dogs can experience so much more freedom .

My point is , positive reinforcement appears to have big limitations with this sweet pup who could n't care less about the positives !

But seriously , help me to decide whether to use an e-collar for OUR dog ! ( Also " transitional leash " )

Our dog does NOT have any aggression issues - he 's extremely sweet , seems submissive , and is generally awesome .

First , the leash-walking part : for that , she recommends using the k9 lifeline transitional leash ( http://www.k9lifeline.net/product/k9-lifeline-training-leash/ ) .
