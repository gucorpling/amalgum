Therefore , Deepwalk is easy to sample into the higher-order proximity range , which makes it impossible to accurately describe the local proximity features of the current node ; LINE does not have the ability to simultaneously sample first-order proximity and second-order proximity , so the algorithm has limitations ; Node2vec uses a random walk based on breadth first search ( BFS ) or depth first search ( DFS ) to explore the neighbor of the node .
