To obtain sufficient association rules that were important and improve the accuracy , the values of min_sup and min_conf should be set to be as large as possible and to obtain as many rules as possible at the same time .

Wholesale and retail , education service , and resident service were the three categories of POI that were most relevant to people â€™s daily life , and they were also the attraction factors for residents .

By analyzing the support values and confidence values , it was that some association rules contained certain categories of POIs , such as catering and corporation , that had high support but low confidence .

The importance of covariates to the PSPs was significantly higher than those of most other the covariates , which shows that PSP had a great impact on the accuracy of the dasymetric mapping .

Those categories of POIs were more likely to have association rules with population gathering points , but the number was small , which means that those association rules were accurate but not important .

This was because many of those POIs had a low proportion of spatial association rules with population aggregation points , which means that those association rules were important but not accurate .
