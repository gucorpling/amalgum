Talk about torpedoes , and he would catch up a pencil , and on the back of an old envelope from his pocket he would sketch out some novel contrivance for piercing a ship ’s netting and getting at her side , which might no doubt involve some technical impossibility , but which would at least be quite plausible and new . Then as he drew , his bristling eyebrows would contract , his small eyes would gleam with excitement , his lips would be pressed together , and he would end by banging on the paper with his open hand , and shouting in his exultation .

As he paced up and down in his jerky quick-stepping fashion after one of these flights of invention , he would take out patents for it , receive you as his partner in the enterprise , have it adopted in every civilised country , see all conceivable applications of it , count up his probable royalties , sketch out the novel methods in which he would invest his gains , and finally retire with the most gigantic fortune that has ever been amassed .

And you would be swept along by his words , and would be carried every foot of the way with him , so that it would come as quite a shock to you when you suddenly fell back to earth again , and found yourself trudging the city street a poor student , with Kirk ’s Physiology under your arm , and hardly the price of your luncheon in your pocket .

The letters of my friend Mr. Stark Munro appear to me to form so connected a whole , and to give so plain an account of some of the troubles which a young man may be called upon to face right away at the outset of his career , that I have handed them over to the gentleman who is about to edit them .

Far from its being an infinite capacity for taking pains , its leading characteristic , as far as I have ever been able to observe it , has been that it allows the possessor of it to attain results by a sort of instinct which other men could only reach by hard work .

But next instant , if you were to express surprise as to how it was that the Egyptian workmen elevated the stones to the top of the pyramids , out would come the pencil and envelope , and he would propound a scheme for doing that with equal energy and conviction .
