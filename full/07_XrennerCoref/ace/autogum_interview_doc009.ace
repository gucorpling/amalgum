" Our work is calling for a complete revision for how we think about the potential for life on Mars , and the work oxygen can do , " he told Scientific American , " implying that if life ever existed on Mars it might have been breathing oxygen " .

Planetary scientist Vlada Stamenković of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and colleagues have developed a new chemical model of how oxygen dissolves in Martian conditions , which raises the possibility of oxygen-rich brines ; enough , the work suggests , to support simple animals such as sponges .

In 2014 , also suggesting multicellular life could exist on Mars , de Vera et al , using the facilities at the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) , studied some lichens , including Pleopsidium chlorophanum , which can grow high up in Antarctic mountain ranges .

The new model indicated these minute traces of oxygen should be able to enter salty seeps of water on or near the planet 's surface at levels high enough to support life forms comparable to Earth 's microbes , possibly even simple sponges .

It has on average only around 0.6 % of the pressure of Earth 's atmosphere , and this is mainly carbon dioxide ; only 0.145 % of the thin Martian atmosphere is oxygen .

Stamenković et al cite research from 2014 showing some simple sponges can survive with only 0.002 moles of oxygen per cubic meter ( 0.064 mg per liter ) .

In their model , they found there can be enough oxygen for microbes throughout Mars , and enough for simple sponges in oases near the poles .

The atmosphere of Mars is far too thin for humans to breathe or for lungs like ours to extract any oxygen at all .

Stamenković et al 's research provides a way for oxygen to get into the Martian brines without algae or photosynthesis .

The lichens can do this because their algal component is able to produce the oxygen needed by the fungal component .
