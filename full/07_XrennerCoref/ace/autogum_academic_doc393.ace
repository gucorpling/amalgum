By applying our proposed approach , the combination of scientometrics and content analysis , the present study has identified that there has been a wealth of research conducted globally focusing on the development of the pharmacotherapeutic , family-based , school-based , and community-based interventions , especially in the last five years .

However , by quantifying different layers of information ( documents by years , citation , and countries where studies conducted ) and applying an advanced analytic technique , the Latent Dirichlet Allocation for titles and abstracts analysis , we could discover the trend and hidden themes of the research studies .

These countries should actively collaborate with other developed countries and countries in the same region ( either through their own government or through the support of neighboring/higher-income countries ) in order to combat their rising rates of overweight and obesity .

The possible causes of this are various , including the Western diet , the low activity level , or regarding the cultural perspective , where obesity means beauty , better health , power , and higher socioeconomic status .

The number of articles related to the treatment and intervention in poor-resource countries were not high compared with that of high-income countries ; meanwhile , the prevalence of obesity and overweight in those settings is increasing .

This study aimed to describe the growth of research publications regarding interventions for childhood overweight and obesity and to understand the current research landscape by grouping publications according to similarities in the topic areas being researched .

By quantifying the scientometrics profile of publications , it is evident that over time , there has been a gradual increase in the publication of research related to interventions and treatments for children with obesity .

However , there were only 121 papers in other languages , which was a quite small number compared with the total number of papers associated with overweight and obesity in children and youth .

However , it should be noticed that the majority of children with overweight and obesity live in lower-setting countries , where the rates are rising faster than in high-income countries .

Yet , due to the limitation in research funding and facilities , human resources , or communication , the contextualized evidence might not be found in the short term .

Moreover , the results highlighted the importance of research support in lower-middle-income countries ( LMICs ) , especially , where the prevalence of childhood obesity has been increased .

Pharmacotherapy is recommended as a combination method when lifestyle intervention and support from a specialist alone are not enough due to extreme excess weight and related chronic conditions .

Thus , LMICs might benefit from the active research collaboration with developed countries or countries in the same region , such as India and China .

Future research should consider expanding to other databases to cover the larger number of publications , which contributes more meaningful knowledge to the research field .

Applying the LDA technique , we found that the number of publications related to school and community-based intervention has increased over the period .

This suggests a definite shift in research towards multifaceted intervention and treatment approaches , particularly those that focus on children â€™s immediate environments .
