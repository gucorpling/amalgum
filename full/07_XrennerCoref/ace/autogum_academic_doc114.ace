The MLIT ’s early “ housing construction five-year program ” , which was based on the mass housing supply plan , focused on improving the residential infrastructure and physical maintenance by considering the indicators of housing quality , including the number of houses available for rent , number of housing units , and spatial size of a house .

The World Health Organization ( WHO ) , Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN-Habitat ) , and Ministry of Land , Infrastructure , Transport and Tourism ( MLIT ) of Japan , among other international organizations , have implemented many measures to improve urban living conditions .

Whereas the aforementioned international indicators emphasize basic quality of life and the eradication of poverty at the national or city level , some international organizations indicate that macro-economic indices do not adequately reflect individuals ’ quality of life ; further , they emphasize neighborhood-level sustainability as an evaluation factor for the judgment criteria of the residential environment .

Apart from emphasizing quantifiable physical dimensions , the OECD stressed the importance of subjective elements such as “ social network support ” and “ life-satisfaction ” in assessing the quality of life and , therefore , included indicators such as happiness , health , social connections , civic engagement and governance , and subjective well-being .

Similarly , the United Kingdom ’s Index of Multiple Deprivation is a governmental assessment tool that monitors the housing environment using indicators related to deprivation levels in terms of income , employment , education , skills , health , and living environment , as well as barriers to the accessibility to housing and services .

Most discussions of the residential environment highlight safety ( such as safety from natural disasters and criminal activities ) not only as one of the most important aspects of residential satisfaction , but also as a particularly crucial aspect of policies for the management of healthy built environments .

Similarly , the Japanese MLIT added the indicators of safety , convenience , comfort , and sustainability to the neighborhood environmental index , which typically assesses microeconomic impacts , with particular emphasis on increasing the community ’s sustainability and reducing the load on the environment .

The value of the residential environment refers to the value of the living environment , including the economic , social , and psychological environment , which extends from the daily life of the family unit to that of the entire human settlement .

To develop a REMI based on the global criterion to evaluate the value of the residential environment , we reviewed relevant international standards based on the concept of sustainable development in terms of environmental , social , and economic aspects .

Further , greater convenience implies improvements in the accessibility of basic facilities necessary for living or the satisfaction of people ’s minimum economic needs , whereas comfort refers to the provision of aesthetic and leisure quality beyond minimum living conditions .
