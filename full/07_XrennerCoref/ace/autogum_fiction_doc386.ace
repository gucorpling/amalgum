For example , how excellent it would be if some reader who is sufficiently rich in experience and the knowledge of life to be acquainted with the sort of characters which I have described herein would annotate in detail the book , without missing a single page , and undertake to read it precisely as though , laying pen and paper before him , he were first to peruse a few pages of the work , and then to recall his own life , and the lives of folk with whom he has come in contact , and everything which he has seen with his own eyes or has heard of from others , and to proceed to annotate , in so far as may tally with his own experience or otherwise , what is set forth in the book , and to jot down the whole exactly as it stands pictured to his memory , and , lastly , to send me the jottings as they may issue from his pen , and to continue doing so until he has covered the entire work ! Yes , he would indeed do me a vital service !

Probably much of what I have described is improbable and does not happen as things customarily happen in Russia ; and the reason for that is that for me to learn all that I have wished to do has been impossible , in that human life is not sufficiently long to become acquainted with even a hundredth part of what takes place within the borders of the Russian Empire .

Him I have taken as a type to show forth the vices and the failings , rather than the merits and the virtues , of the commonplace Russian individual ; and the characters which revolve around him have also been selected for the purpose of demonstrating our national weaknesses and shortcomings .
