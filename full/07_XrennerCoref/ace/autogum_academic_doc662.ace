In the treatment area , this special issue offers an interesting combination of modalities : newly designed pharmaceutical compounds ( nalmefene ) , naturally occurring psychoactive substances ( cannabidiol ) , and non-pharmacological , biological therapies ( rTMS ) . Barrio et al. report the main effectiveness analysis of a phase-IV study conducted among alcohol dependent outpatients taking nalmefene , the only approved medication for alcohol reduction aims .

Digital technologies might be useful to assess brain damage , and they bring us closer to understanding the mechanism(s) underlying addiction . Herreros et al. present a visuomotor rotation task which might be the first step towards developing a useful tool for the detection of cerebellum dysfunction by assessing alterations in implicit learning among chronic cannabis users .
