I 've done end game content in this and other games and I 've raided a bit in this game , but due to factors beyond my control , there are weeks , and sometimes months when my playing partner is not able to play , and so I wait for her , I do n't even run the new content until she 's able to play again .

You can be an omni crafter , you can fish , mine and gather your heart out , you can spend your time playing the mini games , you can spend your time running and re-running the various dungeons , or running whatever FATE you come across , Glamour , Housing , PoTD/Treasure Maps/Eureka/things to come .

So , I do spend a lot of my time on other aspects of the game , and I find it quite a relaxing , enjoyable game with some multiplayer action running things with my friends and chatting while I do some of the less intense activities .

In WoW my raid team is a group of friends that is open to nurturing new raiders , which was how I got started and I doubt finding something similar in XIV would be a Thing except maaaaaybe at the start of an expansion .

On the flip side there are totally casual player who seem to have no aims or goals in the game , and just meander through the game driven only by that which is right in front of them at the moment .

Unfortunately , these players also seem to suffer a kind of burn out , though it might more aptly called a flame-out since it 's as if the flame of interest dies slowly before it really takes hold .

You can set goals like breeding a race chocobo of your desired color with maxed out stats and highest pedigree , or craft every recipe in the game , or even just indulge in market speculation .

Like having a list of things to do on the first and second days after a patch , or logging on after the reset to cap tomes and run the weekly raid .

What is your approach to FFXIV , how do you play , and do you find you are feeling burnout , or are you just chilling and enjoying the world ?

Given how much play time I happily give it , I 'd say it was a bargain compared to most games I have purchased in the last 5 years .

Doing the equivalent of cold-calling and auditioning for statics just jacks up my anxiety super-bad and gives me awful flashbacks of being bad at job-hunting in RL .

Are they raiders who either do n't have the time or are simply not skilled enough to beat the raids within the first month of a patch ?

I see lots of posts on forums about FFXIV talking about serving mid-core players , but I 'm not entirely sure who these mid-core players are .

It 's just that I 'm also a Heroic-level raider in WoW and I feel like I would wear myself doing both that and Savage .

Though I would also add that I do n't like the very driven nature that seems to be an advantage when raiding .

I 've known many players with this style of play and sadly , some have burned out and left the game .

One of the more dominant ( and prominent ) styles of play seems to be all about a very structured approach .

Is the game rich enough to sustain players who do n't raid outside of the ' normal ' versions ?

I play to relax , so I seek to avoid stress , which occurs in abundance in raid content .

So I 'm happy to just do my Expert roulettes and sometimes poke at an EX primal .
