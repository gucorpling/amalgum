Additional aspects of the maneuver can be added to help Car A. For example , before the tap into Car B 's rear quarter , easing off the throttle ( or even using the brake a bit ) at the same time as the turn-in , will increase front tire down-force and increase traction for a very short period of time , which can add lateral velocity into Car B.

At speeds greater than , Car B requires not much more than a good strong kiss from Car A. At speeds closer to , Car A may need to sacrifice a bit of the front-end of the car to give a strong slam to the rear of Car B.

Successfully performing this technique will depend a good deal on the driving abilities of Car B. If Car B is aware of Car A , avoiding the lateral force by simple swerves is possible ( professional PIT Maneuver training may also include evading the PIT Maneuver ) .
