The impact of different IAS on the provision of ecosystem services is considered negative , listing these more important effects — they hinder land use , thus limiting food production , replace natural ecosystems as barriers for many human pathogens to their easier dissemination , attract native pollinator species , thus decreasing their activity on native plant species , colonize water banks , and are ineffective in coastal stabilization , and reduce recreational and tourist benefits .

Invasive tree species are common in urban forests , and are likely to remain so due to low effectiveness of removal actions , yet little is known concerning their perception as a component of natural vegetation remnants or regenerating forms .

Many plants , now declared as invasive species , were deliberately introduced to urban recreational areas due to their aesthetic values , and despite any ecosystem services lost services , such as use in medicine or biofuels , may occur .

More and more studies also reveal an increasing demand from city residents for “ less ordered ” green areas providing the possibility to experience nature more directly than the traditional urban green spaces , such as parks , can offer .

Despite remaining under strong anthropogenic pressure , including land-use change , pollution , lack of cyclic flooding , human trampling , or the introduction of non-indigenous organisms , riparian ecosystems generate multiple important services for the city residents .

Even less is known about ecosystem services in riparian forests due to their scarcity and the difficulties in recreational potential assessment , and the socio-cultural context of the human perception of invasive species is also very poorly understood .

Invasive plant species ( IAS ) not only severely alter the biodiversity of the areas they colonize , but can also alter the ecosystem services provisioning by those areas .
