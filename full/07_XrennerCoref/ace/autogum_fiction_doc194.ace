But now surround this picture by the Mediterranean , and a burning sky , imagine a few palms here and there , a few stunted evergreen trees mingling their waving leaves with the motionless flowers and foliage of carved stone ; look out over the reef with its white fringes of foam in contrast to the sapphire sea ; and then turn to the city , with its galleries and terraces whither the townsfolk come to take the air among their flowers of an evening , above the houses and the tops of the trees in their little gardens ; add a few sails down in the harbour ; and lastly , in the stillness of falling night , listen to the organ music , the chanting of the services , the wonderful sound of bells pealing out over the open sea .

Buried away in the loneliest valleys , hanging in mid-air on the steepest mountainsides , set down on the brink of precipices , in every place man has sought for the poetry of the Infinite , the solemn awe of Silence ; in every place man has striven to draw closer to God , seeking Him on mountain peaks , in the depths below the crags , at the cliff ’s edge ; and everywhere man has found God .

Almost every religious house in the Peninsula , or in Europe for that matter , was either destroyed or disorganized by the outbreak of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars ; but as this island was protected through those times by the English fleet , its wealthy convent and peaceable inhabitants were secure from the general trouble and spoliation .

In the minds of the Roman Catholic world , the convent stood out pre-eminent for a stern discipline which nothing had changed ; the purity of its rule had attracted unhappy women from the furthest parts of Europe , women deprived of all human ties , sighing after the long suicide accomplished in the breast of God .

But nowhere , save on this half-European , half-African ledge of rock could you find so many different harmonies , combining so to raise the soul , that the sharpest pain comes to be like other memories ; the strongest impressions are dulled , till the sorrows of life are laid to rest in the depths .

If the rumour of the Emperor ’s name so much as reached the shore of the island , it is doubtful whether the holy women kneeling in the cloisters grasped the reality of his dream-like progress of glory , or the majesty that blazed in flame across kingdom after kingdom during his meteor life .

The sight of such a city , with its close-huddled roofs , arranged for the most part amphitheatre-wise above a picturesque harbour , and crowned by a glorious cathedral front with triple-arched Gothic doorways , belfry towers , and filigree spires , is a spectacle surely in every way the sublimest on earth .

Inside , the nave and its little side galleries are lighted entirely by the great stained-glass rose-window suspended by a miracle of art above the centre doorway ; for upon that side the exposure permits of the display of lacework in stone and of other beauties peculiar to the style improperly called Gothic .

For some reason , probably because the winds are so high , the architect was unable to build the flying buttresses and intervening chapels which adorn almost all cathedrals , nor are there openings of any kind in the walls which support the weight of the roof .
