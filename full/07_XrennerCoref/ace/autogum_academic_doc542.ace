Indeed , although in the last years , many efforts have been devoted to improve the performance of pedestrian detection , baseline methods cannot be always applied in crowded contexts because of scarce labeled data , and intrinsic differences with respect to the sparse case which may be cause of imprecision in the final detection results .

Recently , an ensemble-based method relying on the use of dropout at inference time has been proposed in ( Monte Carlo dropout ) , allowing to obtain several realizations sampled from the same network with randomly dropped-out units at test time , from which a confidence measure on the prediction can be derived .

Most of the existing works are devoted to finding the best network for applications for which huge datasets exist , but few attention is given to specific real-setting problems where training data are hard to obtain and therefore out-of-the-box networks may be impossible to be trained .

To this extent Bayesian Neural Networks ( BNNs , Bayesian NNs ) offer a probabilistic interpretation of deep learning models by inferring distributions over the models ’ weights , allowing to measure model uncertainty , but they are usually practically limited .

There exists indeed a large variability in the local and global pedestrians ’ appearance , due to the variety of possible body shapes , or different styles and types of clothes and accessories which may alter the silhouettes of the individuals .

A solution proposed for instance by in the case of hyperspectral data is to reduce the number of weight parameters required to train the model by considering some constraints related to the physical interpretation of the weights .

In this work , the type of the data ( grayscale images ) is not suitable for such prior constraints , we propose the use of an ensemble method that is justified according to two different reasons .

Even though deep learning solutions tend to outperform the other supervised learning techniques when trained on large amounts of data , applying them effectively in presence of few labeled data is nowadays an open issue .

Simultaneously , a criticism that is often made of deep learning methods is the fact that they act like “ black-boxes ” , making it hard for their users to interpret the obtained results .

Following this line of work , we intend to investigate the use of deep learning techniques in presence of small training datasets for specific applications ( in our case high-density crowd pedestrian detection ) .

Nonetheless , in recent years , many regularization techniques have been proposed to tackle the problem of overfitting , from data augmentation to early stopping and dropout , besides the traditional weight decay .

Besides , in real-world scenarios several people can occupy the same region , partially occluding each other , and this phenomenon becomes more prevalent as the crowd density increases .

Firstly , it acts as another regularization technique to mitigate the risk of overfitting ; secondly , it allows us to measure the model confidence about each prediction .

To this extent , we propose to work in the context of the Belief Function Theory ( BFT ) to better leverage the classifier ’s unique properties .

The evidential framework is indeed able to naturally model the concept of imprecision in addition to the uncertainty value provided by the classifiers .

This limitation is highly relevant when learning from small amounts of data , where a measure of model uncertainty would be particularly important .

We thus propose an evidential Multiple Classifier System ( MCS ) , which is in turn composed by two ensembles of classifiers .
