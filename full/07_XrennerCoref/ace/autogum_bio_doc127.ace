Nevertheless , Vanuatu also pursued a diplomatic approach to resolving the situation , in which Bayer played a large role : a Vanuatu delegation headed by Bayer went to the U.S. and met with International Monetary Fund , U.S. State Department , and Federal Reserve System officials in January 2000 to discuss details of Vanuatu 's anti-money laundering laws and practices , and arranged for reciprocal visits by State Department and Financial Action Task Force officials to Port Vila in the following months .

Bayer was critical of this response , noting that Vanuatu had criminalised money laundering as early as 1989 , and voiced his suspicions that both the U.S. government and U.S. banks were insincere in their desire to crack down on money laundering , but rather had turned their attention to Vanuatu because it was a small and distant target , and one of the few offshore financial centres which was not a dependency of major foreign powers .

In March 2013 , new Minister of Finance Charlot Salawai , who succeeded to the position after Carcasses lost his seat in the October 2012 elections , attempted to remove Bayer from the RBV board , claiming that he was an agent of European Bank and was thus disqualified from serving under the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu Act Section 8(10)(b ) .

His relocation came just as the groundwork was being laid for the islands ' independence from the United Kingdom and France ; [ 3 ] when Vanuatu became independent in 1980 and asked prominent members of society to take Vanuatu citizenship , Bayer chose to accept in 1982 , giving up U.S. citizenship in the process .

This was part of a larger wave of concern about financial institutions in the South Pacific which led a number of U.S. banks , including the Bank of New York and JP Morgan Chase , to suspend dollar transactions not just with Vanuatu but Nauru and Palau and eventually Niue as well . [ 9 ]

The following month , after the collapse of the Sato Kilman government in whose cabinet Salawai served , and the election of Carcasses ( who had since crossed the floor ) as Prime Minister , RBV Governor Odo Tevi himself was removed after more than ten years in his position .

Members of Parliament expressed differing opinions on the issue : Robert Bohn Sikol stated that " Tevi had done a good job and was not sacked " , whereas Leader of the Opposition Ham Lini described it as retaliation for Bayer 's removal . [ 21 ]

Bayer was confident that the charges would be thrown out , stating in January 2003 that the charge of money laundering was being applied to actions that were nothing more than " normal banking business " . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]

Bayer described the dismissal as illegal and Salawai 's claim as misleading and defamatory as he had not been a board member of European Bank for more than a decade , and suggested that the move was tied to party politics . [ 20 ]
