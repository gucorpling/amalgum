Patients with T2DM tend to have higher FLI scores , but in this study , we could demonstrate that the fasting intervention was equally effective in T2DM patients and in non-diabetic subjects in terms of FLI , although the improvement of other parameters ( e. g. , HDL , LDL , and AP ) was not as complete .

The key mechanism responsible for many of these beneficial effects is the metabolic switch from the utilization of glycogenolysis-derived glucose to fatty acids and fatty acid-derived ketones , i. e. , a fundamental switch from lipid synthesis and fat storage to mobilization of fat in the form of free fatty acids and fatty acid-derived ketones .

In contrast , no severe adverse events were found in a cohort of 1422 subjects treated with a periodic fasting lasting 4 â€“ 21 days , . Michalsen et al. evaluated the acceptance , safety , effects on health-related outcomes , and lifestyle adherence of fasting therapy in different chronic internal diseases .

Our results supported a correlation between changes in FLI and changes in liver enzymes ( GGT , and GOT ) and lipid parameters ( TG ) after fasting intervention , although this was limited to subjects without T2DM .

Indeed , in nearly half of the subjects in the highest risk category ( FLI > 60 ) , a BMI reduction of less than 5 % was sufficient to induce a shift to a lower risk category .
