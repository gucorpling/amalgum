The confusion matrix is also a way to measure the classifier ’s performance , and its form is as follows : ( 25 ) where represents the percentage of cases where fault i classified as fault j by classifier k . c is the number of base classifiers , and t is the number of fault classes .

To measure the classification performance , four evaluation indicators were used : ( 21 ) ( 22 ) ( 23 ) where t is the number of fault classes . ( 24 ) where P is the precision and R is the recall rate .

This not only avoids the shortcomings of the original voting method , which does not consider the difference in performance of each classifier on different faults , but also enhances the impact of the classifiers with good performance in terms of voting results .

Different from the conventional voting method , the fusion results given by the improved voting method are no longer crisp ( i. e. , either 0 or 1 ) , but they take values in the interval of 0 – 1 .

In summary , the proposed decision fusion system uses multiple performance evaluation indicators to measure the performance of the base classifier and determine the combined weights based on AHP and EW-TOPSIS for the base classifiers under these indicators .
