I would say , if I were in your shoes , one interesting question I would ask of everyone here is , when did you feel , what do you feel was the inflection point , the turning point , in the growth of the community in your country — like , was there an event , or was there a — like , not necessarily even a Wikimedia event , like maybe it was , you know , the National Elections of 2008 — was there something that you feel triggered a lot of growth , was there a moment where you feel , yeah there was all of the history up to that point , and then there was growth .

More generally , I really appreciate their successful transition with the new Executive Director , who has been able to assume all of the responsibilities , including , crucially , their submission to the FDC [ Funds Dissemination Committee ] process like their proposal which was good as we have just learned this weekend when the FDC published its recommendations which are granting Wikimedia Argentina practically the budget that they requested .

I like that they are working ... they are not just doing , you know , the Wikipedia education program — going to classrooms , having students write articles — but they are collaborating with other external non-Wikimedia organizations towards free culture and free knowledge .

It would be interesting to learn from all our colleagues here what that moment was for them , if they can think of one , and then see if some of those stories may be relevant for Costa Rica .

Other than that , there 's just the general solutions for all in our movement : trying to have regular meet-ups , trying to collaborate with allies groups like free software groups .

These are more generally solutions , but specifically to learn from Iberocoop I would ask people to think about their early stages and see if they can offer you some advice .

Which is a very strong positive signal from the FDC that Wikimedia Argentina is on the right track , its programmatic approach is good and its planning is solid .

So that 's good ; and they did this in a fairly short schedule after there was some uncertainty about who would host the conference .

Most specifically , I would say Wikimedia Argentina has some interesting partnerships , these educational partnerships that we have heard about yesterday are promising .

What should Costa Rica learn from Iberocoop to reach the same degrees of success that have reached the rest of the chapters ?

I am from Costa Rica , and Costa Rica is the smallest of the groups represented during this Iberoconf .

So that they are not bound only by the volunteers you have but they also leverage the external part .
