Following the return of the Stardust space capsule from its encounter with the Comet Wild 2 , NASA scientists have come up with a novel approach to dealing with the samples of " interstellar dust " that have been collected ; they want help from the public .

Only one side of the collector was exposed towards the stream of particles coming off the Comet Wild 2 during the encounter in 2004 , while the other side was used to collect interstellar dust at an earlier point in the spacecraft 's journey .

Although scientists have seen the particles captured from comet Wild 2 when they examined the aerogel , they have not examined any of the particles expected on the other side of the collector due to their smallness .

Stardust set a new all-time record for being the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth , breaking the previous record set in May of 1969 during the return of the Apollo X ( 10 ) command module .
