The responding quantity , which is defined as the governor free response quantity ( GFRQ ) , is evaluated by the difference between outputs before and after the disturbance using the Equation ( 1 ) : ( 1 ) where is the time of a disturbance , is the time of reaching 59.8 Hz after the disturbance , and is the power at time .

The frequency control services consist of primary and secondary frequency control , which are provided by the resources ’ local responses and the automatic generation control ( AGC ) central response , respectively , as shown in Table 1 .

By doing that , the thermal generator can increase the generation level , and the system marginal price ( SMP ) will be reduced by excluding high-cost generators in the electricity market .

As the frequency is a major parameter indicating the balance between generation and demand of a power system , it is controlled in the Korean power system by providing frequency control services .

The primary frequency control is the frequency response provided mainly by the generator ’s governor , and ESS was permitted to participate in the primary frequency control service in 2015 .

The secondary frequency control is provided by participating resources ’ responses to the AGC frequency control signal , which are determined by the energy management system ( EMS ) .

Presently , the proposed control strategy has been implemented in a 376-MW BESS installed at 13 substations to provide both virtual inertia response and primary frequency response .

In addition , in the Korean power system , the frequency response is evaluated by using two indices , the speed droop and the response quantity .

The proposed control strategy is loaded in the individual control unit , where four power conversion systems ( PCS ) are dispatched , as shown in

According to the plan , a BESS of 376 MW is being operated commercially to provide the frequency response by KEPCO in 13 substations .

The main purpose of MW-scale BESS is substituting the existing primary frequency response reserves from a thermal generator , which has low generation cost .

The speed droop is evaluated by calculating the ratio of the responding amount of a generator power to the frequency change in percentage .

Therefore , the BESS can provide the needed frequency response by injecting the power into the power system just after the disturbance .

ESS was permitted to participate in the secondary frequency control service in 2016 , but it is not yet participating .

Furthermore , the BESS can provide or absorb the power within 200 ms , considering the communication delay .
