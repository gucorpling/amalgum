Eosinophils are equipped with granules carrying a plethora of cytotoxic mediators , such as the cationic proteins major basic protein ( MBP ) , eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP ) , eosinophil peroxidase ( EPX ) , and granzymes ( granzyme-A in human cells , granzyme-B in murine cells ) that can destroy target cells or tissues .

By using a panel of tumor cell lines , we show that IL-33 promotes tumoricidal functions of eosinophils in vitro and in vivo in a cell adhesion-dependent manner , through the integrin CD11b/CD18 and by inducing lytic granule convergence to the immune synapse .

During certain inflammatory conditions ( i. e. , allergies , parasitic infections , autoimmune diseases ) eosinophils can rapidly increase , due to both de novo generation from bone marrow precursors and proliferation of tissue-resident cells , infiltrating inflamed tissues , including tumors .

IL-33 is an epithelial-derived “ alarmin ” playing multiple functions in Th2-related immunopathologies and recently implied in cancer immunity , exerting pro- or anti-tumoral activities , depending on the tumor type and microenvironmental factors .

Indeed , eosinophils were shown to directly kill human colon carcinoma cells via release of granzyme-A in a mechanism dependent on the integrin CD11a/CD18 and on the cytokine IL-18 .
