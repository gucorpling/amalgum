Every one of his compositions has been based upon ideas more or less novel , which , as it seemed to him , needed literary expression ; he can claim priority for certain forms and for certain ideas which have since passed into the domain of literature , and have there , in some instances , become common property ; so that the date of the first publication of each Study cannot be a matter of indifference to those of his readers who would fain do him justice .

Add to the list many delicately scrupulous persons eager to buy landed property beyond their means , who calculate with dry logic and in cold blood the probable duration of the life of a father or of a step-mother , some old man or woman of eighty or ninety , saying to themselves , " I shall be sure to come in for it in three years ' time , and then -- -- " A murderer is less loathsome to us than a spy .

There are men who put the weight of a coffin into their deliberations as they bargain for Cashmere shawls for their wives , as they go up the staircase of a theatre , or think of going to the Bouffons , or of setting up a carriage ; who are murderers in thought when dear ones , with the irresistible charm of innocence , hold up childish foreheads to be kissed with a " Good-night , father !

Picture to yourself the state of mind of a man who must pay a life annuity to some old woman whom he scarcely knows ; both live in the country with a brook between them , both sides are free to hate cordially , without offending against the social conventions that require two brothers to wear a mask if the older will succeed to the entail , and the other to the fortune of a younger son .

When you have read the account of Don Juan 's decorous parricide , try to picture to yourself the part which would be played under very similar circumstances by honest folk who , in this nineteenth century , will take a man 's money and undertake to pay him a life annuity on the faith of a chill , or let a house to an ancient lady for the term of her natural life !
