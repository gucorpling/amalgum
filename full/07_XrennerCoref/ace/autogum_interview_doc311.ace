I think it would be difficult to rely solely — or even primarily — on Wikinews , because I do n't think it is yet particularly comprehensive ; I do n't know if it ever will be .

But it makes sense to me that Wikinews would reflect the interests of the people who edit it , which I imagine is one of the reasons it ( and the other WMF projects ) are successful .

Which means , in theory , that you can cover lots of stories when there are lots of stories to cover , and do very little , when there is n't much going on .

I think it used to be the case that there was X amount of shelf space for news — like , 40 pages of newsprint daily , or 22 minutes of television time .

So if a media outlet has a reporter in Johannesburg , they get a lot of news out of South Africa , whether or not anything particularly interested is happening there .

Matt : Do you think the reason for this is wikigroaning , such as more topics are written in focused areas rather than things of interest to the most people ?

What I think changes — theoretically — with Wikinews , is that you are freed of both those constraints .

And when there is a big story , lots of people come here to help , I assume .

We got great cooperation on some big stories like the UK attacks , did big media notice ?
