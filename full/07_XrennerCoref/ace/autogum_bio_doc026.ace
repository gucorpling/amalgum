In 2011 she studied the subspecies of C. pipiens , which is known as Culex pipiens pallens as well as other members of the genus Culex : C. quinquefasciatus , C. australicus , and C. globocoxitus and issued a verdict that Culex pipiens is the only species that transmits arboviruses and filariasis .
