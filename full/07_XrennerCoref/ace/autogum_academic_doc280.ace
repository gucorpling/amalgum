However , one reason the DP strategy for pricing sports tickets has been studied extensively is due to interest in different kinds of factors , such as current position in the league standings or weather conditions , in order to price the tickets .

As is evident , teams tend to hold on to their season ticket holders by offering a lower price ; a future study involving season ticket transactions and DP is required to find the optimal fixed price for season tickets .

. when the demand for tickets is relatively low , it is optimal for the club to retain 20 – 40 % of the tickets and the rest of the capacity should be sold to online retailers .

In the real world , this pricing technique has been used by football clubs and thus the secondary market online retailers like Ticketmaster and Vivid Seats have become popular in the last decade .

On the other hand , as the demand fluctuates the capacity allocation is an important factor and a hard mathematical problem for the club to maximize its revenues from ticket sales .

Thus , the retailer will have a differentiated strategy and the overall supply chain needs to be considered for the benefit of the club and the online retailer .

A further scope of research would be to consider sales from both the club and the retailer ’s perspective and maximize the revenue of the supply chain .

The online retailer might not be able to sell all the tickets , in which case a salvage value can be considered if the ticket is unsold .

An evaluation of other sports clubs for different games in other leagues might reveal different demand functions , which are the core element of a DP model .

11,13 organization|15,18 abstract|21,28 abstract|25,28 abstract

However , if the home game is either medium or low ranked then at least nine different demand functions need to be considered for all game types .

As mentioned in the introduction , several previous researches have pointed out to the fact that loyal fans are not always deterred by high ticket prices .
1,2 person
4,6 abstract|7,10 event|14,16 abstract|17,19 person|24,27 abstract

The results depict that for a high intensity game , the demand is generally high and thus the club should sell all the tickets by itself .

Based on the calculated demand functions , it is established that the application of DP strategies would generate more revenues than the optimal fixed price .

This would provide a more detailed analysis of how the capacity distribution of tickets should be allocated by the club to maximize its revenues .

Therefore , the study contributes to the existing literature by analyzing a pricing approach that is applicable in the field of online ticket sales .

Hence , future research could extend the findings from the current study by analyzing a larger data set involving multiple teams and multiple games .

The current study uses the mathematical principle of DP combined with empirical data to determine the demand functions for university football game tickets .

Second , the designed DP model is based on only five demand functions , one for each home game played by the university .

The present dataset does not contain transactions on season tickets ; thus , the present study is limited to only individual transactions .

It has been shown that it is not always optimal for a club to sell the entire capacity of tickets by itself .

Getting involved with a retailer can be beneficial if the club can earn a commission based on the sales from the retailer .

However , the main result of DP for generating maximum revenues should not change when different seat types are considered .

Prices for different zones and seat types may yield different result in terms of distribution of the capacity .

Due to this fact , several researchers have reported a positive correlation of game attendance with ticket prices .

Finally , the present study considers only one type of seats for simplicity for pricing the tickets .
