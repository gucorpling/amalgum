An intra-reconfigurable robot can be viewed as a collection of components ( sensors , actuators , mechanical parts , power sources , controllers , etc. ) acting as a single entity while having the ability to change , for instance , its structure , mobility , or principal activity without requiring any external assembly or disassembly .

It was based on the theory of hinged dissection of polyominoes as reported in and was inspired from the tile-matching puzzle video game called “ Tetris ” , which consists of four identical square blocks that can transform into seven shapes , therefore named as hinged-Tetro .
