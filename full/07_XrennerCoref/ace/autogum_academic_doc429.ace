There are at least seven haplotypes of V. destructor identified based on a 458 bp fragment of the mitochondrial CO-I gene , including Korea , Japan/Thailand , Nepal , Vietnam , China , China 2 , and Sri Lanka haplotypes , and much greater genetic variation among V. destructor ( 18 haplotypes ) has been revealed using the concatenated mtDNA sequences ( 2700 bp ) .

These findings suggest that the genetic variation among Varroa mites themselves might determine their reproductive capability on worker brood hosts , and mites of different haplotypes show varying reproductive capability on the worker brood of the same honey bee species , but further studies are needed to confirm this .

Interestingly , the mites that reproduced on A. cerana worker brood were either the Korea haplotype or the Japan/Thailand haplotype , which are found to infest A. mellifera ; while those that were considered sterile on the A. cerana worker brood were neither Korea haplotype nor Japan/Thailand haplotype .

On the other hand , Varroa mites derived from A. cerana colonies in southwestern China and northern Vietnam , which were both identified to be Vietnam haplotype , were almost infertile in the worker cells of local A. mellifera colonies after artificial inoculation .

By providing the essential pollination services for crops and wild plants , honey bees play a vital role in the sustainable development of modern agricultural industries and the global ecosystem , and produce a wide range of benefits for human well-being .

Unlike in its original host , V. destructor has posed a deadly threat to the survival of the new host A. mellifera , which lacks the resistant mechanisms as seen in A. cerana , due to long-term coevolution .

The ability to reproduce on worker brood emerges as a critical adaption to the new host , remarkably facilitating the development of Varroa population and causing greater damage to A. mellifera colonies .

Drone brood cells are more attractive to mites compared to worker brood , but much less available in natural colonies , as they are reared only during swarming season .
