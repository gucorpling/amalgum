Based on the findings , as CTR management and village residents share a preference for low-impact tourism , in the long run , it may be useful to examine the possible strategy of tourism being managed by an autonomous agency with the support of community-based institutions , the forest department , and NGOs .

In response to the turmoil in tourism development , as custodians of national parks and its adjoining areas , the local authorities should not allow any new construction in the ecologically sensitive vicinity of CTR , and action should be taken against illegal , unauthorized activities at holiday resorts .

Similarly , as suggested by Ballantyne , Packer , and Hughes , wildlife tourism management practices that enlist tourists as conservation partners , communicate the reasons behind any constraints imposed , and present a consistent message regarding interactions with wildlife are likely to be successful in reducing environmental transgressions .

Hence , it is vital to strengthen the communicative message about the park ’s conservation efforts on the ecosystem to allow tourists to utilize the best of the resources provided by the park , which , consequently , will boost the tourist ’s attachment to the park .

Since most local tourism providers seem to be environmental offenders , policymakers need to introduce a new destination development strategy that promotes ethical and ‘ uncompromised ’ development by bringing the entire CTR region under strict environmental regulations and by enforcing sustained vigilant monitoring .

About the tourist ’s attitudes , priority needs to be given towards transformation of tourists ’ attitudes , from ‘ individuals ’ just seeking thrill and leisure to ‘ eco-tourists ’ who leave national parks with an appreciation for the environment and iconic species .

Since deviant behavior is generally caused due to ignorance of laws and lack of social pressures , it could be countered by offering guidelines or codes of conduct for tourists through effective communication that informs tourists of the negative health consequences of these actions .

Therefore , the park should stage the tourist experience as one that tourists are visiting an iconic tourist destination that is a national treasure ; thus , the responsibility of exhibiting environmental compliance falls on them .

Meanwhile , park staffs must strictly prohibit littering in and around CTR by issuing penalties against littering , and they should have more display/message boards and interpretation centers to enhance environmental awareness amongst tourists .

Local authorities should adopt conservationist views , leading to restrictions on tourism development and putting in place harsher restrictions on the number of vehicles that can operate in and around CTR .

In regard to deviant tourist behavior , in agreement with the literature , respondents also confirm that to reduce deviant behaviors , the number of tourists needs to be regulated .

Park authorities , the local municipality , local tourism providers , communities , and tourists have been identified as critical stakeholders that must contribute towards a reduction in environmental transgressions .

This study finds that returned tourists have developed an attachment to the park by experiencing a sense of awe and appreciation for nature during their multiple visits to the park .

Further , evoking an emotional bond ( i. e. , place attachment ) with the park is a viable way to curb a tourist ’s environmental transgression .

Additionally , results also point towards strengthening locally active NGOs to escalate their environmental advocacy efforts towards reducing negative impacts of tourism activities in and around CTR .

While more overt enforcement could be applied to address behaviors inside national parks , complementary efforts could begin in private hotels and guest houses outside CTR .

However , respondents are also of the opinion that time allowed inside the park should be relaxed to enhance appreciation for nature and place attachment .
