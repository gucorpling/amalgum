The exerted biting force in vertical direction must overcome the resistance force of the tongue prototypes . Gay et al. reported the maximum biting force in ten different subjects are between 25 to 400 N , which are significantly greater force values than the maximum resistance force ( i. e. , ~2 N ) that was measured in our prosthetic tongue devices .

The tongue strengths of our prototype shown in this study ranged from 6 to 12 kPa depending on the design of prototype , such as the angle and geometry of guiding tubes , as well as the type of measurement systems ( i. e. , IOPI and MOST ) .

Mastication is complicated and thus the exerted biting force is not constant ; biting force is an indicator of the masticatory system and is dependent on the gender , age , craniofacial morphology , type of the food , and the measurement techniques .

While the pressure exerted by the prosthetic device is an important design factor to be considered , the device should have a low-profile design that has a sufficient spring-back force to recover the nitinol strips original geometry when the biting force is removed .

The aim of the development of the TPAD was to augment the function of the impaired tongue by additional force on the food bolus to elevate it towards the palate and direct it posteriorly from the mouth to the pharynx .

While the device worked properly with cadavers , additional ceramic materials were added to stabilize the device on the mandible in these specimens , since the teeth were irregular , and some were missing .

The tongue plays a significant role in swallowing , through preparing the bolus of food and pushing it posteriorly in order to transfer it from the oral to the pharyngeal phase of swallowing .

The first reason was that the cadaver model was not sufficiently soft and easy to manipulate to apply for the vertical direction biting force to the device mimicking human jaw motion .

The second reason was that the central area of the prototype ( i. e. , bulging region ) was difficult to align with the placed pressure sensors during the measurement .

The movements of the native tongue and pharynx are complex and coordinated , so the simplistic elevation movement of our device was only a partial mimic .
