Well , while at JSC I learned that they mostly want Engineers , and a few science grads , and I worry that my computer science degree with not be very valuable , as the NASA rep told me only 1 % of the applicants for their work study program are CS majors .

NASA has some analytical capabilities , particularly at JSC , but the vast majority of the analytical capability in the community is not at NASA but is at universities , government labs and other institutions all over the world .

For example , some of the most important science is done by measuring the relative abundances of isotopes in samples , and these are not affected ( at least not much ) by capture into aerogel .

I 'm just curious as to your thoughts on if CS majors will be more in demand now that projects like Stardust and the Mars missions have been great successes ?

I should also point out that practically every analytical technique is destructive at some level . ( There are a few exceptions , but not many . )
