When Monte Cristo entered the boudoir , to which we have already once introduced our readers , and where the baroness was examining some drawings , which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them with M. Cavalcanti , his presence soon produced its usual effect , and it was with smiles that the baroness received the count , although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name .

Eugénie bowed coldly to the count , and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study , whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured Monte Cristo that Mademoiselle Danglars preferred to his society and to that of M. Cavalcanti the company of Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly , her singing teacher .

Cavalcanti , dressed in black , like one of Goethe ’s heroes , with varnished shoes and white silk open-worked stockings , passed a white and tolerably nice-looking hand through his light hair , and so displayed a sparkling diamond , that in spite of Monte Cristo ’s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger .

It was then , especially while conversing with Madame Danglars , and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation , that the count noticed M. Andrea Cavalcanti ’s solicitude , his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass , and of manifesting his admiration .

If he did not come , the painful sensation became most intense ; if , on the contrary , he appeared , his noble countenance , his brilliant eyes , his amiability , his polite attention even towards Madame Danglars , soon dispelled every impression of fear .

It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her ; besides , the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end — useless injury is repugnant to every mind .

She was somewhat beautiful , and exquisitely formed — a little fairy-like figure , with large curls falling on her neck , which was rather too long , as Perugino sometimes makes his Virgins , and her eyes dull from fatigue .
