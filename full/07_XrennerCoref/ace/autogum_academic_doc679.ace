The following three questions will be studied : ( 1 ) What are the characteristics of the spatial distribution of Chinese scientists at different development stages ? ( 2 ) What is the structure of their flow network ? ( 3 ) What factors drive the flow of Chinese scientists ? Based on data sourced from the academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CAS ) and the Chinese Academy of Engineering ( CAE ) at different development stages , this paper uses spatial statistics , social network approaches and visualization software to study the issues above .

As outstanding representatives of China ’s top innovative talents and scientists , academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences ( CAS ) and Chinese Academy of Engineering ( CAE ) embody China ’s highest level of science and technology , so agglomeration areas of CAS and CAE academicians are bound to be dominant in the competition for technological innovation .
