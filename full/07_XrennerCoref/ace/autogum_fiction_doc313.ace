There was a muffled rushing in the snow ; and in a good hour for Dick , who saw the sword-points glitter already at his throat , there poured forth out of the wood upon both sides a disorderly torrent of mounted men-at-arms , each cased in iron , and with visor lowered , each bearing his lance in rest , or his sword bared and raised , and each carrying , so to speak , a passenger , in the shape of an archer or page , who leaped one after another from their perches , and had presently doubled the array .

Dick had crossed the greater part of the open ground between Shoreby and the forest , and had reached the bottom of the little hill , some hundred yards below the Cross of St. Bride , when , through the stillness of the black morn , there rang forth the note of a trumpet , so shrill , clear , and piercing , that he thought he had never heard the match of it for audibility .

Four against one , the steel flashed about him in the starlight ; the sparks flew fiercely ; one of the men opposed to him fell -- in the stir of the fight he hardly knew why ; then he himself was struck across the head , and though the steel cap below his hood protected him , the blow beat him down upon one knee , with a brain whirling like a windmill sail .

There were seven or eight assailants , and but one to keep head against them ; but so active and dexterous was this one , so desperately did he charge and scatter his opponents , so deftly keep his footing on the ice , that already , before Dick could intervene , he had slain one , wounded another , and kept the whole in check .

Dick , returning this scrutiny , was surprised to find in one who had displayed such strength , skill and energy , a lad no older than himself -- slightly deformed , with one shoulder higher than the other , and of a pale , painful , and distorted countenance . { 2 } The eyes , however , were very clear and bold .

Next moment , indeed , his foes were on him , and he was once more charging and fleeing , leaping , stabbing , dropping to his knee , and using indifferently sword and dagger , foot and hand , with the same unshaken courage and feverish energy and speed .

Meanwhile the man whom he had come to rescue , instead of joining in the conflict , had , on the first sign of intervention , leaped aback and blown again , and yet more urgently and loudly , on that same shrill-voiced trumpet that began the alarm .
