If the host slain upon the field , could have been for a moment reanimated in the forms in which they fell , each upon the spot that was the bed of his untimely death , gashed and ghastly soldiers would have stared in , hundreds deep , at household door and window ; and would have risen on the hearths of quiet homes ; and would have been the garnered store of barns and granaries ; and would have started up between the cradled infant and its nurse ; and would have floated with the stream , and whirled round on the mill , and crowded the orchard , and burdened the meadow , and piled the rickyard high with dying men .

Crops were sown , and grew up , and were gathered in ; the stream that had been crimsoned , turned a watermill ; men whistled at the plough ; gleaners and haymakers were seen in quiet groups at work ; sheep and oxen pastured ; boys whooped and called , in fields , to scare away the birds ; smoke rose from cottage chimneys ; sabbath bells rang peacefully ; old people lived and died ; the timid creatures of the field , the simple flowers of the bush and garden , grew and withered in their destined terms : and all upon the fierce and bloody battle-ground , where thousands upon thousands had been killed in the great fight .

Heaven keep us from a knowledge of the secrets whispered afterwards upon the tainted wind that blew across the scene of that day ’s work and that night ’s death and suffering ! Many a lonely moon was bright upon the battle-ground , and many a star kept mournful watch upon it , and many a wind from every quarter of the earth blew over it , before the traces of the fight were worn away .

The Seasons in their course , however , though they passed as lightly as the summer clouds themselves , obliterated , in the lapse of time , even these remains of the old conflict ; and wore away such legendary traces of it as the neighbouring people carried in their minds , until they dwindled into old wives ’ tales , dimly remembered round the winter fire , and waning every year .

The larks sang high above it ; the swallows skimmed and dipped and flitted to and fro ; the shadows of the flying clouds pursued each other swiftly , over grass and corn and turnip-field and wood , and over roof and church-spire in the nestling town among the trees , away into the bright distance on the borders of the sky and earth , where the red sunsets faded .

Heaven keep us from a knowledge of the sights the moon beheld upon that field , when , coming up above the black line of distant rising-ground , softened and blurred at the edge by trees , she rose into the sky and looked upon the plain , strewn with upturned faces that had once at mothers ’ breasts sought mothers ’ eyes , or slumbered happily .
