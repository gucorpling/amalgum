The insights from this analysis have been synthesized in a multilevel analysis at three aggregation levels : macro level , which described the relevant energy policies , regulatory frameworks , and the intended societal transformation required to achieve the national energy goals ; meso level , which focused on product – service arrangements , stakeholders ’ relationships , infrastructural development , and organizational changes taking place in the electricity distributions sector ; and micro level , which looked at product technology intervention and behavioral change at household level .

Moreover , it is time-consuming and bureaucratic for energy utilities to purchase products and services that can only be designed by one specific company ( e. g. , due to exclusive rights over certain technologies or methodologies ) , which can discourage energy service companies ( ESCOs ) from participating in such programs through energy performance contracts .

The study shows that promoting the long-term transition to sustainable energy systems in low-income energy markets does not only involve the adoption of energy policies and regulatory frameworks , but also depends largely on changes to infrastructure , stakeholders ’ networks , technology , user practices , and culture .

Therefore , policymakers and problem-solvers have to work towards increasing the alignment between components at lower and higher system levels , in other words to create new opportunities for the improvement of energy solutions for low-income households in Brazil .

In particular , for the low-income category , PEE could use a mixture of measurement and verification methodologies that consider the social and technical analysis of the low-income context prior to and post implementation of the energy program .

The study identified several aspects that contribute to the hindering of energy solutions that could increase the ability of low-income energy efficiency programs to reduce environmental impacts and increase the socioeconomic benefits of electricity distribution in low-income contexts .

Therefore , outcomes that cannot be objectively measured and quantified , but which are relevant to low-income markets , such as increased wellbeing , long-term effects , and indirect effects of behavioral change , are often overlooked .

Although the activities in PEE projects are not limited to demand-side management ( DSM ) , the focus group discussion revealed that energy utilities are reluctant to approve new projects that differ from more established methodologies .

PEE programs have rigid methodologies for their implementation , and opportunities for developing solutions capable to produce radical improvements in energy systems are limited to the typology “ pilot project ” .
