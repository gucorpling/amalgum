I should have said above that this is the first " solid " sample return mission — Genesis brought back a sample from the Sun almost two years ago , but Stardust is also bringing back the first solid samples from the local interstellar medium — basically this is a sample of the Galaxy .

This is a big challenge because they are very small ( order of micron in size ) and are somewhere ( we do n't know where ) on a HUGE collector — at least on the scale of the particle size — about a tenth of a square meter .

I should mention parenthetically that there is a fantastic launch video — taken from the POV of the rocket on the JPL Stardust website — highly recommended — best I 've ever seen — all the way from the launch pad , too .

The primary science goal of the mission was to collect a sample from a known primitive solar-system body , a comet called Wild 2 ( pronounced " Vilt-two " — the discoverer was German , I believe ) .

We 're right now using an automated microscope that we developed several years ago for nuclear astrophysics work to scan the collector in the Cosmic Dust Lab in Building 31 at Johnson Space Center .

Stardust is a NASA space capsule that collected samples from comet 81P/Wild ( also known as " Wild 2 ) in deep space and landed back on Earth on January 15 , 2006 .

It was decided that a collaborative online review process would be used to " discover " the microscopically small samples the capsule collected .

The first challenge that we have before can do any kind of analysis of these interstellar dust particles is simply to find them .
