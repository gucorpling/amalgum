Individualism becomes a strategy of subsistence and risk minimization , while collective work is assumed as a requirement of public policy that , in theory , would serve the common purposes , but which , in practice , conflicts with prevention toward associativity and , in general , with the incipient formation of values and indispensable capacities for enduring collective dynamics .

Because members of the organizations use water as a productive resource but not from a more integral perspective , a resource of common use and the interests of the group or of the beneficiary community and their management agreements do not acquire the relevance they deserve with respect to individual interests .

It seems that the central concern of the members is to comply with the legal requirements , by neglecting the organization itself in terms of its collective performance , its future projection , and its background scope , which are also not visualized .

With the use of the mixed research method , a complement between qualitative and quantitative information was achieved , which enriched the analysis and contributed to a better approach to complexity based on the voices of the producers and their interpretation .

These categories were developed based on the results of the research and a theoretical framework in which the concepts of common good , collective action , social capital , and human capital were valuable inputs to achieve a systemic vision .
