We further analyze the performance of models to forecast multiple time steps into future , how the models perform with cloud cover variable , and how the performance of different models vary across a given day , over the year , and days with high variability in irradiance .

Rather than having one static model to predict non-cloudy and cloudy days , we could potentially use ensemble methods or concept drift methods to reduce over-fitting on days where there is high variability in cloud cover .

The data used in our experiments includes hourly GHI data which is freely available from NREL , but many solar installations collect one-minute resolution data that could be used to potentially improve the model performance .

On days where there is no cloud cover , both models performed exceptionally ; however , on days with cloud cover , both models fail to accurately predict future solar irradiance .
