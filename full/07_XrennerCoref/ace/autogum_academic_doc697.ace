For this reason it was decided to support the interested actors from the five pilot regions directly in their work on LS in a next step : Specifically , various smaller pilot projects will be carried out in 2019 , in which , for example , school classes will tackle the special landscape characteristics in their residential communities , or landscape events will be offered to the interested public in partnership with authorities , agricultural organizations , and nature conservation organizations .

At first glance , the results of this study seem comparable to similar landscape management projects , supporting the idea that landscape cannot be addressed only by a specific landscape-oriented policy ; rather , its management must take several sectoral policies ( i. e. , forest , water , agriculture — see ) into account .

By formalizing the types of relationships ( cf. ) these stakeholders have with the landscape — whether a relation of exploitation of resources , aesthetic appreciation , or symbolic identification — LS can increase people ’s awareness of the importance of landscapes and ultimately their willingness to protect them and/or develop them sustainably .

LS provides three types of opportunities : ( 1 ) Communication , information , and dialogue : to communicate about the special characteristics and services of landscapes , and to encourage the population to engage with landscapes .

On a more analytical level , using the LS approach can help find co-operative solutions in cases where conflicts arise between resource-based and non-utility conceptions of landscapes , as discussed by Gerber and Knoepfel .

By naming and describing the relevant LS ( see Table 1 ) it is possible to establish a shared understanding of the relevant issues and the ways that different stakeholders can relate to them .

Rather , we found that the specific landscape traits and services that different stakeholders see in a certain landscape should be the starting point from which a landscape service assessment can be developed .

Talking about “ identification and sense of place ” or “ recreation and health ” in specific areas can reveal more concrete needs than abstract discussions about goals of visitor guidance .

However , the concept of landscape services can be used at the operational level as a coordination tool between stakeholders in charge of the management and planning of landscapes .

This is where the LS approach is helpful : it enables stakeholders to express the benefits and the needs that they see in regards to a specific landscape .

Assigning responsibilities within the fields of action outlined above is challenging because there is often a lack of resources and expertise for a proactive approach to LS .

We furthermore consider that LS are powerful communication tools for improving awareness of the qualities of the landscape amongst the public , the visitors and the inhabitants .

It is much more common to react when problems arise , e. g. , when the pressure on land use in an area has become too great .

With our focus on BLN sites , we already established that it does not make much sense to assess every kind of landscape with the same tool .

In particular , the LS “ aesthetic pleasure ” and “ identification and sense of place ” are clearly associated with non-utility conceptions of landscape .

We therefore believe that not only special , such as protected , landscapes will receive better appreciation with such an assessment but also every-day landscapes .

These two LS could bridge more resource-oriented conceptions represented by the “ recreation and health ” and “ attractiveness of location ” LS .

Consequently , the following questions arise : How can the findings be transferred to other areas , e. g. , to non-protected landscapes ?
