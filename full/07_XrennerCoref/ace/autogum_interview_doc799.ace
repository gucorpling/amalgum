DS : When I interviewed Augusten Burroughs he told me that when he was in advertising he completely shut himself off from the yearly ad books that would come out of the best ads that year , because he wanted to be fresh and not poisoned by other ideas ; whereas a band called The Raveonettes said they do n’t try to be original they just do what they like and are upfront about their influences .

When you are coming up with an idea for a song and then you all of a sudden stumble across it having been done somewhere else , how do you not allow that to squelch your creative impulse and drive to continue on .

Once my record came out I got some amount of positive reviews that made me think I have something original , which in turn made me have writer ’s block to keep that thing that I did n’t even know I had .

I started writing in a vacuum just for myself and I did n’t have a lot of feedback , and I thought that what I ’m saying has been said so many times before .

The way I say it , to me , sounds completely trite because it ’s the way I would say it and it does n’t sound special at all .

Probably more towards Augusten Burroughs because when I first started writing it was more in a vacuum , but I think everyone has their own way .
