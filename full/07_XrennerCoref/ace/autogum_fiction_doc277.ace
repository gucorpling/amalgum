As I have , however , judging from certain experiences in the past , some reason to anticipate such a demand , I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr Thomson ’s admirable history of travel ‘ Through Masai Land ’ for much information as to the habits and customs of the tribes inhabiting that portion of the East Coast , and the country where they live ; also to my brother , John G. Haggard , RN , HBM ’s consul at Madagascar , and formerly consul at Lamu , for many details furnished by him of the mode of life and war of those engaging people the Masai ; also to my sister-in-law , Mrs John Haggard , who kindly put the lines of p. 183 into rhyme for me ; also to an extract in a review from some book of travel of which I cannot recollect the name , to which I owe the idea of the great crabs in the valley of the subterranean river . { Endnote 23 } But if I remember right , the crabs in the book when irritated projected their eyes quite out of their heads .

Thence , as there is good evidence to show , they emigrated in two streams , one of which took possession of the shores of Palestine , while the other is supposed by savants to have immigrated down the coast of Eastern Africa where , near Mozambique , signs and remains of their occupation are not wanting .

And , by the way of illustrating the probability , I may add that to this day a very extensive trade is carried on between the Persian Gulf and Lamu and other East African ports as far south as Madagascar , which is of course the ancient Ebony Isle of the ‘ Arabian Nights ’ .
