According to the degree of network traffic congestion , the duty-cycle ratio of the receiver and the contention window size information of the senders are broadcast through E-ACK ( Early Acknowledgment ) , which reduces the transmission latency and waste of energy .

Reliable data collection and detection is crucial for data transmission with minimum energy and delay because data must be transmitted without delay in the event of fire in areas where it is difficult to replace batteries .

For example , if the total number of wake-ups to listen to an application is determined , the existing duty-cycle MAC occurs irrespective of the congestion occurring at the time of the traffic .

The proposed algorithm increases the number of wake-up times by reducing the sleep time of the receiver at the peak traffic time and reduces the number of wake-up in the opposite case .
