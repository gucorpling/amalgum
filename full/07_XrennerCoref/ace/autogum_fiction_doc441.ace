Louis , in order not to show on his face what was passing at the bottom of his heart , persisted in remaining in his own apartments , where his nurse alone kept him company ; the more he saw the approach of the time when all constraint would be at an end , the more humble and patient he was , falling back upon himself , as all strong men do when they form great designs , in order to gain more spring at the decisive moment .

The cardinal had , as we have said , great faith in the predictions of his secretary ; but the sum was a large one , and whatever might be the genius of Colbert , from time to time the cardinal thought to himself that the Theatin also might possibly have been mistaken , and that there was at least as much chance of his not being damned , as there was of Louis XIV . sending back his millions .

The disease , as Guenaud had predicted , had become worse ; it was no longer an attack of gout , it was an attack of death ; then there was another thing which made that agony more agonizing still , -- and that was the agitation brought into his mind by the donation he had sent to the king , and which , according to Colbert , the king ought to send back unaccepted to the cardinal .

Guenaud , on his part , preserved profound secrecy ; wearied with visits and questions , he answered nothing but " his eminence is still full of youth and strength , but God wills that which He wills , and when He has decided that man is to be laid low , he will be laid low .

Every time that the door opened , he turned sharply round towards that door , expecting to see the return of his unfortunate donation ; then , deceived in his hope , he fell back again with a sigh , and found his pains so much the greater for having forgotten them for an instant .
