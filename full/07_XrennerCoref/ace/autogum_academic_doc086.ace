Thirdly , ( 3 ) relevant concepts within urban spatial theory are drawn upon to explain and underpin the implications identified within the urban commons literature . Fourthly , ( 4 ) a preliminary conceptual framework is outlined to draw together the key concepts that connect urban commons with urban spatial theory . Finally , ( 5 ) the concepts are pre-emptively illustrated within the context of residential landscapes using examples from recent cohousing research in the UK .

Therefore , even though the broadening of the commons concept to include shared urban resources has stimulated a reconceptualisation of collective governance in cities generally , challenges remain surrounding clarity in its definition , understanding the spatial implications , and the role of urban professionals in its implementation .

Even though profession-led top-down approaches remain the predominant model for new housing development in the UK , community-led housing is growing in popularity , something that has been recognised in the UK government ’s 2018 announcement of the £163 million Community Housing Fund .

Resident control over shared outdoor spaces also allows potential for residents to shape their common surroundings in a way that is beneficial to them , providing agency over the way they live and increasing opportunities for social interaction .

Community-led housing challenges some of the limitations within contemporary housing development by generating a new bottom-up approach that shifts residents ’ roles from end users to engaged participants in aspects including anything from site acquisition to management .

In 2017 , the UK Government set out plans to build 300,000 new homes a year in England in an attempt to tackle ongoing issues around the affordability and availability of housing ( s.5.3 ) .

Furthermore , a polarisation between top-down and bottom-up approaches to urban development in the UK presents additional challenges of integrating commons as a bottom-up approach within the top-down guidelines and practices of urban professions .

While the evolving meaning of the term commons has created a usefully flexible concept applicable to various resources in different contexts and at multiple scales , it remains conceptually challenging in its vagueness .

Notable within the increasingly popular community-led housing sector , and resident participation in shared residential landscapes more generally , is the emerging concept of urban commons .
