I do n't know if you 've had the chance to visit , or if you would even have time to do that at this point , but keep in mind that South Bend is a verrry tiny ( and relatively dangerous ) city with not much at all going on apart from Notre Dame .

WashU is very much the opposite - - the dominant religion on campus is Judaism , but people tend live more secular lifestyles ; religion is n't something that enters the conversation outside of actual Jewish events , in my experience .

I do know a couple people from my hometown who specifically sought ND out because they really valued having Catholicism incorporated into so many aspects of campus life and the opportunity to meet people from similar backgrounds .

I unfortunately really undervalued how much location can impact college experience - - it really makes a massive difference in how at home you 'll feel , and your sense of contentment comfort on campus .

Maybe that 's something you 'd enjoy . ( washu on the other hand has relatively tame frat parties , and I have never once seen anybody tailgating here ha )

JI 'd recommend you spend time thinking about where you think you 'd be the happiest without worrying too much about whatever minor differences there are between the engineering schools .

I think ND is more suited to kind of a unique niche of student who prefers the conservative environment and the lifestyle of a quieter , more isolated town .

If you 've seen my comments in other threads , I generally am pretty upfront about the fact that I really dislike living in St. Louis .

If you 're really into sports and want that to be a part of your college experience , ND definitely has the edge there .

Notre Dame will have crazier frat parties and tailgates to compensate for what I assume is very short supply of bars and clubs .

Honestly , academics and alumni are really not going to be much different at WashU vs. Notre Dame .

The student body attitude is decidedly more liberal left -leaning , like most of the other T20 schools .

South Bend vs. St. Louis and 2 . the general vibe culture of the respective student bodies .

That will restrict your options in terms of social life general off -campus activities quite a bit .
