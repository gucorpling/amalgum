And it was different to feel part of a whole production , with the stunt guys and zombie girls and the NZ bands and the big time bands and the dragon ! ! ? … Often we ’ve been a stand alone performance so it felt good to have a role , alongside others , in creating a rocking experience for the rock enthusiasts .

We have performed throughout New Zealand with our biggest audience probably being the Qtn Winter Fest openings in 2005 & 2006 but I think the Rock2Wgtn was bigger than that ... .
