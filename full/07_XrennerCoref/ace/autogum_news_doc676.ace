Everson argues Fox News , in violation of Title 11 , " structure[d ] the debates to promote or advance one candidate over another " through a July 27 change to its criteria that replaced a pre-existing one percent polling threshold with a threshold admitting those " consistently " included in " recognized " polls .

Everson argues his exclusion violates Title 11 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations in that debate hosts must not " structure the debates to promote or advance one candidate over another " , and must " use pre-established objective criteria to determine which candidates may participate in a debate .

He alleges this was done to ensure the inclusion of the low-polling candidates former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina , former New York governor George Pataki , Senator Lindsey Graham , and former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore , because Fox News recognizes these candidates as " major players .

Furthermore , Everson argues the Fox News criteria are not " objective , " as Title 11 requires , because they fail to define the terms " consistently " and " recognized " when referring to polls .
