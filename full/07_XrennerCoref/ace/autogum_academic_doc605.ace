To some degree , our findings support the current polycentric development pattern in Chinese cities , as polycentric development enhances a more balanced population distribution between the main center and its sub-centers for those cities with a large number of private car ownerships ( >10 million within cities ) .

Some incomparable results of our empirical findings , such as the positive impact of compactness in terms of urban density on air pollutants in the context of YRD cities , might contribute to the longstanding debate and the impact of compact development on air pollution in developed countries .

Focusing on employment data will shed more light on the heterogeneity that potentially exists in the relationship between poly-centricity and air pollution , i. e. , the impacts may be heterogeneous for cities with different jobs-housing balances , which is not considered in our paper .

The current study takes the first step toward a better understanding of the relationships between compact urban form and poly-centricity and air quality for a sample of 19 YRD cities by using the analysis of the spatial durbin model ( SDM ) .

Regarding the rapid urbanization and urban expansion and the consequent long-lasting impacts on accessibility , housing affordability , and air pollutants , knowledge on the issue of how compactness and poly-centricity affect air quality is of crucial importance for China .

In addition , poly-centricity in terms of developing too many activity centers has a higher level of PM10 emissions , while enhancing polycentric clusters does not necessarily result in more PM10 emissions .

However , for cities with more private car vehicles of >10 million , polycentric clustered development may improve air quality in terms of PM10 , but this improvement may be limited .

In addition , cities with more vehicle ownerships have a large effect on PM10 emissions , which indicates that more vehicles used are one of the reasons for more PM10 emissions .

First , following Engelfriet and Koomen and Li et al. , we use population centers rather than employment centers to measure poly-centricity .
