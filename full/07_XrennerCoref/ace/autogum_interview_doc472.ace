I 've been deputing over the last four years about the Front St. Extension which is big tax money , I 'm on the Toronto Cycling Committee ( again - I took off a couple of years , but it 's been nearly a decade of bike work , and I 'm quite involved in the TaketheTooker .

That 's a good question - likely working on the waste reduction side of things , but I 've been very focussed on deflecting the Front St. Extension , so the 21-19 vote in Feb 21/05 stunk , moreso as most " progressives " kept this Dumb Growth alive .

Transport sector emissions lead our emissions growth yet the slim majority of NDP councilors are persisting with the Front St. Extension project , which has n't looked at transit options , nor harm to transit from this $ 255 million 2 km roadway .

I also have had a lot of time with transit groups , and previous volunteer community radio work led to numerous links to environmental and civic groups , such as C4LD , fighting the destructive " amanglemation " deemed by the Harristocracy .

The Feb. 21/05 21-19 council vote to keep alive the Front St. Extension and not to explore transit options meant we could n't trust the NDP to be as progressive as they claim to be .
