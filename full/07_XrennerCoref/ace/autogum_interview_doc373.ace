With the feedback that came from that review , one very key thing that came back was that there was a strong support , and in fact almost a demand from quite a lot of people who were involved with the statistical work of the nation , for the ABS to take a stronger leadership role , and that change in the wording that occurred back in 2005 actually reflected the decision the organisation took , and the Statistician at the time , that they would in fact look at taking a stronger leadership role in official statistical activities in Australia .

And my role is as Chief Executive of the organisation , so I have management roles that are associated with running a big complex organisation - a little under three thousand people and a budget of something around three million dollars a year - and I also provide the leadership from a statistical policy point of view for official statistics in Australia , and of course I operate under the authority of the Statistics Act , so I have statutory responsibilities as well under the Statistics Act to meet .

: I think what we saw there was a change that reflected the results of a review that was undertaken , known as the " Allen Review " , that was undertaken as the role of the ABS was playing in statistics in Australia and official statistics , and talking to a very broad range of our stakeholders , both public and private .
