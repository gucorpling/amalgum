In the case of the 0.1 mm profile condition , the erosion occurred in most of the backshore area owing to strong wave runup , and in the case of the 1 and 5 mm profile conditions , the undertow developed by the strong rundown phenomenon created large-scale scouring near the boundary between the nourishment section and existing sandy ground .

The trend of morphological change was verified by applying nourishment , which is one of the typical soft-type methods , to a coast where erosion occurred , and the characteristics of each profile were analyzed by comparing the findings with the results of the submerged breakwater method , which is applied in the field more frequently as a hard-type structure .

With regard to the 5 mm material , no suspension or traction due to waves occurred , and when the wave was applied to the material directly , the material was transported to the rear by a momentary impact , but the material accumulated from the position within x : 100 cm , forming a steep rubble dune .

To summarize the above experimental results , if nourishment is selected for the purposes of reducing erosion , a 1 mm particle size is advantageous for sediment transport , but an increase in the grain size , such as with the 5 mm condition , does not produce greater reductions in sediment transport .

However , complicated flows , such as breaking waves , reflection , and standing waves , occurred at P2 on the shoreline , and the overall energy density increased in conditions where wind was applied , although the overall energy density could vary according to the morphological conditions .

In particular , large-scale loss of sand occurred over a wide range from the position of x : 200 cm where waves broke to the backshore area , and a sandbar was formed up to the position of x : 200 â€“ 400 cm to the seaside .

On the basis of the wave data collected from the positions of P2 and P6 , a clear wave change according to the change in wind velocity did not appear at P6 , where no breaking wave or wave deformation occurred in the experiment .

When the submerged breakwater was installed , sediment transport decreased because of the effect of wave energy being decreased in comparison with the 0.1 mm profile , and the total amount of sediment transport was similar to the condition with 1 mm material application .

When there was an accompanying wind velocity of 8 m/s , the erosion trend in most profiles was similar to the situation in the case of 0 m/s , but a difference was revealed in that the erosion range was expanded .

This is because the sediment transport caused by wave action was restricted by a fast fall in velocity , and wave runup and rundown did not affect the sediment transport significantly .
