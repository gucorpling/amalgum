Basically everyone has expertise in the area and we come together and having meetings and plan four years ahead and say at the moment Sochi ' s the goal , but Rio ' s still in the back of the head , and knowing my body so well now that I 've done both sports for five years means that I can know where they 've made mistakes , and I know where things have gone really well , so we can plan ahead for that and prepare so that the things that did go wrong wo n't happen again .

So one of the big things I guess , after the Vancouver campaign , being in ski boots for so long , I had lost a lot of muscle from my calves so they were n't actually firing properly , and when you 're trying to run and jump and you do n't have half of your leg working properly it makes it pretty difficult to jump a good distance .

So I 'm skiing now but when I 'm in a gym doing recovery and rehab or prehab stuff , I 've got calf raising , I 've got hamstring exercises because I know they 're the weaker areas that if I 'm not working on at the moment they 're two muscle groups that do n't get worked during ski .

One of the difficult things I guess is we have to have that 100 per cent communication and trust between one another and a lot of the female skiers on the circuit , their guide is their husband .
