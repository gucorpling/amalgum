And now , my lords , this is , perhaps , the fittest time to put a sentence upon record , which is this - that standing in this dock , and called to ascend the scaffold - it may be to-morrow - it may be now - it may be never - whatever the result may be , I wish to put this on record , that in the part I have taken I was not actuated by enmity towards Englishmen - for among them I have passed some of the happiest days of my life , and the most prosperous ; and in no part which I have taken was I actuated by enmity towards Englishmen individually , whatever I may have felt of the injustice of English rule in this island ; I therefore say , that it is not because I loved England less , but because I loved Ireland more , that I now stand before you " .
