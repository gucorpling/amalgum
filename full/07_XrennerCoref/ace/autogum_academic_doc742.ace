According to a “ cyclical model of technological change ” by Anderson and Tushman and a “ stages of growth model ” by Gibson and Nolan , growth models can be divided into four stages : entry , growth , expansion and stage .

It creates a complicated connection of cases that tend to repeat the pattern “ cause – result – cause – result ” and can cause variables that are dependent on the initial phase to become independent in the next stage .

Depending on the nature of the platform , each stage consists of economics and business theories , two-sided markets , network effects and business ecosystems , which are the main theories relating to platform businesses .

A conceptual framework is a heuristic frame for assessing cause-and-effect relationships , which describes the logical relationship of concepts used and identifies the conditions , objects and the idea itself .

However , since it is related to consecutive phases , it is possible to proceed with a more accurate analysis when using a conceptual framework than with simple pattern-matching .

It examined explicitly whether consecutive cases with the same cause – result – effect were connected and repeatable , as well as whether they applied in other cases .

Each stage has a different set of tasks , and each task has a different set of decision items and influence factors to be considered .

Using a conceptual framework as an analytical method means that observed cases can be matched based on experience with theoretically predictable cases .

Therefore , adequate core elements and strategies for each stage are crucial in today ’s business world .
