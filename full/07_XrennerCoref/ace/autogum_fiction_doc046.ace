On her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent to her marriage they were under the impression that she was ultimately going to join her husband ; and from that time to the present she had done nothing to disturb their belief that she was awaiting his return in comfort , hoping against hope that his journey to Brazil would result in a short stay only , after which he would come to fetch her , or that he would write for her to join him ; in any case that they would soon present a united front to their families and the world .

We discover the latter in changed conditions ; instead of a bride with boxes and trunks which others bore , we see her a lonely woman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage , as at an earlier time when she was no bride ; instead of the ample means that were projected by her husband for her comfort through this probationary period , she can produce only a flattened purse .

After again leaving Marlott , her home , she had got through the spring and summer without any great stress upon her physical powers , the time being mainly spent in rendering light irregular service at dairy-work near Port-Bredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley , equally remote from her native place and from Talbothays .
