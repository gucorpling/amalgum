( a ) while it 's within the scope of the Legislation of the Diet how conditions are set for acquiring / losing Japanese nationality ( Article 10 ) , a distinction without rational reasons brought by such a condition may be unconstitutional ( Article 14 : Paragraph 1 ) . ( b ) being legitimated by the parents ' marriage or not is a thing the child can not change by its will or endeavor . ( c ) the purpose of legislation of this provision is rational , because that is considered to demand the child 's tight connection with Japan 's society . ( d ) after this provision was added in 1984 , both notions and actual situations of people in Japan have been becoming of variety , as to family life or parent-child relationship . ( e ) the child 's tight connection with Japan 's society can not be measured instantly by whether the parents have got legally married . ( f ) many foreign countries have lifted a legitimacy condition through revision of the law ; two conventions ( # ) that Japan has ratified include provision meaning that a child is not to face any discrimination as to its birth .

the distinction as to legitimacy is not unconstitutional and is within the range of choice of legislative measures . even if it 's unconstitutional , the plaintiffs ' appeals are to be dismissed , following the viewpoint in the other dissenting opinion . it 's dubious whether or how people in Japan have been making changes as in ( d ) . it 's rational to offer Japanese nationality in two other situations as in ( g ) . easy naturalization as in ( h ) to offer Japanese nationality is rational both as a measure and in practice . foreign countries ' movement as in ( f ) is not to be instantly reflected in judgment on constitutionality ; they are different from Japan , with a large number of international marriages and expansion of regional unification like EU .

These distinctions have no rational relation with the purpose of legislation . ( h ) another provision in this Act states a child in this situation may be naturalized with fewer conditions , but it does n't justify the relation between the purpose and the distinctions , because naturalization is within discretion of the Minister of Justice .
