( 3 ) The data set in this research contains time variables ( such as the year , month , day , day of the week , and hour ) , external environment variables ( including temperature , humidity , sunlight , airflow , wind speed , and soil temperature ) , and energy variables that track the energy consumed during the building operating hours ( in 2016 , use of electricity consumption hourly data of 11 offices ) ;
