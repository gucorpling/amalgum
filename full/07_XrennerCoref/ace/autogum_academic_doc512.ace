Salivary α-amylase ( sAA ) seems a more sensitive and generalizable stress response marker than cortisol , as it reacts more pronouncedly and rapidly to different types of stressors and returns to baseline levels immediately after the end of the stress bout without the carry-over effect observed for cortisol .

Aging tends to heighten the sympathetic tone , as revealed by a higher sAA global output than in younger adults , without attenuating the autonomic response to stress , as revealed by similar stress-related increases of sAA in younger and older adults .

Studies of sAA response to physical stressors have mainly investigated the impact of physical exercise bouts of long duration ( >20 min ) and moderate-to-high intensity ( >50 % maximal oxygen consumption ) , showing that they acutely elevate sAA .

This is particularly evident when older individuals perform a concomitant cognitive task while walking , as indicated by the larger decrement in gait performance from single-task ( ST ) to dual-task ( DT ) conditions compared to younger adults .

Subjective indexes of the perceptual and cognitive responsiveness to task performance , such as the rating of perceived exertion ( RPE ) , may complement physiological measures for a comprehensive understanding of the responses to physical-cognitive DT performance .

This is relevant to the present study , because working memory seems more relevant to gait efficiency and resource allocation during DT walking in aging than the other core components of prefrontal-dependent cognition .

This is consistent with the hypothesis that regular physical activity may lead to physiological adaptations that buffer the effects of stressors in physical and non-physical domains ( the cross-stressor adaptation hypothesis ) .

The first aim was to investigate how aging individuals cope with locomotor-cognitive dual-tasking by analyzing complementary information on their autonomic response to DT performance and cognitive effort .
