For instance , animals with a low-grade chronic systemic inflammation due to a high-fat diet have developed osteoarthritis , and others with an increased body weight due to diet have shown an increased progression of osteoarthritis . Metcalfe et al. proposed that metabolic endotoxemia ( raised LPS blood and synovial concentrations ) caused by impaired gastric mucosa and low-grade chronic inflammation , may contribute to the onset and progression of OA in obese patients .

The hypothesis that not only oral but also intestinal microbiota can be associated with the development of RA is supported by many data . Zhang et al. published a case-control metagenome-wide association study ( MGWAS ) of the fecal , dental and salivary microbiomes of a cohort of treatment-naive and treated RA patients .

It has been hypothesized that the alteration of single bacterial genus could have direct impact on driving inflammation , as suggested for Bacteroides , Akkermansia or the anti-inflammatory Faecalobacterium prausnitzii , which has been noted to be depleted in RA patients , while Prevotella and Ruminococcus were more prevalent .

A clear example is the potential therapeutic effect of SCFAs ( short chain fatty acids ) , which are microbial fermentation products found in the bowel , that have demonstrated a profound influence on T-reg cell differentiation in a variety of experimental models of autoimmunity or inflammatory T-cell-mediated diseases .

The authors suggested that modulation was likely mediated by the differentiation of CD4 T cells towards T-reg cells , which produce anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 , and thus influenced the function of Th17 cells .
