Generally , anesthetics affect the basal levels of sympathetic nerve activity to regulate blood pressure , which plays an important role in controlling cardiovascular function . Sun et al. indicated that anesthesia attenuated the excitatory response of RSNA and HR to anaphylactic hypotension , while these excitatory responses were attenuated by anesthetics in the order ketamine-xylazine > urethane = pentobarbital . Bencze et al. found that pentobarbital anesthesia had a modest influence on the BP level and its maintenance by the above vasoactive systems .

Epidemiological studies have hinted at a link between fructose consumption and elevated blood pressure . Jalal et al. reported that excess dietary fructose ( ≥74 g/day ) in the form of added sugar was associated with higher BP values in adults in the United States who did not have a history of hypertension .

The great increase in fructose consumption in the last decades leads to the rapid accumulation of triglyceride in the Occidental population . Tran et al. reported that serum norepinephrine and triglyceride levels are significantly increased in fructose-fed hypertensive rats , as reflected by high SNA .

A previous study showed that hypertriglyceridemia may be the main contributory factor associated with impaired baroreflex sensitivity during a metabolic syndrome . Soncrant et al. reported that elevated BP was increased by sympathoexcitation in 20 % fructose-induced , salt-sensitive , hypertensive rats .

According to Tran et al. , hypertension can develop in rats owing to excessive fructose consumption , and the developed hypertension can be treated using a sympatholytic agent called prazosin , which blocks the α1-adrenoreceptors .

Consistent with this previous result , our data showed that the use of a DGAT1 inhibitor for inhibiting serum triglyceride level led to a slight decrease in BP but did not affect SNA (

Excessive fructose intake increased serum triglycerides levels and induced BP elevation by stimulating SNA ; however , alleviation of hypertriglyceridemia did not attenuate sympathetic activation and only slightly lowered BP .

Our research further indicated that fructose intake may reduce NO levels in the NTS and cause baroreflex dysfunction , which further stimulates SNA and induces the development of high BP (
