However , the movie has been building up to the ending where Rey uses the force , defeats her archenemy , goes alone to Luke without Leia or anyone else and only she gives Luke his lightsaber , hinting that she would probably finish her training wit him .

This could mean there could be a group of Jedi survivors who survived the massacre of Kylo Ren and rise from the shadows as an army of Jedi again like the Republic in Attack Of The Clones and fight Kylo Ren and the First Order .

There has been so much about this and I 've yet to see anyone mention that in RotJ during the last scene with Yoda , he tells Luke that when he 's ( Yoda ) gone Luke will be the Last Jedi .

Now , not many accept this theory because he got his ass kicked by a Stormtrooper but when he fought Kylo Ren , if he did n't have the force , he would 've died within seconds compared to the Stormtrooper .

Then , without warning , someone will point out to Finn proving that he is actually the last Jedi , while everyone would believe it 's Rey or Luke .

Like some other people mentioned Luke is the last of the Old Jedis , then if he trains Rey or Finn or whoever hes still the last jedi .

She knows how to fight , she can fly anything , she can fire a blaster well , she 's a good mechanic and she is force-sensitive .

There would be a showdown between him and the Dark Side but I believe he will fall and the Dark Side will win in this episode . -

Then , Luke will battle Kylo Ren and die like Obi-Wan did in A New Hope , leading Rey to be the last remaining Jedi . -

So far , there are five things that could have a possibility of being the last Jedi . - It 's Luke Skywalker : Clearly throughout

11,18 abstract|15,18 person|20,21 abstract|22,24 person

Also , he spent thirty years of training and On his first battle , he never fired a shot at the innocents .

In my opinion , I would say it most likely Rey , but my heart wants it to be Finn .

This could mean that Finn is a little Force-Sensitive and that his family he never knew was also Force-Sensitive .

The Force Awakens , we have been getting enough hints that say that Luke is the last Jedi .

5,6 person|9,11 abstract|14,15 person|16,19 person

But after killing his own father , he is clearly on the full course of the Dark Side .

So based only on that scene I figure it means Luke and would make sense I feel .

Luke will train Rey like Yoda trained Luke , while the Empire soundly crushes the Resistance .

If you ask me , that 's long enough to brainwash any soldier to be loyal .

He could be the only Jedi left and now the First Order is hunting him down .

1,2 person|4,8 person|10,13 organization|15,16 person

So he could have the force to help him resist the brainwash of the First Order .

Some how , he still has some good in him and is the only Jedi left .

He immediately defected the First Order after being raised by them for thirty years .

While this is extremely unlikely , some believe it 's actually Kylo Ren .

And lastly , we have the idea that Jedi is also a plural .
