Mr. Bird said that he had assisted in naming the three boys , and that he should leave this matter entirely to Mrs. Bird ; Donald wanted the child called " Maud , " after a pretty little curly-haired girl who sat next him in school ; Paul chose " Luella , " for Luella was the nurse who had been with him during his whole babyhood , up to the time of his first trousers , and the name suggested all sorts of comfortable things .

Grandma said that she would prefer not to take any part in the discussion , and everybody suddenly remembered that Mrs. Bird had thought of naming the baby Lucy , for Grandma herself ; and , while it would be indelicate for her to favor that name , it would be against human nature for her to suggest any other , under the circumstances .
