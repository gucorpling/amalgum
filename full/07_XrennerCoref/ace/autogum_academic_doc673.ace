While the study of any particular saint , hagiography , or hagiographic tradition may at first glance appear singular , monolingual , or culturally isolated , in actual fact , the differences in cultural context between literary and spiritual traditions demands nuanced scholarly engagement with the complex balances of religious , political , and social forces that generate the cultural milieux of holiness.11 Indeed , as Massimo Rondolino argues elsewhere in this issue , the term “ hagiography ” itself signifies “ an analytical category for the taxonomy of sources that contribute to construct and promote the recognition of a given individual as a perfected being in the context of a particular religious theory of truth . ” 12 The textual history of any single hagiographic text often encompasses a long and complicated history of narrative negotiation among speakers , languages , and versions of a life story , more often than not resulting in the type of generic diversity of sources discussed here by DiValerio , and able to reveal a holy imaginary along more indexical axes , as Ritchey suggests , than we might expect.13

In the century between Canon MacCulloch ’s proposal of “ comparative hagiology ” as a discrete field of study and Massimo Rondolino ’s call for its serious reconsideration , the study of hagiography has developed into an academic discipline on its own terms.1 Countless serious and theoretically ambitious studies now provide more scholarly bibliography than any single graduate seminar could include.2 Book series from American and European publishers encourage new theoretical approaches to hagiography while calling for expanded attention to global traditions of sanctity.3 Yet the role and force of the comparative within the study of hagiography remains — with a few exceptions — curiously undertheorized , despite the flourishing fields of comparative religions , comparative literatures , and their attendant professional organizations.4 Many possible reasons for this particular lacuna exist , from the place of hagiographic scholarship within studies in religion and literature , more broadly to the difficulties inherent in academic approaches to the sacred .

I agree with my co-contributors that hagiography in and of itself exceeds the textual , and I am mindful in particular of Jon Keune ’s caution here , that we give careful nuance to the various media expressing sanctity , since “ the word hagiography cannot but prioritize textuality in its very restricted sense of written documents . ” 9 However , for the purposes of this essay focused on materialist approaches to the literature of sanctity , I have chosen to use the older term hagiography for this very reason , because , in Ritchey ’s formulation , “ the graphia or text-production of the hagiographical process concentrates the hagio of the exemplary figure ” .

The material history of hagiographic texts — the various texts that lie behind the official or canonical versions of any saint ’s life story in any tradition — demand rigorous and context-specific approaches to the oral and written narratives of their sanctity because it is those narratives that preserve and even — through the multiple configurations charted here by David DiValerio — create sanctity itself.10 A materialist approach to those narratives thus necessitates the technical methodology of manuscript studies and book history .

Self-reflective interrogation of the material history of hagiographic literature may be closer to Keune ’s “ comparative-prioritized ” method than we realize , able to “ disrupt normative readings ” as French recommends , precisely because our narratives of the textual , material history of hagiographic literature remain largely unexamined — and unquestioned.14 Only through a comparative approach to the material record can we begin to ask such questions and work toward a more nuanced understanding of the literature of sanctity .

In this relatively narrow terminological usage I depart from Sara Ritchey ’s and Massimo Rondolino ’s use of the term , explained elsewhere in this issue , to describe a much wider range of medial and conceptual records of the sacred imaginary , which variously combine in the production of holy identity and reputation .

I have chosen to use the term “ hagiography ” in the discussion that follows — with some caution — because I focus specifically on a methodology for approaching the literature of sanctity : the textual record of the life stories of holy men and women.8

I suggest further that attention to the material history of the literature of sanctity — to the religious literature that Western scholarship has long termed hagiography — allows us to ask questions that reveal a comparative approach to hagiography from the inside out .

I am mindful as well , here , of the historical , conceptual , and disciplinary issues raised by the term “ hagiography ” , long used as a generic classification with colonialist , patriarchal , and Christo-centric associations.7

Yet , as Todd French notes in this issue , while the disciplinary restrictions inherent to academic specialization create a difficult terrain for comparative approaches to religious topics , they nevertheless “ render collaborative work imperative . ”
