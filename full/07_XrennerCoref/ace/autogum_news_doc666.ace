This gene is already present in the mouse genome , but the modified gene is designed to be strongly active ( transcribed ) in skeletal muscle . ( The natural copy of the gene , most active in the liver , continues to function normally ) .

Researchers at Case Western University in Cleveland , Ohio have announced the creation of transgenic mice with substantially improved athletic endurance , which live and breed longer and are more aggressive than genetically unmodified siblings , and are leaner despite consuming 60 % more food .

Hanson said that he did not expect that the results would be applicable to humans due to both practical and ethical considerations in addition to the fact that the genes might not function the same way in humans .

In the transgenics , more energy is available to muscle through the burning of fatty acids , with much less production of lactate ( a chemical that leads to sore muscles when one exercises ) .

These alterations increased strength rather than endurance through the genetic modification of myostatin and follistatin , or by injection of a soluble form of ACVR2B to block myostatin activity in normal mice .
