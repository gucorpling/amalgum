It coincides with other trails on a number of legs , notably with the newer European long distance path E1 from Kautokeino to the tripoint after Kilpisjärvi and perhaps elsewhere , with Grensesømmen from the tripoint to the Ny Sulitjelma hut , with Nordlandsruta ( part of ? ) the distance from Gautelihytta to Ny-Sulitjelma , and with the Padjelantaleden and Kungsleden on some legs .

Also standards vary considerably , from the Spartan open wilderness huts in Finland ( and a few minimal turf huts and emergency huts you can choose to use ) through the obetjent variety of Norwegian huts and manned Swedish huts with some service but with the expectation of guests taking care of themselves , to the fjällstation with restaurant and at least hostel like accommodation .

Much of the time you walk on rolling fell heaths and through sparse fell birch forest , where walking is easy , but there are quite a lot of legs with steep grades , and there are passages where the terrain is mostly boulders and good boots are needed .

The Nordkalottleden trail is above the treeline for much of the distance , where the wind keeps most of them away , but in valleys they may be plentiful , and on still and moist days there may be quite some räkkä also on higher ground .

The trail is in no way extreme , but you should be able to handle also unlikely nasty surprises , as in finding an alternative route if the spring floods took your bridge , or as in waiting out a snow storm in summer .

As you will probably be carrying your own tent , hiking mattresses , sleeping bags and cutlery anyhow , the standard of individual huts is not necessarily that important , but some extra service may feel good after days in the wilderness .

Huts close to trailheads are also likely to be more busy , but as trailheads usually are on the end of a long dirt road , often a day 's hike from Nordkalottleden , day hikers are not a common sight .
