Her Ph.D. thesis studied a stream in the Arizona Sonoran Desert to determine how the different parts of the streams dried during warmer months , and it was determined that when each part of the stream ecosystem shrinks and expands , the stream as a whole fluctuates in size . [ 3 ]

According to her paper , this research could help predict how drying patterns cause changes in ecosystems , and knowing that stream ecosystems change over space and time can also be used to predict how streams could change due to climate change . [ 3 ]
