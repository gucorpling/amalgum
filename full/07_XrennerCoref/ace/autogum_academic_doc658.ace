It is important to note that driveline site assessment and obtaining specimens of the drainage should only be performed by members of the LVAD team ( or designated shared care centers ) in order to limit the number of times and the number of people to whom the driveline is exposed .

ISHLT classifies infections in LVAD patients as VAD-specific ( involving the pump , cannula , pocket , or percutaneous driveline ) , VAD-related ( infective endocarditis , blood stream infections including central venous catheter associated , mediastinitis ) and non-VAD infections such as pneumonia .
