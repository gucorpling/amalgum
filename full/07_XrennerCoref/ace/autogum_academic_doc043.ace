However , it should be noted that virulence in seabass is much higher following intraperitoneal injection with doses as low as 104 cfu per fish resulting in 100 % mortality within 48 h. This together with the fact that other fish species cultured in adjacent cages are not affected during disease outbreaks suggests either an adaptation of the pathogen to this host , or an increase sensitivity of seabass to A. veronii .

In the case of fish farm 1 ( West ) where the disease was initially described we can now talk for an established problem as long as A. veronii was isolated from diseased fish almost all year round ( March – December ) excluding the winter months ( temperature <18 °C ) , over the past ten years .

In any case , the ability to cause hemolysis in seabass blood agar was observed in all tested isolates , an attribute related to the hepatic jaundice and the icteric appearance of the diseased fish in the field but also to the in vivo hemolysis observed in seabass challenged with strains NS and PDB .

Regarding the West Aegean Sea , while initially the disease was reported to affect only two neighboring fish farms in Argolikos Bay , it has now affected one more farm in the same area but more importantly it has geographically expanded to the neighboring Saronikos Bay where aquaculture activity is very intensive .

Fish exhibiting the typical clinical signs of A. veronii disease are still present in the field in summer months ( personal communications with fish farmers ) but are not considered a threat for the moment because impacts are much lower than those recorded in the West Aegean Sea .

Fish transfers between farms located in the Black Sea and the Aegean regions could explain the establishment of the pathogen in the latter , however this should be confirmed in a future study using molecular epidemiological methods .

Nevertheless , a recent outbreak in Bodrum ( sampling 24 ) and the similarities of strain T04-D with the rest of eastern isolates should be considered when discussing the disease ’s occurrence in East Aegean Sea .
