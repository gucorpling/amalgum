She had an old piece of a mare ( which I think she had bought from Stephen ) , with one eye , three legs , and no mane or tail to speak of , and on which she lavished , without the least perceptible result , care enough to have kept a stable in condition .

She nearly always fetched some little thing to her host -- not her hostess -- a fowl , or a pat of butter from her one old cow , or something of the kind , because , she said , “ Abigail had established the precedent , and she was ‘ a woman of good understanding’ -- she understood that feeding and flattery were the way to win men . ”
