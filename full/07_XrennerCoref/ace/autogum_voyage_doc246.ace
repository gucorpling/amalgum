In 1692 , a smaller group of Chaldeans ( re-)broke their communion with Rome , declaring themselves to be the members of the Assyrian Church of the East , an independent Eastern Christian denomination with a patriarchate in the village of Qodchanis ( modern Konak ) , northeast of Hakkari . ( In 1918 , the patriarchate was moved to Iraqi Kurdistan , and the former church in Qodchanis now lays in ruins . )

The Chaldeans are Eastern Catholics who reverted to communion with the Roman Catholic Church after the schism of 1552 , when they broke from the Syriac Orthodox Church , which in its turn broke from mainstream Christianity in the schism of 431 that came about after the Council of Ephesus .
