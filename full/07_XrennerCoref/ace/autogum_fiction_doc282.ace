A little of him and his monocle went such a great way with me that I thought I had enough of him by the end of the trial , where he gets off a man charged with murder , and then cruelly snubs the homicide in his gratitude ; and I do not quite know how I kept on to the point where Steele in his drunkenness first dazzles and then insults the gang of drunken lumbermen , and begins his second life in the river where they have thrown him , and where his former client finds him .

No one in his day has done more to popularize the romanticism , now decadent , than Mr. Gilbert Parker ; and he made way for it at its worst just because he was so much better than it was at its worst , because he was a poet of undeniable quality , and because he could bring to its intellectual squalor the graces and the powers which charm , though they could not avail to save it from final contempt .

A few years ago , when a movement which carried fiction to the highest place in literature was apparently of such onward and upward sweep that there could be no return or descent , there was a counter-current in it which stayed it at last , and pulled it back to that lamentable level where fiction is now sunk , and the word " novel " is again the synonym of all that is morally false and mentally despicable .

In " The Right of Way " Mr. Parker is not in a world where mere determinism rules , where there is nothing but the happening of things , and where this one or that one is important or unimportant according as things are happening to him or not , but has in himself no claim upon the reader 's attention .

Quite as surely as romanticism lurked at the heart of realism , something that we may call " psychologism " has been present in the romanticism of the last four or five years , and has now begun to evolve itself in examples which it is the pleasure as well as the duty of criticism to deal with .

In a better and wiser world , the homicide would not perhaps be at hand so opportunely to save the life of the advocate who had saved his ; but one consents to this , as one consents to a great deal besides in the story , which is imaginably the survival of a former method .

He saves himself in his latest novel , because , though still so largely romanticistic , its prevalent effect is psychologistic , which is the finer analogue of realistic , and which gave realism whatever was vital in it , as now it gives romanticism whatever will survive it .

Add to these conditions of his personality that pathologically he is from time to time a drunkard , with always the danger of remaining a drunkard , and you have a figure of which so much may be despaired that it might almost be called hopeless .

Yet that this , too , is partly apparent , I think can be shown from some phases of actual fiction which happen to be its very latest phases , and which are of a significance as hopeful as it is interesting .

Nature employs the miracle so very sparingly that most of us go through life without seeing one , and some of us contract such a prejudice against miracles that when they are performed for us we suspect a trick .
