What we could do , however , was to study anatomy and figure out what it is , so that when we have samples preserved for studying e. g. , the genome , transcriptome , or metabolome , or conduct tests of the fluid in the burrows or in the animals themselves , we can make precise comparisons , and figure out what these animals have or do ( metabolically or chemically ) that lets them live where they live .

Although I am sure that being there would enhance my understanding of the animals and the system in which they live , and would help me formulate more and better questions about the anemones , ship time is expensive , especially in Antarctica , and if there are biologists whose contribution is predicated on being there , they should have priority to be there .

Weather conditions prevented biological sampling equipment being delivered from McMurdo Station , but the scientists retrieved 20 â€“ 30 anemones by using hot water to stun them before sucking them from their burrows with an improvised device fashioned from a coffee filter and a spare ROV thruster .

The technology that Frank and his colleagues are using to explore the ice is so important because , given our lack of data , we have no reasonable expectation of what it should be like , or what it should n't be like .

Some of the most intriguing questions are chemical ; do they produce some kind of antifreeze , and is that orange glow in the ROV lights their own ?

The samples we have are small in terms of numbers and they are all preserved in formalin ( a kind of formaldehyde solution ) .

The formalin is great for preserving structures , but for anemones , it prevents study of DNA or of the chemistry of the body .

I think to say it was unexpected is inaccurate , because it implies that there was a well-founded expectation of something .
