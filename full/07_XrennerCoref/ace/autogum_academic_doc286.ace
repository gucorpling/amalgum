Cellulose is hydrolyzed by three different classes of enzymes : endo-β-1,4-D-glucanases ( EC 3.2.1.4 ) , which hydrolyze internal β-1,4-glucosidic linkages , 1,4-β-D-glucan cellobiohydrolases ( EC 3.2.1.91 ) , which cleave off cellulose fragments from the cellulose chain ends , generating the cellobiose disaccharide and β-D-glucosidases ( EC 3.2.1.21 ) , which use cellobiose hydrolysis to generate glucose .
