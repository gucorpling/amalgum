We have always believed that it is of strategic importance to engage in different forms of political protest that are less costly in terms of human lives ; for example , in the form of general strikes and other forms civil disobedience â€“ which we witnessed all over Iranian Kurdistan on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the assassination of the Kurdish leader Dr. Ghassemlou on July 13 , 1989 , by the Islamic Republic in Vienna .

The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan is the oldest Kurdish political party in all four parts of Kurdistan and the most experienced political organisation in Iranian Kurdistan ; we have in the past waged a guerrilla war against the Islamic Republic from 1979 to 1997 , and although we are not rejecting armed struggle as a method , we think that there are other opportunities that are less costly in terms of human lives that are worth pursuing .

The PDKI is the leading Kurdish political party in Iranian Kurdistan ; in the first rounds of elections to the Majlis after the revolution , our party won an overwhelming majority of the votes in Iranian Kurdistan and our party leader at the time , Dr. Ghassemlou , was elected to the Council of Experts , which had the task of drafting the constitution , as the only secular member .

It should also be mentioned that the general strike on July 13 did not receive any attention by international media for the simple reason that the Islamic Republic has created a North Korea -like situation in Iranian Kurdistan where not only international media cannot gain access to the region , but it is also difficult for the Kurds themselves to inform the outside world about their plight .

Despite the focus of international attention on continued demonstrations against the Ahmedinejad government , an ongoing press blackout means little of the news , which does arrive from Iran , comes from the provinces which are home to 74 % of Iran 's population .

It seems like often , discussion of the politics in Kurdistan , whether in Iran , Iraq or Turkey , is dominated by discussion of communist or guerilla groups like the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) or the Communist Party of Iran .

Thus , even though we think it is important that international media pays attention to the situation in Iranian Kurdistan , for us it is more important to engage in forms of political activity that are of long-term significance .
