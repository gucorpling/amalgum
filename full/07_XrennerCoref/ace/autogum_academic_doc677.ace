As owner-related causes of delay , Khatib et al. suggested their financial problems and difficulties , change orders , delays and shortages of materials , poor site management and supervision , poor communication and coordination among construction parties , lowest bid awards , slow decisions , the contract type , delays in performing inspections and tests , and lack of clarity of the project ’s scope .

According to Frimpong et al. ’ s study , participants , material procurement , and frequent breakdowns in the construction plant and equipment contributed to projects ’ schedule delays . Koushki et al. studied the causes of time delays associated with the construction of private residential projects , particularly from the owner ’s and developer ’s perspectives .

Based on the factors reviewed above , this study selected seven owner-related causes of project delays : change in scope ; owner ’s poor supervision ; poor communication and coordination ; approval delay ; delay in procuring items , lowest bid tender award ; owner ’s inadequate fund or budget allocation , and materials/equipment damaged during construction .

They suggested ten owner-related problems that cause delays , including lack of strategic management , construction requirements , improper project feasibility study , lack of a clear bidding process , excessive change orders , unclear responsibility , lack of capable representatives , owner ’s financial difficulties , poor contract management , and slow decision making .

Among them , owner-related causes were the owner ’s slow decisions , shop drawings and samples ’ slow preparation and approval , the owner ’s change orders during construction , owner ’s financial problems for the project , and owner ’s delay in contractors ’ progress payment .

Odeh and Battaineh studied causes of schedule delays in construction projects with traditional types of contracts and identified eight major groups of causes : client- , contractor- , consultant- , material- , labor and equipment- , contract- , and external-related factors .

Previous studies have largely identified causes of construction project delays based on literature reviews and expert interviews , and the delay factors were classified into various groups depending upon each paper ’s authors , as follows .
