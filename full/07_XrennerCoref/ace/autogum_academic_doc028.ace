As part of a wide program to identify Tempranillo clones with enhanced WUE , the main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether , under realistic field conditions , the previously observed clonal differences in WUEi within Tempranillo cultivars were affected by environmental complex variations such as the “ year effect , ” commonly reported for grapevine harvest and quality .

In either case , to classify genotypes ’ WUE , the measurements of leaf gas exchange have been recognised as a useful tool because it is feasible to screen a large quantity of genotypes grown under field conditions and to characterize their behaviour under different water statuses .

As mentioned above , the WUEi , or photosynthetic water use efficiency , is obtained from the quotient between net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance , ( AN/gs ) and is largely used to qualify drought resistance or water scarcity responses in plants .

In our research group , after having identified differences in WUEi at the cultivar scale , and considering the narrow rules of wine regions to introduce new varieties , the next step has consisted of an intra-cultivar variability evaluation .

However , there is a strong mathematical influence of gs upon WUEi , because the soil water depletion is followed by a progressive reduction in gs thus WUE is largely dependent on the soil water availability for the plant .

However , to explore the genetic variation inside grapevine varieties and clones , and to identify the genetic material characterised by a better WUE , is also a promising way to improve the vineyard WUE .

In many semi-arid areas , dryland viticulture is becoming increasingly more challenging and sometimes is reconverted into irrigated crops , thus there is concern about the water scarcity increase linked to climatic change .

This consists of establishing a general WUEi-gs relationship ( log transformed for linearity ) based on the data of all genotypes that , in general , presents a high correlation coefficient .

Then , an average of the residuals of each genotype ( observed-predicted value ) is calculated ( and expressed in percentage ) , to rank the given genotype among the rest .

So , for most viticulture areas , improving the water use efficiency ( WUE ) of the grape is becoming more and more important to secure the sustainability of vineyards .

Grape quality components are largely dependent on an efficient water deficit , which can be achieved by adjusting irrigation but also the plant density or pruning management , .
