However , if I ca n't solo at all - would this game even be worth trying to get into with 1-2 hours of play in a session ? I have memories of desperately wanting to play a game like FFXI ( back when I had a lot of time ) but not being able to find a group , nudging along by killing what enemies I could alone .

Point is , put in some time here and there , set smaller goals and use weekends to put in some real work : ) If you find some friends and coordinate a bit its always possible to set up a full group run and get assembled in minutes after logging in to maximize time in dungeons .

I know what this game is , but there is something to be said for being able to jump into a game if you only have an hour or two and feel like you had a good play session .

Please do n't take this post as a knock on the game , quite the contrary - I 'm super interested in this game , I know what it 's about and how it will play .

The one caveat could be , while it may not be my first choice , I do n't mind playing a tank or healer or maybe even a support class to help find groups faster .

That 's not to say I do n't have very fond memories of that game as well when things were going well and I had time and I had a good group .

I remember how EQ played and I have extensive experience with Lineage 2 a few years later which was a similar camping type of game ( in my opinion ) .

So , while I 'm very interested in this game and truly ca n't wait to play it , my biggest fear is I wo n't have time to .

I still remember a dwarf I asked to join our group and he said “ Thanks , but today is my day at the forge ” .

I understand the grouping aspect and I 'm not asking them to change it and I 'm not saying it should be any different .

If you like crafting that can most likely be a way to spend days when you are short on playtime .
