Although ER stress plays an important role in mycobacterial infection , Ra-mediated ER stress was stronger than that induced by the virulent strain Rv .

The difference in mitochondrial fragmentation between infection with Rv and Ra is likely dependent on the levels of fusion/fission protein production .

Also , Ra induced a higher level of Parkin production than Rv , possibly due to different intensities of ER stress .
