We combine legitimacy theory with impression management theory to explain the environmental information disclosure of penalized companies , and try to examine the impact of environmental penalties on EID from two aspects of level and quality to find out which aspects of quality characteristics of environmental information have been affected by environmental penalties .

Based on the theory of legitimacy , some researchers found that companies will increase environmental disclosures under the circumstances of being prosecuted by the Environmental Protection Agency , being subject to regulatory fines , or facing environmental crises or accidents .

The researchers argued that if managers want to conceal negative aspects of the company , they will obfuscate negative outcomes by increasing reading difficulty in their annual reports or providing less complete information , and so on .

To fill these research gaps and help stakeholders understand the corporate EID under the environmental administrative penalty , the objective of the research is to reveal how environmental penalties affect the level and quality of EID .

Environmental events such as environmental penalties may affect voluntary EID or mandatory EID , but few studies have incorporated the voluntary disclosure and mandatory disclosure together to addresses the effects of environmental penalties on EID .

Previous research suggests that environmental disclosures in annual reports can be integrated as an environmental strategy or used as a self-serving tool to alleviate the crisis of legitimacy to gain legitimacy from stakeholders .

Among the quality characteristics of environmental information ( relevance , reliability , comprehensibility , comparability , balance , and integrality ) , which aspects of characteristics are affected by the environmental penalty ?

Content analysis is a general method to measure EID , but the method does not take into account the characteristics of information quality in measuring the quality of environmental information disclosure .

As profit-seeking entities , most organizations would be expected to react by undertaking strategies to reduce the negative effects that may flow from unexpected penalties .

Companies that are subject to environmental penalties are ultimately responsible for the punishment , and have to bear the related costs .
