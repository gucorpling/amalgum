This tilted decisional balance is seen in the plethora of perceived barriers to implementation that were mentioned in the focus groups , such as organizations being too small/too big , having too much hierarchy , an inability to make policy changes , not enough time , external management , difficulties in understanding the prevention efforts , worries about backlash , macho workplace values , and a lack of workplace buy-in .

Continued education at all levels of the community is necessary to help service providers and leaders conceptualize what prevention would look like , to engage community members in a conversation that takes FV beyond the simplistic victim/perpetrator dichotomy , and to change the story for regional women .

This may be due to the phenomenon described by cognitive science , that when facts are presented in a manner than is incongruent with a person ’s values , the facts will be rejected , not the values framework within which the person is functioning .

This is because the readiness for change in this group of early adopters will necessarily be higher than the overall community due to their previous engagement ; thus , their views can inform prevention efforts at all levels of the community .

Participants were clear about ‘ changing the conversation ’ as a metaphor for preventing FV , and they had suggestions about who should be involved , what ‘ the conversation ’ should include and how prevention efforts could be evaluated .

This model recognizes that communication is not a purely rational endeavor ; rather it theorizes that the frameworks of values and norms that each individual functions within have a large impact on their understanding and acceptance of facts .

Certain key organizational stakeholders were more progressed , at or beyond the planning phase , recognizing a strong impetus for change but impeded by limited resources and without detailed and focused plans or efforts to address FV .

In these early stages , leaders and community members believe that FV is an issue for the community , but there is no immediate intent to act , and the decisional balance is tipped towards the negatives .

The rates of harm from alcohol are considerably higher in rural than metropolitan areas , with rural residents more likely to engage in alcohol consumption that exceeds thresholds for short-term harm and long-term harm .

However , the conceptual link between increasing gender equality and preventing FV is not well understood , possibly due to the CRE Plan ’s lack of focus on this driver of FV .

The main argument against alcohol and drug use as a primary cause of FV is that it cannot explain the highly gendered patterns of violence perpetration and victimization .

Identifying alcohol and drug use as a primary cause of FV can also work to excuse violence , thus reinforcing the culture which condones it .
