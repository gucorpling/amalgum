There are no symptoms indicating a reduction in bone mass , and fractures are the only clinical consequences of OP ; therefore , despite being the most common bone disease , the incidence is difficult to establish , and the prevalence is often based on estimates using indirect indicators such as fractures .

In Spain , prevalence , as determined by densitometry , is about 30 % in women aged 50 years old , increasing to 50 % in women older than 70 years old . About 40 % of Caucasian women will suffer at least one bone fracture after their 50s .

The word diet comes from the Greek diaita and means ‘ way of life ’ and the MD holds true to this meaning as MD covers not only what to eat but how to eat and live ( active lifestyle , prioritizing culinary activities , etc. ) .
