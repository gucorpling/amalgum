Significant reduction in CO2 emission was confirmed by Akash et al. ; however , this study also showed that the use of CCS in power generation affects construction expenditure , and consequently , the cost of electricity caused by the lack of additional economic effects . Odenberger et al. showed that various CCS options ( offshore and onshore storage ) could have a significant impact on the development of energy in Europe in the coming decades .

The authors noted that these technologies are at an early stage of development ; however , in the near future they could be used in many areas , including the processing of plastic wastes . Chauvy et al. also described the assessment of various CCU technology readiness levels and a novel method for selecting optimal short- and medium-term CCU options .

At the same time , the negative environmental impacts of CCS and CCUS ( acidification , eutrophication , toxicity potential ) are much higher compared to most CCU technologies . Zhang et al. proposed a roadmap for the implementation of various CO2 sequestration options in China .
