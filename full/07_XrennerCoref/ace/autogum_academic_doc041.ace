There has been a significant effort by water management authorities to adopt new techniques in treatment plants such as UV and membrane treatment technology , mechanical ( ultrafiltration , reverse osmosis , nano-filtration ) , ultrasonic ( ozonation ) , biological ( active filters and enzymes ) , adsorption ( activated carbon ) , and combinations of these processes to eliminate and partially remove microbes in wastewater .

Most water-borne pathogens are spread through the fecal â€“ oral route , and find their way to wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs ) through excreted feces in raw sewage from infected people or in drinking water , or by eating food exposed to contaminated water , which could lead to serious health complications .
