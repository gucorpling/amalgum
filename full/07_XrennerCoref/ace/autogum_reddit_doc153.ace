It would n't make a big difference but you can set your own heating curve , max temp , set a timer that takes it into a standby mode so when you leave it on the table the tip wo n't be damaged from the heat , thanks to an accelerometer integrated into it .

I 'm an EE student so I figured I 'd be doing a decent bit of soldering in the future , so a few days ago I ordered a soldering iron , leadless solder , a solder wick , brass wool and some flux .

You might think it 's good for your health but what you really want to avoid is the smoke of the flux which is inside of the solder , no matter what type it is .

Also , I would n't recommend using a steel brass wool as it might damage the tip of the soldering iron , especially if you 're using the aforementioned cheap irons .

Do any other EE students/people who know how to solder have any ideas as to what would some good things to do for practice ? Thank you !

Finally , this depends on your soldering iron but if you bought a cheap plastic one then the tip is probably a very soft metal .

I know how to use them ( at least on a basic level ) , but so far they 're kinda just sitting there .

I do n't know why exactly and I ca n't really explain the difference , try both and see for yourself I guess .

A CRT TV board would work better as those have all kinds of different soldering points such as holes , pads and etc.

It 'll be shiny and you 'll be proud of yourself when you see your reflection on the blob of solder .

For practising , I 'd just go to an old computer shop and ask them if they have a broken board .

Also , most people do n't pay attention to this but lead-free solder has a shelf life due to oxidization .

Maybe your school only allows lead-free solder , if that 's the case then there 's nothing to do .

Both lead-free and 60 40 have it so why do n't you just go with the 60 40 one .

What I use is a digital DC powered TS100 soldering iron , you can go crazy with it .

Jokes aside , it 's a lot easier to learn to solder with a lead based solder .

If you use excessive heat you might oxidize it and it 'll never be the same .

I went to a soldering workshop about a month ago where I learned how to solder .

However you can use lead based solder that your grandpa used a couple of decades ago .

What kinds of things did you do when you first were learning to solder ?

Just get a kitchen sponge soak it into water and use that instead .
