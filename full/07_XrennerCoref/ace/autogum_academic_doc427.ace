Its disposal is , on one hand , problematic due to the environmental degradation of water bodies resulting in the increasing salinity level and its content in critical raw materials and , on the other hand , challenging in eliminating the contained metal elements .

SLCA is described as “ a social impact assessment technique that aims to assess the social and socio-economic aspects of products and their potential positive and negative impacts along their life cycle ” .

SLCA follows the same framework as the LCA method , from the goal and scope definition phase to the life cycle inventory , the life cycle impact assessment , and interpretation phases .
