Her house ( known in the neighborhood as the Maison Vauquer ) receives men and women , old and young , and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable establishment ; but , at the same time , it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years , and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest .

The only audience who could appreciate the results of close observation , the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color , are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre , in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud , a vale of sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow ; but this audience is so accustomed to terrible sensations , that only some unimaginable and well-neigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there .

On the opposite wall , at the further end of the graveled walk , a green marble arch was painted once upon a time by a local artist , and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing Cupid is installed ; a Parisian Cupid , so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals , and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism .

That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late ; it has been overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature ; but it must do service again here , not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word , but because some tears may perhaps be shed intra et extra muros before it is over .
