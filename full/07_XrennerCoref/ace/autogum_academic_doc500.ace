In the United Kingdom ( UK ) , national guidelines recommend people with acute stroke have their swallow screened within 4 h of hospital admission by a specifically trained healthcare professional and , if dysphagia is suspected , the person should have a specialist swallow assessment by a speech and language therapist ( SLT ) within 72 h of admission ( Supplementary Table S1 : Summary of Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ) Clinical Guideline for Stroke ) .

The RCP Clinical Guideline for Stroke state that there is good evidence that a multi-item DSP that includes at least a water test of 10 teaspoons and a lingual motor test is more accurate than screening protocols with a single item , but do not recommend a standardised screen .

Interviews with staff responsible for dysphagia screening , assessment and or clinical management of stroke patients were undertaken as part of a mixed methods research design to inform the development of a national survey of hospitals registered in the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme ( SSNAP ) database .

Further studies are needed to test this and screening for oral aerobic Gram-negative bacteria as well as the need to evaluate if treatment with proton pump inhibitors and nasogastric tubes ( NGT ) are associated with SAP in patients with dysphagia .

The aim of the interview study was to explore beyond the 4-h and 72-h audit criteria for screening and assessing patients for dysphagia to give a more rounded picture of care beyond the SSNAP performance indicators .
