Add in gun rammer , vents , BIA , and make sure you also have the Snap Shot skill on your gunner ( helps reduce bloom a bit on turret rotation , which in turn also helps with the vert stabs ) and you have this monstrosity :

Oh , did I forget to mention that if you learn which tanks you can easily overmatch turret roofs on , then you can easily pen many of the heavies you will face in their turret roofs with AP rounds .

In fact , I think the O-Ni is the only tank in the line I did n't like ( and this was pre-buff to the Type 4 Type 5 ) .

3,889 DPM ( yes , probably closer to 1,944 due to non-pens , but trust me , you will get pens on thin skinned targets to help with this )

O-Ho is certainly a more painful grind than the O-Ni but you do still get the odd battle that 's fine .
