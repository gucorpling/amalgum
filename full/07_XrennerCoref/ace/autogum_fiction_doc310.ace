Robert took a cracker , Cyril and Anthea had Roman candles ; but Jane ’s fat paw closed on the gem of the whole collection , the Jack-in-the-box that had cost two shillings , and one at least of the party -- I will not say which , because it was sorry afterwards -- declared that Jane had done it on purpose .
