I embedded a few of the animals in wax and then cut them into very thin slices using a microtome , mounted the slices on microscope slides , stained the slices to enhance contrast , and then looked at those slides under a compound microscope ( that 's how I got the pictures of the muscles etc in the paper ) .

Just knowing a whole lot about a single species is n't very useful , even if that animal is as special as these clearly are — we need to know what about them is different and thus related to living in this strange way .

Once we figured out what it was , we played a lot of manuscript email tag , which can be challenging and time consuming given the differing schedules that folks keep in terms of travel , field work , etc.

By comparing my observations to what my colleagues and predecessors had found , I figured out what group it belongs to , and was able to determine that within that group , it was a new species .

In terms of their glow , I suspect that it 's not theirs — although luminescence is common in anemone relatives , they do n't usually make light themselves .

What sort of difficulties were posed by the unorthodox preservatives used , and what additional work might be possible on a specimen with intact DNA ?

They do make a host of florescent proteins , and these may interact with the light of the ROV to give that gorgeous glow .

I used a dissecting scope to look at the animal 's external anatomy and overall body organization ( magnification of 60X ) .

I used that same compound scope to look at squashed bits of tissue to see the stinging capsules ( = nematocysts ) .

I compared the things I saw under the ' scopes to what had been published on other species in this group .

Some of that time was just lost time — I had other projects in the queue that I needed to finish .

It was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication , why did it take so long ?

It was about two years from when Frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out .
