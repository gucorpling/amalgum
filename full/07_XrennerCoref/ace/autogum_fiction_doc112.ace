He remembered her now , of course : remembered her as one of the shadowy sidling presences in the background of that awful house in Chelsea , one of the dumb appendages of the shrieking unescapable Mrs. Murrett , into whose talons he had fallen in the course of his head-long pursuit of Lady Ulrica Crispin .

He had really been getting to like her -- had recovered , under the candid approval of her eye , his usual sense of being a personable young man , with all the privileges pertaining to the state , instead of the anonymous rag of humanity he had felt himself in the crowd on the pier .
