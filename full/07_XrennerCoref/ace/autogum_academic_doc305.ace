The matching value can be calculated between the contour image to be recognized and the image in the existing image set and then the category of the image with the largest matching value can then be taken as the vehicle recognition result .

After contour thinning and speckle reduction , the vehicle contour is much clearer than before , and it is convenient to detect the contour line , calculate the rotation angle of the vehicle , and other contour data .

Additionally , since the projection data is much smaller than the image data , it is very convenient and cost-effective to store the projection features , and the projection features of all the images can be saved .

Therefore , if only a simple size feature , such as the length or width of the contour , is used , it is difficult to recognize the model of the vehicle .

The image set that was obtained after selection process retains some representative images , but many images are also removed , and some features of this model are inevitably lost .

Moreover , the image set containing all images loses the significance of studying representative features , and it becomes unnecessarily large and redundant .
