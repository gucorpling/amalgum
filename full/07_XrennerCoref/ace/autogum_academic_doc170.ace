For example , a propeller with an 8.8 inch diameter and 8.75 inch pitch had an efficiency ranging from appropriate 0 to 60 % as the Advance ratio ( a parameter proportional to wind tunnel speeds and reversely proportional to Revolutions Per Second and Propeller Diameter ) increased , and a large-sized propeller with a 12 inch diameter/pitch had a maximum efficiency of approximately 80 % .

Because the basic propeller experimental data is important , Merchant had measured data ( Blade number , thrust , torque and revolutions per minute , etc. ) of small propellers with a diameter ranging from 6 to 22 inches , and the calculated results showed the efficiency of some propellers .

In the follow-up study , the velocity of the vehicle can be increased by improving the efficiency of the system through enlarging the propeller , and the velocity can be larger than 5 m/s when the efficiency is 70 % according to Table 4 .

Using the conventional method , the design and fabrication of a ball based system must consider details such as the complicated platform velocity kinematic relations , the cooperative work of the motor control system and the position precision of the fabricated three-dimensional structures .

Further , maybe a more certain experimental condition is necessary for the measurement of basic performance data , such as the testing of both static and dynamic conditions in a wind tunnel , which was conducted in a study by Brezina et al. .

In this study , in order to make the control simple and easy to understand , a series of operations of the forward/backward movement of the vehicle/fan were conducted by pushing up to 10 pairs of numbers on the universal television remote .

Second , it is difficult to make precise movements with the vehicle , because the thrust of propeller is difficult to manipulate immediately after the start of the fan ( fan acceleration period ) , which causes the movement to be imprecise .

Therefore , to improve the precision of vehicle motion , it is necessary to consider the motion pattern such as the time point to move after the propeller start or the integration of a velocity prediction curve into the control program .

However , the concept may not be specific for the propulsion of a vehicle with ball-based wheels , but it may be suitable for the Mecanum wheels if only the propulsion method is considered .

It is obvious that a deeper understanding of the performance data , or a detailed motion plan is required , such as the auto control of the servo together with the DC motor .

Therefore , the performance of the fabricated system suggests that the propeller is suitable for the holonomic vehicle driving , although the efficiency of the other type of propeller was not investigated .

, it is not coincidental that for an applied propeller , a large efficiency value directly increases the motion velocity , and further increases the thrust exerted on the vehicle .

Alternatively , a selection of commercially-available parts such as motors , propellers , ball wheels , etc. , may be enough for the assembly of a holonomic vehicle .

Because the efficiency of the propeller is determinative for the velocity and thrust , a propeller design or a proper propeller selection is crucial to improve the efficiency .

Ball-based wheels indeed have many advantages over the Mecanum wheel design , such as reduced friction between the wheel and the ground and a higher motion velocity .
