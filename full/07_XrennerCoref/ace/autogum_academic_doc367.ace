To understand the seasonality of dust intrusions over Europe , Marinou et al. performed a 9-year study of Saharan dust transport based on satellite data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation ( CALIPSO ) and lidar ground-based measurements from the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network ( EARLINET ) .

Also , dust is influencing the severity of respiratory conditions ( e. g. , asthma ) especially when significant quantities of particulate matter ( PM ) including dust are present in the air ( i. e. , an increase of more than 10 g m in PM , ) .

Not only the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea ( [ 16,24 ] for Greece ) but also those located in central and southeastern Europe ( e. g. , for Romania , for Hungary ) are affected by Saharan dust transport which can negatively impact the daily activities .

The analysis is based on the continuous measurements performed at the Romanian Atmospheric 3D Observatory ( RADO ) situated near Bucharest which allowed the analysis of the type of mineral particles transported , the chemical composition of the refractory or non-refractory aerosols and their physical properties .

Saharan dust particles can also carry bacteria over long distances ( e. g. , the Alps ) despite the low temperatures and UV radiation at which the are exposed during transport .

Thus , under certain meteorological conditions the dust can reach high altitudes later being detected at the ground due to the dry and wet depositions ( e. g. , ) .
