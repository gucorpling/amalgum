On Earth , worms and clams that live in the muddy sea beds require 1 mg per liter , bottom feeders such as crabs and oysters 3 mg per liter , and spawning migratory fish 6 mg per liter , all within 0.2 moles per cubic meter , 6.4 mg per liter .

Does your paper 's value of up to 0.2 moles of oxygen per cubic meter , the same as Earth 's sea water , mean that there could potentially be life on Mars as active as our sea worms or even fish ?

The temperatures for the highest levels of oxygen are really low , -133°C , so , is the idea that this oxygen would be retained when the brines warm up to more habitable temperatures during the day or seasonally ?

Or — is the idea that it has to be some exotic biochemistry that works only at ultra low temperatures like Dirk Schulze-Makuch ' s life based on hydrogen peroxide and perchlorates internal to the cells as antifreeze ?

Stamenković et al 's paper is theoretical and is based on a simplified general circulation model of the Mars atmosphere — it ignores distinctions of seasons and the day / night cycle .

Stamenković 's team combined it with a chemical model of how oxygen would dissolve in the brines and used this to predict oxygen levels in such brines at various locations on Mars .

Mars would be high enough for the least demanding aerobic ( oxygen-using ) microbes , for all the brines they considered , and all the methods of calculation .

Second , the major reason for limiting life at low temperature is ice nucleation , which would not occur in the type of brines that we study .
