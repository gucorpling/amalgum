> Everyone was n't a fan of Lin ] being the new star In free agency , Jeremy Lin got a 4 year $28.8million offer from the Rockets that was only guaranteed for 3 years . It came out to $7.2million/year . Knicks were ready to match , but the Rockets came back with a 3 year $25million deal where they backloaded it . It came to about $5million for the first 2 years , and $ 14.9 million for the final 3rd year . For the first 2 years , Lin would 've only been their 4th highest paid player behind Stoudemire(20million ) , Carmelo(21 million ) , and Chandler(13.5million ) . [ While on the US Olympic team that summer , Carmelo was asked about if Jeremy Lin would come back to the Knicks , to which Melo called it a ridiculous contract > " It 's not up to me , " Anthony said with a laugh .
