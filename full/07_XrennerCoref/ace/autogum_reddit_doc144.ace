So there 's just a bunch of fields where you fill out all your info , pick the stuff you wanna order , when you need it by , if you wanna make any changes to each item , how much of each item you need , etc , and finally you click submit and all the data is taken , and parsed through where I put it through to an HTML template I have made which then I convert to a PDF and email to the customer and my family friend .

How much would something like this cost to make ? I ca n't really count the hours because this sort of stuff just intrigues me so throughout the day I 'm thinking of how I could do it in my mind , and when I 'm on the bus or train I 'm googling different packages and trying to learn ways to do what needs to be done .

So yeah , how much would be a reasonable amount to charge him if he was just a regular customer asking for a website to be made ? ( I 'm probably going to take off a good % of it since he 's a family friend who 's helped my family a lot )

The customer downloads the excel sheet , fills it out , emails it to the person ( in this case , my family friend ) and he has an invoice created using the info from the excel sheet and he emails it back to them .

I created a website where there is n't really an amazing front end ( just slapped materialize onto it ) since they will come to this website after visiting the parent companies website which would mean they already intend to order stuff .

So it just saves all the work of the user having to download and fill a file and send it to my friend and then wait for them to respond with the invoice and etc.

However if I had to guess , from beginning to end I did this in about a week and this was my main focus throughout this whole week .
