For example , Via Michelin , an excellent service , has recently become very irritating because it carries so much advertising , in addition animated as well so that it is difficult to concentrate on what I want to do there for all the moving stuff .

: The web was invented in Europe , but it grew exponentially and to some extent the invention has exploded in your face ; at any point did you feel that the WWW had been hijacked by the United States ?

If they want , sites can of course also distinguish between a paying entrance after which there are no more adverts and things work faster , and an entrance that is free but full of adverts .

And I could of course set limits by telling the browser to warn me if I spend more than 10 Euros a day or when a site charges more than a cent for a page , etc.

For example : I sometimes want to look up a word in the Oxford English Dictionary , but not so often that I find it worth my while to pay for the subscription .

With micropayments and digital money I would be able to pay Oxford a tiny sum for each time I consult the dictionary , but without having to pay a full subscription .

The principle of an information market with micropayments is simple and it is not new ( the French Minitel has had it since the early 80s ) .

A good implementation of micropayments must also provide comfort : I should not have to log in or agree , my computer automatically pays behind the scenes .

In this way I could read the news in several papers without having to pay a complete subscription to each and having to log in .

In short , there is then a true market for information , directly between the seller and the customer .

Manner 2 is used often but puts off people because of the high level of the subscription .

That bars the reader from using many different sites , e.g. to browse many newspapers .

Manner 3 is the most used even if that is not pleasant for the user .
