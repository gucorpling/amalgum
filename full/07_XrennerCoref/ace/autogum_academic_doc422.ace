In aquatic environments , the use of δ15N ( a measure of the abundance of the heavier isotope 15N relative to the lighter isotope 14N ) as potential indicators of land-use intensification and nitrogen enrichment has been suggested for streams and rivers , ponds and lakes , estuaries and coastal waters .

To our knowledge , no studies have investigated the combined effects of multiple , simultaneously operating agricultural stressors on consumer stable isotope ratios , even though non-additive effects such as antagonisms and synergisms have been documented from experiments assessing changes in diversity and ecosystem processes in freshwater ecosystems .

δ15N values of common primary consumers ( grazers ) will show similar patterns along the gradients of catchment land-use intensity because they all feed on one resource ( periphyton ) and are therefore ingesting food with the same isotopic composition ;

Nor have previous studies focused on multiple primary consumers : most have investigated the relationship between a single primary consumer taxon or calculated δ15N values from several taxa combined where the focal consumer taxon was not present at all sites .

Against this background , we studied consumer stable isotope values at 43 stream sites spanning wide gradients of land-use intensity ( sheep/beef farming intensity and streamflow reduction ) within an agricultural river catchment , to test the following hypotheses :

Moreover , they have been used as bioindicators because they are widely distributed in running waters and generally reflect the isotopic values of their periphyton food sources ( after taking into account enrichment through trophic fractionation ) .

Most of the existing stream studies have reported positive linear relationships between δ15N values and catchment land-use intensity , although Larson et al. reported a saturation curve for δ15N values along a wide gradient of % agriculture .

Most ecosystems are exposed to multiple environmental stressors acting simultaneously and combined multiple-stressor effects can be difficult to predict because they can be larger or smaller than expected based on the effects of the individual stressors involved .

Any of these stressors may alter stream nitrogen dynamics , for example by flow reduction intensifying in-stream nitrogen transformation processes such as denitrification by increasing water retention times , respiration rates and occurrence of anoxic conditions .

δ15N values are positively related to catchment land-use intensities because higher farming intensity and greater flow reduction increase the input of heavy isotopes from fertilisation and increase the intensity of nitrogen transformation processes ; and

Agricultural land use can impose a variety of stressors on stream ecosystems , including nutrient enrichment , increased sediment load , higher light availability and augmented water temperatures due to removal of riparian vegetation .

δ15N values follow antagonistic response patterns along the gradients of land-use intensity and flow reduction because both stressors have strong individual effects and their joint effects cannot exceed 100 % .

Further , gaseous nitrogen losses through denitrification and ammonia volatilisation can lead to even more elevated δ15N values of the nitrogen initially derived from both inorganic fertilizer and manure .

Delta 15N values differ between nitrogen sourced from precipitation , fertilizer and sewage , and also due to subsequent fractionation during assimilation by plants and other nitrogen transformation processes .

Compared to the high spatiotemporal variation of periphyton stable isotope values , grazers provide a more time-integrated and habitat-integrated measure of nitrogen sources and transformation processes .
