Among them are the identification of genetic modifiers , affecting the penetrance of homozygous pathogenic MVK : p. ( Val377Ile ) variant ; the lack of detection of pathogenic variants in patients with a clear given phenotype , such as pathogenic canonical splice site variants not covered by Sanger and panel approaches ( e. g. , ADA2 : c. -47+2T>C ) ; or large chromosomal rearrangements , encompassing several genes in patients with complex phenotypes .

In those reports , for example , frequent variants , such as p. ( Glu148Gln ) ( MEFV ) , p. ( Arg121Gln ) ( TNFRSF1A ) , or p. ( Val198Met ) ( NLRP3 ) , and all known susceptibility factors for inflammation were considered consistent with the diagnosis .

In an attempt to find a cause that could explain the low rate of genetic confirmation using panels in the patients referred to us , we wondered whether validation of the request by a specialized reference center could improve this performance .

The low performance of the AIDs panel might also be explained by our study design that did not include most of the patients with features of FMF , MKD , and DADA2 because they were screened by Sanger sequencing .

This observation possibly stems from a better detection by NGS of the new molecular mechanisms involved in AIDs ( mosaicism , CNVs ) and better information on these three diseases because they are among the best-described AIDs .

In addition to the successful clinical option we demonstrated here , it is easy to predict the upcoming discovery of new genes or molecular mechanisms involved in AIDs that will continue to revolutionize our routine genetic diagnosis .

Moreover , our definition was more stringent than these four previous studies because we considered that we could not conclude on the diagnosis when the parent ’s DNA was lacking segregation analyses of heterozygous rare VOUS .

The success of the NGS approach was suggested to rely on its use in the context of a highly specialized clinical service for patients with AIDs .

This result reflects daily practice because the cutaneous/mucosal , digestive tract , and musculoskeletal systems are the three most common systems involved in AIDs .

Also , our reference center recently offered a diagnostic checklist to guide practitioners who may suspect an AID for ordering genetic tests .

If this value appears to be low , the reference center recommends that no NGS be conducted in discussion with geneticists .
