The team wanted to expand upon research using single atoms or molecules , instead constructing a four- micrometre thick sphere of calcium carbonate , in a crystaline form called vaterite , in a bid to examine systems containing over a million atoms .

With the ball held within a vacuum by a laser trap , the scientists were able to apply a twisting force through the light 's polarisation ( orientation ) as it passed through the ball .

The microscopic gyroscope is levitated by the laser beam coming from below which at the same time is used to apply a torque to the gyroscope .

The vacuum eliminated air resistance so that scientists could look for evidence of quantum friction , a proposed force that slows spinning particles without external assistance .

The fundamental aspect that raised our interest is the mechanism that stops an object [ rotating ] infinitely fast in absence of friction .

One can also imagine other interesting mechanisms and we hope that future experiments will be able to conclusively distinguish between them .
