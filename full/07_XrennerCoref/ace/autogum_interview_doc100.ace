Instead it found what ANDRILL director Frank Rack of the University of Nebraska – Lincoln , a co-author of the paper describing the find , called the " total serendipity " of " a whole new ecosystem that no one had ever seen before " .

With only their tentacles protruding into the water from the underneath of the ice shelf questions also revolve around how the animals avoid freezing , how they reproduce , and how they cope with the continuously melting nature of their home .

The cameras also observed worms , fish that swim inverted as if the icy roof was the sea floor , crustaceans and a cylindrical creature that used appendages on its ends to move and to grab hold of the anemones .

Discovered by the ANDRILL [ Antarctic Drilling ] project , the team was so unprepared for biological discoveries they did not have suitable preservatives and the only chemicals available obliterated the creature 's DNA .

In their thousands they were doing what no other species of sea anemone is known to do — they were living in the ice itself .
