A solution has many kinds of changes after perturbation , so even if the current solution is perturbed into the solution that has appeared in previous iterations , it will change in other directions when perturbed again , which will not have a negative impact on the results .

Metropolis criterion is that the algorithm allows the inferior solution to be accepted with a certain probability , so that the algorithm can jump out of the trap of the local optimum .

The algorithm is designed with the memory function of the optimal solution in the existing iteration process , that is , to remember the ‘ best so far ’ state .

Each operator can be executed independently or simultaneously , for example , one line can be added while another line can be deleted at the same time .

As the iteration proceeds , the solution in the memory base is continuously updated until the algorithm converges .

Therefore , the objective value will approach the global optimum gradually in the iterative process .
