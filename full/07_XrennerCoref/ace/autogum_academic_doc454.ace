In addition to a reduction in body weight and an improved metabolic profile — characterized by reduced plasma glucose and HbA1c levels — we observed a reduction in mitochondrial superoxide production in diabetic patients after treatment with the iSGLT2 empagliflozin , together with increased antioxidant defenses .

However , neither the reduction in HbA1c observed in the study ( 0.60 % over 12 weeks ) nor the reduction in SBP ( up to 5 mmHg ) are sufficient to explain the reported protection against cardiovascular mortality .

Oxidative stress occurs when the production of pro-oxidant species overcomes the intrinsic antioxidant defense system of the cell , thus triggering damage to lipids , proteins and DNA , and eventually compromising cellular and tissue function .

Nevertheless , despite the available evidence , the molecular mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular protection attributable to iSGLT2 treatment are still unknown , though amelioration of oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be a potential contributor .

Interestingly , as little as 24 weeks of treatment with iSGLT2 is sufficient to witness their beneficial effects on HbA1c , body weight , blood pressure and , most importantly , on the cardiovascular system .

A recent study demonstrated an improved arterial stiffness after 6 weeks of treatment with empagliflozin in T2D patients , and hs-CRP was shown to be one of the main significant determinants for this improvement .

Our data demonstrate that T2D patients receiving iSGLT2 treatment undergo a reduction in mitochondrial superoxide production in parallel to an increase in glutathione content , and markedly so after 24 weeks of treatment .

This has been reflected by several studies , such as the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study in which a reduction of 38 % in cardiovascular mortality was evident in the empagliflozin vs. placebo group .

iSGLT2s are a new class of oral hypoglycaemic drugs that block glucose reabsorption at the renal level , thus promoting urine glucose and sodium excretion and reducing plasma glucose levels .

Because cardiac tissue possesses low antioxidant defenses , increasing the expression or activity of antioxidant enzymes could be a mechanism of cardiac protection under high risk situations such as T2D .
