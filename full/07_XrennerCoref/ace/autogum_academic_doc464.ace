Only a few studies have compared the leukotoxicity of A. actinomycetemcomitans with the LtxA expression and production defined as a quantification of the LtxA , e. g. , by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , or mRNA coding for LtxA , but it seems reasonable to assume that the two factors are related .

In the present study , we aimed to investigate if the leukotoxicity of a collection of Ghanaian A. actinomycetemcomitans , serotype b , is related to the LtxA production of the strains determined by Western blotting and ELISA , and LtxA expression as determined in a mRNA expression assay .

This leukotoxicity is determined by use of cell lysis assays , where human immune cells are exposed either to the bacteria or to purified LtxA , and most often the leukotoxicity is correlated with the JP2 or non-JP2 genotype of the A. actinomycetemcomitans strain .

Furthermore , we wanted to compare the results obtained by ELISA and mRNA expression assay to elucidate the relationship between the two quantification methods used to determine leukotoxic potential as the LtxA production and expression of A. actinomycetemcomitans , respectively .

A higher expression of the mRNA , encoding the ltxA , has been reported to correspond with a higher leukotoxic potential , but also a variation in the activity of LtxA in some A. actinomycetemcomitans has been reported .

This discovery marked the beginning of an era , where the detection of the 530-bp deletion categorized highly leukotoxic A. actinomycetemcomitans strains as a member of the JP2 clone of A. actinomycetemcomitans , possessing enhanced virulence .

Therefore , it has been the common believe that the leukotoxicity of an A. actinomycetemcomitans strain could be explained by the 530-bp deletion , an explanation supported by recent results presented by Sampathkumar and co-workers .

Based on in vitro studies , it was reported that the JP2 genotype of A. actinomycetemcomitans has a 10 – 20 fold higher lytic activity than the non-JP2 genotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans .

Furthermore , longitudinal clinical studies reported a clear correlation between being carrier of the JP2 genotype of A. actinomycetemcomitans and having an increased risk of developing periodontitis at a young age .
