This aspect reflects the need to involve more social services in the management of assigning people to the various paths and in the relationships with the tutors and the activities that have been carried out in this project , but which certainly represents an aspect to be strengthened and developed further .

In fact , since the classroom is structured with the constant presence of a social tutor , it is easier to follow and monitor the participant ’s growth path , supporting each individual in dealing in a timely manner with the various difficulties that could arise in the context of work .

The self-assessment ability related to the psycho-attitudinal skills improved at the beginning of the farm stage ( compared to the classroom ) , confirmed by the capacity of participants to understand what was required from them and by having a deeper comprehension of the meaning of the indicators .

This would make it possible to obtain greater and richer information ( relative to the meaning of the different scores assigned to each aspect of the model ) , as well as a more holistic understand of the organizational mechanisms and dynamics and the value of the evaluation .

The comparison of indicators showed that it was difficult for the participants , mostly those belonging to the mental health area , to evaluate themselves , which was reflected on the differences found between their own assessment and the evaluation made by their tutor and the trainers .

Some studies in the literature have provided qualitative analysis ( Boyce and Neale 2006 ; Hassink and Van Dijk 2006 ; Kawulich 2005 ; Sempik et al. 2014 ) ; our study attempted to provide some results linked to psycho-attitudinal and technical skills .

Moreover , in a previous study ( Hassink et al. 2010 ) , a specific program of activities in a classroom and on a farm had a positive effect on activity participation , with an increased number of activities performed by the participants .

The analysis of the assessment forms then suggested that perhaps “ too often ” the participants were initially scored with the maximum level envisaged by the model and this , in fact , hinders any possibility to improve the initial assessment .

Given that their inclusion in the paths represented a novelty for many participants , almost of all the parameters have been assessed by the participants with a higher rating score than that provided by the trainers .

As argued by Gagliardi et al. ( 2019 ) and Sempik ( 2008 ) , “ conducting thorough research in the context of social farming is challenging due to both practical and technical difficulties . ”

As reported previously ( Elings and Beerens 2012 ) , farm experiences promote the participants ’ social relationships with different people , such as tutors , training staff , and other participants sharing the activities .

This scientific research is still at an early stage and often focuses on analyzing the impact of a certain social farming paths on a group of participants to gain an overall view of their effectiveness .

This difference may be due to the fact that the services included participants who , apart from the motivation to enter this type of path , had no previous experience or technical knowledge in agriculture .

As Kaley et al. ( 2019 ) highlights , the aspects on which the participants improved are linked to psycho-attitudinal skills , in particular those connected to basic skills in the working world .

In spite of all the advantages that could be observed , difficulties in obtaining a completely objective , quick , and comparable measurement of the results achieved by the participants is acknowledged .

In this case , compared to the results from the classroom , coming into contact with a real entrepreneurial reality facilitated the improvement of knowledge in the agricultural field .

Among those limitations , it is undoubtedly useful to highlight the complexity of the context ( classroom and farm stage ) which would require more flexible data collection forms .

However , while numerous benefits of social farming were identified , the impact of social farming on the everyday lives of people with intellectual disabilities varied substantially .

In addition , the farm stage path is significant , especially in terms of theoretical knowledge of the technical aspects , but not of skills and abilities .
