Existing studies specific to copper include a long-term forecast for the U.S. focused only on the front end of material life cycle , a long-term outlook for intensity of use and in-use stocks that is global in focus with general regional breakdowns , a global outlook of supply and demand , nonspecific to the U.S. , as well as a forecast for global and U.S. copper , but only of production .

Several research studies have attempted to assess the criticality of future demand for materials generally metals , and even specifically copper , but such assessments typically do not take into account the relevance of circularity and the circular economy , focusing mostly on the front-end of the material life cycle and not assessing end-of-life ( EoL ) and scrap flows which play a major role in meeting demand and material availability .

Material demand patterns generally have been studied since the 1950s , and socio-economic theories have predicted “ dematerialization ” or “ decoupling ” of material consumption from economic growth and development for several decades , though the predicted absolute decrease in material consumption has not been observed at the scale of the national economy .

The growth in demand for copper globally , coupled with environmental impacts of extraction and processing , speak to the need for assessment of the life cycle of the material and its circularity , so that reserves may be prolonged and the embedded energy and environmental footprint of copper may be improved .

This study investigated prospects for circularity in the future ( up to 2030 ) by forecasting material flows including production , use , and recovery of copper in the U.S. An assessment of the environmental footprint associated with the projected primary and secondary copper production was also performed .

In the development of material flow forecasts , therefore , inclusion of indicators that represent dematerialization or decoupling , which can be represented by material efficiency measurements , was done and potential implications for the copper circular economy into the future were considered .

Previous works differ from this study in that their time frame of forecasts tend to be shorter term , or the scope of the forecast did not include a complete material life cycle , but only a subset of the entire material life .

Another study , by Schandl et al. focused on production and consumption of materials , but in larger regions , which may be problematic in that trends have been shown to vary dramatically even within a region depending on economic development .

However , starting around the year 2000 , copper consumption , both absolute and per capita , and from both primary and secondary copper sources , in the U.S. has declined steadily following steady growth throughout the 20th century .

Copper is among the most important metals in the U.S. due to its widespread use in the economy in large amounts in both commercial and residential sectors .
