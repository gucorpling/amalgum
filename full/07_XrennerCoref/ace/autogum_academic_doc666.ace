Additionally , wild animals from the diverse orders Artiodactyla , Carnivora and the superorder Xenarthra have been reported to be serologically positive for anti-YFV antibodies , and the elicitation of antibody responses against YFV indicates a potentially productive infection within these species , indicating that diverse mammalian species could represent YFV potential reservoirs ( see Section 8.3 ) .

Finally , while many flaviviruses share the common ability to antagonize IFN signaling and therefore enhance viral replication , the YFV NS5 is unable to bind murine STAT2 and in contrast to ZIKV and DENV , is unable to engage human STAT2 in murine cells .

Thus , the generation of an immunocompetent mouse model would be beneficial , which could be realized by knocking out downstream specific anti-YFV effectors that directly inhibit differential aspects of the YFV lifecycle , rather than upstream master-regulators of the antiviral response .

However , while patterns of YFV-17D dissemination in immunocompetent mice were restricted , infection of IFNAR knockout mice resulted in broad dissemination preceding viral clearance , indicating that no barriers to dissemination exist in the absence of type I IFN .

Double-humanized mice have been developed , possessing both human immune systems and hepatocytes , and these animals represent ideal tools for monitoring systemic YFV infection in vivo as both compartments are permissive for YFV .

Furthermore , while I and II type IFNs contribute to control of YFV-17D infection , type III IFN was demonstrated to have immunomodulatory functions and was protective against YFV-17D neuroinvasion in mouse models .
