The developed system has been financed by the Spanish Plan Nacional , with support from interested partners like the Hospital Nacional de Parapléjicos de Toledo ( HNPT ) and the Instituto Nacional de Educación Física ( INEF ) , and has received input from other experts in the fields of rehabilitation and gait analysis , helping to focus on the more relevant design issues .

This work tries to bridge this gap by presenting an innovative self-propelled ambulatory system for gait rehabilitation with lower body movement induction , PBWS and body stabilization designed for clinical environments , named HYBRID ( Hybrid Technological Platform for Rehabilitation , Functional Compensation and Training of Gait in SCI Patients ) .

On top of that , these trainers cannot generate a gait movement synchronized with the system ’s absolute speed or force the patient to maintain a posture conductive to put on an exoskeleton — a process involving important physical effort and lengthy preparation times .

Recent studies have demonstrated that training using HAL is effective in improving ambulatory mobility for patients with stroke or spinal cord injury . Robotic training led to an improvement in walking parameters and in balance abilities , with increases in the WISCI-II score .

To address these shortcomings , new ambulatory training systems which allow a higher freedom of movement from the patient have been designed , such as WalkTrainer Nature-gaits , SUBAR , EXPOS , the device presented in , MLLRE , or MOPASS .

Most of them , like Ekso Bionics , HAL , Vanderbilt exoskeleton , or ReWalk are 4DoF ( degrees of freedom ) lower-limb exoskeletons , and actuate both the hip and knee on the sagittal plane .

Such strategies have the potential to improve the locomotive capabilities of people with motor deficit by minimizing the muscular effort required and simultaneously reducing the forces and pressures exerted over the user ’s skeletal system .

Our solution enables practitioners to easily transfer patients from a wheelchair to standing position , suspend their weight , and provide assisted gait patterns extracted from healthy users , all while offering safety and comfort .

These devices are limited in the sense that the patient remains in place , and therefore their proprioception , posture , and dynamic balance systems are not being properly trained and receive conflicting stimuli .

Wearable exoskeletons that can induce musculoskeletal movement , and therefore help the user perform a healthy gait pattern , are a very popular way of using robotic devices for rehabilitation .

This problem could be avoided by using PBWS ( partial body weight support ) solutions that unload part of the patient ’s body weight by suspending them .
