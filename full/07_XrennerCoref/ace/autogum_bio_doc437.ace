The title page of Burby 's Q1 of LLL , the earliest play text to be printed under Shakespeare 's name , also claims that that edition was " Newly corrected and augmented " – which has been taken by some commentators as a possible indication of an earlier " bad quarto " of LLL that has not survived . [ 5 ]

It has even been argued that the printing in the " bad quarto " of Romeo and Juliet , Danter 's 1597 Q1 , is superior to the printing of the Burby/Creede Q2 , the " good " quarto of 1599 – that Q2 " is on the whole less carefully printed than Q1 .

The title page of the R&J Q2 states that that edition was " Newly corrected , augmented , and amended " – which has been interpreted to indicate that Q2 was issued as a deliberate correction and replacement for the defective Q1 , the " bad quarto " printed by John Danter in 1597 .
