If I 'm finding it really difficult to write something I know that I need to go investigate it in a more visual way , and I 'll start to gather images and take photographs and make notes and make collages and start looking to photographers and filmmakers to give me a more grounded sense of the place that I 'm writing about , whether it 's in my imagination or in the characters .
