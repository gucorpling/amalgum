Area-based methods , however , are not employed due to two reasons : ( 1 ) the first reason is that this method is computationally heavy as it performs cross correlation on multiple image patches and ( 2 ) the second reason is that image patches under different exposure levels may display extremely different characteristics , which may fail cross the correlation method .

We selected this model because during the bracketing stage , hand-shake is inevitably introduced , leading to different imaging angles for the same document object , and the planar homograph model is suitable for the situation where the imaging object is put on a planar surface and is captured from different view-angles .

Under this model , points in two different images can be mapped as : ( 1 ) where points are represented by homogeneous coordinates and so point ( x , y , z ) is the same as ( x / z , y / z ) in the inhomogeneous coordinate .

a is the left central image patch and we can see that the geometric difference between the well-exposed image and over-exposed image in this region is around 10 pixels ( half the size of the lowercase letter “ a ” ) in the vertical direction .

We expect that the extracted features will be consistent regardless of exposure levels and among all the feature extraction methods , we selected the Scale-invariant Feature Transform ( SIFT ) method because it improves detection stability in situations of illumination changes .

Using this method to estimate the planar homograph model involves two steps : in the first step , a moving window is defined in the reference image and the image patch within the window is regarded as the template .

Among all the geometric models , such as the affine model , translational model , rotation model , and so on , we ended up selecting the planar homograph model to represent the geometric disparity between LDR images .

SIFT does not only define the position of detected points , but also provides a description of the region around the feature point by means of a descriptor , which is then used to match SIFT feature points .

The most popular registration in the context of exposure bracketing is from , where a translational geometric model was employed to account for the geometric disparity between two images .

The green band and blue band come from the corresponding bands in the well-exposed image while the red band is from the corresponding band in the over-exposed image .

This is obvious evidence that the geometric disparity between LDR images cannot be translational and that it must follow a more complicated geometric model .

On top of it , we can clearly see that the global translational model cannot account for the geometric disparity between these two images .

If there are no geometric disparities between these two images , the foreground ( textual part ) of the image should overlap .
