The results are not only relevant for groups of homeowners who consider installing a hybrid stand-alone renewable electricity system as a community , but also for investors or policy makers , as they present a guideline on how to size such systems and where in Germany and the Czech Republic , they are the most attractive regarding installation costs .

These costs divided by the number of households and the amount of electricity that these would require in a 20 years ’ horizon are at least 2.3 ( best locations in Germany ) and up to 10.5 ( worst locations in the Czech Republic ) times larger than the current costs of obtaining electricity from the grid .

In the majority of Bavaria in south Germany , as well as large areas in the western Czech Republic , small-scale wind power plants are not considered in a cost-minimized solution due to low wind resources and a lack of complementarity between wind and solar power .

Regarding particular areas , maps revealing the total costs for a hybrid renewable electricity system show most profitable locations in the south of Germany , as well as challenging locations mainly in the western part of the Czech Republic and in the eastern parts of Germany .

In the presented study , the economically optimal configurations of PV-wind-battery systems are calculated with the help of a MILP model based on datasets of weather variables and population density as well as detailed technical specifications on the generation technologies .

The results show that including wind power in such self-sufficient systems decreases the comparatively high installed capacities of PV necessary at higher geographic latitudes due to lower solar irradiation while reducing total installation costs compared to PV-battery systems only .

Finally , in order to assess full energy self-sufficiency , the study conducted here has to be extended to include the energy demand for heating/cooling of the households and alternative hybrid system configurations to supply it .

Several cases of homeowners who reflect different levels of risk aversion with regards to levels of self-sufficiency , respectively the probability of loss of power supply and grid-dependency could further provide valuable insights .
