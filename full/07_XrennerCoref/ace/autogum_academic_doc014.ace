A multitude of different tools has been proposed to inform immunotherapy , including morphology , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR)-based techniques and next-generation technology assays , such as next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) or multiplex barcode technology ( e. g. , NanoString ) .

These two scoring systems are rather different , given that the former considers only the percentage of PD-L1-positive neoplastic cells , while the latter combines all PD-L1-positive cells ( i. e. , tumor cells , lymphocytes , and macrophages ) into the following formula .

For the first time in the history of medicine , a drug ( in this case , an immune-checkpoint inhibitor ) was approved based on a specific molecular feature of the neoplasm , irrespective of its anatomical site of origin .

In addition , there are several indications that TMB is not a universal biomarker , as its value varies not only across tumor types but also across different genomic regions and during the time .

In this respect , important harmonization efforts have been made to standardize both the preanalytical and interpretative phases of PD-L1 testing , at least in non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .

It has been hypothesized that tumors with a higher TMB are more likely to express neoantigens and to induce a more robust immune response in the presence of immune checkpoint inhibitors .

Among new biomarkers to select patients for immunotherapy , the tumor mutational burden ( TMB ) has been shown a strong correlation with the response to some compounds .
