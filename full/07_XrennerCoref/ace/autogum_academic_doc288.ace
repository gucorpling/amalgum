This is due to the relatively good availability of building material in many parts of the world and ease of assembly related to technical aspects ( heavy equipment is not required ) , as well as assembly time and good usability parameters ( aesthetics , easy repairs and modifications , good climate , etc. ) .

The concept of increasing the effectiveness of secondary structural elements in the overall seismic behaviour of buildings has also been investigated ; for example , the application of special mechanical connectors interposed at the interface between a multi-storey building and the glazing facade .

A number of studies have been focused on structural connectors , anchor connections and special flat bars and angles , the use of which results in stiffening of the whole structure and increasing its seismic resistance .

Methods of strengthening these structures , mainly constructed of reinforced concrete or steel frame ( for example using the fiber-reinforced cementitious composite ) , are subjected to many tests , including experimental and numerical ones .

The results of the study indicate that , once the input parameters of the connecting devices are properly designed , the glazing facade may work as an effective passive control system for the primary structure .

The results of these analyses show that using polyurethane foam instead of mineral wool for the in-wall insulation of a wood-frame building leads to an increase in the rigidity of the whole structure .

There are some numerical analyses available , which indicate that thermal insulation of the wooden frame building can substantially affect the dynamic resistance of the whole structure ( for example , see ) .

It has been found that the increase in the rigidity of the building insulated with the polyurethane foam leads to the substantial reduction in the structural response under different seismic excitations .

This effect is obtained mainly due to full connection between the polyurethane foam and the surrounding wooden elements , and a lack of such connection in the case of mineral wool .
