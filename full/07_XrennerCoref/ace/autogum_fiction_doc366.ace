The last night at Midway , I had little sleep ; the next morning , after the sun was risen , and the clatter of departure had begun to reign on deck , I lay a long while dozing ; and when at last I stepped from the companion , the schooner was already leaping through the pass into the open sea .

About four of the afternoon we turned Waimanolo Point , the westerly headland of the great bight of Honolulu ; showed ourselves for twenty minutes in full view ; and then fell again to leeward , and put in the rest of daylight , plying under shortened sail under the lee of Waimanolo .

For some while , we saw nothing but the dark mountain outline of the island , the torches of native fishermen glittering here and there along the foreshore , and right in the midst that cluster of brave lights with which the town of Honolulu advertises itself to the seaward .

The two last ( I learned afterward ) were frequent partners ; Sharpe supplied the capital , and Fowler , who was quite a character in the islands and occupied a considerable station , brought activity , daring , and a private influence , highly necessary in the case .

It has often since been a comfortable thought to me that we had thus destroyed the tell-tale remnants of the Flying Scud ; and often a strange one that my last sight and reminiscence of that fatal ship should be a pillar of smoke on the horizon .

A whaleboat accordingly ranged alongside , and three men boarded us : my old San Francisco friend , the stock-gambler Speedy , a little wizened person of the name of Sharpe , and a big , flourishing , dissipated-looking man called Fowler .

As we drew farther off , the conflagration of the Flying Scud flamed higher ; and long after we had dropped all signs of Midway Island , the smoke still hung in the horizon like that of a distant steamer .
