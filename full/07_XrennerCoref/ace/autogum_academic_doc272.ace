The author is investigating the design and use of specific hand-crafted features ( which the author has already used in the medical field ) extracted from the chart of currency time-series and which would seem to early indicate the possible misalignments between the cross currency prices from which are extracted .

Therefore , in a financially balanced market , so that an investor cannot take advantage of arbitrage conditions and consequently obtain a systematic gain , Equation ( 1 ) must always be verified , i. e. , there must be a very precise temporal correlation between specific currency crosses .

Specifically , such training simulations and annual validation have been performed , dividing the dataset as follows : 70 % of the mentioned dataset was used to train the pipeline , while the remaining 30 % was used to validate and test the proposed method .

In the specific case , without losing generalization , the author will refer to the EUR/USD currency as that on which to execute financial trading operations and to the EUR/GBP and GBP/USD currencies to determine the data set for a possible triangular arbitrage .

Again , with reference to the aforementioned time period , for each cross currency the historical data referring to the opening and closing prices , higher and lower in addition to the time of each quotation ( CET time ) have been collected .

Both the training set and the validation ones has been analyzed as to understand if the possible trends ( LONG , SHORT , NULL ) were equally represented in both datasets in order to avoid overfitting issues for the deep learning system .

For the reasons mentioned above , the author has designed a pipeline which , to determine the medium-term trend of a given currency , analyzes the correlations between the related currencies in the context of a triangular arbitrage .

In this way , whatever the pricing of the cross currency entering our system , the pipeline will always process data in the range [ 0 , 1 ] , greatly improving the stability of the proposed algorithm .

In reality , small short-term misalignments are always found in the Forex markets and these are often excellent trading opportunities for financial robot advisors who automatically execute many operations , taking advantage of these short-time market misalignments .

As introduced in the first section , an arbitrage takes advantage of differences in the price of single currency related to short-time misalignments between the traded currency with the related ones .

The price of the EUR/USD cross for arbitrage purposes in the currency market must always be obtainable from the other two pairs EUR/GBP and GBP/USD by the relationship ( 1 )

A typical example of arbitrage is the so-called triangular arbitrage referred to three currencies of which one is obtainable from the combination of the prices of the other two crosses .

To this end , the authors will describe below a pipeline that is based on the use of set of cross-currency exchanges characterizing an arbitrage opportunity in the Forex market .
