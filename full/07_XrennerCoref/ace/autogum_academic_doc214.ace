Process simulations provide information on how to manufacture components in order to achieve the required properties and support the development and understanding of the manufacturing process itself . Finite Element ( FE ) simulations , a conventional method used in the modeling of welding processes , particularly for larger components , are applied on the macro scale .

Since Ti-6Al-4V is a two-phase alloy consisting of 90 – 95 % of hcp-α phase and 5 – 10 % bcc-β phase at room temperature , the final microstructure of the material after being additive manufactured can exhibit a variety of microstructures , depending on the conditions of the thermal cycles .
