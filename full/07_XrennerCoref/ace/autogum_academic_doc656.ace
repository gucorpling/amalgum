Thirteen biosynthetic gene clusters associated with biocontrol activity were identified using an integrated approach of genome mining and chemical analysis , including the three antifungal metabolites fengycin B , iturin A , and surfactin A. Another strain , B. velezensis LM2303 , which has antimicrobial activity against F. graminearum in addition to other plant pathogenic fungi , also presented a plethora of genes encoding antimicrobial compounds .
