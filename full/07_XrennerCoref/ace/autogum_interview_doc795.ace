I am running as a Candidate for the CHP because it is the only Federal Party that is squarely based on Christian principles , the only Party that believes in the Supremacy of God , the only Party that is fully Pro-life from conception to natural death , the only Party that believes abortion is the killing of a life and should not be funded by the government , the only Party that is fully Pro-Family , the only Party that believes that homosexuality is contrary to God 's will and commandments , for it has been clearly demonstrated , that homosexuality has no genetic or hormonal cause , but is an addiction much like alcoholism , and the only Party that would deal decisively with the Human Rights Commissions , who have been successful in fining people who say anything against the practice of homosexuality .
