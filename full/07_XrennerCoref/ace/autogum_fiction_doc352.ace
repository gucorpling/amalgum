On the 20th of August , 1672 , the city of the Hague , always so lively , so neat , and so trim that one might believe every day to be Sunday , with its shady park , with its tall trees , spreading over its Gothic houses , with its canals like large mirrors , in which its steeples and its almost Eastern cupolas are reflected , -- the city of the Hague , the capital of the Seven United Provinces , was swelling in all its arteries with a black and red stream of hurried , panting , and restless citizens , who , with their knives in their girdles , muskets on their shoulders , or sticks in their hands , were pushing on to the Buytenhof , a terrible prison , the grated windows of which are still shown , where , on the charge of attempted murder preferred against him by the surgeon Tyckelaer , Cornelius de Witt , the brother of the Grand Pensionary of Holland was confined .

If the history of that time , and especially that of the year in the middle of which our narrative commences , were not indissolubly connected with the two names just mentioned , the few explanatory pages which we are about to add might appear quite supererogatory ; but we will , from the very first , apprise the reader -- our old friend , to whom we are wont on the first page to promise amusement , and with whom we always try to keep our word as well as is in our power -- that this explanation is as indispensable to the right understanding of our story as to that of the great event itself on which it is based .

Cornelius de Witt , Ruart de Pulten , that is to say , warden of the dikes , ex-burgomaster of Dort , his native town , and member of the Assembly of the States of Holland , was forty-nine years of age , when the Dutch people , tired of the Republic such as John de Witt , the Grand Pensionary of Holland , understood it , at once conceived a most violent affection for the Stadtholderate , which had been abolished for ever in Holland by the “ Perpetual Edict ” forced by John de Witt upon the United Provinces .

As it rarely happens that public opinion , in its whimsical flights , does not identify a principle with a man , thus the people saw the personification of the Republic in the two stern figures of the brothers De Witt , those Romans of Holland , spurning to pander to the fancies of the mob , and wedding themselves with unbending fidelity to liberty without licentiousness , and prosperity without the waste of superfluity ; on the other hand , the Stadtholderate recalled to the popular mind the grave and thoughtful image of the young Prince William of Orange .

But God laughs at the presumption of man , who wants to raise and prostrate the powers on earth without consulting the King above ; and the fickleness and caprice of the Dutch combined with the terror inspired by Louis XIV . , in repealing the Perpetual Edict , and re-establishing the office of Stadtholder in favour of William of Orange , for whom the hand of Providence had traced out ulterior destinies on the hidden map of the future .

This new chief , quite ready to appear on the political stage , and to measure himself against Louis XIV . , however gigantic the fortunes of the Grand Monarch loomed in the future , was William , Prince of Orange , son of William II . , and grandson , by his mother Henrietta Stuart , of Charles I. of England .

The brothers De Witt humoured Louis XIV . , whose moral influence was felt by the whole of Europe , and the pressure of whose material power Holland had been made to feel in that marvellous campaign on the Rhine , which , in the space of three months , had laid the power of the United Provinces prostrate .

The Grand Pensionary bowed before the will of his fellow citizens ; Cornelius de Witt , however , was more obstinate , and notwithstanding all the threats of death from the Orangist rabble , who besieged him in his house at Dort , he stoutly refused to sign the act by which the office of Stadtholder was restored .

The brothers De Witt , therefore , had to strive against a double difficulty , -- against the force of national antipathy , and , besides , against the feeling of weariness which is natural to all vanquished people , when they hope that a new chief will be able to save them from ruin and shame .

Louis XIV . had long been the enemy of the Dutch , who insulted or ridiculed him to their hearts ’ content , although it must be said that they generally used French refugees for the mouthpiece of their spite .
