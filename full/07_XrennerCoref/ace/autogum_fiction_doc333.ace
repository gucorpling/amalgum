Tory Hill and Saco Hill met at the bridge , and just there , too , the river road began its shady course along the east side of the stream : in view of all which “ old Mis ' Bascom 's settin'-room winder ” might well be called the “ Village Watch-Tower , ” when you consider further that she had moved only from her high-backed rocker to her bed , and from her bed to her rocker , for more than thirty years , -- ever since that july day when her husband had had a sun-stroke while painting the meeting-house steeple , and her baby Jonathan had been thereby hastened into a world not in the least ready to receive him .

A tottering old sign-board , on a verdant triangle of turf , directed you over Deacon Chute 's hill to the “ Flag Medder Road , ” and from thence to Liberty Centre ; the little post-office and store , where the stage stopped twice a day , was quite within eyeshot ; so were the public watering-trough , Brigadier Hill , and , behind the ruins of an old mill , the wooded path that led to the Witches ' Eel-pot , a favorite walk for village lovers .

The river was a sheet of crystal , as it poured over the dam ; a rushing , roaring torrent of foaming white , as it swept under the bridge and fought its way between the rocky cliffs beyond , sweeping swirling , eddying , in its narrow channel , pulsing restlessly into the ragged fissures of its shores , and leaping with a tempestuous roar into the Witches ' Eel-pot , a deep wooded gorge cleft in the very heart of the granite bank .

Old Mrs. Bascom herself did not need the rumble of wheels to tell her that a vehicle was coming , for she could see it fully ten minutes before it reached the bridge , -- at the very moment it appeared at the crest of Saco Hill , where strangers pulled up their horses , on a clear day , and paused to look at Mount Washington , miles away in the distance .

Her mother had lain there and listened to the swirl of the water , in that year when the river was higher than the oldest inhabitant had ever seen it , -- the year when the covered bridge at the Mills had been carried away , and when the one at the Falls was in hourly danger of succumbing to the force of the freshet .
