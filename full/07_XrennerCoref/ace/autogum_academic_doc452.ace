Increasing scaffolds ’ design complexity is therefore extremely demanding and scientists face some important challenges , such as : ( 1 ) engineering of scaffold microarchitecture to mimic the ECM structure , ( 2 ) imprinting topological and biochemical patterns inside scaffolds pores to guide cells ’ growth and tissue morphogenesis , and ( 3 ) developing automated processes for the precise and reliable control of scaffolds ’ features and geometry .

Scaffolds pore size and shape , pore wall morphology , porosity , surface area and pore interconnectivity , are probably the most important architectural parameters , as they have been shown to directly impact cells migration and colonization , new ECM biosynthesis and organization , oxygen and nutrients transport to cells , as well as metabolic wastes removal in the whole cell/scaffold construct .

Indeed , it is reported that porous scaffolds releasing biochemical signals following a precise dose and time intervals to target sites stimulate cells ’ functions ( e. g. , adhesion , proliferation and migration ) , promote the biosynthesis of new ECM and , ultimately , guide tissue growth , morphogenesis and vascularization .

Nevertheless , controlling the morphological and biomechanical properties of porous scaffolds is not enough for the success of scaffolds-based therapies , as there is also the need to load matricellular and soluble molecules inside scaffolds ’ matrix as biochemical regulators of cells behavior .
