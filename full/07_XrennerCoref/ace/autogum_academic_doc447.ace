Indeed , while sarcopenia is now recognised with its own International Classification of Diseases , 10th Revision , Clinical Modification ( ICD-10-CM ) code ( M62.84 ) , few health care professionals know how to diagnose it , include it as part of their clinical practice , or even recognise it as a disease , .

Ultrasound represents a potentially cost-effective , accessible and safe method of measuring muscle quality and Harris-Love and colleagues demonstrate in this special issue that rectus femoris echogenicity assessed by ultrasound is significantly correlated with intra- and inter-muscular adipose tissue estimates from CT , and has similar associations with muscle function and cardiometabolic outcomes .

Physical function assessments are also simple to perform in clinical settings and may be most appropriate to identify sarcopenia cases in obese older adults who , owing to their larger muscle mass , may generally exceed cut-off points for low muscle mass .

Liver disease is also associated with weight loss and physical frailty , and a population-based study reported that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was more common in Korean adults with low muscle mass determined by CT , regardless of their obesity status .

Computed tomography ( CT ) provides precise estimates of muscle quality and so may be useful for case-finding in sarcopenia , but barriers to this method include high costs , lack of availability and ionising radiation doses .

Mesinovic and colleagues demonstrate associations between the metabolic syndrome and poorer muscle function despite the generally larger muscle size in overweight and obese older individuals , indicating accelerated loss of muscle quality is common in this population .

The SarQoL® ( Sarcopenia and Quality of Life ) , is a validated quality of life ( QoL ) questionnaire which can discriminate sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients and has already been translated into several languages .

The effects of sarcopenia on cognitive impairment are supported by an original study of community-dwelling older adults residing in rural areas of Korea which reported that physical frailty was significantly associated with poor cognitive function .
