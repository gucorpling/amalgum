When free fatty acid ( FFA ) is overloaded in the body , FFA uptake factors such as cluster of differentiation 36 ( CD36 ) and fatty acid transport proteins ( FATPs ) are significantly up-regulated , and then excessive FFA is accepted into the liver , gradually accumulating .

According to a previous study , uric acid-induced oxidative stress in hepatocytes significantly elevated the expression of lipogenesis factors such as acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase ( ACC ) , fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) , and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c ( SREBP-1c ) .

Another study has shown that an HF diet destroyed the antioxidant defense system by decreasing superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) and catalase ( CAT ) activities , and markedly increased the production of ROS .

Furthermore , several studies have indicated that fatty acid overflow by activated CD36 subsequently produced a higher level of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which could be linked to oxidative stress .
