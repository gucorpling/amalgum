To prevent the disease spreading in wild boar , control measures including ( i ) fencing to restrict animal movements , ( ii ) hunting activities for active monitoring and to reduce susceptible populations , and ( iii ) disseminating baits for oral immunization , were implemented .

During the epidemic , CSFV infections were confirmed on seven farms that were geographically distant from , but epidemiologically linked , to the farms affected by CSFV ( i. e. , run by the same owner , supported by the same husbandry company , etc. ) .

According to the high degree of sequence homology between an original virus isolated in Japan and viruses that were circulating widely in East Asia , it was suspected that the FMD virus might have been introduced via movement of people or commodities from East Asia .

Potential factors that could have contributed to disease introduction include easy access from the international airport to the affected area , which has regular and direct flights from China , and the relatively high population density of Chinese people in the affected area .

The continuous notification of CSF in the area might have been attributed to wide spread of the virus within wild boar populations favored by free animal movements , as well as to the emergence of epidemiologically related domestic pig farms .

Given the potential for transmission of the virus between pigs on any farms or from wild boar near that farm , the epidemiologically related farms may further expand the spread of disease .
