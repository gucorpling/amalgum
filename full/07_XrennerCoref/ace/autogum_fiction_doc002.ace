Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose , for it was fighting the tide , and sometimes winning ; and when it won , Peter , always sympathetic to the weaker side , could not help clapping ; it was such a gallant piece of paper .

Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque [ small ship , actuallythe Never Bird 's nest in this particular case in point ] in a place wherethe bird would easily find it ; but the hat was such a great success that she abandoned the nest .
