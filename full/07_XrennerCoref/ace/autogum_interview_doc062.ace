For example , dissections are done when the ants are anesthetized ( either by CO2 or Ice ) , and when ants need to be killed , we do it in alcohol , which kills the ants in a matter of seconds .

So while the ants do not have ' rights ' as such , we still try to handle them with as much respect as possible ( even though the experiment involves infecting them with a deadly fungus ) .

This is probably for reducing chance of infecting nestmates , but of course it also reduces the work load of their nest-mates , as their corpse does n't have to be dragged out etc.

But even though the 12,000 ants in our study sounds like a lot ( and it is ) , this is negligible in the ' grand scheme of things ' .

Moths and fruit flies definitely do it , and there 's evidence in honey bees and bumble-bees as well .

Sick ants stop most interaction with nestmates and especially brood , and leave the nest to die in isolation .

Insects ( and animals in general ) seem to be quite good at taking care of themselves .

Could healthy ants perhaps tell other ants are infected and encourage this behaviour ?
