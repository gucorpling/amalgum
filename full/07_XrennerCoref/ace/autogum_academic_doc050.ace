NO is a bioactive free radical molecule ( 1 – 2 sec lifetime in water ) that diffuses freely on its own and , similar to oxygen ( O2 ) , tends to partition into hydrophobic regions of cells , e. g. , cell membranes .

Unlike more conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy , PDT has few ( if any ) light-independent side effects and is non-invasive and site-specific , i. e. , limited to the tumor upon which light is directed , typically via fiber optic networks .

In the present study , we compared the ability of four PDT-treated cancer lines ( melanoma BLM , glioblastoma U87 , breast MDA-MB-231 , and prostate PC3 ) to stimulate NO-dependent aggressiveness in bystander cells of the same type .

At relatively low steady state levels ( e. g. , 50 – 300 nM range ) , NO is known to play a key signaling role in survival , migration , and drug resistance of many different cancer cells .

In addition to acting as a PDT sensitizer , ALA-induced PpIX , like that induced by more lipophilic ALA esters , e. g. , Hexvix , can serve as a highly effective fluorophore for image-guided tumor resection .

Upon entering cancer cells via an amino acid transporter , ALA is metabolized to protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX ) , the active PS , via the heme biosynthetic pathway , PpIX accumulating initially in mitochondria .

Importantly , these cells exhibited a more aggressive growth , migratory , and invasive phenotype than non-photostressed controls , and this was suppressed by inhibition of iNOS or by NO scavenging .

As an anti-tumor modality , PDT is unique in requiring three components : a photosensitizing agent ( PS ) , PS-exciting light in the far-visible-to-near-infrared range , and molecular oxygen .
