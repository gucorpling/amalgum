Among the several enzymes that are currently applied in biocatalysis , lipases ( triacylglycerol ester hydrolases E.C. 3.1.1.3 ) have been outstanding for their great industrial application in the production of high added value esters due to , among other advantages , their ability to show activity both of hydrolysis and esterification , the non-requirement of cofactors , and their ability to be able to perform reactions with high regio- , enantio- , and chemo-selectivity .

Lipase-catalyzed transformations play an important role in organic synthesis to fulfill the rapidly growing demand for enantiomerically pure compounds such as pharmaceuticals , agrochemicals , and natural products , mainly due to no requirement for cofactors and also the capacity of catalyzing different reactions such as asymmetric esterification , asymmetric transesterification , and asymmetric hydrolysis .

Levoglucosan can be transformed into derived esters with a hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance that is of great value as surfactants , emulsifiers , or even lubricants , showing great potential of application in the most diverse industrial sectors , as our research group has observed with other esters that are produced by enzymatic routes .

Immobilization of lipases on different supports or different protocols in the same support allows the development of systems with different stabilities and specificities , depending on the support used , the intensity of the enzyme – support interaction , and the orientation of the enzyme molecule on the support surface .

In this work , we performed both the esterification and transesterification of levoglucosan with different acyl donors catalyzed by the lipases Novozym 435® , PSIM® , and the home-made lipase CaLB_epoxy , aiming to evaluate conversion and selectivity for the obtained mono- and diesters in the batch processes .
