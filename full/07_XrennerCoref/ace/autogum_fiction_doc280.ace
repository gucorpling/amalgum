And I struck out a truth one day in Cromwell Road quite suddenly , as I looked over the Natural History Museum “ By Jove , ” said I “ but this is the little assemblage of cases of stuffed birds and animals upon the Bladesover staircase grown enormous , and yonder as the corresponding thing to the Bladesover curios and porcelain is the Art Museume and there in the little observatories in Exhibition Road is old Sir Cuthbert ’s Gregorian telescope that I hunted out in the storeroom and put together . ”

The roads and back ways of Mayfair and all about St. James ’s again , albeit perhaps of a later growth in point of time , were of the very spirit and architectural texture of the Bladesover passages and yards ; they had the same smells , the space , the large cleanest and always going to and fro where one met unmistakable Olympians and even more unmistakable valets , butlers , footmen in mufti .

There have been no revolutions no deliberate restatements or abandonments of opinion in England since the days of the fine gentry , since 1688 or thereabouts , the days when Bladesover was built ; there have been changes , dissolving forest replacing forest , if you will ; but then it was that the broad lines of the English system set firmly .

Yet in time there has grown up in me a kind of theory of London ; I do think I see lines of an ordered structure out of which it has grown , detected a process that is something more than a confusion of casual accidents though indeed it may be no more than a process of disease .

It was really a good piece of social comparative anatomy I did that day ; all these museums and libraries that are dotted over London between Piccadilly and West Kensington , and indeed the museum and library movement throughout the world , sprang from the elegant leisure of the gentlemen of taste .

Wimblehurst dwindles in perspective , is now in this book a little place far off , Bladesover no more than a small pinkish speck of frontage among the distant Kentish hills ; the scene broadens out , becomes multitudinous and limitless , full of the sense of vast irrelevant movement .

Theirs were the first libraries , the first houses of culture ; by my rat-like raids into the Bladesover saloon I became , as it were , the last dwindled representative of such a man of letters as Swift .

I could trace out now on a map what I would call the Great-House region ; passing south-westward into Belgravia , becoming diffused and sporadic westward , finding its last systematic outbreak round and about Regent ’s Park .
