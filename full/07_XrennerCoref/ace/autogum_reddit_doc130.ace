I ’ve had mine for about 4 months give or take so I wo n’t mention anything about longevity but I use mine probably 6 hours a day with about 1.5 being on the phone and would never make it an entire day without the case but this is a non issue because the case is always in my pocket .

With the case charger being always in my pocket it is n’t super common for me to run out of battery when I ’m listening to music throughout the day but I do try and get equal use out of left and right and switch between the two .

If I happen to want to play one of those songs and my phone is in Bluetooth range it ’s about a 25 % success rate of actually being able to listen to them without manually pairing them the the watch .

Almost always they reconnect to the phone but I have a few playlists ( workout mostly ” on my watch that I do n’t leave on my phone since it ’s not with me on a run .

Usually I only use one at a time and they charge faster than they discharge so I ’ve never been caught without them or even really been bothered by them not lasting super long on the phone .

The case also charges quite fast and I tend to plug that in every couple of days or just while on a quick car ride just out of habit and rarely because it ’s actually dead .

I honestly have n’t figured out if it ’s a phone , watch , or airpods issue but quite often the airpods will get stuck in limbo and wo n’t connect to the Apple Watch .

Please only respond if you ’ve had them for an extended period of time ( 6+ months ) as I want to know how well they hold up .

Due to using them one at a time a lot I was worried about one battery wearing faster than the other but I have n’t noticed anything yet .

I think the 2 rated hours is pretty accurate but mine are almost never at 100 % when I start a phone call .

Edit : I would recommend getting a pair and never looking back at your wired earbuds again

My biggest gripe is the switching back and forth with my phone and Apple Watch .
