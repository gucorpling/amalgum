When the furnace temperature was 700 – 1000 °C , the droplet evaporation and small molecule evaporation analysis time was very short — that is , by entering the macromolecular pyrolysis stage , a large amount of gas was released and accompanied by combustion , and the droplet expansion index reached the maximum value .

However , when the droplet size increased , the specific surface area decreased , the heat transfer and mass transfer became slower , and the oxidation of the air formed a dense shell on the surface of the droplet , which hindered the volume expansion of the droplet .

When the furnace temperature was less than 600 °C , the expansion process of the droplets was mainly due to the evaporation of water and pyrolysis of the waste liquid , which caused the droplet volume to increase sharply .
