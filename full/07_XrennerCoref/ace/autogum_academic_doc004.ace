The following problems exist in the application and promotion of the second national potential evaluation software : ( a ) The model mechanism is oversimplified , which results in the limitation of the application scope of the model and affects the reliability of the operation results . ( b ) The increase of polymer flooding potential and chemical compound flooding is lower than that of numerical simulation , and the enhancing oil recovery of most blocks is less than 2 â€“ 5 % .
