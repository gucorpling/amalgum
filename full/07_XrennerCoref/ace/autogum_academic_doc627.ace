The IIHF ’s definition describes a reportable event as “ any injury sustained in a practice or game that prevented the player from returning to the same practice or game ; any injury sustained in a practice or game that caused the player to miss a subsequent practice or game ; a laceration which required medical attention ; all dental injuries ; all concussions ; all fractures ” .

However , when comparing the time on ice metric to the estimated player game-hour metric ( based on one hour per game , rather than the actual amount of time that players spent on ice ) it appears that this difference is small .

We identified the International Ice Hockey Federation ’s ( IIHF ) definition of injury as the most appropriate as it only captures events that are sufficiently severe that they influence participation in practices or games .

Therefore , the simplest and easiest way to calculate athlete exposure is to use six players on the ice ( player-game hours ) unless position specific injury rate information is warranted .

Several researchers used player-game exposure based on the entire team , or average team roster ( 19 players ) , while others used player-game hour exposures based on 6 players .

This may be due to the differing demands as professional players play more games in a season , and therefore may experience more overuse injuries .
