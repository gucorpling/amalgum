This fact did not allow investigating the possible effects of confounding factors , including gender-specific ones ( i. e. , the sexual-hormone influences for female subjects , menstrual cycle phases , etc. ) or variables related to some physical characteristics of the subjects ( i. e. , the body mass index ) , even though none of the volunteers was apparently under- or overweight .

Despite not being extensively studied with respect to the TSST , this kind of ANS behavior is consistent with the results by Boesch et al. , which , with a slightly different protocol , found an increase in HR together with a contextual decrease of HRV features during the administration of the TSST for groups ( TSST-G ) .

Our study , conducted on a limited , though well characterized , number of young , healthy volunteers , aimed at comparing the autonomic response to cognitive and sensory tests to the best of our knowledge , and tried to fill in a significant gap in the existing literature .

The comparison between ANS responses to olfactory stimulation and to the TSST protocol made it possible to compare Task I and Task II , as well as Task II and Task III responses , and highlighted a much higher contribution to the SNS activation borne by the TSST .

Fifth , the somewhat counterintuitive results retrieved in studying time- versus frequency-domain features were partially explained by the contrasting literature explanation regarding the physiological processes underlying frequency-domain variations , as explained in the signal analysis subsection of the Materials and Methods .

Third , for the same reason , we decided not to administer stress-related questionnaires , such as Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) or State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , to monitor both state and trait anxiety .

Second , due to the necessity of keeping the overall length of the protocol reasonably low , we did not consider long-term ANS measurements that could be more precise in characterizing the overall stress state of the volunteers .

Further studies conducted on larger samples , and using other time-domains and more robust ECG features , including RMSSD and the Cardiac Vagal Index calculated from the Lorenz plot , could also help in clarifying this point .

Interestingly , the trends noticed in the phase transition between Task III and recovery suggest an overall ANS withdrawal after a massive psycho-sensory stress protocol , being that both SNS and PNS activity decreased at this stage .

The magnitude of this response was significantly smaller than that occurring with TSST , highlighting its usefulness in stress monitoring of subjects unable to undergo complex mathematical stress tests , limited to some particularly controlled experimental settings .

After the olfactory stimulation , the TSST further increased the SNS activity , at the same time highlighting a somewhat parasympathetic withdrawal , as demonstrated by the simultaneous decrease of both SDNN and pNN50 .

Having reported that the olfactory compounds used included odors normally judged as both pleasant and unpleasant , our findings are somewhat similar to the retrievals of Bensafi et al. , limited to unpleasant odors .

Finally , the administration of both pleasant and unpleasant odors would have represented a possible confounding factor if one â€™s aim was to control the selective ANS response to one of the two categories .

In addition , we also failed to find significant correlations between autonomic parameters and odor pleasantness , confirming that pleasant versus unpleasant odors do not cause significantly different autonomic responses in healthy subjects .

In light of such considerations , future protocols could be structured starting from the selection of odors based on their hedonic tone , even referring to pleasantness data reported in previously published studies .

This result could be speculated in terms of sustained hyper-reactivity of the PNS , as a marker of increased selective attention and higher-order behavior and cognition ( e. g. , see ) .

With respect to the baseline , the presentation of the six different olfactory stimuli was seen to elicit a significant response in terms of activation of the sympathetic branch of the ANS .

Similar results in terms of HR augmentation and HRV reduction under TSST stress were also found in several other protocols ( see ) , strengthening the scientific value of our findings .

Therefore , TSST was confirmed to represent a powerful psychosocial stress task capable to induce an acute stress response of all main physiologic stress systems .

Finally , the only significant correlation revealed that subjects who more quickly completing the TSST protocol displayed higher PNS activation in the following phase .
