It was about the beginning of September , 1664 , that I , among the rest of my neighbours , heard in ordinary discourse that the plague was returned again in Holland ; for it had been very violent there , and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam , in the year 1663 , whither , they say , it was brought , some said from Italy , others from the Levant , among some goods which were brought home by their Turkey fleet ; others said it was brought from Candia ; others from Cyprus .

This turned the people 's eyes pretty much towards that end of the town , and the weekly bills showing an increase of burials in St Giles 's parish more than usual , it began to be suspected that the plague was among the people at that end of the town , and that many had died of it , though they had taken care to keep it as much from the knowledge of the public as possible .

Hence it was that this rumour died off again , and people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in , and that we hoped was not true ; till the latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664 when two men , said to be Frenchmen , died of the plague in Long Acre , or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane .

This increase of the bills stood thus : the usual number of burials in a week , in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-Fields and St Andrew 's , Holborn , were from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each , few more or less ; but from the time that the plague first began in St Giles 's parish , it was observed that the ordinary burials increased in number considerably .

The like increase of the bills was observed in the parishes of St Bride 's , adjoining on one side of Holborn parish , and in the parish of St James , Clerkenwell , adjoining on the other side of Holborn ; in both which parishes the usual numbers that died weekly were from four to six or eight , whereas at that time they were increased as follows :

The family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible , but as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood , the Secretaries of State got knowledge of it ; and concerning themselves to inquire about it , in order to be certain of the truth , two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house and make inspection .

And then we were easy again for about six weeks , when none having died with any marks of infection , it was said the distemper was gone ; but after that , I think it was about the 12th of February , another died in another house , but in the same parish and in the same manner .

But such things as these were gathered from the letters of merchants and others who corresponded abroad , and from them was handed about by word of mouth only ; so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation , as they do now .

The people showed a great concern at this , and began to be alarmed all over the town , and the more , because in the last week in December 1664 another man died in the same house , and of the same distemper .
