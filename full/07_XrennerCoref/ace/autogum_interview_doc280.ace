In a few cases where we felt articles were missing we asked the community to write them ( e. g. Portal : Early Modern Britain , which is a curriculum subject , was kindly written just for us ) : These " proposals " were then looked at by mainly SOS volunteers ( some onwiki , some offline ) .

Our offices are in the middle of Cambridge and we get high quality volunteers , who skim read each article and then compared two versions from the article history by credible WP editors a significant period apart ( this picks up most graffiti vandalism which runs at about 3 % of articles ) .
