The arthrogenic role of Collinsella has been confirmed both in vivo using a humanized murine model of arthritis and in vitro by a human intestinal epithelium cell-based study . Chen et al. further demonstrated that Collinsella could be transferred to germ-free mice with resultant exacerbation of arthritis in a murine model .

In contrast to previous studies revealing that the predominance of Prevotella in the gut microbiota was associated with the untreated or new-onset RA and phylum Bacteroidetes was enriched in early RA patients , we did not observe significant increase in the abundance of family Prevotellaceae or phylum Bacteroidetes .

Using pre-trained Naive Bayes Greengenes classifier to explore the taxonomic composition of gut microbiota , we observed an increased abundance of phylum Verrucomicrobiae , which might be driven by the genus Akkermansia ( Akkermansia muciniphila ) , in RA patients compared with healthy subjects .

There was a trend of difference finding in the β-diversity between patients with the lowest and the highest levels of TNF-α or IL-17A , indicating an association of gut microbiota composition with the inflammatory parameters in RA patients .

Our statistical data has suggested that there was no significant difference which may be due to the small sample size of RA subgroups with different phenotypes .
