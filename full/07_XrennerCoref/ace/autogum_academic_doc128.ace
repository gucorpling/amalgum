In general , as already stressed elsewhere , the success of the projects , both bottom-up and top-down , seems to come from a widespread communication , participation and engagement of the population , through the creation of meeting places and the diffusion of community activities , as well as the creation of private â€“ public partnerships and strong stakeholder coordination and engagement ( see SE13 in

The actions undertaken not only have a direct effect on the districts , such as the reduction of flooding risks , but also have positive implications at a wider scale , such as the reduction of water consumption and the increasing of municipal waste management .

The results of this analysis are represented in radar graphs , where the axes are the sub-dimensions identified , whereas the data points show the number of cases presenting specific actions and interventions under the considered categories (

It has to be noted that the sub-dimensions were defined based on an inductive method in order to classify and to cluster all the specific actions of each case study in unique identifications .

In addition , the disincentive of private cars is encouraged by the proliferation of car-free areas and by a reduction in the number of parking lots , often isolated in the district borders .
