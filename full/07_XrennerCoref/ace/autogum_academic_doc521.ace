In this study , we presented the fungal community and diversity of the abandoned solar salterns and the intertidal mudflats on three different islands located in the Yellow Sea of South Korea , and we identified indicator taxa for the assessment of the restoration of abandoned salterns to mudflats .

We demonstrate that the ecological recovery of the abandoned salterns can be assessed by using the two indicator taxa to indicate not only the recovery state but also the recovery direction , i. e. , whether the recovery process is moving in the right direction .

The fungal communities in the abandoned salterns in Yubudo and Gopado had been restored to a similar status as those in the mudflats , but that was not the case of the saltern in Yongyudo , which was abandoned less than a year ago .

The diversity and the number of isolates in the NS were higher than those in the other salterns , which is inconsistent with the results of metagenomics , and every isolate except P. chrysosporium belongs to the Ascomycota .

However , the results were not identical , even though we only used methods that use the absolute abundance data rather than processed data such as ecological distances that could lead to statistical misinterpretation .

However , many novel fungal species were found from the abandoned salterns , and interestingly , all fungal strains selected for high bioactivity were isolated from NS or RS .

Therefore , active measures to recover abandoned salterns to mudflats should be carefully determined and planned , taking into account their value as a source of biological resources .

We also proved that the fungal community is highly suitable for use in ecosystem assessment , as it has a sufficient level of identification with good resolution .

Since bioactive compounds with these activities have never been reported from these species , the likelihood of discovering novel compounds is high .
