Shiny/Non-Shiny Ratios at 1:1 or greater ( 113 responses ) If a player got 1 Shiny with 1 total Wailmer ( or 2:2 , 3:3 , etc. ) , this again would affect Negative numbers ( 2 responses ) Self-explanatory as well Errors ( 5 responses ) Entering zero after selecting that the player had found a shiny wailmer , or other “ hanging chad ” entries was classified as invalid , as I preferred not to alter the data and felt it best to just remove the result from the dataset .

Ignoring the responses of 3 Shiny lowers the drop rate to 1:540 , but I have no justification to ignore those responses , as it is not statistically impossible to get 3 Shiny , though highly unlikely on as few as 60 catches .

Total Wailmer Caught : 0 ( 101 responses ) Self-explanatory , but if you have n’t caught any Wailmer , you are certainly not going to have gotten a shiny and I did n’t want those to affect averages , etc.

If I were to do anything differently , I would have asked for total number of Wailmer seen/checked instead of caught , but I ’m unsure if it would have made a significant difference .

I also calculated the Average Drop Rate including just the previous “ Caught : ” group to see how much of a change the 3 & 4 Shiny catches changed the overall drop rate .

I also had a few responses with high catches and no shiny ( high 1,678 ) and some responses indicating 1 shiny with low total catches ( lowest was 1 for 3 ) .

A drop rate of 1:512 ( or 1:500 ) would also explain the number of players , myself included , that have not found one yet , despite having caught/seen 200+ Wailmer .

1,6 abstract|5,6 quantity|8,9 quantity|13,17 person|18,19 person|25,26 person

Based on the above data , the drop rate can be calculated to 1:509 , which is close to the predicted 1:512 , as opposed to the other predicted value of 1:256 .

As you can see above , a total of 941 Shiny Wailmer have been caught from 479,376 catches , with an average of 21.36 % of players finding a shiny .

( If anything , it would have made the Ratio larger , but percentage of players with a shiny seem to correspond well to the overall catch rate . )
