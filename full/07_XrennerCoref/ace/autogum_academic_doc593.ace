Two measurements based on the Histogram of the Oriented Gradients ( HOG ) and the edge detection results of the satellite images , namely Variation-HOG ( V-HOG ) and Edge Density Index ( EDI ) , were used to conduct the change detection between the pre-disaster and post-disaster satellite images .

The OSM building map represents the pre-disaster time ; however , since some buildings get damaged during the disaster and are later demolished , direct use of those maps for the training area selection from post-disaster images will lead to inaccurate results as rubble and damaged buildings are included .

Hence , to overcome these issues , the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI ) and Normalized Difference Water Index ( NDWI ) indices were computed for the pre-disaster image to exclude vegetated areas , trees , and water bodies from the building mask .

Since it was observed that the shift on the building footprints was not systematic and the shift direction and amount differs substantially across the area , initially the downloaded OSM data for the pre-disaster time were separated into five sections/regions .

In order to achieve good results from the application of the rubber sheeting method , five geographically well-distributed points within each region of interest were used so that the points cover at least the center and the four main directions .

Since the extraction of the buildings will be based on the advanced proposed deep learning approach , a simple yet accurate method was developed only for the identification of the intact and damaged buildings from the provided OSM building map .

Since the aim of this study was to use OSM building data as a mask to extract building training samples from the pre-disaster image for a CNN-based approach , we implemented simple preprocesses to create accurate training samples .

Then , rubber sheeting was implemented in ArcGIS , which can also handle small geometric correction as well as shifting the vector maps to adjust and align the building map to the building rooftops in the pre-disaster image (

In addition , even for a correct match of building and OSM map , some non-building pixels might end up inside the training samples , e. g. , a tree may partially cover a rooftop of a building .

Moreover , in order to increase the training samples , more patches were generated from the same area by shifting the starting point of the generation of the patches by 100 pixels in both x and y directions .

In this paper , we propose a framework for updating the building database after a disaster through an automated ResUnet-CRF , using outdated OSM building data and multi-temporal satellite images (

This procedure was conducted three times to obtain different image patches from the same area and then the suitable training samples were selected from those to train the network .

To do so , NDVI and NDWI masks were computed based on pre-defined thresholds and those pixels falling into the masks were removed from the building training class .

Although the mismatch between OSM building footprints and the actual buildings in the pre-disaster images was mostly corrected for in step 1 , some matching errors remained .

This might also occur where buildings are next to the sea/water bodies , which may lead to the inclusion of water pixels in the training samples .

Hence , the damaged and destroyed buildings should be excluded from the building footprint map before using them for training area selection for post-disaster time images .

For example , in the case where a building near a vegetated area has a mismatch , the building mask might contain vegetation pixels .

In addition , 542 image patches were selected for each of the disaster and post-disaster images to be used for fine-tuning of the model .

The change detection was performed only on the building masks of the images to distinguish the damaged/demolished and intact buildings in the post-disaster image .

Furthermore , the post-disaster satellite images were co-registered/rectified according to the pre-disaster image using ArcGIS by selecting geo-rectification points .
