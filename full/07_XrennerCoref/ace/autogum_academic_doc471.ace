NAFLD has a strong inherited component , and variants in proteins regulating hepatocellular lipid handling , including patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 ( PNPLA3 ) , transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 ( TM6SF2 ) , membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 ( MBOAT7 ) , predispose to the disease development and progression to NASH and fibrosis .

Thus , to investigate the independent contribution of IR and NASH that is usually intertwined in patients on miRNAs expression , IR was induced in mice by haploinsufficiency for InsR ( InsR+/− ) , which determines an impairment of hepatic insulin signaling recapitulating that has been observed in NAFLD patients .

NAFLD is defined by increased hepatic fat accumulation not explained by alcohol abuse , and it encompasses a wide spectrum of liver injuries , ranging from simple steatosis ( >5 % of liver weight ) to its inflammatory form nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) .

In particular , microRNAs ( miRNAs ) are short non-protein coding , single-strand RNAs of 19 – 22 nucleotides that regulate gene expression and cell-to-cell communication as it occurs between hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) during fibrogenesis .

Consistently with these results , target prediction analysis revealed that miR-101-3p is involved in insulin signaling , lipid metabolism , cell proliferation , fibrogenesis , and cancer susceptibility , possibly representing a molecular signature in NAFLD during IR .

Here , we showed that miR-101-3p was downregulated in InsR+/− HSCs and hepatocytes , its expression was reduced even in total livers of insulin resistant mice , and it was associated with all stages of liver disease .

Alteration of miRNA expression in response to genetic/epigenetic factors or environmental conditions may contribute to steatosis onset and NAFLD progression to fibrosis and cancer , mirroring the histological features and the molecular events occurring in NAFLD .

Indeed , fibrosis has been observed in diabetic patients with NAFLD even independently of NASH , and genetic variants that impair insulin receptor ( InsR ) signaling favor fibrosis development in NAFLD patients .

The mechanism whereby IR aggravates fibrosis may be related to reduced extracellular matrix ( ECM ) degradation and to the induction of proteins involved in collagen crosslinking .

Conversely , to model fibrogenic NASH , we exploited the methionine choline deficient ( MCD ) diet , which impairs phospholipid metabolism without altering IR .
