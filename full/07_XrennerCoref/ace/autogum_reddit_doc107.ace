My husband and I are going to be in Key West for a wedding this week and we have Saturday and Sunday to ourselves , I was wondering if there 's anything you guys can suggest that we can do for fun ! I 've looked up some things and found the aquarium and a few cool places , but getting the local scoop is always nice .
