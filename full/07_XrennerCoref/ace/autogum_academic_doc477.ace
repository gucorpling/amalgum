EVs can be classified in exosomes , nano-sized vesicles ( with a diameter in the range of 30 to 120 nm ) , that originate from the cell endocytic compartment through the formation of multivesicular bodies ( MVB ) , microvesicles , with a diameter up to 1 μm released by cell membrane budding , and apoptotic bodies , with a dimension similar to platelets , derived from blebbing of dying cells .

In addition , given their phospholipid bilayer , EVs can directly fuse with the targeted plasma membrane , thus allowing a more efficient internalization of the encapsulated drug . Their hydrophilic shell , together with the presence of anti-phagocytosis surface markers ( i. e. , CD47 ) , enables them to evade phagocytosis by monocytes and macrophages of the reticulo-endothelial system , hence weakening their clearance .

EV biological properties derive from their sophisticated membrane structure , characterized by the presence of several proteins for active targeting , adhesion , cell fusion , and intracellular release of their content ; this functional complexity is not easily reproduced by de novo synthesized nanoparticles .

EVs have been shown to carry functionally active biological materials including proteins , mRNAs and miRNAs , which makes them capable of transmitting signals to target cells in the surrounding environment as well as to distant organs , via blood and lymphatic vessels .

In the second part of the review , we will take a step back and bring attention to the basics of one of the main pitfalls concerning EVs : the urgent need for highly pure vesicle preparation .

For example , it has been demonstrated that the administration of EV-encapsulating chemotherapy drugs leads to a significant reduction of drug accumulation in off-target organs , thus preventing important side effects during standard clinical protocols .

These experimental evidences , in addition to preliminary clinical data , indicate that EV formulations may not only enhance the safety and biodistribution of commonly used drugs , but also increase their efficacy .

Although this research field is in its infancy , in the last decade , the use of bio-engineered EVs for the delivery of cytotoxic molecules in preclinical models has produced encouraging results .

Despite the distinct sizes and biogenesis , the absence of standardized isolation methods and the numerous similarities existing between these two subclasses make it particularly challenging to distinguish among them .

Among the several types of nano-based drug delivery systems , liposomes are probably the most used , due to their non-toxicity and capacity to accommodate high amounts of compounds .

Since EVs can be obtained with an autologous procedure from the patient ’s cells or blood , they do not solicit the immune system as usual synthetic formulations do .

However , a still inadequate in vivo targeting efficiency together with a potential immunogenicity associated to liposomal formulations has limited their broad applicability in therapeutics .

Moreover , the limited size allows them to efficiently extravasate through the inter-endothelial junctions and fenestrations of both existing and neo-synthesized vessels .

Therefore , the greater specificity combined with the consequent limited induction of systemic side effects make EVs ideal vehicles for drug delivery .
