While for this study the microcontroller board and data logger combination was programmed as an interval logger , for future studies it could also be programmed as a state or event logger ( the interrupt pins on the microcontroller board can be used for state and event logging ) .

Furthermore , the interval can be programmed to be longer or shorter for specified times , ( e. g. , during base or storm flow ) or to increase or decrease in length over time ( e. g. , during the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph ) .

The 1.9 % failed data logs for the 2016 field season were attributed to a single microcontroller board and data logger shield combination , which for unknown reasons stopped logging data for eight days in the middle of the field season and then continued to work again .

Bhamjee and Lindsay ( 2011 ) argued that a state logging approach is preferable to an interval logging approach for temporary stream monitoring because the latter would quickly reduce memory capacity when measuring at short intervals .

However , to further simplify data collection and allow the ability to collect real-time data , the next step would be to add a module to the multi-sensor monitoring system that enables wireless data transmission .

For state logging , custom programming offers the possibility to assign custom state change thresholds , rather than having to work with pre-programmed thresholds ( which is the case for most conventional loggers ) .

Not only is the combined price of a microcontroller board and data logger shield lower , but the microcontroller board also offers more connections for sensors , thus lowering the costs per sensor .

However , new developments in wireless technology will improve the power consumption , reception and costs of these modules , making it more practical and cost-effective to include them in future setups .

If , for a future project , regular resetting of the RTC is not an option , then it could be worth it to invest in a better RTC .

Such a module was not included in the current setup of the monitoring system because it would have significantly increased the power consumption and costs of the monitoring system .

Accumulating RTC drift over a relatively long period could be problematic when comparing the sensor data to data from other instruments with significantly smaller clock drifts .
