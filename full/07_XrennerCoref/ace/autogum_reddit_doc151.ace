As if it ’s her achievement ! ? ! I remember how she took so long in the chair complaining about my makeup and hair person on our wedding day that I had to be rushed through hair and make up ! ! I remember her being so angry with us because my mother in law had a cancer scare and we did n’t share it with her and we should have “ cause she ’s family . ”

I get so angry every time I even think about it and whenever she sends us anything related to our marriage , or comments anything related to our marriage , it brings me back to the proposal and how I will never have that moment back and how she was involved in one of the best decisions of my life and tainted that memory .
