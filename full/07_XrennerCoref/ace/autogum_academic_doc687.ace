Because they aim to improve their economies in order to reach the status of a developed economy , they should mainly focus on electricity production and use it effectively .

The most important objective for them is to reach the level of developed countries , since economic development , among other factors , can improve population health status .

On the other hand , it is also identified that higher electricity production will have a positive effect on industrial production in the following period .

By increasing the number of the dams , it can be possible to increase electricity production , which has a positive contribution to sustainable growth .

In addition to these issues , it is also important that these countries turn to alternative energy sources in order to increase electricity production .

Another important point is that a detailed plan should be designed by the authorities with the aim of using this electricity effectively .

For instance , renewable energy sources such as solar , wind and geothermal energy have gained importance especially in recent years .
