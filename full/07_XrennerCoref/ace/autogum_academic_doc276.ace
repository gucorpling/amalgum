However , most of these researches was performed for homogeneous background media , and further research is still needed on the imaging performance of Kirchhoff and subspace migrations when the unknown targets are surrounded by random scatterers or embedded in an inhomogeneous medium .

Kirchhoff and subspace migration are also well-known non-iterative techniques for finding location/shape of unknown inhomogeneities , and they have been applied to a variety of problems ( see [ 38,39,40,41,42,43 ] , for instance ) .

The analysis is based on the structure of the singular vectors associated with non-zero singular values of so-called multi-static response ( MSR ) matrix and asymptotic expansion formula in the presence of small electromagnetic defects .
