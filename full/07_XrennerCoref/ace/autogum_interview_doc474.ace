On the technical level , the only major criticism I 've seen of " Elephants Dream " is the character animation , especially in the opening scene -- many reviewers felt that the movements seemed a bit unnatural .

I 'm very happy with the reviews we got so far ; luckily the movie was perceived as a professional quality product , and reviewed based on comparisons with what the big studios come up with .

But , most importantly ; the main target of our project was not only to create a 3D movie short , but to experiment with ways to improve the efficiency and quality of open source development .

I 'm the first to admit that - looking back especially - certain aspects worked out quite weakly ; there 's loose ends and questionable decisions , especially in story development and continuity .

I know they might have liked a cartoonish funny movie with furry animals better , but for that you get already pretty well served by the bigger 3D animation studios . : )

In many animation movies they introduce characters in the beginning in a way you get used to their specific characteristic movements , so you accept a certain level of non-realism easily .

On this aspect only , this project was just a huge success , and the main reason for our sponsors ( the DVD pre-sale ) to support it .

Their personal incentive to participate in this project was also to learn from it , and to create a good portfolio for their future career .

I can clearly see the animation quality increase , and that whilst the ending scenes were done in much less time due to time constraints .

Even when we could n't satisfy all these quality demands , it has luckily not been branded as a pathetic presumptuous attempt by amateurs !

The five artists from our user community who were invited to make the movie were young people with no professional background in filmmaking .

Yeah , the challenge the artists set themselves - to use quite realistic personages - is also something that easily works against you .

Would the Blender Foundation be interested in such a project , or do you intend to continue focusing mainly on shorts ?

I 've witnessed them grow in competence in the past year enormously , something I 'm incredibly proud of .

Another aspect is that we 've started work on the first scenes , and ended with the last scenes .

Do you think there is hope for a full-length open movie project in the near future ?

We also did n't schedule to do 9.5 minutes of animation either â€¦ .
