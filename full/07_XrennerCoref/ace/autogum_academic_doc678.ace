Due to the fact that universally accepted mobile-native affordances were used throughout this app , such as the text and appearance of the buttons , the map functionality , and user interface touch/swipe movement patterns , one can infer that either the specific participant group may have not had as much exposure to standardised mobile digital experiences as others , and/or that their intrinsic motivation levels for interacting with mobile applications was predisposed to waning in the face of negative feedback .

At the other end of the scale , those photos only visible ( or fully visible ) on swiping were only chosen twice , and then only in third iterations , tentative indications that the reluctance to scroll identified in the author ’s prior work is in evidence in a mobile environment , despite the fact that the swipe action required may be easier than using either a mouse or arrow keys .

In the case of our participants , how they approached the system-specific tasks — especially in the face of difficulty or negative feedback , for example , at the hands of the error message in the map , or the unexpected navigation screen — might be indicative of their a priori attitude towards digital or mobile use in general .

For example , the author ’s PhD on website design for people with learning disabilities , completed only five years ago , is unlikely to be replicated or built upon , as the world of IT is now mobile and dominated by apps rather than by web pages on large screens .

Archibald and Munce describe how gatekeepers may limit access to potential participants to those of their choice , such as those likely to have ‘ an above average understanding of the [ research ] instead of participants with a more typical profile ’ ( p. 35 ) .

The propensity to choose the top two photos when deciding on which attraction to locate , reflects work undertaken by the author on web site design and usability on static devices , where he developed the idea of ‘ serial access ’ .

Interestingly , in the mobile environment , the easiest content with which to interact for people using their thumb to interact may not be at the top , but on the right of the screen ( for right-handed people ) .

By the time the research cycle of finding a topic , obtaining funding , carrying out the study , writing up , and publishing has been undertaken , the technology will have moved on and other areas appearing for study .

One way to attempt a global interpretation of results of this experiment is to differentiate between a user ’s general beliefs and attitudes regarding technology , and a specific perception to a particular application .

This is , indeed , one reason we decided to create an app which tested interactions likely to be used over a long period of time ( tap , swipe , etc. ) .

This can be defined as the practice of linearly absorbing each unit of information , without skipping any phrases or words that may be irrelevant and without looking beyond the immediate content encountered .

A longer time-lapse between app demonstration and the usability test may have elicited more usability issues , as the participants would not have been able to rely on memory so much .

However , the photos themselves were not strictly controlled variables and may have played a part in the selection ( for example the natural visual attractiveness of the London Eye ) .

We classified this as an affordance difficulty due to the fact that there was no visible indicator ( such as an arrow pointing down ) to indicate a downward swipe .

Only with encouragement from the researcher and with successful iterations were the participants enabled to develop an application-specific opinion and comfort level that allowed for greater ease of use .

Participants had varied experience with technology , although in a way this could be seen as a strength , permitting a wider spectrum of user behaviour to be observed .
