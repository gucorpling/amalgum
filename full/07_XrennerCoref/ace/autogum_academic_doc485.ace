The 12-month point prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders in Western countries sums up to 10 % – 14 % on average now , and it has become a public health priority issue around the World in the case of adults and children .

Recent World Health Organization ( WHO ) evidence reviews , published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health , have revealed sufficient evidence that sources of transportation noise lead to serious annoyance , sleep disturbance , and cardio-metabolic disorders .

It was unfortunate that the WHO evidence review on mental health was hampered mainly by the broad outcome selection , which embraced different levels of severity , from health-related quality of life to clinical outcomes like depression or anxiety disorders .

By restricting to more confined clinical outcomes , such as depression and anxiety , and the exposure to residential road traffic noise ( as the most prevalent type of traffic noise exposure ) too many analysis subsets can be avoided .

In the meantime ( the mental health review included papers up to October 2015 ) , a sufficient number of new studies on more severe mental health outcomes , such as depression and other mental health disorders , were published .

Moreover , the pathway to mental disorders is a complex and interactive process , and over-reliance on individual treatment at the expense of broader “ structural prevention ” approaches has further hindered the successful reduction of disease prevalence .

The updated meta-analysis should add to the growing collection of up-to-date systematic reviews on health effects of traffic noise ( e. g. , birth outcomes , cardiovascular and metabolic disease , and behavioral/emotional disorders in youth ) .

The small number of studies in the sub-section outcomes and the diverse measurement instruments used in the available studies ( symptom questionnaires , clinical diagnoses , psychotropic medication ) prevented the authors from conducting full meta-analyses .

Mental health is a perquisite for well-being and participation in social and economic life , with the burden already amounting to about 4 % of the gross domestic product across European Union countries .

Unlike other chronic diseases , mental disorders such as anxiety and depression show an early-life onset , ranging from mild and time-limited to chronic and severe impairments .

Clark and Paunovic concluded that there were too few studies of clinically significant mental health outcomes , and studies of large samples were needed .

With that in mind , we aimed to supplement the WHO review by providing a formal meta-analysis with these additional studies .

This feature makes the illness difficult to identify , and therefore , it is often poorly treated and overlooked .
