In order to reveal the impacts of pore structure on the gas flow in migration and accumulation process in the tight sandstone , physical simulation experiments of gas migration and accumulation combined with X-ray computed tomography ( X-CT ) and casting thin section ( CTS ) analyses were conducted on the 13 samples collected from Shanxi and Lower Shihezi formations in the Daniudi gas field .
