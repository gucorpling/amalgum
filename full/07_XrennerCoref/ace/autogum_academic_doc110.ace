The GUECL measured by the super-efficiency SBM-VRS model was a truncated variable with a value range greater than 0 . For such limited dependent variables , if the OLS ( ordinary least squares ) method is used to estimate the model , the parameters obtained would then be inconsistent and biased , but the inconsistency and bias could be avoided by adopting the Tobit model .

Based on the existing research results and by considering data availability , agricultural human capital , farmer occupational differentiation , the extent of farmers ’ dependence on cultivated land , agricultural added value , agricultural machinery density , agricultural scale level and agricultural disaster rate were selected as the variables to study the factors influencing the GUECL in this paper ( Table 2 ) .

Farmer occupational differentiation results in differences in farmers ’ income levels and structures , so the influence of farmer occupational differentiation on the GUECL is undefined . ③ The higher the proportion of rural household per capita net farmland income in rural household per capita net income , the greater farmers ’ dependence on cultivated land income .

In this paper , the software Stata 13.0 was used to conduct a random-effect panel Tobit regression analysis on the factors influencing the GUECL in the 30 provinces ( autonomous regions or municipalities directly under the central government ) of China during 2001 – 2016 .
