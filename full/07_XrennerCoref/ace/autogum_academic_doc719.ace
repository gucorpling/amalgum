Examples include talking with companions while crossing in groups , using a mobile phone , carrying luggage , grooming , drinking or eating , reading , looking at the surrounding instead of oncoming traffic , searching their bags , carrying a bicycle or umbrella , holding a child ’s hand , or pushing a stroller .

From the above observed special cases , only the effect of pedestrians crossing without waiting and distraction were considered in the analysis and pedestrians who waited on the road , rolling gap acceptance , and number of attempts were not considered .

The longer the pedestrian has to wait , the greater the chances that they will take risks when they cross . Drivers yielding and respecting the pedestrians ’ right of way are essential for pedestrian ’s safety at these crosswalks .

In many cases , while approaching the marked crosswalk , a pedestrian analyzes the situation and if they do not see any oncoming vehicle/s , they start crossing without waiting at the sidewalk .

If the oncoming vehicle gives the right of way to the pedestrian by yielding , then the pedestrian starts crossing and completes the crossing maneuver safely ; this is the safest crossing scenario .

If the oncoming vehicle or series of vehicles do not stop , then the pedestrian must wait for a sufficient gap in the traffic stream before they can start crossing .

Some pedestrians start crossing as soon as the approaching vehicle is seen and cross the crosswalk just after a vehicle has passed and before the next one arrives .

However , if a pedestrian sees a vehicle or a series of oncoming vehicles , they wait at the sidewalk until they can cross safely .

This behavior can be risky , as the pedestrian might not have made accurate judgments about the speed or distance of oncoming vehicles ; and

Some pedestrians step down from the sidewalk onto the crosswalk and wait for a gap in the traffic stream .

If they see any oncoming vehicle while crossing , they accelerate or run to complete the crossing .

This can be dangerous if the driver does not yield and continues at the same speed .

Some pedestrians , who arrive running , maintain the same speed when on the crosswalk .

This occurs when drivers do not acknowledge the pedestrian ’s right of way ;

Sometimes , the pedestrian makes more than one attempt for initiating crossing .
