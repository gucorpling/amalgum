It is interesting to note that the percentage of piglets born with a ruptured umbilical cord varies widely from around 20 % to 70 % , and also that in some studies this percentage increases with birth order , whereas in others it is constant . Around 50 % or more of stillbirths are associated with a ruptured umbilical cord , which suggests that this is an important risk factor .

In prolonged parturitions , placentae may also start to detach , since van Rens and van der Lende reported that in contrast to short parturitions where placentae are expelled after the last piglet has been born , in prolonged parturitions the first set of membranes are expelled while some piglets are still to be born .

In short parturitions ( <3 h for example ) , stillbirth increased ten-fold between the first and the last piglets in the birth order ; in long parturitions , stillbirth increased forty-fold ( from 1 % to 37 % ) between the first and the last piglets .

In observational studies with no interventions , the cumulative effect of oxygen deprivation is reflected in the profound effect of birth order on asphyxia symptoms , with piglets later in the birth order showing increasingly higher lactate and lower pH in umbilical cord samples at birth .

In this respect , we do not know whether before being expelled , foetuses gradually travel through the uterine horn , or remain positioned at their implantation site and only travel to the birth canal once it is their turn .

The importance of the cumulative effect of contractions is supported by observations from Zerobin and Kündig , showing that inhibition of contractions at the start or just before parturition , using a tocolytic , prolonged parturition without increasing stillbirths .

Repeated episodes of obstructed blood flow , however , can result in anaerobic metabolism , the cumulative effect of which is an increasing lactate level in foetal blood and a decreasing foetal blood pH as buffering capacity is exhausted .

The function of the latter is less clear , but have been proposed to shorten the uterine horn and to prevent accumulation of foetuses at the caudal end , thus reducing the premature rupture of the umbilical cord .

In fact , a recent study showed that risk of stillbirth only started to increase significantly when birth interval exceeded 90 min , whereas the duration of farrowing increased the risk cumulatively with every 2 h that elapsed .

With the cumulative duration of farrowing and birth order being the predominant factors determining the risk of stillbirth , other piglet-related factors that increase this risk are a ruptured umbilical cord , breech position and meconium staining .

This was demonstrated by van Dijk , et al. , who clamped the umbilical cord of unborn piglets for 5 – 8 min during caesarean section , to simulate the cumulative effect of oxygen insufficiency .

Oxygen deprivation during parturition , as the main cause of stillbirth , may be caused by stretching and even rupture of the umbilical cord during stage II ( expulsion of piglets ) of parturition .

Obstruction of blood flow to the foetus induces a temporary drop in heart rate , which in itself is probably harmless and an adaptive mechanism of the foetus to reduce its oxygen consumption .

In a more recent study , the total duration of farrowing was shown to exacerbate the effect of birth order on measures of asphyxia and on the risk of stillbirth .

With meconium staining it is also difficult to assess whether it is a consequence of asphyxia , or whether it contributed to the factors leading up to stillbirth .

Both tubo-cervical and cervico-tubal contractions occur during parturition , the first obviously serving to transport foetuses to the birth canal .

However , when expressed as the relative risk , a ruptured umbilical cord increases the risk of stillbirth approximately three-fold .
