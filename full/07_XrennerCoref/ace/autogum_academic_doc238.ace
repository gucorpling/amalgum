The enumerated categories data field can be divided into different subcategories such as ( low , median , and high ) for laboratory results , ( normal , and abnormal ) for blood pressure , or classify patients into certain groups based on age .

However , in case the previous techniques fail to increase the accuracy of the prediction systems , NLP is usually applied to extract more features from narrative text . A summary of feature extraction methods is presented at the end of this section .

From an Information Extraction ( IE ) perspective , it is essential to pre-process the clinical text by some NLP techniques , such as tokenization , sentence detection , word sense disambiguation , part of speech tagging ( POS ) and parsing .

An analysis of these clinical notes could offer better information and description of the patient ’s status ; however , the manual review of these notes for large-scale projects is costly and highly time-consuming .

These fields vary across different institutions ’ datasets . ‘ Diagnoses ’ , ‘ medication ’ , and ‘ procedure ’ fields are the most common types of data represented in code .

Feature extraction using coded data is available and easy to access and is usually conducted by selecting the code that most likely identifies a cohort with a particular disease .

The accuracy of code extraction within an EHR depends on whether the code reflects the physician ’ opinion and whether the physician was able to make a diagnosis correctly .
