There was the ghastly , stinking crush of the subway -- the car cards thrusting themselves at one , leering out like dull bores who grab your arm with another story ; the querulous worry as to whether some one is n't leaning on you ; a man deciding not to give his seat to a woman , hating her for it ; the woman hating him for not doing it ; at worst a squalid phantasmagoria of breath , and old cloth on human bodies and the smells of the food men ate -- at best just people -- too hot or too cold , tired , worried .

A small boy rushed out , sniffed in the damp , fresh air and turned up the collar of his coat ; came three or four couples in a great hurry ; came a further scattering of people whose eyes as they emerged glanced invariably , first at the wet street , then at the rain-filled air , finally at the dismal sky ; last a dense , strolling mass that depressed him with its heavy odor compounded of the tobacco smell of the men and the fetid sensuousness of stale powder on women .

He pictured the rooms where these people lived -- where the patterns of the blistered wall-papers were heavy reiterated sunflowers on green and yellow backgrounds , where there were tin bathtubs and gloomy hallways and verdureless , unnamable spaces in back of the buildings ; where even love dressed as seduction -- a sordid murder around the corner , illicit motherhood in the flat above .
