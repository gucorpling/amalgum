In order to overcome these limitations of Gem , combinatorial regimens such as folinic acid , 5-fluorouracil , irinotecan and oxaliplatin ( FOLFIRINOX ) have been widely used to treat PC patients . FOLFIRINOX presents higher response rates and its median overall survival is nearly 12 months .

One of the primary reasons for the high mortality is the difficulty in early diagnosis of the disease because pancreas is behind the stomach and the patient shows general symptoms such as digestive problems , abdominal pain , and weight loss before metastasis .
