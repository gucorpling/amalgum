Considering the examples presented in Section 4 , the proposal of insurance or maintenance services for the home electric and heating systems fall into this category , as well as the standard packages offered to customers in the mobile communication sector , the inclusion of media contents in such contracts , or the PAYT service in the waste collection sector .

In the communication sector , the inclusion of smartphones , laptops and tablets , or modem , web cubes and TV boxes , are typical examples of product and service integration , since they include access to the communication service and , more often , to specific media contents .

Considering a social sustainability point of view , the adoption of productization in the public service can enable the use of more “ innovative ” products and updated technologies for people who did not have access to them before , due to their high purchase costs .

The proposal of new business models based on leasing plans or the possibility for the user to pay in instalments , including the cost of the product in the monthly fees paid for the service , can extend the market to users with lower income .

Similarly , the remote control devices and smart thermostats , that allow a smart control of the heating and electric systems , as well as comfort and security sensors , are usually sold with a service package including installation and maintenance .

Although the concept of productization has not been deeply investigated in the PSS scientific literature , which is more focused on the opposite phenomenon of servitization , this transformation in the service sector has several recent examples in utilities companies .

While the impacts on sustainability of PSSs in general , dematerialization , and servitization have been often analyzed in literature , discussing benefits and criticalities , a similar analysis on productization is still missing .

Some examples are the installation of photovoltaic systems , efficient boilers and air conditioners , and water purifiers , all of which come with an integrated service of maintenance included in the contract .

Another social impact related to the more diversified offer of the company is the enhancement of its brand value , that can improve significantly thanks to the increase of the service level provided .

The main objective of productization is identified in the possibility to improve the value offered to customers , but other possible environmental , social , and economic outcomes are not clear yet .

The analysis conducted revealed a variety of PSS offerings , which can combine both the strategies identified ( service standardization and addition of a tangible product ) at different levels .

The sensors for bin filling in the waste collection sector are another example of integrated PSSs , since their installation is necessary to implement a dynamic collection service .

For this reason , we propose a first analysis of the main impacts that the strategies presented for the utilities sector can have on sustainability , summarized in

In fact , most PSSs including a physical product often offer the possibility to choose flexible payment plans that facilitate the access to customers .

This can foster the diffusion of more reliable , safe , and energy-efficient technologies , improving the health and safety dimension in domestic environments .

This can also be improved by PSSs based on sensors for comfort and security , aimed at improving the domestic quality of life .

Another interesting discussion point is represented by the possible impacts of productization in the utilities sector on the three main dimensions of sustainability .

Typical examples are the sale of kits with energy-saving led bulbs , smart home kits , air purifiers and domestic composters .

These products are not usually provided with a strong service component , but aim at widening the offer for the customer .

Typical examples are boilers , air conditioners , photovoltaic systems , but also smaller devices such as smartphones and tablets .

Finally , the integration of electric cars and charging stations with the electric service is also included in this category .

This combination can result in different shades of productization , that we clustered in three different PSS integration levels .

The second level is represented by an integrated PSS , providing both a standardized service and a product component .

On the third level , we find PSSs that are prominently product-based .

The first is represented by pure standardized services .
