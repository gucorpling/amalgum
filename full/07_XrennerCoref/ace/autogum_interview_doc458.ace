Do you think it was unfair for Tyra to ask that [ studying magazines and developing your poses ] of you and Diana , considering that even though she 's fuller-figured now , she has a lot more experience under her belt than you two did ?

I could n't study magazines and try to develop my poses , because a woman who weighs 110 pounds and is 5'10 " looks completely different when she shapes and curves her body than a woman who is 5'10 " and weighs 175 pounds .

I think it was about finding a " Top Model " during the show 's beginnings , but I think that Ã¼ber-success of the show has turned it into a profit-driven production .

I 've learned more reading that magazine and getting to know the folks who write for that magazine than I ever learned about being a plus-sized model on ANTM .

Do you think Tyra still believes her show is about finding " the next top model " even though none of the show 's winners have had that success ?

And I truly think that the show would see a return on cultivating their winners , because the show 's credibility would increase .

Well , you know , I would say that it would have been fair if there were magazines for us to study !

That 's why I think that it 's so important that publications like Plus Model Magazine continue to blossom and flourish .

I just wish that the show would put more time and cultivation into their winners even after their cycle 's conclusions .

A fan wrote in to ask , " What struggles did you face on the show as a plus sized model ?

I think that my biggest struggle was realizing that plus sized models and straight sized models are apples and oranges ...

While one cycle is airing , they are taping another and apparently the show is scheduled to continue until 2010 !

I think that viewers think that we have a whole lot more interaction with Tyra than we actually do .

Did Tyra encourage a certain standard among the girls ( weight or otherwise ) that was unhealthy ?
