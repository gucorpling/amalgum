Consequently , ECs acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype and start expressing different pro-inflammatory molecules , such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( MCP1 ) ( also known as chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 2 ; CCL2 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM-1 ) , all of which attract monocytes to the activated endothelium .

It has been proposed that disturbances of hemodynamic forces that are especially likely to occur at atheroprone sites of blood vessels , such as bends or bifurcations , can cause local activation of endothelial cells ( ECs ) .

Phagocytic macrophages actively participate in lipid accumulation by engulfing lipid droplets and give rise to foam cells . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) contribute to the local inflammatory response through antigen presentation and cytokine signaling processes .

Destabilization of plaques leads to their rupture with subsequent thrombus formation that can lead to dangerous events such as acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) and stroke .

Elevated low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) is known to be associated with atherosclerosis and is identified as the major source of lipids accumulating in atherosclerotic plaques .

Atherosclerosis is characterized by progressive lipid deposition in the arterial wall , plaque induction and possible further progression to the state of so-called unstable plaque .

Besides elevated LDL , chronic inflammation is now considered as another crucial pro-atherogenic mechanism that can even precede lipid entry into the arterial intima .

The imbalance of monocyte/macrophage polarization towards the preferential pro-inflammatory phenotype and a lack of normal inflammation resolution are also present in atherosclerosis .
