This study uses a sample of 3504 firms in Vietnam , and aims to fill the gap whether proactive or reactive innovation is better for SMEs , and whether proactive/reactive innovation is better for SMEs firms with higher or lower constraints .

It is suggested that individualism boosts open innovation thanks to its strong association with creativity , but the complexity from the collaboration with external parties should be controlled to some extent to ensure the stability of the business .

First , the data have some missing observations , are short and have not been updated since 2015 , while innovations are the term that should be analyzed in the most current setting possible .

The result shows that reactive innovation brings negative effects to firm performance , consistent with the view that proactive entrepreneurial behavior is a highly sought-after characteristic or a valuable resource for a firm .

Second , this study found that constraints a firm faces play a role in the decision of innovation strategies , specifically the choice between proactive and reactive orientation .

For SMEs , the decision to opt for innovation is more complex , since they suffer from higher constraints which thwart their resources and capabilities to innovate .

Since SMEs in developing countries tend to experience a stronger impact of constraints , the study on the link between constraint – performance is critical in Vietnam .

Finally , our result indicates that if firms have sufficient resources , then proactive strategies should be the choice rather than reactive one to improve firm performance .

Those factors could be obtained through open innovations , which could significantly help in the case of SMEs in developing countries due to their insufficient resources .

Therefore , future studies could seek to update the data and examine the solutions to tackle the negative impact of constraint on firm innovation .

We continue to dig further by filtering innovations into two categories : proactive and reactive , and examine which is better for firm performance .

While there are a number of extant studies dealing with this link , the samples only comprise of firms in developed economies .

Second , the mechanisms/factors to relieve the constraint impact on firm innovation adoption have not been studied in the current research .

Our findings suggest that technological innovations in general are beneficial to firm performance , as this increases firm sales and profits .

Furthermore , open innovation should also be well handled due to its complicated nexus under the micro- and macro-dynamic viewpoints .
