Bhatti proposed a novel method to extract built-up areas by integrating temperature data , normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI ) , and the modified normalized difference water index ( MNDWI ) , which improved the overall accuracy of the extraction . Lin et al. proposed a maximum-entropy method for extracting urban areas from data collected in 2000 , 2005 and 2010 by combining MODIS surface reflectance , MODIS NDVI , and DMSP-OLS data based on the maximum-entropy model ( MAXENT ) . Zhou et al. developed a cluster-based method to estimate the optimal thresholds and map urban extent from the DMSP-OLS NTL data based on the cluster size and overall nighttime light magnitude , which can be used to map urban areas at different levels .

Although these methods can reduce the issues of over- and underestimation , the deficiencies of nighttime light data resolution , such as the overlapping of adjacent pixels , geolocation error , and the limited temporal coverage of the data products , can still be considered unavoidable influencing factors . Shi et al. proposed an improved Neighborhood Focal Statistic ( NFS ) method based on nighttime light data , NDVI data , and water vector data in accordance with the approximation of the characterization trend of each urban area in the nighttime light data and digital elevation model ( DEM ) .

It is worth stressing that the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System ( DMSP-OLS ) nighttime light data can effectively detect city lights and extract information about cities , and the related theories and technologies have driven great achievements in many fields , such as the extraction of urban scope , the monitoring of urban expansion changes , and the prediction of socioeconomic factors , such as gross national product , power consumption , and carbon emissions .

High-resolution optical remote sensing images and other high-quality land cover data products are important data sources for the extraction of urban information . Li et al. proposed an approach to detect built-up areas by using unsupervised learning technology , which was based on remote sensing images with high resolution . Chen et al. developed a field-based method to automatically detect built-up areas from high-resolution satellite images .

The following challenges may still be encountered : ( 1 ) Since urban elements are characterized from different remote sensing data , the features dependent on the relevant sample selection and training parameters or indices have not been comprehensively considered ; ( 2 ) The issue of differences in the resolution among multisource data has not been addressed properly .
