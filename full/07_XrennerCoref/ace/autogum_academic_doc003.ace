Although this interpretation exerts a robust influence on the way we currently grasp and think about biological systems , it has been repeatedly challenged when consideration is given to well-accepted ( although largely ignored ) features of the cellular milieu such as molecular crowding and spatial confinement that are likely to strongly influence the way that the cellular machinery operates .

While the circumstances under which glycolytic oscillations take place are documented and the enzymes and participating biochemical reactions have been characterized , an adequate explanatory framework remains unspecified : why glycolytic oscillations arise and what they reveal about the complex relationship between the various levels of the description of life processes are questions still awaiting definite answers .

This approximation suggests that glycolytic oscillations may arise as a consequence of a living cell ’s requirement for a near constant low-entropy state while remaining metabolically active , in contrast to the prevailing notion that metabolic processes have to be understood as essentially dissipative ( i. e. , in terms of steady state energetics ) .

Particularly , we observed that during glycolytic oscillations , the extent of dipolar relaxation in the cellular interior , which is governed mainly by the rotational dynamics of intracellular water , is coupled to the behavior of the pathway ( intervening metabolites such as ATP and NADH ) in that it oscillates synchronously .

We also found that intracellular water relaxation is a crucial parameter for the manifestation of glycolytic oscillations ( e. g. , oscillations occur only within a defined range of relaxation values ) , and this parameter emerges as an intensive property of the system ( i. e. , it is scale independent ) .

When these cells are starved and respiration is blocked , they will use externally added glucose in such a way that the chemical activity of essential central metabolites such as reduced Nicotinamide Adenine dinucleotide ( NADH ) and Adenosine Triphosphate ( ATP ) will follow a well-established temporal waveform .

Therefore , it is unlikely that it will share properties of dilute solutions where enzymes are generally characterized ; in fact , it is becoming increasingly evident that intracellular water is affected by such a high concentration of solutes and that its behavior significantly deviates from tractable ideality .

Furthermore , water in the cell is not just a passive medium where reactions occur , but an active participant ( e. g. , many cellular reactions are condensations that produce water , or hydrolytic ones that consume it ) .
