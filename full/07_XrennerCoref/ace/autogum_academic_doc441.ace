Comparing ( b ) and ( e ) , or ( c ) and ( f ) , or ( d ) and ( h ) , the commission rates charged to the capacity supplier had stronger effects than the equal commission rates charged to the manufacturer on the profit of each participant .

Among the three charging modes : when was low , the platform obtained the most profits by charging the capacity supplier ; when was moderate , the platform can collected the most profits by charging both sides ; when was high , the platform obtained the most profits by charging the manufacturer .

The results of numerical examples were consistent with actual situations where some sharing platforms that choose bilateral charging set the commission rates charged to the demand side higher than that charged to the suppliers in order to give each participant a more profitable space for sustainable operations .

The numerical examples were constructed to illustrate the effects of interaction among the capacity supplier , the traditional supplier , the manufacturer , the platform , and sustainably conscious consumers on the profit of each participant from the perspective of sustainable operations .

Additionally , combined with Corollary 2 , the platform could obtain the most profits when it charges the capacity supplier and sets the access requirements that cause the capacity supplier to undertake the cost to manage the surplus production capacity .

e because the commission rate had stronger effects than the equal commission rate on the profit of each participant and that there was a mutual relationship between and commission rates with a given , which was found in Theorem 5 .

Firstly , low capacity management costs , which reflect a low level of access requirements for the capacity supplier , set by the platform can result in that the platform benefits from an increase in commission rates such as

According to Theorem 6 , based on the relationship between the access requirements and the commission rate , the impacts of the commission rates on platform ’s profits lead to three situations .

Secondly , with moderate capacity management costs , the profit of platform first increased and then decreased as the commission rates increase , which is shown in

As described in Section 5 , the commission rates set by sharing platforms typically ranges from 10 to 30 percent .
