You were n't organized setting up your ETL DAG and now it 's a pain in the ass to run the second half of this job after you hit a fail point halfway through ? Your docker skills suck so you do n't even know how to contribute to the conversation with the team about how to get this thing deployed on AWS ?

Is it scalable to real-world problems , and do people actually use vanilla NNs much ( without convolutions or other fancy stuff ) ? I 'm just curious what bare minimum knowledge is required to actually " get real stuff done " in ML that is n't just MNIST digit classification .

I 'm starting to suspect that at least part of the brick wall waiting for all those bright eyed would-be data scientists has to do with the grunt work of actually working with the data .

The fact that ML jobs pay so well makes me skeptical that you can get really far on the basics , but I 'd like to hear what people think .

I suspect the majority of the companies out there looking to get more into ML do n't have the data to go beyond making more basic predictions with scikit-learn .

I wonder how much vanilla NNs are used as well , but I have a DS friend that mostly does n't deal with NNs at all .

Most courses in Machine Learning begin with basic neural networks where you learn how feed-forward and back-propagation works , and regularisation .
