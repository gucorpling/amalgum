However , a number of scenarios which are believed to be common for aqueous aerosols , such as organic coatings , phase separation , or low-viscosity aerosols , are known to result in mass transfer limitations which inhibit the uptake of IEPOX into aqueous aerosols , limiting subsequent IEPOX SOA formation .

Although the lower acidity and sulfate concentrations of cloudwater would make the rate of IEPOX SOA formation in cloudwater lower than in aqueous aerosol , other factors , such as high liquid water content and lack of organic coating or viscosity-based mass transfer limitations , may promote SOA formation .

IEPOX secondary organic aerosols ( SOA ) , which in part consists of tetrols and organosulfates , is formed via the acid-catalyzed ring opening of the epoxide followed by nucleophilic addition of water or anions ( e. g. , HSO4âˆ’ ) .
