Secondly , the transport flow on such network is more fragile and vulnerable to many physical and human factors ( e. g. , weather , accidents and regulations ) , it can be envisioned that its spatial interaction patterns have strong economic and demographic effects and implications for policy-making .

Since the end of the 20th century , with the increasing development of globalisation and informatisation , the flow of various elements ( people , goods , knowledge and information ) has become more frequent across various scales , and accordingly , regions have become the space of flows .

The traditional methods of calibrating the spatial interaction models are dominated by global regression models ( e. g. , Ordinary Least Square ( OLS ) , Poisson Regression and negative binomial regression ) based on the assumption that the mobility pattern is spatially stationary .

However , the classic GWRs , using multiple explanatory variables , assume that all the explanatory variables have a spatially homogeneous process of determining the pattern of a dependent variable , or simply speaking , operate on a single spatial scale .

In the field of geographical mobility , there is a long history of deploying a gravity model to analyse the spatial economic interactions between cities and regions by considering a variety of physical , social , economic and even environmental dimensions .

As the most important form of spatial interaction to connect and increase communication between different geographical spaces , transport flow undoubtedly has remarkable impacts on economic activity space and is a key factor in the shaping of socio-economic spatial structure .

With the increasing demand for fast inter-city transport , the infrastructure including expressways , airlines , high-speed railways and ETC ( Electronic Toll Collection ) systems have become the most important parts of the modern transport system .

Regional spatial morphology is also being redefined and modified as researchers from multiple disciplines have begun to recognize and analyse spatial structure using the flow rather than central place perspective .
