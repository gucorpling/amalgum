I thought that the question form would serve the meme better , so I went ahead and registered it ; and as soon as I did , I changed the website to the question instead of the statement ( in the title and header for the page ) .

The " question " domain came about because the entire concept of the meme is not to try and convince people that Beck raped and murdered ; but how the supposed rumour that he did is a direct parody of the techniques he himself uses .

It bears observing that by bringing the WIPO complaint , you took what was merely one small critique meme , in a sea of internet memes , and turned it into a super meme .

: As I said about the original domain - I wanted to register the meme as the domain , and that 's what I referred to as the " statement " domain .

Also , it 's a lot easier to type " gb1990 " than either of the long versions , so that was a part of it as well .

It was n't until people posted news about the legal threats to Reddit , Fark , Digg , and many blogs that I saw spikes in traffic .

For example , when a thread went green ( public ) on Fark.com , traffic to my servers nearly overwhelmed them for a couple of hours .

Even before I got the website up and running , Farkers had already spread the meme - asking questions on Yahoo Answers , for example .

Ultimately , the website 's purpose was to shine a light on Glenn Beck 's style , and to reflect it right back at him .

I did this partly because if he managed to get the question or statement domains taken down , I would have a backup in place .

When we posted my brilliant lawyer Marc Randazza 's responses to the original WIPO complaint , traffic was high for a couple of days .

: Well , it certainly did n't make me very happy , but at the same time , it confirmed what I suspected .

How did you feel when you first found out that Glenn Beck had begun to take legal actions with regard to your website ?

So it definitely got attention out there ; but the traffic to the site dropped off drastically after the first couple of days .

Of course , it confirmed my suspicions that Glenn Beck 's claims to be a champion of the constitution are false claims .

The major spikes in traffic to the site have all come from updates about where the legal fight stood .

I put gb1990.net as a mirror on my second server , in case something happened to the first .

" Media commentators have written that Beck 's actions in the case trigged the " Streisand effect " .

I made gb1990.com the primary domain for the website , and parked the other two on top .

Why did you register alternate domain names : " DidGlennBeckRapeAndMurderAYoungGirlIn1990.com " , and " gb1990.com " ?

It also made me unhappy because I saw it as a direct assault on free speech .

1,2 abstract|4,5 person|7,8 person|9,10 event|11,17 abstract|15,17 abstract

In each case , it dropped down to a relatively low level when news was sparse .

When the domain dispute was filed , I registered gb1990.com , as well as gb1990.net .
