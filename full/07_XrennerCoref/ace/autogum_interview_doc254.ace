But also , you know , I became a mathematician because people , the generation above me , made the effort to excite the general public about mathematics and I thought that was what I wanted to be when I grow up , so my hope is as well that my popularization will encourage the next generation of mathematicians but also to encourage politicians to recognize that maths is an important part of our society and needs to be funded .

I think a lot of people got into mathematics because of puzzles , especially at the moment , with Sudoku being so popular , I think people will love doing puzzles - now it 's a very popular TV show .

At the moment I 'm in the middle of making a history of mathematics series for the BBC , four one-hour programs from the Ancient Babylon through to the modern day .

My work is looking at symmetry , something called group theory , but using tools from number theory , something called the Zeta function , which was introduced by Riemann .

It was a travel program because mathematics is a very international subject and so we travel around the world : to India , to Germany , to Greece .

So I used that tool to try and understand instead of prime numbers , which are very hard to understand , what sort of symmetry can exist .

So , for example this conference is about communicating to our peers but I think that communication can go to a much broader audience .

This conference is looking at ways of connecting lots of different ideas in mathematics to help us understand groups and symmetry .

I mean discoveries really cannot be said to exist , I think , unless you communicate them to other people .
