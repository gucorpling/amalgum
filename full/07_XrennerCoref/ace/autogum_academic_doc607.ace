This has been evidenced in recent studies indicating that maintaining high levels of strength , balance , gait and cardiorespiratory fitness are the main objectives for the optimal achievement of the basic and instrumental daily living activities for middle-aged and older women , as well as to delay the onset of sarcopenia and frailty .

In this sense , HIICT is an alternative form of training for improving physical condition and performance in daily living activities due to integrated multiplanar-based movements ( squatting , pulling , etc. ) performed at maximal speed , which makes it very functional and with high transfer in older adults .

Due to hormonal changes ( i. e. , menopause ) , the effect of ageing in women is resulting in chronic diseases , functional dependence , the prevalence of sarcopenia and frailty and the risk of falls and injuries , increasing the risk of hospitalization and mortality .

Furthermore , during recent years a new type of training called high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) has been included as an alternative method of training in healthy people and as part of the treatment of pathologies , especially in cardiac rehabilitation programmes .

Body weight-based circuit training can be considered a functional training method because they are based on the imitation of daily living activities in which only body weight is used ( i. e. , body weight squats and lunges ) .

For these reasons , the main objective of the present study was to determine what type of training ( HIICT or MICT ) induces greater adaptations in the functional ability and BMI of middle-aged and older women .

Recently , physical exercise has become relevant for the maintenance of health and functional ability in middle-aged and older women , functional ability being understood as the capacity to carry out activities of daily living .

Similarly , physical exercise also helps maintain healthy body mass index ( BMI ) values , which is an important factor in their relationship to chronic diseases that cause dependence in older women populations .

Based on the previous research , our hypothesis was that HIICT would significantly improve the strength , gait , cardiorespiratory fitness , static and dynamic balance and BMI in middle-aged and older women .

Some research has shown strong evidence that HIIT is an effective method for improving maximal oxygen uptake , strength , cardiorespiratory fitness , gait and body composition in older people with pathologies .

Some research involving the elderly has shown that moderate-intensity circuit training ( MICT ) has positive effects on strength , cardiorespiratory fitness , balance , body composition and quality of life .

However , although the benefits of HIIT are known , there is little evidence on including HIIT methodology in circuit training ( HIICT ) in healthy middle-aged and older women .

Circuit training consists of performing a series of exercises for all muscle groups , allowing strength and cardiorespiratory fitness to be influenced simultaneously .

HIIT consists of intermittent short high-intensity work periods ( 85 â€“ 100 % of maximal oxygen uptake ) and relative rest periods .

In fact , there is a trend that indicates that health indices and markers are more favourable after HIIT than after MICT .

For these reasons , governments and the healthcare system are implementing physical exercise programmes for middle-aged and older people at day centres .

As the training sessions are usually in groups , circuit training is one of the most common types of training .
