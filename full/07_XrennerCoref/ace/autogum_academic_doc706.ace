This phrase highlights the importance of the collaboration with financial institutions , and thus the potential investments , in order to achieve an improvement in the condition of life for individuals in developing countries . ‘ Investment ’ and ‘ developing countries ’ are also identified as keywords ( see above ) by the temporal overlay keyword co-occurrence map with a recent high interest .

What is striking is that most keywords also occur in the United Nations report ‘ Transforming our World : The Agenda for Sustainable Development ’ ( e. g. , developing countries , world , economic growth , environmental policy , education , renewable energy , technological development , climate change , industrial development , global warming , ecosystem ) .

Furthermore , we can deduct from the analysis that a high interest in the last couple of years around innovation in sustainability emerged and that Anglo-American societies contributed the most to the knowledge base .
