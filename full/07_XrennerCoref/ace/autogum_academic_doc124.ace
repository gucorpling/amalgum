To complete it , other Spanish universities have been selected that could contribute to the objectives of the study : technical universities , as specialists and referents in the field of engineering , and other universities attending to their involvement in the field of sustainability ( such as their participation in the Higher Education Sustainability Initiative ) .

Every engineering degree in Spain includes mandatory courses on Economy , but the contents are not so much related to the inclusive economy , poverty , inequality , or employment , which would be the most significant topics for ESD ; when they appear , they have been considered as social issues .

For the collection of data , the web pages on each of the selected universities and degrees have been reviewed , with the purpose of analyzing the presence of sustainability competences in the competences and objectives that define the degree , and especially the presence in the courses of the curriculum .

The main purpose of this study is to describe how the current degrees of both industrial engineering and informatics engineering are integrating sustainability competences in teaching , paying special attention to whether it is done holistically and systematically throughout the curriculum , and identifying good practices and reference models .

A thorough revision of the Learning Guides was carried out to collect all this information , using some keywords for each key dimension , but also taking advantage of the researchers ’ knowledge of the subjects for identifying their presence into the syllabuses and selecting inspiring practices .

A first pilot study was carried out , in which data from three universities were collected , and the possibility of extending the study to some foreign universities was studied , an option that was rejected due to the lack of homogeneity in the sources of information .

This approach has also been used for Sánchez Carracedo et al. — with a lower range of universities — but it is different from other studies aimed at analyzing the performance of just one university in its different degrees ( internal benchmarking ) .

Moreover , a functional approach has been adopted , focusing the study on two specific aspects that have been considered critical : the holistic vision of sustainability competencies and its systematic inclusion in the curricula .

From this pilot study , a small number of key dimensions were determined , attending their significance for the goal of the study and the facility to be clearly identified in the sources of information .

The difficulty of distinguishing these nuances from the information provided by the Learning Guides has been the reason for not considering these competences as key dimensions .
