For example , Zarnetske et al. conducted a δ15NO3 and chloride tracer test in a stream in Oregon , United States , in which they sampled detailed solute and nutrient concentrations at many locations within a gravel bar . Schaper et al. combined plot- and reach-scale investigations to identify the relevance of hyporheic removal of TrOCs for their removal in the whole stream .

Furthermore , in many streams the oxygen concentration of the surface water varies dramatically between day and night due to photosynthesis during daytime and respiration of organic matter during nighttime , as already shown in 1956 by Odum , as well as in studies by Mulholland et al. , Roberts et al. , and Rajwa-Kuligiewicz et al. .

Individual studies address , for example , the hyporheos , HEFs , hyporheic biogeochemistry , the fate of pharmaceuticals in streambeds , the geomorphology of streams , subsurface hydrogeology , microplastic abundance in streams , or ecological effects of river management measures and damming .

Further research closing the gaps is necessary to improve our understanding of HZs , to protect HZs and ecosystem services provided by them , and finally to conduct adequate and efficient management measures to restore ecosystem functions and ecosystem services .

The researchers only rarely considered bed movement , even though the relevance of bed movement for hyporheic exchange has been long recognized , and can lead , for example , to overestimation of nitrate removal .

Despite a great amount of HZ research during the past two decades , there are still major research gaps (
