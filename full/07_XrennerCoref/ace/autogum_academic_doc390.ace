Sphericity is one of the most important quality traits among hazelnut properties because it is mostly spherical nuts that most preferred in the food industry , whereas the surface area is used to estimate the amount of packaging material required and is important in roasting and cooling operations .

Knowledge of nut and kernel physical characteristics ( such as volume , sphericity , etc. ) are necessary to project the processing lines of hazelnuts because many types of machines are influenced by the size and shape of the food .

The rupture force required for the whole nut and kernel is important during the mechanical shelling process because the application of too great a force can cause damage to the hazelnuts and nut losses in production .

The first objective of this research was to determine the genetic variability between all six hazelnut cultivars in relation to the nut and kernel genetic variability physical characteristics as well as major physio-quality traits .

The world market for hazelnuts is divided into two groups : nuts with intact shells for direct consumption ( 10 % ) and shelled nuts transferred for further technological purposes ( 90 % ) .

Furthermore , high-quality hazelnut cultivars to be used for processing purposes have not been identified in Poland and the cultivated kernels often do not meet market standards determined by the confectionery industry .

Poland has developed the cultivation of only large-sized , so-called table cultivars , with large , oval nuts , almost all of which are sold as a raw product for fresh consumption .

Furthermore , most of hazelnut grown in Poland are originated from C. avellane var. pontica , Corylus maxima , Corylus lamberti or are derived from their hybrids .
