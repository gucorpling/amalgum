In particular , in this paper , we provide very important proof of the completeness of the system of eigenfunctions and associated functions in of the operator for based on fact that the operator of fractional differentiation is sectorial and for ( this fact plays a main role in solving boundary value problems for advection-diffusion equation of fractional order by the method of separation of variables since we can write out both the exact solution in the form of an infinite series by eigenfunctions and the approximate solution replacing the infinite sums by sums of the first n terms ) , a proof based on the well-known Livshits theorem ( researching of case for published in this paper firstly ) : Theorem 1 ( Livshits ) .

In his paper M. M. Dzhrbashian wrote , that “ the question about the completeness of the systems of eigenfunctions of the operator or a finer question about whether these systems compose a basis in , has a certain interest but its solving is apparently associated with significant analytic difficulties ” .
