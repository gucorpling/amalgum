LXRA has a 100-fold higher binding affinity than LXRB for the corepressors NCOR1 and NCOR2 and deregulation of these corepressors allows prostate and bladder cancer cells to evade cancer suppressive signals of Vitamin D ( through repression of Vitamin D Receptor ( VDR ) ) and omega-3 fatty acids ( through repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPARs ) ) by impairing sensitivity to ligand .

Transcriptional activity of the LXRs , like the other members of the Nuclear Receptor ( NR ) superfamily , is not just regulated by ligand bioavailability ; chromatin environment , cross-talk and competition for response element binding with other NRs , as well as cell- and tissue-type dependent expression of cofactors are also key mediators .

Given the prognostic and therapeutic value of stratifying BCa by hormone receptor status , further delineation of the pathways that are altered between these subtypes , such as scOHC-LXR signalling , may help advance understanding about the emerging roles of cholesterol metabolism in cancer and improve outcomes for patients .

Side-chain hydroxycholesterols ( scOHCs ) are typically formed through hydroxylation of cholesterol by specialized members of the Cytochrome P450 family , which bind and activate the Liver X Receptor-alpha ( LXRA ; gene name NR1H3 ) and beta ( LXRB ; gene name NR1H2 ) transcription factors .

As well as differences in expression of LXRA and LXRB , local concentrations of the scOHCs differ considerably between tissues , and relative to each other , sometimes by as much as 1000-fold and variance can also depend on disease status .
