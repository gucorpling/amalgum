The study uses a panel dataset where each variable in Equation ( 3 ) refers to country i at time t , while D it in Equation ( 2 ) denotes socio-economic factors ( Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) as a measure of income , education level , and population density ) , PM2.5 refers to air pollution ( mean annual exposure ( micrograms per cubic meter ) ) , temp it is used as a proxy for climate change , and ε it is the error term .

The data for other variables , like temperature ( yearly average of monthly mean temperature of respective countries ) , GDP per capita ( as a proxy for national income ) , secondary school enrollment ( as a proxy for national educational level ) , and population density ( people per sq . km of land area ) are retrieved from the World Bank dataset .

The empirical model is mentioned below : ( 1 ) where M denotes the number of neonates deaths due to acute respiratory infection , CV signifies the climate variables ( application of mean temperature as a proxy for CV ) and air pollution ( PM2.5 ) , while D signifies socio-economic variables , i. e. , income , education , and population density .

According to , the fixed-effect model is a suitable specification if the analysis is focused on a given number ( N ) of units so that statistical inference is conditional on the particular set of ( N ) unities , which in our case , are 12 countries highly vulnerable to climate change ( N = 12 ) .

Thus , the static model is expressed as : ( 2 ) The study employs the panel dataset method to evaluate the effects of air pollution ( PM2.5 ) and climate change ( temperature ) on the neonate deaths due to acute respiratory infection .

On the other hand , random-effect models require the assumption of uncorrelated explanatory variables and a time-invariant unobservable component of the model , which is assumed to be random ( for example , ) .

In other words , the random effect model would require that units were selected randomly from a large number of possibilities , as is the case when the units are individuals or households .

The objective behind introducing the climate variables in quadratic form is to determine the number of neonatal deaths caused by respiratory disease patients as non-linear in climate variables or otherwise .
