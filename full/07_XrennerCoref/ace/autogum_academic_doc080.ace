Detailed studies along these lines have been recently conducted at the European , Australian , and in few cases at global scales , but the issue has not been thoroughly addressed in SSA countries . Naumann et al. calculated composite indicators that reflect different aspects of vulnerability and adaptive capacity at the Pan-African level .

A number of studies show that if no drastic actions are taken in consumption patterns , shifting diets , and reducing wastes , meeting the world â€™s food demand will require doubling food production and this will unavoidably exert extreme pressure on agricultural and natural resources .

Indicators of adaptive capacity were also grounded in sustainable livelihood theory as a set of different forms of assets to which people have access , such as financial , human , resource , or physical assets .
