I do n‚Äôt want to force him to play something he does n‚Äôt want to play , but I do want to see if I can tweak Fate to something he ‚Äôd like a bit more before giving up on getting him to play .

I ‚Äôm hoping to probe the minds of all you out there with great experience , because I know you ‚Äôll be able to point out the weak points of Fate that my Fanboy eyes ca n‚Äôt make out alone .

I do however have one friend that has only played two campaigns DM ‚Äôd by me under 5e ( that he loved ) and I ‚Äôve been trying to convince him to play Fate with the me and some others .

I consider crippling depression a major character flaw , and something like selfishness to be a minor character flaw , while someone else might consider selfishness a major character flaw and a character with crippling depression unplayable .

I was hoping to tweak Fate to fit his playstyle more , but instead I ‚Äôll try and find a system that all the players are interested in .

After looking at the rule book he is not very interested in trying it out , saying it ‚Äôs not his style and wants to play 5e .

It can be narrative oriented , but has just enough customization options that every character really feels unique and conflict has actual tension behind it .

Another bad thing about FATE is that they take a DND-amount of pages to describe their barebones rules system .

The mechanics leave a basic , generic nothing where players never have to think to solve problems .

The only concrete mechanic are Skills , which leaves practically nothing for character customization .

I love narrative tension over mechanical challenge , and adore freedom to create .

This is because FATE needs to stick to a certain type of play .

The mechanics are too barebones , and too easily exploitable or imbalancable .
