Less than six months later , critical acclaim for Will May ’s 800 page edition of The Collected Poems & Drawings of Stevie Smith proved Jenkins wrong in her belief that “ nowadays , Smith is only really remembered for her 1957 poem ‘ Not Waving But Drowning ’ ” ; though David Orr ’s description of her , in his review in The New York Times , as “ the English poet so odd that even other poets , most of whom are fairly odd themselves , have never been sure what to do with her ” suggests that she may still not have found her place in the canon .

It is all too often supposed that Smith condensed her own autobiography into the twelve short lines of Not Waving but Drowning ,7 but although the quiet desperation of little lives is certainly one of her poetic subjects , she never saw herself as among those doomed to the unenviable fate of having “ no fate at all”.8

Stevie Smith in performance was a mime artist in words , her sad , expressive eyes and the impeccably unexpected timing of her deadpan delivery reducing audiences to helpless laughter as she felt her way around the bars of the imagined cages , which , one way or another , imprison us all .
