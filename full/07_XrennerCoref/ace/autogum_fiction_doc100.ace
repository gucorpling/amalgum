‘ Papa , ’ she said on one occasion to the fine , red-faced , handsome man of forty , who , puffing and fizzing like a bursting bottle , lay on the bed wrapped in a dressing-gown , and every now and then enunciating , in spite of himself , about one letter of some word or words that were almost oaths ; ‘ papa , will you not come downstairs this evening ? ’ She spoke distinctly : he was rather deaf .

Elfride had as her own the thoughtfulness which appears in the face of the Madonna della Sedia , without its rapture : the warmth and spirit of the type of woman ’s feature most common to the beauties -- mortal and immortal -- of Rubens , without their insistent fleshiness .
