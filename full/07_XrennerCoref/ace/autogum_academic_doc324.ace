In the east – west direction , the solution area is characterized by westward movement and the maximum displacement can is −0.65 m. In the north – south direction , there is no horizontal displacement toward the north and the maximum deformation is −0.73 m. Therefore , the horizontal displacement is toward southwest , which suggests that the region with co-seismic deformation mainly concentrates in the northeast part of the seismogenic fault .

In this study , we mapped the complete 3D co-seismic surface of the earthquake by integrating the ascending ( track 72 ) and descending orbits ( track 6 ) LOS measurements derived from D-InSAR and the along-track measurements derived from offset-tracking (

The ground deformation field , limited to the single direction ( LOS ) , can be decomposed into three mutually perpendicular components ( east – west , north – south , and up – down ) .

The maximum uplift is −0.81 m and the maximum subsidence is −0.28 m. The huge value difference between the uplift and the subsidence lobes on the two sides of the fault confirms the thrust movement .

Third , the source mechanism of different organization ( Table 1 ) indicate that this earthquake had a strike-slip movement close to the north – south direction accompanied by large deformations .

Therefore , this earthquake might be caused by a blind thrust fault close to north – south with the deformation field concentrating on the northwest side of the fault .

First , most current SAR satellites fly in near-polar orbits , so the acquired SAR data is not quite sensitive to the north – south deformation .

Then , the robust azimuth offset of the surface deformation can be got by subtracting the components of the topographic relief and orbit trend separation .

Theoretically , we can obtain the three-dimensional deformation field utilizing multiple InSAR measurement results acquired by different SAR satellites .
