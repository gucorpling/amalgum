Given that sodium hypochlorite ( NaOCl ) and EDTA are principal components of the management of endodontic infections , we hypothesised that root canal treatment failure involving C. albicans may be driven by biofilm heterogeneity resulting in an enhanced ability to withstand treatment and regrow within root canals .

The route of fungal invasion to the root canals is likely to be through cracks or via leaking restoration , though the diameter of hyphae , which is 1.9 – 2.6 µm , cannot exclude the possibility of dentinal tubules invasion especially in deep caries lesions .

EDTA acts mainly as an adjunct irrigant to remove smear layer , though an alternative effect is the inhibition of filamentation through chelation of necessary divalent cations in the pathogenic yeast C. albicans , a structural element strongly associated with robust biofilm formation .

Dental pulp is generally a sterile tissue containing nerves and vascular tissues that are connected to the surrounding periradicular tissues , though recent studies appear to suggest the presence of bacterial DNA in the pulp of pristine healthy teeth .

RCT aims to : ( 1 ) eliminate microorganisms from the root canal system to a level that promotes the healing of periradicular tissues , and ( 2 ) provide a three-dimensional hermetic seal to prevent reinfection .

Therefore , the use of chemical irrigating solutions to maximise root canal debridement and removal of the smear layer is vital for successful RCT , which includes ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , though not universally .

Its capacity to morphologically transition from yeast to hyphal cells enables it to react dynamically , both in evasion of host immunity and in its ability to readily form biofilm structures that impact increased antifungal resistance .

Breach to these tissues , as a result of dental caries , tooth fractures or cracks , can expose the dentin and provide routes for oral microbiota to ingress towards the pulp .
