And when I went through in my mind the different courses of action that could get us there I kept coming back to the referendum and I did not see another way that we could bring final closure and resolution to this issue , this very sensitive and difficult issue , without passing it to the people for an up or down vote .

Well if public opinion has truly changed then it was in their interest to pass this through the legislature and send it to the people themselves for an up or down vote were the referendum would be defeated and the issue would forever be gone and dealt with .

Shipman : With the polls in Indiana showing a change in public opinion over the past several years that is more favorable to the acceptance of same-sex marriage , do you think it 's going to be harder to support traditional marriage in the future ?

I think if the polling data is accurate , as you expressed it , then the folks that were the opponents of HJR-3 — specifically the folks that were in leadership within Freedom Indiana — were working against their own self-interest .

Because if they would have allowed the vote and public opinion had changed , then they probably would have voted the referendum down and that would have been the debate once and for all .

And if public opinion has changed , then those that support same-sex marriage worked against their own self-interest by denying the people the right to vote on this in November of 2014 .

But having sat in the legislature now for eight years , I think there 's going to be pressure to bring this back this next session — some sort of version .

But to me the ultimate issue was bringing this whole thing to closure and by denying people the right to vote this November we did not bring this to closure .

And for me again , the only way that I could see us bringing this to final closure was to have the referendum by the public .

Because of the path that we chose , there is going to be pressure to bring this back next year and possibly years beyond that .

Shipman : Since the amendment would have had a long lasting consequences on Hoosiers , did n't the process work this time ?

Obviously you know about my family , and there is a difference of opinion just with me and brother on this issue .

2,3 person|5,6 person|5,7 person|11,23 abstract|17,18 person|19,20 person|21,23 abstract

So the state of Indiana is going to be forced to deal with this issue year in and year out .

To me it did n't make any sense to delay the final resolution of this once and for all .

They may put the civil union ban back in it , which then puts it on another two years .
