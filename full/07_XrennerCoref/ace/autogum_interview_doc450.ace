But if look at the terrorist threat , which I think right now is perhaps the greatest imminent threat that we have , the securing of a nuclear device or another weapon of mass destruction , and its detonation in a large population center ,

No , I do n’t think the United States should eliminate our nuclear arsenal because I think that manifests a deterrent against others who might move aggressively against the United States at some point , or might move aggressively against our allies .

I think there is a deterrent factor to having a nuclear weapons capability for the United States , which I would describe as a responsible nuclear state .

So you have a regime that includes the nuclear suppliers group , you have several international constructs to keep those systems from getting into the wrong hands .

No , they are producing the powder , the explosive material that is used in a nuclear device , which is the most difficult part to obtain .

So technology control is a very important aspect of securing and preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons capability by a terrorist group or a terrorist state .

There are several species of threats , but I would say in terms of the war against terrorist —
