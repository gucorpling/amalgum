On the other hand , despite the professionalisms working in the digital domain are rapidly growing and greatly specializing their skills , digital creators working for museums are not always aware about the design of an appropriate user experience for the museum ’s communication needs , aiming at a harmonious use of technology with respect to the contents , visit paths and target .

hybridization of media , bringing together different paradigms and languages of “ representation ” ( virtual reality , theater , cinema , sound and light design , mixed and augmented reality , holography , game ) , in order to involve and guide the visitor through a vivid and incisive narrative cultural experience .

Narration is a central theme because it implies a series of choices that are not only creative and technological but also “ ethical ” and cultural , inherent the respect of the correctness and of the scientific plausibility of contents , while using agile and multiform tools such as the digital ones .

Several virtual museums , multimedia and virtual reality projects has been conceived and realized by the author , together with her research group , experimenting new narrative forms and interaction paradigms , and they have been addressed to diverse audiences of real museums and cultural sites , in Italy and in Europe .

The purpose this work aims at is to propose best practices and guidelines on “ experience design ” for museums , focusing on different typologies of experiences , connected to different technologies , interactive or not , immersive or not , and different “ scenarios ” of use .

To tell a story , in fact , means to formulate a hypothesis which implies the creation of a possible “ reconstruction ” , related to both the physical aspect of the cultural heritage and its contexts , the human activities , behaviors , thoughts , values .

Today more and more museums are embracing the digital challenge , but there is not yet a real and shared awareness of how to make virtual and real contents interact and how to design the best experience for the public , aiming at cultural transmission .

It is addressed to those working on the experience design of museum visitors , curators and creative , as a survey of existing approaches and lessons learnt for each one , that can lead to an advancement in this filed .

Despite the great contribution that multimedia , virtual reality and mixed reality can offer to the museum sector , many curators still seem rather reluctant to benefit from the full potential of these languages , especially in permanent outfitting .

The continuous outcomes are extremely useful to have a better understanding of the public , of the benefits and the limits of the proposed solutions , and therefore they constantly help to increase awareness and to improve our research .

Usually museum curators prefer to be “ neutral ” regarding the artifacts , and they avoid to tell or to suggest the visitors anything else beyond the pure evidence in the form of captions or descriptions .

On this base some priority objectives of the “ experience design ” intended for the museum ’s public are here defined and proposed , and they constitute the “ leitmotiv ” of this paper :

They are directly connected to the emotional intelligence of humans and are decisive in encouraging a contact between our sensitivity and the profound essence of the cultural heritage .

From many years this experience has being accompanied and supported by user experience evaluations on thousands of visitors , to test the effective impact of such projects .

Embodiment , emotional involvement , multisensory solicitations are essential elements in the creative and intuitive processes of human nature and in the creation of an experience .

They often capture those aspects that are more compatible with the traditional didactic approach , remaining suspicious especially towards the emotional components of narration .
