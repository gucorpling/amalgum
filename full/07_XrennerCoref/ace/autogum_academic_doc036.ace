Inulin is a linear fructo-oligosaccharide composed of fructosyl units ( β ( 2→1 ) linkage ) and usually contains one terminal glucose moiety per molecule . β-linkage makes inulin resistant to hydrolysis by human gastrointestinal enzymes and it is classified as colonic delivery biopolymer .

The use of synthetic antioxidants , such as butylated hydroxytoluene , butylated hydroxyanisole , or n-propyl gallate to delay lipid oxidation is currently questioned due to their possible harmful effects on human health , and the use of natural antioxidants is of growing interest .

The objective of this research was to design flavonoids ( epicatechin and quercetin ) microparticles with inulin as encapsulating agent and to evaluate the influence of the physical state of spray-dried flavonoid microparticles ( semi-crystalline/amorphous ) on the oxidative stability of lipid systems .

These microparticles were able to release the encapsulated flavonoids and improve the oxidative stability of methyl linoleate and vegetable oils , which was attributed to the formation of channels inside the microparticles , favoring the diffusion of flavonoids .

When the flavonoid-inulin microparticles are incorporated into a lipid system , the physical state of these microparticles ( semi-crystalline/amorphous ) may influence the oxidative stability of the system , but this still has not been addressed .

However , in the case of inulin , process variables of spray-drying such as feed temperature and inlet air temperature have been reported to influence both the morphology and the degree of crystallinity of the microparticles .
