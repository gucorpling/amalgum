In the ANP method , the problem is structured as a network , and its elements are evaluated through a pairwise comparisons approach to measure their weights in the model , which , after some matrix calculations , allows ranking of the alternatives considered in the problem .

City Council holds an indirect interest in the problem since it is concerned with the general well being of the local population ; hence , it could decide to provide financial support for construction of a freight lorry parking and enact policies to discourage inappropriate parking .

Since in the lorry parking location problem the elements influencing the decision-making process turn out to be highly interconnected , the Analytic Network Process ( ANP ) permits to model the problem in a more complete way by controlling and estimating all the element interconnections .

Because local businesses are the main factor in the generation of HGV flow , through their involvement it is possible to obtain information about the HGV flow that would otherwise be difficult to obtain , such as the number of daily deliveries in the area .

To ensure a positive revenue stream , a freight lorry parking needs to be attractive to drivers , which means it should offer security for their goods and access to amenities while avoiding costly HGV deviations from their original routes .

Local residents are directly affected by inappropriate HGV parking , as highlighted in Section 2 , and their main interest is to maximise the distance between their homes and HGV traffic and hence the freight lorry parking .

The main task here is to identify the relationships between different classes of stakeholders and the issues they care about most , as these will constitute the basic elements in developing our Spatial Decision Support System .

To this aim , we first outline the main phases of the ANP ( RO.2 ) and then construct the ANP dependency network model based on the outcomes of the stakeholder analysis ( RO.3-RO.4 ) .

The characteristics of this problem cannot in fact be hierarchically represented , as it involves logical interconnections between elements in a complicated dependency structure that allows elements on different levels to influence each other .

Local residents are the primary source of information on inappropriate parking through their reporting of nuisances to local authorities , and these complaints are the spur for political action to tackle the problem .

The stakeholders are those individuals or organisations that have personal interest and influence in the decision process because they have goals directly or indirectly affected by the problem and its possible resolution .

Although we first also considered using the Analytic Hierarchy Process ( AHP ) method , we soon realised that the complexity of the problem rendered this method unsuitable .

In the process of making a decision on a public matter , the starting point for the theoretical model should be the various stakeholders and their interests .

The ANP is a generalisation of AHP , and is more appropriate for dealing with real decision-making processes with complex dependency structures between the considered elements .

Following such analyses , and consistently with research objective R0.2 , we explore the possible use of ANP as a suitable model component for our SDSS .

That is possible because ANP is able to generalise the AHP approach by allowing the presence of any type of possible mutual influences among the elements .

As expected in a real problem scenario , we can see that there are multiple stakeholders with different and conflicting interests .

Moreover , a purely hierarchical model cannot encompass the case of alternatives potentially influencing the weights associated to the criteria .
