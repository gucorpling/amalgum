Extra amenities offered to premium economy passengers vary widely from airline to airline , ranging from nothing more than the extra legroom in United Airlines or American Airlines , to lounge access at the departure airport either for a fee as is the case of Air France or Lufthansa , or as part of the ticket price as is case of All Nippon Airways or Japan Airlines .

A standard amenity in modern first class is a lie-flat seat , which lies completely flat ( 180 degrees ) and is increasingly offered in suite or cradle configurations where you have a curtain or other privacy divider to separate you from other passengers , and a few airlines even offer these in " double " configurations for two people .

The first class experience begins before you board the plane : some airlines like Thai throw in limousine transfers to and from the airport , where you can expect to have your bags carried by a porter , be checked in at a private first-class check-in area and enjoy your first glass of sparkling wine at a first-class lounge .

True flat bed seats are rare and expensive , with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic 's Upper Class pioneering the concept , but lie-flat seats , angled seats like those found in Air France 's business class cabin , which recline to an angle of perhaps 170 °and are vertically tilted to squeeze in better , are increasingly common .

Once on board — and you 're usually boarded first — seat pitch in business remains good by any measure : while 91 cm ( 36 in ) is considered unusually generous in economy , few long-haul business seats are under 100 cm ( 40 in ) and 130-153 cm ( 50-60 in ) is considered standard .
