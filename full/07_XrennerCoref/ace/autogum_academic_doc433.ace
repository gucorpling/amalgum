Contaminants found in TWW include pathogenic microorganisms ( concentrations in the range of 10−1-105 [ cfu l−1 ) , nutrients ( nitrates and phosphates , 100-102 [ mg l−1 ] ) , heavy metals ( 10−1-102 [ µg l−1 ] ) and endocrine disruptors ( 10−2-102 [ µg l−1 ] ) .

Via “ following the water ” , this study aims to determine whether TWW makes up a significant flow component for surface water bodies in the Netherlands and provide a first estimate of the extent to which de facto wastewater reuse is occurring in agricultural irrigation .

As such , the distribution of TWW within the surface water network of the Netherlands can be characterised ( without the need for direct measurements ) and subsequently related to agricultural extractions , hence bridging the knowledge gap between TWW emissions and societal water uses .

Indeed , literature points to the direct reuse of TWW becoming a more common trend in the future , both internationally and in the EU , if appropriate regulations can be devised and the societal “ yuck ” factor can be overcome .

Existing studies have shown that TWW exerts a significant impact on many surface water bodies in terms of water quality , but have failed to address the contribution of wastewater to the discharge of surface water bodies .

De facto ( or indirect ) wastewater reuse is the practice of extracting from a surface water body which is heavily influenced by discharge from a wastewater stream ( see Appendix A ) for anthropogenic use .

In the Netherlands , it is likely that wastewater is an important flow component in surface water bodies owing to high population densities and an extensive network of wastewater treatment plants ( WWTPs ) .

This contributes to initiating discussions regarding appropriate regulations for de facto reuse and how the practice can be integrated within the circular economy to increase the responsible reuse of water sources .

This is highly dependent on subsurface characteristics and hydrological conditions , but is indicated by studies which find a range of TWW-related pharmaceuticals and personal care products in groundwater samples .

This study opts for a new approach to this problem : repurposing a national scale water quality model and labelling TWW as a tracer in and of itself .

In this form , TWW can constitute a freshwater resource for agriculture ( irrigation ) , industry ( cooling purposes ) and public services ( drinking water ) .

The presence of these in surface water bodies may lead to problems meeting WFD chemical water quality targets , negative impacts on ecology and reduced societal functions .

Characterising this problem has been ( to date ) confounded by difficulties in measuring and tracing the presence of TWW in a dynamic hydrological system .
