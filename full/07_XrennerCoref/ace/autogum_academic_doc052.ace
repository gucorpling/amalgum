The advantage of the simple methods lies in the easiness of use , whereas the complex methods , such as pairwise comparison , offer a coefficient indicating the consistency of the decision-maker â€™s choices .

MIF is a graphical weight assignment method where linkages between GIS datasets are drawn , and the weights are calculated based on the number and the importance of linkages between the criteria .
