But I think that ’s more a revelation of their own natures , meaning if they did n't have some external force making them being nice to people , they would be bastards ! We Satanists , because we are relaxed , we love our lives , we love people who enrich our lives and things that are around us that we enjoy , we can be really giving .

The whole point of Satanism is again to choose your values , and if you become somebody that really feels you want to work for hospitals for free — a number of our members work for animal organizations because we generally cherish animals and think they are far less polluted than people with values that are anti- their nature .

So anyone who is going to go out and assault undeserving people , is someone we would deem a criminal and have them locked up or dealt with in whatever way seems most appropriate , whether it ’s therapy , whether it ’s drugs , or if they ca n't control themselves , execution .

Because our values come from the self , people who try to tell themselves that they must be selfless , they ca n't really understand why you would be giving if you ’re a selfish person .
