What counts as a minor or major infringement often depends on the game situation , eg did it thwart a promising attack , was it deliberate or repeated offending , was it physically dangerous ? Common offences usually deemed minor are forward passes , knock-on ( i. e. ball forward from hand to ground ) , and tackled player not releasing the ball . It 's usually a penalty for collapsing a scrum or being offside , ie competing for the ball from in front of it .
