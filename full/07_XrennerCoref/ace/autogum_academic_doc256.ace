For example , the “ National Travel Survey ” ( NTS ) in the UK , the “ National Household Travel Survey ” ( NHTS ) in the US , and the “ Mobility in Germany ” survey have been conducted , and many studies using the data from these surveys have been carried out .

The Road Traffic Census ( RTC ) is a traffic survey which covers the whole of Japan and includes investigations , such as origin-destination ( OD ) flows , using questionnaires about daily travel , road state investigating surveys , the traffic census , and travel speed investigations .

The studies , which take into account the relationships between urban structure and traffic flow , examined them from the point of view of urban transport geography ; however , quantitative studies about the estimation of old traffic flows have also not been addressed in this field .

Many studies have been carried out using such data . Sekimoto et al. ( 2011 ) calculated highly detailed people flows for every 1 minute from PT survey data , and some secondary studies have been carried out based on this flow data .

Since the first OD survey in 1958 , it has been conducted approximately every 5 years . Kohira et al. ( 2014 ) and Fujita et al. ( 2016 ) examined traffic flows based on the results of these OD surveys .

However , these movements have been studied from the perspective of urban planning and the development of the transportation infrastructure , and people and traffic flows in the past have not been considered in these studies .

In these surveys , many items , including personal properties , travel objects , travel times , type of mobility , and so on , have been investigated to understand the detailed behavior of people .

For example , phone call data , smartcard use , and other data like global positioning system ( GPS ) log data and social networking service data have been used for human mobility studies .

In recent years , surveys of personal travel behavior have been carried out around the world , and these surveys have been used for understanding the characteristics of people flow and for urban planning .

The first extensive PT survey was done in 1967 in the urban areas of Hiroshima City , and PT surveys have been conducted for more than 30 years in the urban areas of Japan .

However , these surveys have been conducted mostly after World War II , when these information technologies became available , and it is impossible to acquire people and traffic flows for the modern era .
