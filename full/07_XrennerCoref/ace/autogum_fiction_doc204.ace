The great bay , as blue and tranquil as a high mountain lake , as silent as if the planet still slept after the agonies of labor , looked to be broken by a number of promontories , rising from their points far out in the water to the high back of the land ; but as the Juno pursued her slanting way down the channel Rezanov saw that the most imposing of these was but the end of a large island , and that scattered near were other islands , masses of rock like the castellated heights that rise abruptly from the plains of Italy and Spain ; far away , narrow straits , with a glittering expanse beyond ; while bounding the whole eastern rim of this splendid sheet of water was a chain of violet hills , with the pale green mist of new grass here and there , and purple hollows that might mean groves of trees crouching low against the cold winds of summer ; in the soft pale blue haze above and beyond , the lofty volcanic peak of a mountain range .

As the little ship that had three times raced with death sailed past the gray headlands and into the straits of San Francisco on that brilliant April morning of 1806 , Rezanov forgot the bitter humiliations , the mental and physical torments , the deprivations and dangers of the past three years ; forgot those harrowing months in the harbor of Nagasaki when the Russian bear had caged his tail in the presence of eyes aslant ; his dismay at Kamchatka when he had been forced to send home another to vindicate his failure , and to remain in the Tsar 's incontiguous and barbarous northeastern possessions as representative of his Imperial Majesty , and plenipotentiary of the Company his own genius had created ; forgot the year of loneliness and hardship and peril in whose jaws the bravest was impotent ; forgot even his pitiable crew , diseased when he left Sitka , that had filled the Juno with their groans and laments ; and the bells of youth , long still , rang in his soul once more .

Not a human being , not a boat , not even a herd of cattle was to be seen , and Rezanov , for a moment forgetting to exult in the length of Russia 's arm , yielded himself to the subtle influence abroad in the air , and felt that he could dream as he had dreamed in a youth when the courts of Europe to the boy were as fabulous as El Dorado in the immensity of ancestral seclusions .

There was not a tree ; the mountains , the promontories , the hills far down on the right beyond the sand dunes , looked like stupendous waves of lava that had cooled into every gracious line and fold within the art of relenting Nature ; granted ages after , a light coat of verdure to clothe the terrible mystery of birth .

Dr. Langsdorff , surgeon and naturalist , had accompanied the Embassy to Japan , and although Rezanov had never found any man more of a bore and would willingly have seen the last of him at Kamchatka , a skilful dispenser of drugs and mender of bones was necessary in his hazardous voyages , and he retained him in his suite .

Langsdorff returned his polite tolerance with all the hidden resources of his spleen ; but his curiosity and scientific enthusiasm would have sustained him through greater trials than the exactions of an autocrat , whom at least he had never ceased to respect in the most trying moments at Nagasaki .

On his immediate right as he sailed down the straits toward the narrow entrance to be known as the Golden Gate , there was little to interest save the surf and the masses of outlying rocks where the seals leapt and barked ; the shore beyond was sandy and low .
