Although I am 19 , I still have to tell my parents when I 'm going out and follow a 9 pm curfew , which means I cannot do many of the fun things that a lot of my peers are doing such as sleeping over and getting wasted or hanging around a bar with friends late at night .

A few tricks that I think helped : 1 ) Tell them that it 's hard to answer the phone , like if you 're in movie , in class , or a loud restaurant , but you can check in with them via text .

Like wow , considering how I do go out a decent amount and am still alive , I would think they would eventually stop calling me so frequently and understand that I can think for myself , but I guess not .

Gain their trust by actually texting when they do n't expect it . 2 ) Sell everything that you do as being related to academics or work .
