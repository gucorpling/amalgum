From all three editions , only 6 samples are known to have survived ( e. g. the ones held by SUB ( Göttingen ) , Germanisches Nationalmuseum ( Nuremberg ) , Bibliothèque Nationale ( Paris ) , British Library ( London ) ) , but Etzlaub 's data were widely used during the first half of the 16th century , among others by Martin Waldseemüller and Sebastian Munster .
