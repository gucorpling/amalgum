Conversely , other studies have demonstrated that larger females are more efficient disease vectors . Xue et al. found that larger A. aegypti females live longer and are more likely to seek multiple blood feedings than smaller females , which increased the likelihood that they could become infected with a virus and transmit it to a host within their lifetime . Juliano et al. used both laboratory experiments and field-collected female Ae . aegypti to demonstrate that intraspecific competition in larval habitats produced smaller females that had reduced survival and were less likely to be infected with dengue .

If larger C. pipiens females are more effective disease vectors , ephemeral pool systems with S. arundinaceus clippings would produce the most competent disease-transmitting mosquitoes , while pools with J. effusus detritus with would produce the least competent disease vectors . Changes in vegetation communities surrounding ephemeral pools could then alter the risk of disease transmission from mosquitoes based on which plant species were displaced .

In surveys of roadside stormwater ditches , mean C. pipiens densities did not differ among habitats that varied in litter species , but female C. pipiens were larger from ditches with S. arundinaceus and smaller with J. effusus compared to other plant species ( P. australis and T. latifolia ) .

This allowed us to calculate more accurate λ′ estimates than past studies ( e. g. , ) , which have used a function based on a relationship for four females from an autogenous form of C. pipiens that almost entirely uses subterranean environments , C. pipiens f. molestus .

In a laboratory microcosm experiment , C. pipiens per capita rate of population change ( λ′ ) was unaffected when larvae were provisioned with different detritus species , yet larger adults emerged from microcosms with S. arundinaceus and smaller adults from microcosms with J. effusus .

Therefore , we recommend future studies that require size-fecundity relationship for above-ground C. pipiens to refer to the function in this study until an even more robust size-fecundity relationship from a greater number of females over a wider range of wing lengths is calulcated .

Since egg rafts from autogenous mosquito species ’ tend to have fewer eggs than those of anautogenous species , using a size-fecundity relationship based on a small number of C. pipiens f. molestus is undesirable for above ground C. pipiens .

The results of this study suggest that the invasion of S. arundinaceus in stormwater ditches or the displacement of J. effusus by P. australis invasion may alter disease transmission of C. pipiens by producing larger females .

For example , if P. australis , which produces intermediate-sized females , displaced J. effusus the disease risk in the area could increase , while if P. australis displaced S. arundinaceus the risk could decrease .

For adults of numerous mosquito species , larger size is related to survival , and adult survival has been shown to be a critical life-history parameter for pathogen transmission in mathematical models and field studies .

Although mosquito size is a consistent factor explaining variability in vector competence , there are conflicting data in the literature as to whether smaller or larger female mosquitoes are more competent disease vectors .

Invasive plants that alter the vegetation around ephemeral ground pools may facilitate or resist the spread of the exotic vector mosquito C. pipiens by altering allochthonous detritus inputs in those pools .

The co-occurrence of exotic species is becoming more common with the increasing spread of organisms worldwide , and a better understanding of their interactions is important to manage biological invasions .

Alternatively , if larger C. pipiens females are less efficient vectors , scenarios conducive to the establishment of S. arundinaceus would result in a lower risk of disease transmission .
