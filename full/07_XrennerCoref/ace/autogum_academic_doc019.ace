These effects , combined with the electrostatic repulsion caused by the large number of negative charges on the particle surfaces , help maintain the stability of fine kaolinites in coal slurries , which makes it difficult for the kaolinite to aggregate and settle , and thus , seriously affects the sedimentation and clarification of coal-water slurries .

Also using DFT methods , Chen et al. simulated the adsorption of amine/ammonium cations on kaolinite ( 001 ) and ( 001 ) surfaces , and found that adsorption was the joint result of electrostatic attraction and the formation of hydrogen bonds , with the former as the major driving force .

In the present study , scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometry ( SEM-EDS ) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) analyses were performed to determine the major elemental constituents of the carbon impurities and the structure and relative contents of the C and O elements .

Subsequently , two typical structural models were constructed for the carbon impurities , and DFT was applied to simulate the adsorption mechanism of each unit on the kaolinite ( 001 ) and ( 001 ) surfaces so as to determine the adsorption configuration .

Through experiments and theoretical calculations , Cui et al. found that an important premise for the separation of fine kaolinite is to regulate the structural properties of its interface .

The main method of regulation is to add surfactants , such as cationic amine salts or quaternary ammonium salts , which regulate the hydrophobicity of the kaolinite surfaces .

To more deeply understand the functional mechanism , the interactions of the reagent at the kaolinite interface must be explored from a microscopic viewpoint at the molecular/atomic level .
