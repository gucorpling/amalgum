note : vowel combinations/diphthongs in Irish ( e. g. ' G aei lge , ' s ea cht ai n ) are slightly rounded and pronounced in the back of the mouth without using the lips at all . ( e. g. ' Gaeilge ' should not , strictly speaking , be pronounced with a w after the g. ) Thus , correct pronunciation can be obtained only from imitating spoken Irish , but the pronunciation guide given here is an adequate enough approximation in that by using it , you will be perfectly understood by any Irish speaker .
