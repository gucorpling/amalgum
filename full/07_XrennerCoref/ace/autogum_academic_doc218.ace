Considering the intrinsic reversibility of the basic mechanical laws it was argued by Maxwell that a being “ whose faculties are so sharpened that it can follow the course of individual molecules ” should be able to operate a trap door , inserted into a vessel homogeneously filled with gas , to produce either temperature or pressure differences inside the gas that would allow mechanical work to be extracted from a single macroscopic heat reservoir , maintained at a finite temperature .

It was argued that this latter step of erasure is unavoidable to arrive at a fully cyclic process of information gain and work extraction and that therefore the energy cost of information erasure is a more inescapable necessity than the energy cost of measurement and information gain .

Following discussions of Maxwell ’s demon ’s paradox , it can be observed that some authors express discomfort with the idea of thermodynamic information as the processes of gaining , receiving and maintaining information through measurement either explicitly or implicitly assume the involvement of intelligent beings .

It is argued that such an involvement introduces an element of subjectivity into the definition of entropy , which is unacceptable if entropy is to be considered as an element of physical reality that exists independent of the existence of human beings and of human observation .

Considering the motion of a single atom , enclosed in a finite volume and in contact with a heat reservoir of temperature , Szilard showed that knowledge about the location of the atom can be used to extract mechanical work from a single-molecule gas .

A further important step in the analysis of Maxwell ’s demon paradox was the realization that the information gained in a physical measurement is burdened with an energy cost that overwhelms the energy gained in operating a Maxwell ’s demon device .

Even later it was argued that operating a Maxwell ’s demon device entails storage of the information intermittently obtained , and that the energy cost of information ultimately needs to be paid when this information is erased again .

The other important achievement was that Szilard ’s analysis established a connection between the physical concepts of entropy and abstract information , showing that 1 bit of abstract information corresponds to units of entropy .

This tendency was interpreted early on as arising from the statistics of motion of large numbers of particles rather than from any irreversibility in the underlying laws of motion of the individual molecules themselves .

Brillouin and Landauer both agree in that ultimately an energy of at least needs to be expended to gain one bit of information and to ultimately conserve the validity of the second law .

This example showed that work extraction from a thermal reservoir is not for free but that it has to be paid for in terms of a new “ currency ” , called information .

Brillouin ’s initial analysis , which claimed that this energy cost is associated with the measurement process itself was later challenged by arguments that reversible measurements might in principle be conceivable .

According to Boltzmann , entropy is related to the number of microscopic states of motion which are consistent with the limited macroscopic knowledge about the molecular system : ( 2 )

In this context a change in entropy was defined as the amount of heat , , reversibly exchanged between two macroscopic bodies maintained at an absolute temperature : ( 1 )

Such a gain in energy , clearly , would be in sharp contrast with the postulate imposed by the second law of thermodynamics and thus create a paradox .
