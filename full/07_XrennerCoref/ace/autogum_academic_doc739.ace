There are few attempts to apply humanist analyses of aesthetics and visual culture to scientific representations of climate and climate data.5 Yet , as evidenced by the climate spirals and , to a degree , the hockey stick graphs that precede it , data visualization is a rich site of aesthetic and affective responses — responses that can best be evaluated through tools of formal analysis and reception germane to the arts .

The role of aesthetics in climate communication has been largely confined to the field of ecocriticism and related studies of global warming in art , literature , and film — in short , objects of study that are understood to be interpretive representations of climate within a predominantly humanist tradition ( Siperstein et al. 2016 ; Svoboda 2016 ; Davis and Turpin 2015 ) .

Recent efforts by Antti Lipponen , Kevin Pluck , Robert Rohde , Neil Kaye , and John Nelson are examples of this trend , including gif , video , and scrolling animations that dramatize the speed and size of global temperature anomalies , sea level rise , and fossil fuel consumption on sites including Twitter , Reddit , Flickr , and YouTube .

This is in large part because of the paradox of scale that endures within the political , scientific , and aesthetic problems of climate : Global warming requires inherently trans-scalar modes of engagement , calling our attention simultaneously towards each other and far beyond the scope of individual or everyday experiences .

Among the activists and advocates delivering testimony in support of a declaration of climate emergency was a small group holding aloft a scarf , knitted to display stripes of rising temperatures across scales greater than a human lifetime .
