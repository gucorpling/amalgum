Dalial Freitak , who is also on this paper is currently running tests with Ph.D. student Siiri Fuchs ( who is also on the paper ) with other substances to see if any have the same effect as H2O2 [ hydrogen peroxide ] .

Furthermore we 're working on social parasitism in wood-ants ( ants have lots of animals exploiting the nest for shelter and resources , which all somehow have to get in to the fortress without getting killed ) .

For example , once we find the source of the medicine in nature ... would species without access to this source also have evolved the same behaviour in the lab ?

So basically it seems like they collect it in order to keep diseases out of the nest , so they stop the disease before it can actually infect them .

I also started collaborating with Prof. Michael Poulsen from the University of Copenhagen on immunity in fungus-growing termites , as well as their chemical recognition abilities .

So as an answer to the question , I would find it unlikely that such a behaviour would evolve , but it 's not known yet .

I still have some questions left unanswered from my Ph.D. work related to how ants recognize who is a friend and who is n't .

They collect this even if not infected , and when you infect them , they do n't collect more of the resin than normal .

Ants generally avoided the peroxide if they were healthy , but in some circumstances might they try to build resistance against infection in advance ?

There might be many sources of medicine ( recent evidence suggests that tobacco plays a similar role for bumble bees ) .

Once the behaviour has been well described in this species of ant , I might do a comparison with other species .
