Drawing herself up , as though she plumed herself greatly upon not resorting to these lures to catch sitters , Miss La Creevy applied herself , more intently , to her task : only raising her head occasionally , to look with unspeakable satisfaction at some touch she had just put in : and now and then giving Miss Nickleby to understand what particular feature she was at work upon , at the moment ; ‘ not , ’ she expressly observed , ‘ that you should make it up for painting , my dear , but because it ’s our custom sometimes to tell sitters what part we are upon , in order that if there ’s any particular expression they want introduced , they may throw it in , at the time , you know . ’

On the second morning after the departure of Nicholas for Yorkshire , Kate Nickleby sat in a very faded chair raised upon a very dusty throne in Miss La Creevy ’s room , giving that lady a sitting for the portrait upon which she was engaged ; and towards the full perfection of which , Miss La Creevy had had the street-door case brought upstairs , in order that she might be the better able to infuse into the counterfeit countenance of Miss Nickleby , a bright salmon flesh-tint which she had originally hit upon while executing the miniature of a young officer therein contained , and which bright salmon flesh-tint was considered , by Miss La Creevy ’s chief friends and patrons , to be quite a novelty in art : as indeed it was .

In fact , ’ said Miss La Creevy , sinking her voice to a confidential whisper , ‘ there are only two styles of portrait painting ; the serious and the smirk ; and we always use the serious for professional people ( except actors sometimes ) , and the smirk for private ladies and gentlemen who do n’t care so much about looking clever . ’

All those beautiful shiny portraits of gentlemen in black velvet waistcoats , with their fists doubled up on round tables , or marble slabs , are serious , you know ; and all the ladies who are playing with little parasols , or little dogs , or little children -- it ’s the same rule in art , only varying the objects -- are smirking .

Sometimes they say , “ Oh , how very serious you have made me look , Miss La Creevy ! ” and at others , “ La , Miss La Creevy , how very smirking ! ” when the very essence of a good portrait is , that it must be either serious or smirking , or it ’s no portrait at all . ’

‘ They are beyond anything you can form the faintest conception of , ’ replied Miss La Creevy . ‘ What with bringing out eyes with all one ’s power , and keeping down noses with all one ’s force , and adding to heads , and taking away teeth altogether , you have no idea of the trouble one little miniature is . ’
