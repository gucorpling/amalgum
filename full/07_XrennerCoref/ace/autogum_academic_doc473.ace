A confusing aspect of many SAR analyses is that the ‘ fragile event ’ can occur , when even small structural changes ( colloquially termed ‘ magic methyl ’ ) can result in a boost of potency for the target , or in a more detrimental manner , can completely destroy biological response — a phenomenon known as activity ‘ hotspot ’ or activity ‘ cliff ’ in structure-activity landscape .

Obviously , a crucial question that confronts drug ‘ hunters ’ is , which properties or features should be employed in the receptor-dependent ( RD ) methods that rely on the principle of complementarity or in the receptor-independent ( RI ) ones that are mainly based on the principle of similarity ?

Chemically , gently sloped hills pinpoint areas where gradual structural variations are accompanied by moderate changes in activity , whereas in flat SAR landscapes , the biological data varies little over the wide modifications in the compound structure — further substitutions are not likely to result in more potent molecules .

In other words , finding the optimal balance between ADMET-related properties and desired drug potency ( ‘ sweet spot ’ ) can be rationalized graphically by extension of the 2D similarity-based projection with activity data in the form of a ‘ biological response surface ’ or SAR landscapes .

Hence , many attempts have been undertaken in order to implement some rough guidelines , sometimes called ‘ rules of thumb ’ for both the ligand and structure-based in silico protocols ; however , even meeting the rules does not guarantee the final success of drug discovery projects .

In concert with the medicinal chemist ’s intuition ( or serendipity ) , the computer-assisted molecular design ( CAMD ) approaches are regarded as an integral method for the exhaustive transformation of the compound topology or topography and/or the electronic properties into the property-based chemical space .

In other words , the working tenet of QSAR is that molecules with high similarity share common effects ( similarity principle ) ; however , the validity of the assumption is still questionable — there is no absolute standard ( or metric ) of similarity .

A set of characteristics might be denoted by a bit-string representation , sometimes augmented with the weighting factors , assigning varying importance to the particular descriptors to calculate a quantitative measure of the structural resemblance between objects , for instance Tanimoto coefficient .

Despite the presence of fluid scientific boundaries , e. g. , some similarity metrics exhibit size-dependent behavior — similarity quantification is still a powerful concept that allows us to specify ( with some confidence ) the shared host – quest interactions .

Finding critical in vitro and/or in silico parameters ( descriptors or properties ) of the hit→lead→seed→drug route is still a long-term aspiration and monumental challenge in drug discovery projects , mainly due to the intrinsic multidimensionality of the problem .

The quantitative mapping of experimental/calculated properties/descriptors into the ADMET-driven molecular potency is frequently a ‘ hit-or-miss affair . ’ Therefore , some structure – activity relationship ( SAR)-mediated guides are urgently needed at the ‘ pre-synthesis ’ stage .
