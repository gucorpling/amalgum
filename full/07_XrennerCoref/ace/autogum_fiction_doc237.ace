Better , far better would it have been had he given in to the insistent demand of his subconscious mentor ; but his almost fanatical obsession to save ammunition proved now his undoing , for while his attention was riveted upon the thing circling before him and while his ears were filled with the beating of its wings , there swooped silently out of the black night behind him another weird and ghostly shape .

His rifle flew from his grasp ; he felt clawlike talons of great strength seize him beneath his arms and sweep him off his feet ; and then the thing rose swiftly with him , so swiftly that his cap was blown from his head by the rush of air as he was borne rapidly upward into the inky sky and the cry of warning to his companions was forced back into his lungs .

Then his captor did that which proved beyond doubt to Bradley that he was in the hands of human beings who had devised an almost perfect scheme of duplicating , mechanically , the wings of a bird -- the thing spoke to its companion and in a language that Bradley partially understood , since he recognized words that he had learned from the savage races of Caspak .

When danger threatened , he was prepared ; but he was not forever courting disaster , and so it was that when about one o'clock in the morning of the fifteenth , he heard the dismal flapping of giant wings overhead , he was neither surprised nor frightened but idly prepared for an attack he had known might reasonably be expected .

Past experience suggested that the great wings were a part of some ingenious mechanical device , for the limitations of the human mind , which is always loath to accept aught beyond its own little experience , would not permit him to entertain the idea that the creatures might be naturally winged and at the same time of human origin .

Bradley was a brave man , yet so keen was the feeling of revulsion engendered by the sight and sound of that grim , uncanny shape that he distinctly felt the gooseflesh rise over the surface of his body , and it was with difficulty that he refrained from following an instinctive urge to fire upon the nocturnal intruder .

He felt the thing that carried him rise to a greater altitude , and below he glimpsed momentarily the second white-robed figure ; then the creature above sounded a low call , it was answered from below , and instantly Bradley felt the clutching talons release him ; gasping for breath , he hurtled downward through space .
