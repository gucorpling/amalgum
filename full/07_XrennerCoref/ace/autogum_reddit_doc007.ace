I know I could " just not watch " ( gottem ) those of his videos , and trust me I do n't , but since that has become a good 60 % of the h3h3 channel by now , I just do n't want to see these videos consume any more of his channel than it already has .

They make people fear that these social justice warriors are everywhere , that people this irrational and easily offended are around every corner , when I have yet to find someone come even close to what is portrayed in the videos , and I live in an extremely liberal town .

Of course , these videos are entertainment , so they are going to pick the most ridiculous people of the bunch , yet looking at the comments I see people say they 're scared of making jokes because of these people .

The purpose of this post really is n't about political correctness or social justice warriors , so I wo n't get too much into that , but you see my point .

It 's over , it 's done , now that kind of content is boring , the people who still get views out of it are involved in fringe right-wing politics .

I used to love watching videos making fun of Social Justice Warriors ; in fact that is a big reason as to why I was originally drawn to H3H3 .

That 's what the SJW outrage videos were : Just some angry people who had a meltdown in public and got famous on the internet .

IMO the right way to combat the overly-offended is to ignore them , they really have no power if their message is not spread .

It was some lame video made by boring BuzzFeed writers , who were probably the only ones to give a shit about it .

Of course , that last bit is subjective , however I cannot imagine that I 'm the only one that feels that way .

No one 's mind is being changed , no awareness is being spread , and nothing new is ever said .

While one may argue that they are entertaining , they get quite old quite fast , as I previously stated .

No one agrees with them but those that are already within the " cult of outrage " .

Very few people ever took the SJWs that became the subject of those videos seriously .
