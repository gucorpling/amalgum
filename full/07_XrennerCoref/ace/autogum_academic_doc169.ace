Lanthanum ( La ) is a rare earth material which has been introduced as dopant in the TC shows a stable phase up to its melting temperature of 2295 ± 10 °C . Mauer et al. reported that La2O3∙ZrO2 is best processed by atmospheric plasma spraying ( APS ) at a low power , where it exhibited high durability due to the high fusion enthalpy of ~350 kJ mol−1 of La2O3 .

At the same time , thicker TC may increase surface temperature during operation and exceeds the ceramic materials limit at elevated temperatures , owing to the excessive growth of thermally grown oxide ( TGO ) at the interface of the TC/bond coat and leading to detached TC from the bond coat ( BC ) .

However , if an inconsistent layer of TGO was grown on the BC , a cluster of oxides such as chromia ( ( Cr , Al)2O3 ) , spinel ( Ni(Cr , Al)2O4 ) and nickel oxide ( NiO ) may grow along with it , leading to TBC failure .

MCrAlY coatings are typically deposited by electron beam physical vapor deposition , air plasma spray ( APS ) and high-velocity oxygen fuel ( HVOF ) . Li et al. stated that the durability of TBC can be improved by changing the microstructure in the BC .

BC is the most vital constituent in TBC as it strengthens the adhesion of the TC to the substrate and acts as an oxidation and corrosion barrier to the superalloy .
