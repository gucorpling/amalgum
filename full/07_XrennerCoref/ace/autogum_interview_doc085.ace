But it was interesting because the following Thursday I was called in to Senator Long and there were a couple of other senators , and they brought me in there to tell me what my consequence from this whole event was going to be .

And in this case , I did not violate a caucus confidence , and I was trying to advocate for my constituents , who wanted the right to vote on this issue as reflected in the surveys that they returned to my office .

And so I felt like I was doing things to try to advocate on their behalf without necessarily taking a position from their perspective on whether they felt like this should be part of the constitution or not part of the constitution .

And so this idea that I violated a caucus confidence is unfortunate , it 's wrong , it 's untrue , it 's misleading , and , hopefully , this will help correct that record .

And they listed out four different things that were going to happen , and they then told me they were going to go to the caucus and privately tell them what was going to happen .

And I just find it grossly hypocritical and somewhat ironic that there would be a violation of caucus protocol to leak out this punishment that I have while they 're accusing me of this .

There are some — because what has been said to the media , particularly by Senator Long — that have had the wrong perception that I may have violated a confidence of the caucus .
