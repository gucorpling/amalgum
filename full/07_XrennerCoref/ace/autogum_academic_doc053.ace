Since many novel antibiotics exhibiting strong effects against multiple-drug resistant bacteria have been isolated from medicinal plant-associated endophytic Streptomyces spp. in the last decades , endophytic S. griseorubens MP42 could be a potential candidate for the production of valuable bioactive substances .

Using E. coli as a model for exploring the mechanism of action of L. cubeba fruit EO , we demonstrated that EO-treated cells were rapidly killed after 2 h of treatment at the EO concentrations ≥ 2 MIC .
