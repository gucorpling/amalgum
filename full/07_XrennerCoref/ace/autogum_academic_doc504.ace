The ar/R region of the AqpZ homologues in bacteria is mostly composed of a Phe at the second transmembrane helix ( H2 ) ; a His or Ile at the fifth transmembrane helix ( H5 ) ; a Cys , Thr , Ala , Leu , Gly , or Val at loop E ( LE1 ) , which provides a backbone carbonyl oxygen ; and an Arg residue in most species , but that is substituted by Val in six species , at loop E ( LE2 ) , which provides donor hydrogen bonds for water molecules .

Non-conserved NPAs are found in a Segniliparus rotundus AQP , in which the N-terminal NPA motif is replaced by TPV , and the Flavisolibacter tropicus and Segniliparus rotundus AQPs , in which the C-terminal NPA motifs are substituted by NPI and VPA , respectively .

Consistent with the divergent phylogenetic clustering and different facilitated substrates , AqpZ and GlpF possess four distinct conserved amino acid residues that comprise the ar/R region , which is also named the selective filter ( SF ) (

The SF region of the archaeal AQPs is similar to its bacterial counterparts , but for GLPs , except for an Arg at LE2 , the other three conserved amino acids are different from those of bacteria (

Thus , it appears that the archaeal GLPs merge the characteristics of narrow SF and channel in the obligate water-type aquaporins with the more hydrophobic but less polar SF of the aquaglyceroporins .

Based on the hydrophilic characteristics of the amino acid residues in the SF region , these AQPs are predicted as water facilitators .

Because only glycine is hydrophilic in this IAGV/AIGV region , whether these AQPs function as water facilitators remains unclear .
