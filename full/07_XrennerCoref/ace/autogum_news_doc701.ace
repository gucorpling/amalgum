We envision combining these origami-inspired materials with computer-controlled actuators to build more complex machines , such as hardening shells , locked-in joints and deployable barriers ; and ultimately , this transformer technology will revolutionize the way we think about materials , moving them beyond their current static form , and revealing more functionality than what originally meets the eye " .

As The Guardian reported , MIT – Harvard team lead author Sam Felton , a Harvard University Ph.D. candidate , priced the manufacturing equipment for the robot at $ 3,000 , which could then make each individual unit — a 13 cm -long , Transformer -like robot — for about $ 100 .

A research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and Harvard University ' s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering has developed a robot that assembles itself within four minutes from a flat sheet into a 3D ( three-dimensional ) moving structure .

As described by MIT researchers , the initially flat sheet consists of five layers : copper wires in the middle , then two layers of paper ( above and below ) , and two outer layers of shape memory polymer .

Once the battery is attached to the design , the robot folds itself into the pre-determined shape and walks away , with motion of the four-legged robot controlled by the included microprocessor and two small motors synchronised by it .

Marc Lavine , a senior Science editor , suggested such robots might be put in place " through a confined passageway , such as a collapsed building , after which they would assemble into their final form autonomously " .

" It lets you transfer just one degree of freedom into a whole complicated motion , all through the mechanics of the structure , " says coauthor Erik Demaine , MIT professor of computer science and engineering .

The folding pattern studied by the Cornell -led research team is well-known in origami as Miura-ori , whose unusual engineering properties caught the attention of team member Chris Santangelo of the University of Massachusetts Amherst .

Felton told about creation of the pattern : " Cyclic folds are used by a software program called ' Origamizer ' as building blocks to create any polyhedron .

The robot moved during testing at about 5.4 centimeters per second , over a pre-determined route , not just a straight line — without any outside assistance .

The parameters defining the fold pattern which determines the final 3D shape are placement of the self-folding hinges , and the order of their triggering .

The embedded heating circuits activate the robot 's self-folding by heating shape memory polymers at the hinges .
