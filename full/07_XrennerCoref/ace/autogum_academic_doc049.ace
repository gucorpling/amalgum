The superoxide radical anion ( O2∙− ) can be formed from different sources such as xanthine oxidase , NADPH ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ) oxidases , uncoupled NO synthases and the mitochondrial respiratory chain , and represent in many ways a direct antagonist of nitric oxide as shown by the famous experiment by Gryglewski et al. .

Given the recent report by Xiao & Meierhofer raising doubts about the reliable use of hydroethidium-based probes for superoxide detection in cell culture , we think that our present data are of interest for all researchers using hydroethidium-based probes , but especially mitoSOX , in cell culture , isolated mitochondria and tissue samples .

The existence of superoxide dismutases ( mitochondrial MnSOD and cytosolic/extracellular Cu , Zn-SOD ) implies that superoxide may be harmful for the cell , which is supported by the fact that deficiency in MnSOD is lethal and deficiency in Cu , Zn-SOD renders mice susceptible to cardiovascular and neuronal complications .

With the present studies , we evaluated the specific probe for mitochondrial superoxide formation , mitochondria-targeted , triphenylphosphonium-linked hydroethidium ( mitoSOX ) , for its usefulness in the detection of mitochondrial superoxide formation ex vivo/in vivo and compared this high-performance/pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC)-based assay with two alternative/traditional methods .

Since the transition between oxidative stress and redox signaling is a thin line , the exact knowledge of the identity of formed species , the cellular and subcellular localization of their formation , as well as their time duration and concentration , are of high clinical and pharmacological importance .

Nitric oxide ( NO∙ ) for instance acts as an important vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet activation via formation of nitrosyl-iron enzyme complexes but also provides the basis for wide-spread signaling mechanisms by S-nitros(yl)ation of protein thiol groups as exemplified by suppression of apoptosis by S-nitros(yl)ation of caspases .

The term oxidative stress describes a condition that is either characterized by increased generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species ( RONS ) and/or dysregulated cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms ( e. g. , decreased expression of central antioxidant enzymes ) .

With our previous work , we have stressed that the traditional or old RONS assays are not necessarily inferior as compared to up-to-date or even cutting-edge assays and at least have their specific features and application spectra .

The most abundant biological RONS include superoxide radical , hydrogen peroxide , hydroxyl radical , carbon-centered peroxides and peroxyl radicals , nitric oxide radical ( NO∙ ) , nitrogen dioxide radial , peroxynitrite , and hypochlorite .
