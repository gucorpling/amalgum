For a moment Tarzan thought that by some strange freak of fate a miracle had saved him , but when he realized the ease with which the girl had , single-handed , beaten off twenty gorilla-like males , and an instant later , as he saw them again take up their dance about him while she addressed them in a singsong monotone , which bore every evidence of rote , he came to the conclusion that it was all but a part of the ceremony of which he was the central figure .

They wore , like the men , only skins of wild animals caught about their waists with rawhide belts or chains of gold ; but the black masses of their hair were incrusted with golden headgear composed of many circular and oval pieces of gold ingeniously held together to form a metal cap from which depended at each side of the head , long strings of oval pieces falling to the waist .

Her voice was soft and musical -- Tarzan could scarce realize that its possessor in a moment more would be transformed by the fanatical ecstasy of religious zeal into a wild-eyed and bloodthirsty executioner , who , with dripping knife , would be the first to drink her victim 's red , warm blood from the little golden cup that stood upon the altar .
