Should a wide range of knowledge be gained and specific ( at least initial ) experience and the ability to reflect on your actions be acquired to develop the essential competencies and to successfully operate in the conditions of uncertainty and changeable external environment ? Leading universities are actively developing research and managerial training in such areas as systems engineering , future technologies , complex systems â€™ stability and adaptability , network technologies and distributed architectures , data science , conceptual design , chaos management , self-organization , etc. .

It is necessary , on the one hand , to evaluate options taking into account the entire life cycle of the system and the changes in the external environment that can significantly influence it and , on the other hand , to separate the design process of the system as a whole from the detailed work on its individual components and develop iteratively , testing and refining solutions as new information appears .

The continuously arising new tasks , the need for their understanding , systematization and schematization , taking into account the requirements of numerous stakeholders , frequent restructuring of teams to adjust to the changing requirements , makes relevant the interdisciplinary competencies that are crucial in achieving strategic goals of technological breakthrough : engineering-managerial , engineering-economic competencies and the ability to take anticipatory action (

As the systems become more complex , the contradictions increase between the objectives of research and technological activity ( the field of science ) , users of technology ( the field of exploitation ) and the interests of business as the main customer of high-tech innovations .

When training managers , it is important not only to demonstrate the capabilities of an interdisciplinary methodology as a way of organizing teamwork for a comprehensive analysis of the situation and increasing heuristic efficiency , but also to provide them with the tools for interdisciplinary decisions .

The fundamental principle of modern university education is the application of an interdisciplinary approach that integrates subject knowledge into a new quality ( mathematics , physics , biology , engineering and technology , economics and finance , ecology , law , management ) .

We should emphasize that interdisciplinarity is not so much a joint consideration of problems by experts from different fields of science and practice , but a synthesis of various knowledge in order to obtain a new solution to a complex problem .

Hence , in management education , the share and content of scientific , technical , engineering and technological , technical and economic training should be substantially strengthened , as this is what contributes to the development of the relevant competencies .
