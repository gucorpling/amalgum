How Paul Prescott gained strength by battling with adverse circumstances , and , under all discouragements , kept steadily before him the charge which he received from his dying father , is fully told ; and the author will be glad if the record shall prove an incentive and an encouragement to those boys who may have a similar campaign before them .
