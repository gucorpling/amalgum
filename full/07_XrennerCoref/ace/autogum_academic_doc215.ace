This improved performance was attributed to the ability of the silver nanoislands to generate a high density of hot spots on both the top and side of the glass nanopillar array . Park et al. used an Ar+ plasma to treat a polyethylene terephthalate surface to form polymeric nanopillars .

Specifically , because a 3D SERS substrate provides a larger surface area and a higher density of so-called “ hot spot ” zones along the vertical direction compared to a flat 2D substrate , the former allows increased sensitivity and greater enhancement .

Their work determined that the surface tension induced a leaning effect in groups of two or three adjacent nanopillars that resulted in the self-assembly of hot spots , which , in turn , significantly enhanced the SERS signal .

Gold nanoparticles were subsequently generated by evaporation to create a 3D gold-rich nanopillar structure that induced the self-clustering of plasmonic nanogaps due to capillary forces and increased the concentration of analyte on the substrate surface .
