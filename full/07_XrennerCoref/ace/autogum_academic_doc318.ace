By leveraging the growing popularity toward hyper-converged appliances that integrate computing , storage , and networking resources into a single box-style entity , we can enable the multi-site resource pool that ready to be customized and scaled-out without the manual intervention of playground operators .

Thus , in our approach , each playground site is equipped with a box-style of hyper-converged resources , denoted as SmartX Box , the hyper-converged box-style resource that should be useful in supporting the required composability by comfortably accommodating virtualized and programmable resources .

To satisfy the dynamic requirements of playground developers on diversified functionalities over distributed but miniaturized resource pools , the proposed playground should integrate the emerging technology paradigms such as the SDN , cloud computing , and Internet of Things ( IoT ) .

As mentioned earlier , to specifically address the affordability of multi-site playground , the resources should be open without any configuration/monitoring limitations , agile to adopt new technologies or match experiment requirements , and economics by the deployment of low-cost commodity hardware .

Thus , we propose the concept of Playground Tower , which provides a logical space-like abstraction in a centralized location , which leads the operation of the multi-site playground by following the concept of “ monitor and control ” tower .

However , the SDN-enabled multi-site clouds combination brings new complexities for the playground operators , since multi-site clouds resources , connected via SDN-based networks , demand various software-based DevOps- automation tools to build , operate , and use automatically .

For the customizable ( i. e. , software-defined ) playground , the resource infrastructure of the multi-site playground should be composable ( e. g. , programmable ) in terms of computing , storage , and networking types of resources .

A tiny-size team of people ( i. e. , operators ) should provision and control the multi-site isolated resources , which is openly accessible by a group of people ( i. e. , developers ) from all involved sites .

Open-source software in converged SDI with SDN , cloud , and Network Function Virtualization ( NFV ) integration , and the support of open-source hardware are the main drivers of the development of hyper-converged box-style resources .

To continuously operate by re-configuring the playground resources , O-Center provides a set of interfaces ( e. g. , CLI , API , Web UI ) to meet the varying requirements of playground developers .

Mainly , we focus on establishing a multi-site playground infrastructure where playground resources are physically distributed across multiple geographical sites but logically inter-connected with each other to offer a unified shared pool of resources .

From the tower , the DevOps team can enjoy a panoramic view of playground resources that are distributed over underlay networks , and quickly manage and use those resources for their experiments .

A Playground is defined as a miniaturized and customizable testbed that is easy to build and operate for various research experiments by a tiny-size DevOps-style team of developers and operators .

The function represents virtual functions ( e. g. , virtual machine , virtual switch , or virtual router ) , which are implemented by using a set of open-source software .

Finally , the inter-connect is representing the path/link between functions or boxes which include the tunnel-based overlay networking because playground sites are spread over the heterogeneous underlay network infrastructure .

Multiple types of SmartX Box should be designed and deployed for different purposes , such as SD-WAN , SDN-enabled clouds , and access extension support .
