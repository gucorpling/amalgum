Previous studies have shown that total phenolics , total flavonoid , and total polysaccharide contents of goji fruits from 13 different regions in China ranged from 6.899 – 8.253 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight ( DW ) , 3.177 – 6.144 mg rutin equivalents/g DW , and 23.62 – 42.45 mg/g DW , indicating that the goji berry from Guyuan of Ningxia was most similar to Daodi herbs . Liu et al. reported a comparative analysis of carotenoid accumulation in red fruit of Lycium barbarum L. and black fruit of Lycium ruthenicum L. , finding more extensive contents of carotenoids in red fruit than in black fruit .

In this study , we utilized an integrated UPLC-ESI-MS/MS detection system to study the effects of different nitrogen fertilizations on the yield and metabolites of goji berry and provided a theoretical model for the regulation of goji berries ’ nutrient compounds by fertilization .

The nitrogen content of the fertilizer absorbed by the plant was higher than that of the total nitrogen , indicating that these two periods were the peak period of nitrogen absorption and the key period for nitrogen fertilizer application .

In two-year-old goji , nitrogen uptake from the fast-growing period to the fruit-harvesting period ( from early May to mid-August ) continuously increased during the annual growth cycle and in early May to late June .

The growth and development , yield , and quality of goji are all quantitatively limited by nitrogen demand , where either too much or too little nitrogen can inhibit the growth and development of goji .
