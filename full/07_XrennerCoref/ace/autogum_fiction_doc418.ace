Therefore , when some of the blacks told me that wild buffalo were to be found in the neighbourhood -- beasts which had formerly belonged to settlers , but were now run wild -- I resolved , when sufficiently strong , to try and capture one of the cows for the sake of its milk .

I dropped my pole to which the lasso was attached , and allowed the little one to walk quickly away with it ; but , as I anticipated , the trailing shaft soon caught between the stumps of some trees , and made the calf a more secure prisoner than ever .

I had not been established in this camp many days , however , before I was struck down , for the first time , with a terrible attack of malarial fever , probably produced by the many hours I had spent wading in the swamps at Port Essington .

My faithful Yamba was terribly distressed at my condition , and waited upon me with most tender devotion ; but in spite of all that could be done for me , I grew gradually weaker , until in the course of a few days I became wildly delirious .

My success so elated Yamba that she , too , slid down from her hiding-place , and was making her way over to me and the calf , when suddenly an enormous bull , which we had not previously seen , rushed at her at full speed .

I slid down the tree a little way , and when the calf was near enough , I gently slipped the noose over its neck , and promptly made it a prisoner under the very nose of its astonished mother , who bellowed mournfully .

No sooner was the big bull dead than I determined to test the efficacy of a very popular native remedy for fever -- for shivering fits still continued to come upon me at most awkward times , usually late in the day .

Quietly sliding down my tree , I made my way to where Yamba was still holding the attention of the bull -- a fiery brute who was pawing the ground with rage at the foot of her tree .
