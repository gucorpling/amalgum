A number of studies ( national as well as international ) have explored certain important measures for the prevention and control of this disease , such as the selection of trees suitable for the environment , young growth tending , tending felling , pruning and disposal of blighted needles , twigs , and cones , cleaning stands , planting mixed stands , and so on .

However , of the 19 significantly different bacterial genera , six were classified as beneficial rhizospheric microorganisms , which could be attributed to the stability of soil bacterial community structure and the property of P. sylvestris var. mongolica sphaeropsis blight , which is host-dependent .

In addition , beneficial rhizospheric microorganisms occupy space and trophic niches by competing with other counterparts and improve nutrient uptake , plant health , and growth by establishing interactions with the plant rhizosphere .
