Here are some examples to begin with before we discuss : Garen 's a strong lane bully/dominator - Garen 's level 1 stats are decent but scale so poorly most bruiser type champions , and especially other juggernauts , outscale him very hard ever since levels 3-4 . Garen currently only bullies Irelia Garen 's a good lategame scaler - Garen 's lategame has improved thanks to Juggernaut rework , but still is very poor when compared with other Juggernauts 's lategame Garen 's E is a huge damage source - Garen 's E is indeed a decent damage source , but the fact it runs over 3 seconds , and the speed at which the output happens is variable and depends on level makes it so that early game damage is A ) inconsistent , and B ) just poor in general . A ) is explained because of isolation mechanic forcing his damage down , and B ) is explained by maths : 3 autoattacks happen at about the same speed as a full E but do more damage up until level 4 .

This is only possible in 2 scenarios : A ) strict 1v1 ( foe isolated , and CREEPS COUNT for isolation mechanic ) or B ) Villain Garen 's Villain mechanic is a free ticket to win a teamfight - It is a free ticket for actual damage output towards a potential carry but it 's RNG based , and since we have no control over the mechanic so we end up not enjoying it either . You hate it and we 'd like to have more control over it exchange for actual quality of life improvement . We 've answered alot of questions over the course of around 4 hours . If you have any other questions post them here .

( Ghostblade rush , heavy crit builds , triforce/steraks gage , ' weedzard ' aka magic pen sunfire/thornmail tank garen , titanic fervor - back when fervor keystone was a thing - you name it , one of us has probably had some amount of influence in that build for Garen . )

Today we want to discuss Garen with the community , Garen is currently being looked at for buffs by riot ( much needed especially in higher elos of play ) but the group of us are n't entirely sure we agree with what â€™s being done .

One of the casters in recent times famously mentioned how Garen has " one of the best early games " but this statement has been false since 2015 .
