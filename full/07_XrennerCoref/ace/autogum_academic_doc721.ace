The idea of collecting geotagged data and combining this with other databases ( i. e. , weather , land use and surveys ) appears to be successful , especially in the context of the Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven as this event provides a nice test case because the locational attributes of the exhibitions differ considerably .

According to the findings of this empirical study , visitors give more value to the positive immediate experiences than negative ones but the values attached to an experience increase or decrease depending on the temporality , physical environment and the weather of the experience .

Therefore , a practical tool such as a smartphone app that will enable respondents to geotag their experiences and to respond prompt surveys about the characteristics of experiences and underlying reasons can be more useful for the implementation of this study .

Therefore , one of the contribution of this study was that its attempt to capture and measure subjective immediate experiences at a large-scale cultural event while taking into account the relation with physical urban environment ( objective variables ) .

To select such potentially suitable locations , based on findings , we advise to look for locations located at some distance from railways and close to cafes and restaurants or otherwise by adding temporary drink and food facilities .

In a future study , more secondary data on the physical environment such as bike facilities , public restrooms , parking lots , etc. could be added to the analysis to see their influence on immediate experiences .

In addition , as the subjective momentary experiences at cultural events are a relatively new subject , this study provided experiences that might support data collection in future research .

The prominent public spaces might even face problems of congestion , dirt and noise during events , which is not desired for the city , its residents and visitors .

Integrating more other data sources to analysis such as geotagged social network data would enable further investigations of affective states of experiences , and improve this study further .

Finally , in the future , the routes that are taken by visitors should be derived from the GPS logs and integrated into the study for more insights .

This enabled us to extract more data about the surroundings that could help to improve the organization of events and to develop policy on urban environments .

However , the prominent public spaces will be known by a large public and after a few years these public spaces will not become better known .

Providing memorable experiences in different locations will optimize the placemaking opportunities for cities and also reduce the negative impacts of events on cities and citizens .

Although using GPS loggers and paper surveys was proved to be useful , it is also demanding both for researchers and the respondents .

By using different locations in the city , cities would benefit from a more equal distribution of exhibitions in the city .
