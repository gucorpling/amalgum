###Blue Mages * V ! Lyn : 9.0 -> 9.5 Bold Fighter Blade V ! Lyn has absolutely devastating combat results even if she is running Close Counter in her A slot , for a very impressive performance on both Phases due to her bulk and Speed ( which is not wasted on Enemy Phase ) . This puts her above the other blue mages , letting her jump up to be on par with Gwendolyn and Nowi . Reinhardt : 9.0 -> 9.0 With increased granularity , Reinhardt fills the gap of the new tier , while his fellow 9.0 Blue Mages do not . ###Axes NY ! Azura , W !

Fir and Karel have a very impressive new weapon , but inferior statlines to the likes of Soleil ( who can use a refined Wo Dao for effectively 38 Atk and 41 Spd ) , so they are more dependent on Enemy Phasing their first opponent , while the faster , stronger sword units rely on their Specials less and can initiate their first combat with much higher efficiency .
