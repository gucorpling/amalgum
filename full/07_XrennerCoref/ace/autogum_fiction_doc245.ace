But the Crozier being an hotel of a most retiring disposition , and the waiter ’s directions being fatally precise , he soon became bewildered , and went boggling about and about the Cathedral Tower , whenever he could catch a glimpse of it , with a general impression on his mind that Mrs. Tope ’s was somewhere very near it , and that , like the children in the game of hot boiled beans and very good butter , he was warm in his search when he saw the Tower , and cold when he did n’t see it .

Being buttoned up in a tightish blue surtout , with a buff waistcoat and gray trousers , he had something of a military air , but he announced himself at the Crozier ( the orthodox hotel , where he put up with a portmanteau ) as an idle dog who lived upon his means ; and he farther announced that he had a mind to take a lodging in the picturesque old city for a month or two , with a view of settling down there altogether .

This gentleman ’s white head was unusually large , and his shock of white hair was unusually thick and ample . ‘ I suppose , waiter , ’ he said , shaking his shock of hair , as a Newfoundland dog might shake his before sitting down to dinner , ‘ that a fair lodging for a single buffer might be found in these parts , eh ? ’

The waiter explained that he was the Verger , and that Mrs. Tope had indeed once upon a time let lodgings herself or offered to let them ; but that as nobody had ever taken them , Mrs. Tope ’s window-bill , long a Cloisterham Institution , had disappeared ; probably had tumbled down one day , and never been put up again .
