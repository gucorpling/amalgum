But I think I am the only person who is paid to be thinking about the organization as a whole all day every day - so that 's what I do .

Will they be turned down because they have written for an online website like Wikinews , which is not particularly fond of the mainstream media , and not traditional media ?

Because as in academia , authorship is significant for professional journalists , and so I think the idea that something was collaboratively authored is hard for traditional journalists to understand .

Dodge : Do you use Wikinews as a primary source for news , or do you use other mainstream sources , and then look to Wikinews ?

First , let me say that I do n't think Wikinews and the traditional/mainstream media should consider themselves at all in opposition to each other .

There are some things the mainstream media are very good at , and they are also ( sometimes ) happy to admit their faults .

I think there are lots of people who can do as good or better a job than I could , of editing Wikinews .

Matt : Although you have an account on the English wikinews ( User : SueGardner ) , you have never edited .

Matt : Yeah , as long as they state its CC-BY-2.5 and give our name , they can use it .

And yes , I think Wikinews writers can be respected by real journalists , because the work speaks for itself .

The trouble for traditional media is , they do n't own the rights to very much material .

Is there any main reason you do n't edit here or do you just not have time ?

I read your Doris Lessing story , and I was thinking maybe someone had interviewed her later .

We used to joke at the CBC that the only thing we owned was nature documentaries .

Matt : If you could interview anyone for Wikinews who would you like to interview ?

You mean , they can use your material if they credit you , yes ?

The one major challenge to that would be the collaborative authorship issue .

They operate inside a web of very complex agreements with multiple entities .
