‘ Twenty years ago , that pavement was worn with the footsteps of a mother and child , who , day by day , so surely as the morning came , presented themselves at the prison gate ; often after a night of restless misery and anxious thoughts , were they there , a full hour too soon , and then the young mother turning meekly away , would lead the child to the old bridge , and raising him in her arms to show him the glistening water , tinted with the light of the morning ’s sun , and stirring with all the bustling preparations for business and pleasure that the river presented at that early hour , endeavour to interest his thoughts in the objects before him .

The street is broad , the shops are spacious , the noise of passing vehicles , the footsteps of a perpetual stream of people -- all the busy sounds of traffic , resound in it from morn to midnight ; but the streets around are mean and close ; poverty and debauchery lie festering in the crowded alleys ; want and misfortune are pent up in the narrow prison ; an air of gloom and dreariness seems , in my eyes at least , to hang about the scene , and to impart to it a squalid and sickly hue .

A man has confidence in untried friends , he remembers the many offers of service so freely made by his boon companions when he wanted them not ; he has hope -- the hope of happy inexperience -- and however he may bend beneath the first shock , it springs up in his bosom , and flourishes there for a brief space , until it droops beneath the blight of disappointment and neglect .
