Oborne 's article alleges a number of other examples of suppression — calling the coverage of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong " bizarre " , and noting that the paper under-reported news of false accounting at Tesco but gave significant prominence to stories about the company without a critical edge .

Oborne says the failure of the Telegraph to cover HSBC is also present in the relative coverage given in November 2014 after the bank had to allocate a fund of £ 1 billion to compensate customers , as well as an investigation into manipulation of the currency market :

In Oborne 's article , he details how he submitted a story to the Telegraph regarding HSBC closing a number of prominent British Muslims ' s accounts — despite assurances to the contrary , the story was not published by the paper .

It is a matter of huge regret that Peter Oborne , for nearly five years a contributor to the Telegraph , should have launched such an astonishing and unfounded attack , full of inaccuracy and innuendo , on his own paper .

The Barclay brothers , owners of the Telegraph , " are being held to account " , according to Greenslade , and Oborne " has shone a light on a dark reality " .
