Additionally , Liu et al. proposed different modifications to the configurations of the ORC cycle and how to evaluate the performance of this cycle , where they presented ORC best practice , and with these proposed modifications a thermal efficiency of 18.57 % was achieved , higher than the other models evaluated , thus the study provides to future researchers relevant information to evaluate the cost-benefit of each configuration and determine which direction to take for further improvements , but the optimal practical reported for the ORC systems applied only to diesel engines and the contribution presented in this research is oriented to industrial gas engines .

However , this system has not been optimized and integrated to a GE Jenbacher engine type 6 as a bottoming cycle , and in thermoeconomic terms , some indicators of this thermal engine with ORC have not been studied in a real operational context , such as the leveled cost of energy ( LCOE ) , the specific investment cost ( SIC ) , and the payback period ( PBP ) , which allow the technical and economic feasibility of this solution to be determined .

One of the modifications to the architecture of this system is known as RORC , where research has been carried out to increase the efficiency of the cycle by 9.29 % , and from the data obtained from these studies it can also be appreciated that both the RORC and the simple ORC ( SORC ) work better with drier fluids , where the efficiency of the cycle was also affected by the critical temperature .

In order to increase the energy efficiency , different modifications have been proposed to the ORC architecture , several of the proposed improvements aim to optimize the temperature profile , where the organic working fluid follows the external heat source in order to reduce the exergy destroyed in the evaporator and thus increase the general second low efficiency of the system .

The complex structure of the Kalina cycle , the operational requirement of the steam Rankine cycle such as the high operating pressures and high risk of erosion , means the ORC cycle has the advantage given its simplicity , high reliability , and easy maintenance , which uses organic fluids for its operation .
