All unsaturated fatty acid species are derived by the sequential unsaturation of the fully saturated species i. e. , palmitic acid ( C16:0 ) and stearic acid ( C18:0 ) ( the values preceding the colon represent the number of carbons in the fatty acid , whereas the numbers following it are the number of double bonds ) ( Table 1 ) .

In contrast , the eukaryotic pathway occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and synthesizes phospholipids including phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , phosphatidylglycerol ( PG ) , phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , and phosphatidylserine ( PS ) .

During the life cycle of plants , an active lipid exchange between the chloroplast and ER occurs via the import of the DAG moiety of PCs from the ER to the chloroplast envelope where it contributes to the DAG pool used to synthesize plastidic lipids .

The prokaryotic pathway occurs in the chloroplasts and produces the major plastidic lipids such as monogalactosyldiacylglycerol ( MGDG ) , digalactosyldiacylglycerol ( DGDG ) , trigalactosyldiacylglycerol ( TGDG ) , and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol ( SQDG ) , otherwise known as sulfolipids .
