The concern is not only related to the environmental poisoning , needing effective procedures of inhibitor removal before flowing the used solution out of the industrial plant , but also to the contact of the protected metal , for example , with food , beverages , and medicals , during its lifecycle .

The test solutions are meant to mimic the aggressiveness of the environment due to in-situ generation of harsh byproducts ( i. e. , during plastic or biomass combustion ) or due to an environment that is aggressive itself in the exercise conditions ( i. e. , pickling or acidizing treatments ) .
