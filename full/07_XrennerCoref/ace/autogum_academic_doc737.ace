Similarly , it is possible that someone who has experience with using the devices or is able to step over or move them out of the way does not notice how often they have to do so ; while , conversely , someone who has more trouble with them may notice it more , so that the same number of encounters may seem “ frequent ” or “ infrequent ” to different people .
