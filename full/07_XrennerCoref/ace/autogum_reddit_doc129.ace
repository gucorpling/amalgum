I have had a hard time forgiving her , mostly because I struggle between blaming her for the things she did in the same way you would an unimpaired person , because that is how she wants to be seen , and not blaming her , because deep down , I know she IS impaired .

When she called a family meeting to censure me ( which backfired , since no one else agreed with her take on it ) , I brought up TBI , and everyone backed me up , but she would not hear it and followed through with the ' divorce ' .

But at the same time , I am afraid that if we tried to have an ' intervention ' or something , she might go totally over the edge , or just ' divorce ' the whole family and stop letting her husband and son associate with us .

I think because we are twins , she has lower inhibitions with me , and because she thinks of us as equal in everything , if she is being an incredible asshole , then I must be too .

I feel that would be the most productive , since we would all be on the same page , and it feels demeaning to her to have everyone in on the big secret about her except her .
