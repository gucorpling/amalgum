According to Alfred Einstein , writing in The Italian Madrigal ( 1949 ) , Taglia was probably a member of a small society of aristocratic amateurs , as indicated by the unusual care and cost shown in the publication of his two books of madrigals in 1555 and 1557 , for four and five voices , works which showed close attention to the progressive trends in other Italian cities not under Spanish rule .

He seems to have been close to the most famous Venetian composer of madrigals of the middle of the 16th century , Cipriano de Rore , since Rore included one of Taglia 's madrigals in one of his own publications in 1557 , a rare tribute .
