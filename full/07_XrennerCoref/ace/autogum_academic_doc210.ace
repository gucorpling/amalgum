Textile pressure sensors realized onto four fabric substrates ( A , B , C and D ) with a PEDOT : PSS formulation containing ethylene glycol show on average a higher sensitivity , associated with a lower stability and lower reliability with respect to comparable pressure sensors fabricated onto identical fabric substrates but with a pristine PEDOT : PSS formulation .
