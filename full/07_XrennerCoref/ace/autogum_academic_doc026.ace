Indeed , Ech A has been shown to attenuate the oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and cardiac toxic drugs , providing mitochondrial protection of cardiomyocyte . Park et al. have reported similar observations showing that Ech A reduced both cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels of patient-derived cardiac progenitors during the oxidative stress situation .

These previous findings imply that Ech A could exert a wide range of therapeutic impacts on other oxidative stress-related and inflammatory pathologic conditions ; however , the cell-type specific regulation of Ech A on the immune system , which consists of various innate and adaptive immune cells , has not been elucidated yet .

To attenuate the excessive immune response , advanced immunotherapy using immune-modulators such as inflammatory cytokine blockers has been used recently ; however , the presence of non-responder and uncontrolled side effects are the common challenging issues when using immunotherapy .

To explore the therapeutic mechanism of Ech A , we also performed in vitro proliferation and polarization experiments with two major innate and adaptive immune cells , macrophage and CD4+ helper T cells ( Th cells ) , respectively .

More importantly , in vitro results demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory function of Ech A is manifested by , in part , inducing immunomodulatory effector cells , such as M2 macrophages and Treg cells .

The therapeutic potential of Ech A was also evaluated in an experimental gastric ulcer model where Ech A provided anti-ulcerogenic effects by increasing endogenous enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels in vivo .
