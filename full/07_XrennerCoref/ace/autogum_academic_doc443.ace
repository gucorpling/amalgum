The data discontinuities which may be caused by changes in different sensors , orbital drift in the satellite overpass times , variations in sun-sensor-viewer geometry or differences in the atmospheric conditions ( i. e. , water vapour content , aerosols ) are common in other timeseries products , such as datasets from AVHRR , Landsat and VEGETATION .

Although DBEST and BFAST could also track vegetation gradual change by a piecewise linear model on the pixel scale , the number of breakpoints must be set by users when the method was extended to the regional scale .

Therefore , patterns that are composed of the general categories in our framework , or patterns that vegetation gradual changes were stalled or reverse by abrupt events , were not discussed in this study .

Although many methods have been developed to explore vegetation dynamics at a global or regional scale , quantitative methods that could automatically address where , when and how vegetation change are still lacking .

For example , de Jong detected the short-term greening or browning periods within long-term timeseries by dividing the trend component in BFAST into four segments which were separated by three breakpoints .

Firstly , unlike the widely used trend analyses which hypothesize that ecosystems/vegetation always change linearly in a direction , our framework could detect the non-linear change patterns in vegetation .

Then , the duration of the significant greening and browning segments , the magnitude of change in NDVI , and the abrupt changes could be compared between pixels subsequently .

Trajectory-based change detection is an inevitable choice to do this work by constructing a ‘ curve ’ or profile of full temporal records for each pixel .

Secondly , unlike DBEST and BFAST , our framework automatically generalizes processes of vegetation gradual changes into different patterns without setting any parameters .

However , it makes the framework unspecific to the MODIS timeseries products which do not suffer from the problem of data discontinuity .

Secondly , the smoothed treatment implemented on the NDVI timeseries makes the framework unsuitable to detect subtle changes or abrupt changes .

Nowadays , the method has been successfully applied in forest-related change analyses , land use classification , and cropland variations .

Lastly , trajectory-based change detection only functions when the process of vegetation change matches well with the hypothesized trajectory .

New models that could detect both the monotonic and the non-monotonic patterns are needed to be induced in future .

However , just a logistic model is used to simulate all the non-linear monotonic patterns in our framework .

Timeseries products present different temporal scales components , such as seasonal variations , long-term and short-term fluctuations .

All the patterns are associated with only one disturbance event within the timescales of the observation period (

Generally , changes in vegetation are complicated and difficult to be generalized by a single function .
