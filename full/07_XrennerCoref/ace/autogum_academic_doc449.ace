ZnO in the form of thin film with CdS nanoparticles on the surface has been shown to be a high-performance material for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue , while ZnO/CdS hierarchical composites have shown great photocatalytic H2-production performance . Wu et al. prepared ZnO hollow spheres and the hedgehog-like ZnO hollow spheres and studied their use as anodes for lithium-ion batteries , having good rate capacity , cycling performance , and high initial specific capacity .
