Only two studies focused on such paradoxically thermostable enzymes from psychrophilic and mesophilic origin have attempted so far to explain the structural basis of their stability , suggesting that either the flexibility of a global structure or the presence of extra disulfide and salt bridges are responsible for the unusual thermal stability of these enzymes .

To decipher the high stability of the new haloalkane dehalogenase DmxA wt , we investigated three unique features of the enzyme , corresponding to three possible sources of its stabilization . Both replacements of glutamine with asparagine and opening of the main tunnel brought desired outcomes in terms of decreased stability and improved activity .

In this study , we proved that narrow tunnels play a crucial role in the paradoxical stability of DmxA due to multiple van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions , although they are not the only factor responsible for the unique properties of the enzyme .

Despite its psychrophilic origin , DmxA wt exhibited the highest apparent melting temperature ( T m , app = 65.9 ± 0.1 °C ) of all biochemically characterized HLD-II members , and the second highest of all thus far characterized wild-type HLDs .

DmxA wt was found to form a dimer via a cysteine bridge , which may be formed only after heterologous expression in E. coli and purification , while is less likely to occur in the cytoplasm of the original host organism .

When replacing the glutamine with asparagine , the melting temperature of the enzyme decreased by 2 °C ( T m , app = 63.9 ± 0.2 °C ) confirming a small stabilizing effect of glutamine interactions in the protein core .

More importantly , introducing only two mutations , we managed to turn the thermostable enzyme into a mesophilic-like counterpart , with a melting temperature comparable to that of other related HLDs and a significantly improved catalytic performance .

Although cysteines in protein structures often serve as stabilizing elements , the S-S bridge between DmxA wt units in its dimeric form did not have any effect on the stability or the activity of the enzyme .
