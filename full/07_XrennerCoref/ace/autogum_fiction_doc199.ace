When I was a boy , another boy -- the pa'son 's son -- along with a lot of others , asked me ' Who dragged Whom round the walls of What ? ' and I said , ' Sam Barrett , who dragged his wife in a chair round the tower corner when she went to be churched . ' They laughed at me with such torrents of scorn that I went home ashamed , and could n't sleep for shame ; and I cried that night till my pillow was wet : till at last I thought to myself there and then -- 'They may laugh at me for my ignorance , but that was father 's fault , and none o ' my making , and I must bear it .
