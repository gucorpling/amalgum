In this context , the use of ELISA as a tool for laboratory diagnosis of malaria has some limitations , namely : ( i ) low antibody titres presented by individuals in the acute phase of infection ; ( ii ) many Plasmodium sp . are involved in human malaria ; ( iii ) different evolutionary forms of Plasmodium spp. during infection and life cycle ; and ( iv ) different resistance and susceptibility profiles during infection , and consequently in the immunity profile against malaria parasites .

Detection of antibody response against malaria antigens is often done through Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) ; many of these diagnostic assays are designed with a single antigen or with recombinant antigens of different stages of the parasites ( tissue infection or blood ) , where merozoite surface proteins can be detected , and have demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity .

After several decades of disease control campaigns , malaria persists as one of the most serious public health problems , not only in endemic countries , but also in non-endemic regions , where the number of cases of imported malaria via tourists and immigrants is on the rise .

In this work , we performed a comparative analysis of the serological reactivity of total antimalarial antibodies obtained by a commercial ELISA using recombinant antigens from Plasmodium sp . , compared to an in-house ELISA , using crude extract of P. falciparum 3D7 .

Associations among antibodies against parasite antigens and malaria risk areas are not always consistent ; some may depend on parasite antigens and other considerations may be due to the endemic areas of malaria .

Thus , we showed that several other P. falciparum antigens are equally important for the serological diagnosis of malaria , as well as some recombinant antigens commonly used in commercial ELISA .

Other authors have shown that new serological biomarkers can more accurately estimate the recent exposure to P. falciparum not only of a community , but also for several communities .

In 2015 , approximately 3.2 billion people — nearly half of the world ’s population — were at risk of malaria , mainly by P. falciparum .

It should be considered that single responses of antibodies against antigens might be inadequate to for use as biomarkers and indicators of malaria transmission intensity .

However , many individuals cannot be easily diagnosed due to the low levels of antibodies present in their blood .
