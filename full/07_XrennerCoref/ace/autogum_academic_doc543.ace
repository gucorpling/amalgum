Here , we first characterize hippocampal dynamics in mice subjected to CFC and show that : ( 1 ) the hippocampus operates in a near critical regime pre- and post-CFC training , and ( 2 ) successful , behaviorally-verified consolidation of fear memory leads to an underlying shift in hippocampal dynamics towards a subcritical state , similar to what we predict in our model simulations .

Here , we specifically identify very basic , underlying importance for the brain to reside near criticality and demonstrate that near-critical dynamics may be essential for a system-wide consolidation of new memories in a situation when the sensory input is weak and/or sparse in comparison with signals generated by memories native to the network ( i. e. , those previously stored ) .

Specifically , we show that storage of new information that is weakly and/or sparsely impinged on the network is mediated through plastic , state-dependent changes in network connectivity and can be successfully consolidated ( which is associated with attractor formation ) near criticality — a point associated with second order phase transitions .

These requirements raise two questions : ( 1 ) how do permanent and widely-distributed neural engrams form from initial , transient changes to a discrete subset of the network ’s synapses during learning , and ( 2 ) what mediates transformation of local representations of disparate features to global memory representation ?

If this is the case , then the dynamical state of the network must support long-range correlations across the network , as the number of neurons actively involved in encoding a specific memory trace is thought to constitute only a small fraction of the total neuronal population .

Together , these results indicate that novel learning may occur preferentially near a critical regime and leads to universal widespread stabilization of network activity patterns , which in turn drives the formation of widely-distributed engrams ( i. e. , systems memory consolidation ) .

The general , long-accepted assumption is that either strengthening of existing synaptic connections , or the de novo creation of additional synapses ( i. e. , formation of a discrete structural heterogeneity ) leads to the formation of a dynamical attractor .

While features of memory traces can be localized to specific cell populations ( e. g. , location information encoded in place cell activity ) , in general , tracing so-called “ engrams ” to neural circuits has been an elusive task .
