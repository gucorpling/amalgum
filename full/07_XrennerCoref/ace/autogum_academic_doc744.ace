The HSOP and energy consumption patterns will often remain the same , regardless of where the energy is sourced from , which will be a consideration for builders and designers of low-carbon development and energy-efficient homes and technology .

However , the interview revealed that the mother had low-energy and water consumption levels , while the sons would have long showers , use the tumble dryer , use their computers extensively and leave the lights on .

However , as this research has shown , an understanding of pre-occupancy practices allows an assessment of how resident practices change post-occupancy when interacting with the design and technological elements of a low-carbon development .

There were a number of households pre-occupancy who did not have access to their energy or water consumption data , or the data they provided was only for a few months a year .

The use of household level data was chosen to be able to assess the influence of the house as a system , in relation to the social practice theory development of a HSOP .

The authors did originally divide the household level data by the number of occupants in the household , but this resulted in discrepancies with the qualitative findings reported by residents .

Those who had previously had access to a bath and used this for cleanliness and relaxation , post-occupancy had to rely on a shower to perform this task instead .

The marked difference in energy use based on time of day and the practices being performed enable an understanding of the increase in renewable energy and battery storage options .

This research provides insight from a pre- and post-occupancy longitudinal study of low-carbon development residents and with a focus on tracking the pre-occupancy practices of residents .

This has reduced the households with available pre-occupancy data and influenced the extent to which the authors could comment on the possible impact of rebound effects .

Future studies might aim to obtain more detailed energy and water data both pre- and post-occupancy to allow for this area of research to be explored .

Future research might include a larger sample size of residents in a low-carbon development to see how these early adopters interact with the design and technology .

Along with a change in technology used in the practice , a change in the skills of the resident performing the practice are also required .

The authors chose not to use this incomplete data as it does not provide an accurate reflection of household energy and water consumption levels .

Residents who had not moved in to the low-carbon development by the beginning of 2019 were unable to participate .

Lower household water consumption levels are primarily due to low flow fixtures and a smaller garden to water .
