From a tourism management perspective , thirdly , we can conclude that Chinese independent travellers , which are the main target group of Qyer , are mainly interested in discovering travel hotspots in the same way as packaged tourists are ; in addition , they show interest in other , less popular places .

Fourthly , we found that social media activity , as measured by the number of followers and the number of distinct commented locations , is a very selective criteria to segment the observed users regarding their interest in travel hotspots versus alternative destinations .

Overall , there are various uncertainties in terms of the representativeness of the entire visitor population as there is a lack of data covering the behaviour and characteristics of the visiting population , which would be necessary to validate the sample .

Second , the fact that a user has commented on a place or POI does not necessarily mean that this user has visited the place or POI to which the comment refers , even if this indicates interest .

From an information systems perspective , firstly , our system design and formal methodology for hotspot detection from geolocated social media resulted in plausible geographical distributions of tourism hotspots , as validated by cross-references .

This study confirmed the known geographical long-tail distribution of interest , including the hotspot areas of Lucerne , Zurich , Interlaken and Geneva , validating the plausibility of the data and its analysis .

Secondly , in the case study , by application of our proposed method we discovered a highly significant stochastic dependence , thus providing evidence for the value or our proposed methodology for segmentation .

Third , even though Qyer does provide a timestamp for every comment , we found that users tend to upload their comments on various places and POIs at the same time .

We contribute a system design for detecting tourism hotspots and for segmenting tourists based on their interests in these hotspots , in the case of the geolocated social medium Qyer.com .

Even though Qyer is known to be a platform where independent Chinese travellers share their experiences , the possibility that packaged travellers are also active on Qyer cannot be eliminated .

There are various factors , e. ,g . population size , history of a tourism destination , distribution of the value added , that leverage the symptoms of overtourism .

This information can be applied to define a target group for online marketing to promote alternative travel destinations with the goal to reduce overtourism in travel hotspots .

Regarding future research directions , the hotspots detected in this paper do not necessarily imply that the respective destinations experience effects of overtourism .

Furthermore , it is unknown whether the sample is biased towards other subgroups of Chinese outbound travellers , such as budget travellers .

It is likely that they upload their posts upon return to their accommodations , where Internet access is available to them .

So , in future studies , we plan to put even more efforts on validating/evaluating the data we used .

The information gained from these sources may be always biased , which is an issue often associated with generalizations .

We demonstrate the potential of our system and method through pilot application , analysing Chinese tourism in Switzerland .

Users who are more active , who comment on different places and who have followers are a minority .

Finally , it was not possible to separate Chinese residents of Switzerland from the Chinese tourists in Switzerland .

However , these more active users are significantly more interested in alternative destinations outside the hotspot axis .

As a result , it is impossible to retrace visitor flows and evaluate the length of stay .

First , there are uncertainties in terms of the user base of Qyer and its representativeness .

9,17 abstract|13,14 abstract|15,16 abstract|15,17 abstract

Thus , the detected hotspots in this paper should be critically evaluated based on additional criteria .
