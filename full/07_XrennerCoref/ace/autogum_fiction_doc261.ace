I had had on my tongue ’s end , for my own part , a phrase or two about the right word at the right time ; but later on I was glad not to have spoken , for when on our return we clustered at tea I perceived Lady Jane , who had not been out with us , brandishing The Middle with her longest arm .

If he was in spirits it was n’t because he had read my review ; in fact on the Sunday morning I felt sure he had n’t read it , though The Middle had been out three days and bloomed , I assured myself , in the stiff garden of periodicals which gave one of the ormolu tables the air of a stand at a station .

I was strongly tempted , as I walked beside him , to let him know how much of that unveiling was my act ; and there was a moment when I probably should have done so had not one of the ladies of our party , snatching a place at his other elbow , just then appealed to him in a spirit comparatively selfish .

When afterwards , in the course of our gregarious walk , I found myself for half an hour , not perhaps without another manœuvre , at the great man ’s side , the result of his affability was a still livelier desire that he should n’t remain in ignorance of the peculiar justice I had done him .

It was n’t that he seemed to thirst for justice ; on the contrary I had n’t yet caught in his talk the faintest grunt of a grudge — a note for which my young experience had already given me an ear .
