As acknowledged by the Commission of the European Communities ( 2007 , 18 ) , “ accounting for deferred taxes … is very burdensome for companies in general , ” whereas “ it has been confirmed by preparers and users , e. g. , credit institutions and rating agencies , that deferred tax information ( whether recognized in the balance sheet or provided in the notes ) often is not considered a relevant input for the decisions to be taken ” .

The information effect we suggest may not persist in the long period as user ’s familiarity with the implementation of standards increases and/or the quality of financial reporting improves due to the monitoring effect of users of financial information .

Both the loss reversal model and the loss persistence model results show that tax categories provide incremental information before IFRS , but after IFRS information about loss reversal or loss persistency disappears in its usefulness .

We use a unique setting because , under IAS No. 12 , only the recognition criteria related to the tax information were relaxed in Korea , while the estimation method for deferred taxes remains unchanged .

Our results suggest that investors generally underweight their deferred tax balance before IFRS , but after IFRS adoption , investors cannot obtain buy-and-hold returns by buying GN firm-years and selling BN firm-years .

We expect that if IFRS adoption allows a firm greater flexibility in recognizing as deferred tax balance , then deferred tax disclosures will provide little information about the potential earnings sustainability .

We also first examine whether IFRS adoption affects the information about loss reversal or loss persistency , including multiple determinants of tax categories , and their control variables .

However , this is not because investors understand the information of DTAs , but because the usefulness of the information of DTAs deteriorates after IFRS adoption .

First , although we try to control the various effects associated with adopting IFRS , our research is probably not free of endogeneity issues .

First , although existing research analyzes the overall impact of introducing IFRS , our research focuses on specific issues related to tax accounting .
