Reflexive and engaged design involvements towards ensuring adequate and sustained access to resources and services at the margins in an inclusive and socially embedded way , is a need for the hour , particularly when the global South , including rural India , is experiencing severe structural , discursive , and power disparities .

As opposed to modernist and top-down approaches to design , scholars have argued in favor of participatory and co-creative involvements , where the designers and community members work hand in hand as co-researchers to potentially reduce dependency on external resources and expertise , and to build avenues for empowerment and change .

Guided by our mindfulness , competence , sensibilities , and preparedness as well as by agentic capabilities , values , practices , and situated knowledge of cultural participants , such design engagements would potentially co-create avenues for meaningful change , empowerment , and equality .

In global South contexts , many designers oftentimes not only take their privileges for granted in an unreflexive way , but also their expertise oftentimes lacks contextual knowledge ( including historical , social and cultural understanding ) , and primarily emphasize technical knowledge .

Some of the key components of such an approach are defining the design problem(s) and identifying the solution avenues together with local people ; transdisciplinary knowledge production through collaborations and conversations ; and empowering and enhancing local capacities by reducing existing dependencies .

Such design engagements , by paying attention to social , political , moral and ecological dimensions , envision a just society that promotes cultural diversity and plurality , create equal opportunity as well as fight against all kinds of disparities .

Scholars have noted that critical listening engagements essentially question societal power dynamics and uncritical assumptions that foreclose local voices ; whereas a dialogic involvement fundamentally opens up avenues for co-constructing respectful and impactful interactive environment in bringing about transformations .

Scholars term such approaches as self-organization ( i. e. , extending beyond participation ; e. g. , von Unger , , where participants collectively assume the leadership/ownership by minimizing or eliminating dependence on external resources and knowledge .

Thus , effective design initiatives for sustainable social change is essentially contingent on our understanding of human behavior , values , and contextual realities , as well as our commitment to meaningfully address human needs and expectations .

As a design researcher it is crucial for me to unlearn and introspectively de-construct my embodied ethnocentrism , unearned privileges as well as unexamined presumptions and practices that potentially cause formidable barriers to learning and innovating .

In other words , challenging my unearned privileges , ethnocentric assumptions , and sub-/un-conscious senses of superiority as well as self-introspecting to act mindfully , compassionately , and ethically was pivotal to my design journey .

Moreover , in less-known cultural contexts , inculcating and nurturing the qualities of intercultural competence such as empathy and compassion are crucial for me in making design engagements conducive , respectful , and emancipatory .

While the aforementioned principles and aspects guided and shaped my research journey , my design engagements at the margins emanated three thoughts and/or reflections , which I elaborate on in the following paragraphs .

In my design engagements , legitimizing situated social and cultural resources as valuable entities , and prioritizing local autonomy were important for me towards co-creating affordable , customized and sustainable designs .

In my design journey , I sought to legitimize meaningful community mobilization and agentic control over the process , encouraging cultural participants to take over and independently organize design initiatives .

Furthermore , scholars have called for critically examining and de-centering the exogenous experts and knowledge production practices to bring about sustainable transformations at the margins of the global South .
