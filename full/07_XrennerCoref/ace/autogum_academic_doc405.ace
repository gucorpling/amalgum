The way that NIR photons are scattered depends on canopy structure ( represented by LAI and leaf inclination angle , LIA , for homogeneous canopies ) and the direction of incident light ( represented by solar zenith angle , SZA ) , while absorption is dominated by brown elements ( represented by brown pigment content , Cbrown and dry matter content , Cdm ) .

Different GSA results for EVI from broad- and narrow-band sensors indicate that band settings ( central wavelength and full width at half maximum , FWHM ) may change the sensitivity of a VI and should be considered for applications with multi-sensor analysis and future spaceborne sensor design .

Because chlorophyll does not directly affect NIR reflectance , the potentially stronger sensitivity of broad red band canopy ρ to CCC is supposed to be the reason for the observed stronger sensitivity of broad-band EVI to CCC .

Based on the fact that photosynthesis is mainly driven by chlorophyll , EVI might be more representative for photosynthesis-related greenness than other VIs ( especially NDVI ) due to its stronger sensitivity to CCC .

The usefulness of MODIS- and Landsat-derived EVI ( and two-band EVI , EVI2 ) in gross primary production ( GPP ) estimation has been demonstrated by several studies at both ecosystem and global scales .

For weak absorption bands , such as NIR , solar photons are strongly scattered by the leaves in a dense canopy with a large LAI , which can result in significant anisotropic canopy ρ .

For photosynthetically active radiation ( PAR ) bands and water absorption bands , a large LAI can induce strong canopy absorption of radiation and result in very low canopy ρ .

Yet , constant L also gives EVI additional sensitivity to NIR band ρ , especially in dense canopy cases where blue and red band ρ are close to zero .

Therefore , the strong sensitivity of EVI and NIRv to NIR band ρ makes them exhibit relatively strong sensitivities to LAI , LIA , Cdm , and SZA .

For all four sensors , the sensitivity of NDVI is dominated by LAI , and far behind is CCC as the second influential factor .

This is because a soil adjustment parameter ( L ) is introduced into EVI , which makes EVI more resistant against canopy background changes .

In this sense , NDVI , which is probably the most ever-used VI , mainly represents variations of LAI across time and space .

A similar situation applies for NIRv , whose variation is mainly driven by NIR ρ when NDVI saturates in dense canopy cases .
