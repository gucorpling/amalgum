I believe that I had several other things in my favor that contributed to me living this long : I was relatively young when diagnosed ( 53 ) , I was in decent shape and not over weight when diagnosed , I 'm married and my spouse made it a full time job to get me healthy and manage my health ( I know I would have died by now if I was single ; when I was told that I was terminal and had 6 months to live my wife also became a cheerleader and kept me focused when I thought that all was lost ) .

Problem is , i have no further information because he avoids to speak about it and generally did n't change much at all except stopping to smoke , thanks god . ( still has terrible food/drink/sleep/work habbits ) So my question is , if there is solid information on how to adapt to prolong life as much as possible .
