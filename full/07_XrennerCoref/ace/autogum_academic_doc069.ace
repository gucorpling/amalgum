In these discussions we explain the observed trends or changes and attempt to associate these trends with physical processes or attribute the changes to other issues ; however , these explanations may not accurately represent what is actually happening due to the limited amount of data .

Both the nature of these differences , increasing with increasing distance along the line , and changes occurring in regions we expect to have no or little change indicate that these changes were a result of a problem with our measurement or processing methods .

One potential way to address this issue would be to not to compute the distance between the line origin and a measured point , but to create a rotated coordinate system for each line with one ordinal direction matched to the line direction .

However , during field data collections , it was extremely rare ( i. e. , never ) for the survey line to be perfectly straight during collection , as the boat occasionally moved slightly off the heading and was brought back on line .

In some cases , the changes did not appear to be from the result of physical processes , but were either the results of data collection errors , such as not surveying the identical location , or issues relating to the analysis .

While enough data were collected to determine if this approach is feasible , there were not sufficient data collected to adequately characterize all the various processes occurring in the channels , which was not an objective of this study .

We determined that the most likely cause of these anomalies was the processing step where we converted the latitude and longitude readings ( x and y data ) , to one-dimensional data representing distance along a line .

As these were to first two surveys , it is likely that there may have been problems with the sonar setup , as the sonar requires accurate off-set and other information that may have been entered incorrectly .

Then the converted data would show distance from the starting point along the line ( on-track distance ) and the perpendicular distance of the point ( off-track distance ) from the line .

In our method we used the starting coordinate of the survey line as the initial point and we computed distance along the line as the distance from this point .

The data for all the lines showed that as the distance along the survey line increases , there is more apparent change in the sediment .

Thus the distance from the line origin to a sample point was not necessarily the distance along the line .
