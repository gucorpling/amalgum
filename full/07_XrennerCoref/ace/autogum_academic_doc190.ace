( CM ) , Calendula suffruticosa subsp . fulgida ( Raf . ) Guadagno ( CF ) , Calendula arvensis ( Vaill . ) L. ( CA ) and hybrid ( CI ) between the CM and CF . CM , perennial , is endemic to Western Sicily , where it grows along the coast lines ; it is one of the most endangered species on a global scale .

The taxa here investigated occur in different habitats : the rare endemic CM is linked to peculiar coastal areas , the more opportunistic CF is able to colonize several different environments , the hybrid CI testifies to special evolutionary events when CM and CF come into contact , and the widespread CA is common in cultivated or disturbed areas .

In any case , regardless of the species considered , the antioxidant activity could be responsible for the effects reported , both from the phytotherapeutic traditional usages and the scarce available literature about the bioactivity of the plants of this family ( anti-inflammatory , healing , antispasmodic ) .

There is no agreement on the number of species within the genus , owing to the high number of taxa differently considered by different authors , but recently , this number has been proposed to be 15 , with several infraspecific taxa .
