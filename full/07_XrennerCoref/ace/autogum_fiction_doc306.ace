I recollect the sound of father ’s Lancashire clogs on the street pavement above , as being different in my young hearing from the sound of all other clogs ; and I recollect , that , when mother came down the cellar-steps , I used tremblingly to speculate on her feet having a good or an ill-tempered look , — on her knees , — on her waist , — until finally her face came into view , and settled the question .

Whether I cried for that I was in the dark , or for that it was cold , or for that I was hungry , or whether I squeezed myself into a warm corner when there was a fire , or ate voraciously when there was food , she would still say , ‘ O , you worldly little devil ! ’ And the sting of it was , that I quite well knew myself to be a worldly little devil .

Left alone , I yielded myself up to a worldly yearning for enough of anything ( except misery ) , and for the death of mother ’s father , who was a machine-maker at Birmingham , and on whose decease , I had heard mother say , she would come into a whole courtful of houses ‘ if she had her rights . ’

Worldly little devil , I would stand about , musingly fitting my cold bare feet into cracked bricks and crevices of the damp cellar-floor , — walking over my grandfather ’s body , so to speak , into the courtful of houses , and selling them for meat and drink , and clothes to wear .

I was sitting in the road-way , blinking at it , and at a ring of people collected around me , but not close to me , when , true to my character of worldly little devil , I broke silence by saying , ‘ I am hungry and thirsty ! ’

Father , with his shoulders rounded , would sit quiet on a three-legged stool , looking at the empty grate , until she would pluck the stool from under him , and bid him go bring some money home .
