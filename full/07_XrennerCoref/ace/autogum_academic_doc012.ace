Practices such as step-down or gradual weaning through reduction in volume of milk over a number of days or reduction in number of milk meals have been suggested as a means of reducing the impact of weaning stress . Sweeney et al. examined the impact of weaning duration on concentrate intake and performance of calves offered high levels of milk .

Recently , however , it has been suggested that the use of combined remote sensing technologies could allow measurement of several behavioural and physiological responses , which , when compared with measuring only a single aspect , could provide a more accurate aggregate indicator of animal well-being .

Abrupt weaning of calves , whereby a previously unchanged milk allowance is removed suddenly over 24 h , has been associated with decreased solid feed consumption in the pre-wean period and a decrease or stall in growth rate in the period following the withdrawal of milk .

With regard to long-term measurements , automated feeders allow precise measurement of individual feed intake ( e. g. , ) and the recording of behavioural traits , deviations in which can be indicative of increased stress as a result of feeding regime .

Measurement of calf activity using pedometers or accelerometers has previously been linked with hunger , with De Paula Vieira et al. finding that standing time was increased by 1 hr in limit fed calves when compared with those fed ad libitum .

These gradual weaning methods have been shown to encourage solid feed intake at an earlier age which is thought to help prepare calves for a solid feed diet and thus lessen the impact of milk removal ( e. g. , ) .

With an increasing range of on-farm sensing technologies available , the aim of this study was to determine the effect of gradual versus abrupt weaning on group housed calves using non-invasive , automated behavioural and physiological parameters .

With regard to underlying physiological response to stressors , recent research has highlighted heart rate variability ( HRV ) as a viable , non-invasive parameter for measuring response to environmental , physiological and psychological stress load .

This method was used by Overvest et al. in pair housed calves as it was considered that if a volume reduction method had been implemented there could have been greater variation in milk intake between calves .

However , the increased intake was not sufficient to compensate for the reduced intake of milk , leading to lower digestible energy intakes and low live weight gains in the calves weaned over 22 days .

However , these studies also highlight the importance of considering calf age , concentrate intake and milk feeding system when choosing a weaning method so as to ensure calves achieve performance targets .

Weaning is a multifaceted stressor incorporating nutritional , environmental and physiological elements and thus is one of the most challenging periods for both producers and calves ( e. g. , ) .

Concentrate intake was increased in calves subject to 10 or 22 day weaning durations when compared to those weaned either abruptly or over 4 days .

Calf reaction to stressors such as weaning has traditionally been assessed using behavioural and aural observations ( e. g. , ) .
