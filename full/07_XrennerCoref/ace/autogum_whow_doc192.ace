Younger children should n't be given hard chores like washing the dishes or mowing the lawn , instead give them simple chores like putting away their toys or putting away their clean laundry . if they want to do " big kid chores " just give them a bit of help . for older children they can have a little harder jobs , you should also encourage older children to help their younger siblings . you should also offer your child/children a reward for participating in chores , most of the time parents offer pocket money which is a good idea but you can also offer a new toy , an outing at the end of the week , a special dinner , etc. if your children do n't do their chores or forget about them then they wo n't receive their reward . if your kids are n't accustomed to doing chores it might take them a bit of getting used to , but be patient .
