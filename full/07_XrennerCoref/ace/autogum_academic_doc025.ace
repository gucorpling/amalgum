Reid et al showed the induction of type III IFNs in pDCs upon BVDV infection , and type III IFNs contributed to suppression of cellular immune response during BVDV infection . Cai et al shows that CSFV induced the expression of type III IFNs in PK-15 cells , but with a limited level of increase , suggesting that CSFV might have a strategy to suppress expression of type III IFNs .

We also found limited up-regulation of type III IFNs transcription upon wtCSFV infection in IPEC-J2 cells , though the transcription level peaked at 24 hpi and decreased thereafter , which is different from the results shown by Cai et al that the mRNA level of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ3 induced by wtCSFV peaked at 36 and 48 hpi , respectively .

We found that the ∆Npro mutant induced significantly higher transcription of IFNs in IPEC-J2 cells from 24 to 48 hpi than its parental strain , suggesting that the Npro protein might be antagonistic to expression of type III IFNs .

Overexpression of IRF1 led to a significant increase of transcription of all IFN-λs and IFN-λ3 promoter activity , while gene silencing showed opposite effects , indicating that IRF1 positively regulates expression of type III IFNs .

Because CSFV Npro has been found to subvert the type I IFN response , we speculated if Npro might have similar effect on type III IFNs .

These results demonstrate that CSFV employs its Npro to inhibit type III IFNs expression probably by targeting the regulatory elements involved in transcription of IFN-λs .
