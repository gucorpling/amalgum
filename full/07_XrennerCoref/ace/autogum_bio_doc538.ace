Spandounes says the name of the king who sheltered George Kantakouzene and gave him his daughter in marriage was named " Gurguiabei " , which has been interpreted as a king of Georgia ( and either George VIII or Constantine II ) , or " Guria Bey " , ruler of Guria . [ 4 ]

The historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles contradicts Spandounes , writing that after being " summoned to his bedchamber " , Anna was married to Zagan Pasha ; however , when he learned Zagan attempted to force her to become a Muslim , Mehmet separated them . [ 5 ]

This birth year would also have required that David 's first wife Maria , whom he had married either in 1426 or 1429 , die very quickly afterwards in order for Helena to have still been young enough to be available for marriage . [ 10 ]

Ganchou believes that Spandounes ( who was a descendant of the Kantakouzenos ) was aware that a member of the house had married an emperor of Trebizond , but that he had not known her name , nor that of the emperor .

Although Helena presumably was with him , Donald Nicol mentions a source which states David had sent her to refuge with the Georgian prince Mamia of Guria prior to Mehmed 's arrival before the walls of Trebizond . [ 7 ]

It may be that Spandounes had assumed that the emperor in question was the final ruler of the kingdom and then , given that the name Helena appears frequently among the Kantakouzenos , assigned it to the unnamed wife .

A local tradition connects Anna to a village south of Trabizon called " Lady Village " , where in 1870 an inscription bearing Anna 's name was seen in the village church dedicated to the Archangels . [ 6 ]

It is unclear which of David 's children were also hers ; his five children — three boys and two daughters — have been attributed variously to Helena or David 's first wife Maria of Gothia by various genealogies .

The historian Thierry Ganchou advanced the theory that Helena had not actually existed , being instead the result of the confusion between David 's mother Theodora Kantakouzene and his wife Maria of Gothia by the historian Theodore Spandounes .

Ganchou refers to the historical writings of Angelo Massarelli , the Papal Secretary to the Council of Trent , [ 9 ] [ lower-alpha 1 ] which state that Theodora was the daughter of Theodore Kantakouzenos .

Spandounes states they were sent as a present to Sultan Uzun Hassan of the Aq Qoyunlu , where George was converted to Islam , but he eventually escaped and abjured to Christianity . [ 3 ]

Ganchou then concludes that since there is no known death date for Maria of Gothia , it may have been her who had outlived David and performed the famous burial . [ 10 ]

This identification is also reinforced by the historian George Sphrantzes , who refers to Theodora 's other son John IV as a cousin to Mara Branković , herself a granddaughter of Theodore .

Donald Nicol has argued that Helena was the sister of George Palaiologos Kantakouzenos , and thus the granddaughter of Matthew Kantakouzenos and possibly the daughter of Theodore Kantakouzenos . [ 1 ]

Given that the only contemporary source which mentions Helena is Spandounes , Ganchou posits that these discrepancies can be explained by the fact that Spandounes had unintentionally invented her .

In addition to this , given that Theodore had died in 1410 , Helena would have been at least fifty years old at the birth of her youngest child .

However , as Theodore is also commonly identified as the father of Helena , this would result in the extremely unlikely scenario where Helena had married her own nephew .
