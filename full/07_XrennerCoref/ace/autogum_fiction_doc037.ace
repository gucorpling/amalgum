But I still hankered after the forest and the hunting-lodge , and when my little maid told me that I could , by walking ten miles or so through the forest , hit the railway at a roadside station , I decided to send my luggage direct to the address which Johann had given , take my walk , and follow to Strelsau myself .

It was an ideal residence : when “ Black Michael ” desired company , he could dwell in his chateau ; if a fit of misanthropy seized him , he had merely to cross the bridge and draw it up after him ( it ran on rollers ) , and nothing short of a regiment and a train of artillery could fetch him out .

Behind it stood another portion of the original castle , and behind that again , and separated from it by a deep and broad moat , which ran all round the old buildings , was a handsome modern chateau , erected by the last king , and now forming the country residence of the Duke of Strelsau .

The idea seemed whimsical enough for a dream : by the sacrifice of my heavy moustache and carefully pointed imperial , I was to be transformed into a monarch ! I was about to kiss the princess again , when I arrived ( very reluctantly ) at the conclusion that I was awake .

I was not so unreasonable as to be prejudiced against the duke ’s keeper because he disliked my complexion ; and if I had been , his most civil and obliging conduct ( as it seemed to me to be ) next morning would have disarmed me .
