We simply based this study of tourism and flamenco on the definition of cultural tourism by Richards and Munsters : “ All movements of persons to specific cultural attractions , such as heritage sites , artistic and cultural manifestations , arts and drama outside their normal place of residence ” .

Additionally , in an era where the internet allows immediate worldwide access to music and dance , the offer of live music emotion is an important resource for managers of tourist heritage , as well as for private promoters of festivals , performances , hotels , etc. .

Hence , certain destinations are unequivocally associated with popular music and dance ( e. g. , Cuba with salsa , Buenos Aires with tango , Bali with Balinese dance , and Rio de Janeiro with samba ) .

The second is assigning responsibility for its protection to local , regional , or national authorities , following political criteria and not the needs of artists and promoting culture from marketing criteria instead of its intrinsic growth .

However , unlike other cultural assets , music and dance are not mere elements of contemplation but are first-level resources that arouse emotions , allowing the tourist to actively and inclusively experience the local culture .

The debate of authenticity has also been addressed from the perspective of the artists and researchers who report that economic dependence by local artists on tourism provokes a loss of the art ’s essence .

As noted in Point ( d ) , music and dance , in their classical or contemporary form in popular folklore , are elements available for tourists as fundamental elements of the local heritage .

This issue takes on more weight as folklore represents the patrimony and cultural heritage of a people where idiosyncratic historical , religious , and social elements of the culture are arcane to foreigners .

Moreover , it is obvious that offering an artistic style geared toward the uninitiated perverts its natural evolution , resulting in a less “ pure ” style driven by marketing .

Hence , the degree of emotional implication , understanding of the event , and appreciation of the product will vary greatly as a function of the tourist type .

There are many definitions of cultural tourism , yet a review of the many studies defining it and its significance is not the objective of this paper .

The ability of the visitor to distinguish the authentic from the adulterated product designed specifically for the unwitting depends basically on the motivation leading to attendance .

Accidental Musical Tourist : motivation is not cultural and event attendance , often organized by a tour operator , takes place in hotels or restaurants .

Broadening this definition , the European Centre for Traditional and Regional Cultures ( ECTARC ) offers eight potential focal points of cultural tourism :

Casual Musical Tourist : motivated in the broad sense , open to music and dance but lacking information or prior knowledge of events .

This leads to suspicion as to the product ’s authenticity , and to what degree the performance is adulterated and geared toward tourism .

A broad debate , therefore , ensues regarding the authenticity of the tourist offerings and their representativeness of the local musical culture .

Furthermore , initiatives of preservation , such as that of UNESCO declaring the dance Intangible Cultural Heritage , involve two serious dangers .

Tourists will , therefore , hardly be able to feel emotions when partaking something for which they are not prepared .
