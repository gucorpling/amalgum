So [ ... ] we 've got to accept that we 're not going to get the recognition publicly probably that we may or may not deserve , and we more look towards our peers , whether they 're able bodied or disabled , and if they respect us , if the best able bodied skiers in the world respect what we are doing , and think that we are doing it bloody well , then we can hold our head high and feel really good .

There 's always challenges , because you 've got different classes , and varied conditions , so they try and adapt the times to fit , but it 'll never be something that can be always right , because we 've got a sport that 's got different conditions , and different locations , as opposed to a swimming pool , where you know you 've got fifty metres .

From an Australian perspective , not necessarily the public will be aware of that but I think from an international perspective , the skiing has moved into a more professional area , which is good , and I think that it will be the best thing for the sport moving forward .

So that obviously makes us all feel like we 're doing something that while the recognition might not be there from the public , that we feel as though we are doing a really competitive and really difficult sport , and doing it to a really high level .

I have a life away from skiing with what I 'm doing at the university and I 'm here because I really love to do it , and I love to compete , but I 'm not overly fussed about the public recognition of it all .

I think a few of us , well Cam and I and I think Mitch is along the same lines , is that we 're not here for a career as an athlete . so I know I have n't actively a lot of sponsorships .

But with a hundred of ... that 's why I 'm a level below world cup for able-bodied skiers , and skiing on the same hill , and running pretty comparable times , and getting a lot of comments from coaches and athletes there .

And last week we had pretty much the same races as the able-bodied had the week before on the same hills , and what they ski on next week , and we follow on that , so we do n't have to start .

So we 're probably , while its still very small , it 's a lot less than the summer guys , even the summer Paralympics guys , were are more visible than the Australian alpine team .

So that 's something that 'll always be a challenge , but in saying that , it has raised the bar , in terms of the standard of skiing , which is good .

You guys have no visibility , is that something that you guys sit there going " we should have the same sponsorship as the great Australian skiers " ?

The able bodied alpine team is pretty average and has been for a few years now , since a couple of guys retired after Vancouver .
