Based on whole-genome and exome analyses , chromatin loci with higher mutation levels can be characterized as ( I ) gene loci that are not highly expressed , ( II ) chromosome regions replicating in late S phase , ( III ) heterochromatic loci , and ( IV ) loci with closed chromatin that is not sensitive to DNase I. Mutation rates differ by severalfold between high- and low-mutation loci .

However , this association between mutation rate and cancer risk may be unrelated to cell division frequency and resultant changes in cell number , as aptly pointed out by Peto ’s paradox : cancer incidence does not appear to correlate with the number of cells in an organism at the species level .

Based on a recent study , such replicative mutations can be separated into two types : those induced as random errors during canonical replication , and those induced in association with replication-stress-associated DSBs that accumulate in association with genomic destabilization .

Consequently , the DSBs are often erroneously ligated by non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) with topologically incorrect broken ends , resulting in a background that causes CIN-associated chromosomal alterations such as chromosomal translocations , deletions , and rearrangements .

CIN often occurs when such DSBs are not effectively repaired by HR , that is , when DSBs arising during replication are carried over into the following G1 phase at a time when HR is not functional .

Errors caused by those polymerases are primarily repaired by their proofreading system ( Table 1 ) , and the remaining errors are targeted by the mismatch repair ( MMR ) system .

Although the reasons for DSB accumulation are not clear , they are likely to include a reduction in histone H2AX , which mediates repair-factor recruitment and is required for genome stability .

Although the source of these differences remains unclear , the phenomenon might be associated with genomic instability , as heterochromatic loci are often subjected to replication stress and chromosomal rearrangements .

Thus , the higher mutation rates are probably due to DNA synthesis performed by these polymerases , which lack proofreading activity , and the errors probably occur during translesion synthesis .

Deficiencies in MMR and proofreading performed by polymerase ε are associated with hypermutation and cancer predisposition ; thus , the mutation rate is strongly associated with cancer risk .

The mechanisms responsible for mutations in this context are not clear , probably because of the presence of repair systems and other related polymerases ( Table 1 ) .

Most cancers develop genomic instability due to abnormalities in DSB repair ; paradoxically , however , most lack background mutations in DNA repair systems .

Most cancer cells develop one of two forms of genomic instability : chromosomal instability ( CIN ) or microsatellite instability ( MSI ) .

Thus , both CIN and MSI are triggered by replication-stress-associated DSBs and arise due to abnormalities in the repair of these lesions .
