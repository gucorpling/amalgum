The goal of the PDN design is to achieve the input impedance seen by the power pins of the active devices ( integrated circuits , IC , such as FPGA , DSP etc. ) below the target impedance ; with the latter being the ratio between the maximum noise on the DC supply voltage that can be tolerated by the active circuits , Î” Vn , and the current Iin drawn from the PDN by the transmitting devices .

In this scenario of miniaturized devices , the integrity of the digital signals ( Signal Integrity , SI ) is impaired by the quality ( or even , in this case , integrity ) of the electric power ( Power Integrity , PI ) associated with/given by the power/ground supply voltage at board level .
