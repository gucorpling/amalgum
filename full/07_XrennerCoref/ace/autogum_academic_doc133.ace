Result visualization via the tourism matching curve makes it possible to identify nodes that have imbalanced tourism and traffic resources , and provides direct information about the node importance and corresponding scale , which can help decision makers determine whether adjustment of the node is urgently required and how large the project can be .

It is notable that the slope change of the curve could evaluate the equilibrium of allocations of the network , and that the boundaries of two indicators , i. e. , and , are calculated in terms of the results of the upper layer and are used as evaluation criteria .

This comprehensive benefit-oriented model not only paves the way to utilize the importance degree of nodes to quantify the long-neglected radiation effect of the tourism economy , but also has a more concise format , and the involved factors are more relevant compared with other models .
