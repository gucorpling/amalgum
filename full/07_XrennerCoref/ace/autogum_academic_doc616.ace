A lack of knowledge on antibiotic use in the general public has been reported , with more than half of them who thought that antibiotics are useful in treating viral infections , and about one half of them would stop taking antibiotics when they felt better .

Nursing homes or long term care facilities in the United States and Australia were found to be a reservoir for AMR pathogens due to excessive , inappropriate and prolonged broad-spectrum antimicrobial use , inadequate infection control and increased risk of pathogen colonization .

Healthcare providers face challenges in adequately diagnosing and managing infections in this vulnerable population because of the altered drug metabolism in this particular group , the common occurrence of drug – drug interactions due to polypharmacy and lower medication adherence .

Those who had poor knowledge of antibiotic use were associated with a higher probability of antibiotic self-medication and practices of using leftover antibiotics , sharing antibiotics , keeping antibiotics for future use and stopping antibiotics when symptoms disappear .

Due to the paucity of information in this area , we conducted a study among the older adult population in Malaysia to assess their knowledge on antibiotic use and resistance and their expectations towards the need for antibiotics .
