Via this model , the value of RSSI , ( in dBm ) can be theoretically expressed as follows : ( 1 ) where d ( in m ) is the distance between transmitter ( anchor node ) and receiver ( target node ) , is the free space reference distance , typically 1 m , is the path-loss exponent coefficient , and is the RSSI value when the transmitter and the receiver are 1 m apart , which in this case is found to be dBm .
