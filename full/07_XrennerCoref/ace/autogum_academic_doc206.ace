Although spectral entropy is well-defined and can be computed efficiently by Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) , it is difficult to relate spectral entropy with other interpretable properties of interest of original signal , especially when taking no account of the overwhelming endorsement from its counterpart ( information entropy ) , which is the foundational concept in information theory which quantifies the uncertainty .

To sum up , we want to develop a metric to characterize the aforementioned structural irregularities of the power spectra , that is , how the frequency components of different intensities in a spectrum close to each other instead of what is captured in spectral entropy , which is how the intensities of frequency components are distributed no matter their locations in frequency domain .

Therefore , if we use power estimations on the frequency grid as proxies of the intensities of activities corresponding to those frequencies , it seems reasonable to infer that the energy distributed on neighboring rather than remote frequency grids is more likely caused by the very same function .

Fourier transform ( FT ) bridges signals in original space ( time domain ) with their representations in dual space ( frequency domain ) by decomposing a signal satisfying some weak constraints into infinitely many periodic components , which has numerous applications in signal processing .

Therefore , it is unreasonable for well-designed artificial systems or natural systems that have gone through long-term evolution to arrange the internal signals responsible for different functions close with each other in frequency domain within a certain time window .
