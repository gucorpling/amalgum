In the manuscript : Influence of Chip Materials on Charge Generation in Flowing Solution in Nanobiosensors , Y.D. Ivanov and coworkers demonstrate that the presence of an AFM chip ( made of mica and graphite ) near the nozzle of the injector supplying an analyte solution into the measuring cell of an AFM-based fishing system ( used for the registration of low-abundant proteins in the temperature range corresponding to the physiological temperature of 35 °C ) causes an increase in charge generation upon the injection of the solution .
