Part of the other reason for the delay was that we had to learn how to handle the collector — it would cost $200M to replace it if something happened to it , so we had to develop procedures to deal with it , and add several new safety features to the Cosmic Dust Lab .

The good news is that they are pretty clean — there is very little of the dust that you see on our training images — these were deliberately left out in the lab to collect dust so that we could give people experience with the worst case we could think of .

Most missions rather do things quite differently ... you have to build an instrument to make a measurement and that instrument design gets locked in several years before launch practically guaranteeing that it will be obsolete by the time you launch .

The test will look very similar to the training images that you can look at now . But. . there will of course be no annotation to tell you where the tracks are !

In learning how to do the scanning of the actual flight aerogel , we uncovered a couple of bugs in our scanning software — which forced us to go back and rescan .

The IS project has no such deadline , so at times we had to delay the IS ( interstellar , sorry ) in order to focus on the cometary work .

Further , some instruments ( e. g. , synchrotrons ) are the size of shopping malls — you do n't have a hope of flying these in space .

Finally , we 're distracted because we also have many responsibilities for the cometary analysis , which has a deadline of August 15 for finishing analysis .

Some of it has to do with learning how to deal with the aerogel collectors , which are rougher and more fractured than we expected .

AND we have to preserve some of these dust particles for our grandchildren to analyze with their hyper-quark-gluon plasma microscopes ( or whatever ) !
