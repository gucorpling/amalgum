My YouTube channel has videos of most of the guns I 've built , but with very little textual description . [ YouTube ] and my MOCpages homepage has lots of information on all the guns I 've built ; they did n't all end up on YouTube . [ At MOCpages ] there 's descriptive text and a set of pictures for each one .

: Well I ca n't remember a time when I have n't been building with [ LEGOs ] ... as to being ' serious ' about it ( if I have n't always been ) , the major turning points would probably be when , at age thirteen I posted my first gun online .

They 'd buy me LEGO for birthdays and Christmas and so on , and I always enjoyed showing them the latest thing I 'd built — of course I would n't be anywhere near where I am now without their support , so they must be okay with it !

This may be due to the fact that most of my work was in replicating existing guns — which , of course , is n't quite the same as being inspired by someone and then designing something else from scratch .
