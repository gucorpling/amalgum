For example , Zuurbier et al. estimated cyclists inhale twice as much ultra fine particle ( UFP counts ) and PM2.5 ( mass ) per unit time as car and bus occupants because of their much higher minute ventilation , even though the measured UFP and PM concentrations were higher inside the vehicles .

Specifically , we develop a machine learning model for identifying periods of bicycling activity using passively collected data from the RTI MicroPEM wearable exposure monitor , a lightweight device capable of continuously sampling both particulate matter concentration and the wearer ’s acceleration .

Pedestrians and joggers , in addition to cyclists , receive higher potential inhaled doses of traffic related pollutants , but cyclists are the preferred cohort because the exposure and health assessment equipment is less burdensome for cyclists to carry .

Since urban cyclists undertake strenuous exercise in close proximity to traffic , their potential dose is likely to be higher than many other urban residents , due both to their increased respiration rates and their proximity to traffic sources .

In terms of potential exposures , recent studies in major North American cities have found average exposures along bike routes to be higher than comparable fixed sidewalk stations and significant associations between higher PM2.5 emissions and bicycling volume .

While many countries acknowledge this danger and have enacted air pollution prevention laws , developing specific rules and regulations to implement these laws can be challenging when the relationships between pollutant exposure and health effects are underspecified .

Furthermore , if personal exposure data is combined with respiration data , it becomes possible to estimate potential inhaled dose , a much higher fidelity measure for mapping the exposure response than using device concentrations alone .

According to the most recent global burden of disease/comparative risk assessment , exposure to air pollution causes over 6.8 million premature deaths per year , with roughly equal contributions from ambient and household air pollution .

To help address concerns with air pollution exposure assessment studies based on fixed , centrally located sensor data , researchers have proposed using wearable monitors to more accurately capture personalized pollutant exposures .

Unlike stationary sensors , personal monitors can better capture exposures actually experienced by the wearers and provides the spatial and temporal heterogeneity necessary to design interventions incorporating human behaviors and lifestyle .
