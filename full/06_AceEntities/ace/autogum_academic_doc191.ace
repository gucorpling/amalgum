Among these techniques , full-frame single-camera stereo-DIC technique using a color separation device and a color camera has been considered the most practical one , since it can realize full-frame measurements without any loss of spatial resolution of the camera , while maintaining the prominent advantages of other single-camera stereo-DIC techniques such as cost-effectiveness , compactness , and the avoidance of the complicated camera synchronization .

As a matter of fact , stereo-DIC has been widely accepted as the most powerful tool in the experimental mechanics community , and it offers several prominent advantages over competing interferometric optical techniques ( e. g. , electronic speckle pattern interferometry and Moir√© interferometry ) , such as being easy-to-use , a robustness against ambient vibrations , and a wide range of applicability .
