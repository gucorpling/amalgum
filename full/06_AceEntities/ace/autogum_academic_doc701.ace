Analysing the trends of further research it seems useful to verify how much the defined features distinguishing sustainable tourism from the higher level space , enable its measurement or description in the sphere of adopted research aspects , depending on the assumed methodological approach , i. e. , quantitative , qualitative or mixed .

This results from the fact that both tourists , as well as the local community , can have diverse expectations , but they also bear consequences ( positive and negative ) in terms of the broadly perceived natural , socio-cultural and economic environment .

Starting deliberations concerning the issues of the possibility of scientific recognition , especially research methods for identification and explanation of the problem of sustainable tourism , its nature and possibility of its development and evaluation is an important aspect in the study .

The case study adopts the initial ontological assumption that shows that studied aspects of sustainable tourism should be approached as a part of a higher level space ( geographical , socio-economic and cultural ) , rather than as a separate entity .

This represents taking into account the ontological aspect ( that inquires whether the analysis of existence should precede the analysis of recognition ) , as well as epistemological one ( comprising the problem of appropriate path of recognition ) .

On the other hand , within the local community one can distinguish tourist entrepreneurs , workers , employers hired for tourist services , representatives of public administration , representatives of social organisations associated with tourism development among others .

According to Spencer â€™s views , development , on the one hand , consists in a growing diversification of phenomena , and on the other hand in their growing integration , ordering and balancing .

Conducting tourism activity has a very complex nature because it takes place both in geographical space ( physical and anthropogenic ) , as well as in economic , social and cultural space .

The concept of triangulation is borrowed from navigational and land surveying techniques that determine a single point in space with the convergence of measurements taken from two other distinct points " .

The purpose of triangulation of research methods may be particularly useful to increase the credibility and validity of the results and gives a more detailed and balanced picture of the situation .

As a result , subgroups of diverse socio-demographic features , but also different reasons for travelling and related different expectations or travel frequency can be indicated within the group of tourists .

Consequently , this causes quantitative research to occur together with qualitative while complementing each other , or possibly it precedes qualitative research while enabling primary recognition of the formulated problem .

This multi-faceted nature of the phenomena occurring in tourism raises the need to approach tourist activity as conducted in the space linking both material and non-material aspects .
