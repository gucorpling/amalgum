The archival bond first arises when a record is set aside and thereby connected to another in the course of action , but is incremental , because , as the connective tissue that joins a record to those surrounding it , it is in continuing formation and growth until the aggregation in which the record belongs is no longer subject to expansion , that is , until the activity producing such aggregation is completed ” .

The presentation of CPT in Part 3 is highly abstract and requires the addition of more specific classes and properties , with greater precision , to be applicable in practice ; however , between articulation and application , the critical issue that needs to be addressed is whether CPT can support empirical testing and verification .

This possibility becomes compelling in light of the fundamental concept of archival science . “ At the core of archival science is the concept of the archival bond , that is , the network of relationships that each record has with the records belonging in the same aggregation .

Furthermore , the Archival Units used in many activities may include some that are not kept as records by any Participant ; for example , Human Agents may have frequent recourse to data available on the Internet and not downloaded to any local store .

Obviously it deviates from Cencetti ’s original formulation where the archival bond arises from the use of documents by the same Human Agent in the same Activity , thus prior to and independently of being set aside as a record .

By locating a record in a single position in a hierarchical classification , filing systems constrain the expression of the relationships of a document to other records and to the action or actions in which it was used .

Strictly speaking , in conformance with graph theory , an Archival Unit is itself a graph whose nodes are an Item Vestige and the Relationships it has with other Item Vestiges used in the same Activity .

Additionally , the application of the concept of archival bond has assumed that all the relationships that arise in use are embodied in the filing system in which the records are kept .
