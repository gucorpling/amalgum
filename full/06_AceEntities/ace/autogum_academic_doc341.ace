As can be seen , there is a considerable difference between the general risk for Spain ( riskSpain ) and the risk when taking into account the history of attacks , that is , the memory of the system related to how old the attacks are by applying equation 5 ( riskSpainWithMemory ) .

Here , 126 threats were analyzed , which came from sources of information with a high level of confidence , and therefore , all of them were influenced by the confidence assigned to that source .

As can be observed , the risk with memory tends to follow the trend of the instantaneous , but if the variations are very fast , it tends to represent the average of these .

Then , the system was also tested with threats from more than one source of information , some with a high degree of confidence and others with a very low level .

Each threat event has been compounded by its geographic location , IP , a timestamp , severity index , the event confidence , name of the detected threat , etc.

The strongest peaks of memory risk are due to the fact that certain measurements are composed of a large number of threats and , therefore , great representativeness .

First , the system has been tested with a large number of incoming threats , being capable of analyzing each one in an average time of 0.01 s.

In addition , the risk within an AC , i. e. , Andalusia , is calculated based on 48 threats , both with and without memory .

In order to simplify the visualization of the data produced by the system , a graphical interface was implemented by using Java â€™s library JFreeChart .

If this situation were maintained over time , the risk with memory would end up converging with the instantaneous risk .
