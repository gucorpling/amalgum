I literally worked 6 consecutive 6 hour days ( going solely by " Drive Time " , bathroom breaks bring this closer to 7 hours ) I do n't know about you but , that 's about all I can handle both physically and mentally ( sitting for 6 hours a day and dealing with suicidal pedestrians and people who should n't even have a drivers license , if youre not from here , come to SF and drive around for a few hours , you will be done , guaranteed ) . $ 17 in the SF Bay area is basically minimum wage , and this week I 'm not even making that .

I just viewed this video from only Jan 2017 and back then apparently the ride count requirement was only 65 rides for NO RENTAL FEE , not 85 rides for $ 100 off of the $ 200 rental fee but 65 rides for NO RENTAL FEE with only 30 required for the $ 100 rental fee . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMgeghIj4bM I see " Drive for Lyft " ads willy nilly on craigslist , and just as with the amazon.com warehouse job that similarly had them willy nilly on craigslist ( and ended up being grueling slave labor ) this job is basically just that , slave labor .

( having to go Offline to avoid getting pinged and then peeing in your pants every 1.5 hours or more to then spend 5-10 minutes finding somewhere to urinate and not getting paid for it makes a 5 hour drive time day into actually working 6-6.5 hours which makes the proposition that much more absurd , am I down to $ 9 an hour in the SF Bay area now ? Remember , real jobs you can take a bathroom break on the clock ) .

I just made $ 86 working 5 hours last night between 4 and 9 PM , assuming I get the reduced rental rate that 's $ 15 out of that going towards the rental ( or $ 30 a day , which it may be at this rate ) , and at 22-25 mpg in the city that 's around 3-4 gallons of gas ( 2018 Nissan Sentra ) or around $ 15 towards gas leaving me with maybe $ 55 for 5 hours ?

This is my second week into this , the first week I did a little better , earning $ 640 after the rental deduction ( $ 112 , a pro-rated amount after meeting the pro-rated 85 ride count bonus ) and 34-35 hours of drive time , which after fuel cost ( $ 100 ) made for $ 17 an hour ( not counting bathroom breaks , which probably bring this down closer to $ 15 ) .

7 hour day for $ 97 and I burned through 4 gallons of gas making for $ 97 - $ 16 / 6 hours ( because our breaks , including having to use the bathroom , is " off the clock " otherwise it would be $ 80 / 7 = $ 11.50 an hour ) = $ 13 an hour risking life , limb or an expensive accident on my record ?

They do n't have to spend 45 minutes off of the clock cleaning up puke parked on the side of the road near a public park , they do n't have to nearly get a heart attack from every near miss accident nor the health consequences of prolonged sitting , nor dealing with drunks and their belligerence , so why is their cut nearly 50 % ?

I made 20 rides today for a whopping total of $ 97.23 an although the app is only reporting 4.5 hours of drive time I was actually out closer to 7 hours , minus maybe 1 hour for a lunch break , bathroom breaks , and a stop at the gas station .

You could dial back your cut percentage from 45 % to say maybe 40-42 % and it would be doable for many of us ( taking us from $ 17 to $ 20 on good weeks and $ 12 to $ 15 on days like my yesterday ) .
