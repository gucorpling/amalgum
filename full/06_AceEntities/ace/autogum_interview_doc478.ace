What I noticed was when I looked over the statistics of basketball over the time you 've been playing , the scores have been going up .

2,3 person|6,7 person|9,13 abstract|12,13 abstract|14,16 time|16,17 person|21,23 abstract

I think that 's partly to do with that we changed to a size six ball , so we went to a women 's ball .

I think that helped with our statistics , ' cause it 's easier for women to handle the ball and stuff like that .
