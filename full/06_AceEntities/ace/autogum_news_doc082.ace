As professor and head of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at UGA ( and one of the leaders of the research ) Stephen Hajduk explained , " Humans have evolved TLF-1 as a highly specific toxin against African trypanosomes by tricking the parasite into taking up this HDL because it resembles a nutrient the parasite needs for survival .

But T. b. gambiense has evolved a counter measure to these human ' Trojan horses ' simply by barring the door and not allowing TLF-1 to enter the cell , effectively blocking human innate immunity and leading to infection and ultimately disease .

However , the main effect of these measures being a decrease in spreading of the parasite and not in decrease of the death rate , the researchers decided to tackle the puzzle .

It was known that one of the parasites , T. b. rhodensiense , has evolved an inhibitor of the toxic chemical , called Serum Resistance Associated ( SRA ) protein .

Research teams from the universities of Georgia and Glasgow discovered the mechanism the Trypanosome parasite evolved for " sleeping sickness " disease to circumvent the human immune system .

Stephen Hajduk commented , " We believe this research represents a paradigm shift and causes us to think more broadly about how pathogens avoid host defense mechanisms .

The receptor is more strict , causing a lower nutrient intake as well , but it suffices , and the parasite defends against the human immune system .

As WHO reported , subsequent recent introduction of population screening in rural areas and distribution of more effective drugs had potentially reduced the number of death incidents .

Of the several known parasite species , the two that can infect humans were chosen to study , called Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense .

However the other one , T. b. gambiense , was responsible for over 95 % of human deaths , and it had been previously unknown why .

Based on the results of the research , humans could possibly develop a defense mechanism to keep the parasites from evading the human defense system .

Researchers knew that the Trypanosoma attacks typically are repelled by an HDL , more specifically trypanosome lytic factor-1 ( TLF-1 ) .
