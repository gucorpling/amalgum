It is uncertain how often it has erupted since , and how large the eruptions were , but nothing has been big enough to cause serious problems scores of kilometers away .

A group of volcanologists from the UK and USA have traveled to North Korea to assist them with conducting scientific investigations and installing equipment near the volcano Mount Paektu .

Indeed , I could imagine that , behind the scenes , the Chinese pushed North Korea toward this cooperation , as this is somewhat unusual for NK .

The North Korean government is aware of its technological backwardness , and they often dangle concessions to other states in exchange for tech transfers like this .
