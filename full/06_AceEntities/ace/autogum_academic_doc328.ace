In the naval sector , this impact is mostly through big data gathering and analysis , as well as real-time monitoring ( temperatures , emissions , etc. ) , and it brings along with automation , another growing field , fundamental changes such as autonomous shipping .

Although ships are thought to be some of the biggest polluters , the maritime transport of goods is a relatively clean form of transportation , per kilogram of material , and is therefore given an increasing weight over air and road trade and transport .
