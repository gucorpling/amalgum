Although this case series has demonstrated that very high doses of radiotherapy may not provide additional short-term symptomatic benefit , longer courses of radiotherapy may be considered in patients with a good performance status and prognosis in an attempt to provide a longer period of symptomatic benefit without the need for retreatment .

To gain a better understanding of the most appropriate dose and fractionation schedules for different sarcoma subtypes large volume , multicentre , prospective data collections is required using a small number of different dose and fractionation schedules , ideally those outlined by the Royal College of Radiologists ( Table 5 ) .

This study demonstrates that selected patients with advanced sarcoma can benefit from palliative radiotherapy provided their prognosis is long enough for the benefits from radiotherapy , in terms of symptomatic improvement , to outweigh the inconvenience of undergoing radiotherapy and the associated side effects that they may suffer .

There is little published literature considering the role of palliative radiotherapy in metastatic sarcoma , although it is recommended as a treatment option for palliation by both the UK bone and soft tissue sarcoma guidelines and the European Society of Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) guidelines .

The aim of this review , however , was to confirm that radiotherapy does have a role in the palliation of advanced sarcomas and to guide future prospective studies to gain more accurate evidence of the use of palliative radiotherapy in this setting .

A meta-analysis has shown that when treating bone metastases from a number of different primary tumour sites and histology ’s , there appears to be little short-term symptomatic benefit in a fractionated course of radiotherapy , compared to a single fraction .

A previously published case series of 17 patients who received palliative radiotherapy for sarcoma using 39 Gy in 13 fractions over two and a half weeks demonstrated this was well tolerated and provided high rates of durable pain control .

Beyond this point the response is maintained but does not appear to increase further , suggesting very high doses of palliative radiotherapy may not be necessary to achieve a good symptomatic response in this patient group .

Interpretation of this data is extremely limited because of the heterogeneity of the patient population with multiple different histological subtypes and the small numbers of patients treated with each dose and fractionation schedule .

As sarcomas are felt to be intrinsically radio-resistant , it can be hypothesized that a single fraction of palliative radiotherapy may not be sufficient to offer adequate symptomatic benefit .
