Properties such as extracellular analyte consumption , product secretion and cell-cell interactions are not readily detectable with flow cytometry . Screening for ‘ non-cellular ’ phenotypes necessitates the compartmentalization of single cells or an alternative expression system to maintain the linkage between the phenotype that the selection acts on and the genotype in which the evolutionary information is encoded .
