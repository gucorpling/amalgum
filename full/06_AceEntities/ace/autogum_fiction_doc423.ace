And there was Big Medicine whistling until he was purple , while the herder , with a single gesture , held the dog motionless , though a dozen sheep broke back from the band and climbed a slope so steep that Big Medicine was compelled to go after them afoot , and turn them with stones and profane objurgations .

With the sun shining comfortably upon his back , and with a cigarette between his lips , Andy sat upon his horse and watched in silent glee while the irate Happy Family scurried here and there behind the band , swinging their ropes down upon the woolly backs , and searching their vocabularies for new and terrible epithets .

There was Slim , for instance , unwillingly careening down hill toward home , because , in his zeal to slap an old ewe smartly with his rope , he drove her unexpectedly under his horse , and so created a momentary panic that came near standing both horse and rider upon their heads .

Not all herders , let it be said in passing , take unto themselves the mental attributes of their sheep ; there are those who believe that a bold front is better than weak compliance , and who will back that belief by a very bold front indeed .

By the time they panted up the last rock-strewn slope of the bluff , and sent the vanguard of the invaders under the fence , Andy 's mood was complacent in the extreme , and his smile offensively wide .

The herders stared at Andy curiously when he swung in behind the tail-end of the band and kept pace with their slow moving , but they did not speak beyond shouting an occasional command to their dogs .
