In the presented research , it was found that most studies on urban resilience consider buildings , infrastructure and social community , while there is a significant lack of research on the impact of urban open space on urban resilience .

The strategy of urban resilience enhancement has an important impact on urban landscape configuration , city layout , engineering , hydro-engineering , urban economy , agriculture , mobility , and especially emergency management of urban systems .

Considering this , for further research it is planned to work on the realization of the proposed draft model , which would allow seismic resilience assessment by applying algorithms of the graph theory .

To achieve the goal of a resilient system , the qualitative and well-distributed open space can make a significant contribution to emergency response and city recovery .

These characteristics are the qualitative and quantitative properties of resilient open spaces which should be evaluated for the holistic resilience assessment of an urban system .

On the other hand , not only green space , but also built-up and undeveloped open space have an important role for urban seismic resilience .

Moreover , to contribute to resilience enhancement different simulations of the urban system recovery scenarios based on the potential of open space would be performed .

On the contrary , a topic on the importance of open space for urban seismic resilience is rare in the existing scientific literature .

Therefore , coping with climate change requires constant adaptation , while seismic impact reduction addresses a quick response and effective recovery strategies .

Beside the general resilience , the conceptual evaluation model allows the identification of critical points and bottlenecks in the system .
