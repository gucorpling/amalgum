M3C carbides can be formed in the segregated region while the epsilon phase can be formed in the deficient region , which degrades the mechanical properties of weld zone . ( 3 ) Mechanical properties may show anisotropy owing to the difference in grain size in heat affected zone ( HAZ ) and weld zone , and ( 4 ) residual stresses may also lead to property degradation .

If the manganese content in the weld zone changes during welding due to the evaporation of manganese , initial phase and deformation mechanism may alter depending on stacking fault energy , which may cause inhomogeneous microstructure and local stress concentration during deformation .
