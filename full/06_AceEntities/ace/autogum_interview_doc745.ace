But I have learned since then that there are many other serious related issues , such as climate change , that need to be tackled in an inventive way using an approach that relies on ingenuity and takes in a different perspective to the problem ~ and approach that looks at the entire system and its relationships to other problems rather than looking at each problem as if it were isolated .

I am also on the board of directors of the Richmond Hill Naturalists , which gives me insight into local issues from the perspective of those working and studying natural systems ( ecosystems ) and their health and am a member of the Markham Conservation Committee as well , which gives me insight into programs that are being undertaken locally by the town .

Of course , these are likely only a small number of people , and because I do have some name recognition in this riding , however small , I believe that people who are fed up with mainstream politics will still continue to gravitate toward the Green Party .
