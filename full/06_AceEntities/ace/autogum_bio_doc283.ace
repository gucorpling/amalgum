Around 1673 , during the reign of Safavid Shah ( King ) Suleiman I , he converted from Christianity to Shia Islam , a decision which , according to his writings , was inspired by a scriptural evidence as well as a series of visions and dreams .

Though the Persian chronicles , European travelogues and correspondences between Christian missionaries reveal that many converted from Christianity to Islam during the Safavid period , they only depict instances where the converts were either forced to convert or did so out of convenience . [ 1 ]

The work also includes the " standard " biblical reference to the Paraclete of the Gospel of John , an example of inter-religious polemic often used in conversion narratives to express " proof " for Islam from the Bible . [ 4 ]

However , it appears that at the time Armani was not yet an adherent of Shia Islam , at least not initially , but had developed a Shi'ite identity through the course of his journey . [ 2 ]

According to Tiburcio , the Eterāfnāme , though written in Persian , was probably conceived as a missionary tool and for circulation among Armenian Christians " as far as the surviving evidence suggests " . [ 4 ]
