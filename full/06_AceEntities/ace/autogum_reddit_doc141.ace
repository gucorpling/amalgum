I was literally crossing my legs trying not to pee myself when I asked the librarian if I could go , she said no , told me the rule and said if asked again I would get in trouble , so I pissed in front of her and said “ oh well , I just went anyways . ”

Among a bunch of problems she had this rule that if you wanted to use the bathroom outside of recess or lunch break you ’d be given a sheet of math problems as homework .

I once had a librarian who only allowed kindergarten ’s use the restroom , if you did n’t have proof of an emergency you were n’t allowed to go .

I get why she did it but 7yr olds are not great at timing pee breaks .
