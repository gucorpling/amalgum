Among other recommendations in this report , the World Tourism Organization refers to the importance of Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) as a guide in providing a unified vision for all countries in order to achieve sustainable development ( specifically SDGs 8 , 12 , and 14 for the tourism sector ) and to affect the following changes : transform policies into the implementation of specific actions ; fulfill the need to measure the environmental impact of tourism on a regular and consistent basis ; convert the linearity of tourism production and consumption into circularity of the same ( circular economy ) ; and to address the need to add geospatial data to the planning activities of tourist destinations .

Hence , as there is relative consensus that sustainable management positively affects hotel administration , the same unanimity does not exist when analyzing the willingness to pay extra for sustainable consumption , despite acknowledging that a tourist with higher environmental awareness will be more inclined to pay a surcharge in a sustainable hotel than a tourist whose environmental awareness is lower .

To this end , the second part of this paper is devoted to carrying out a bibliographic review of the scientific works in which the willingness of tourists to pay for non-market products or services is considered , as well as to assessing the advantages and disadvantages of the methodology used in this work .

Therefore , tourism faces a global challenge of considerable size in the medium and long-term in which sustainable consumption and production patterns become a first-level strategic objective in accordance with what is stated in Sustainable Development Goal 12 ( SDG 12 ) .

Unsustainable production and consumption practices in the sector may generate not only environmental problems , but economic difficulties as well , since the competitiveness of the sector depends largely on the environmental quality of the territories in which these businesses are developed .

The first one is dedicated to performing a descriptive analysis of the extra amount that tourists are willing to pay for specific and more sustainable tourism products or services when visiting a World Heritage city â€” in this case , Caceres .

Therefore , while some empirical studies conclude that tourists are willing to pay a surcharge for staying in a sustainable hotel , other scientific studies show the contrary and indicate that a tourism consumer is usually unwilling to pay more .

As significant as these figures are , they will increase even further in the future , as estimates show that the average growth rate of tourism worldwide from now until 2030 is expected to be 3.8 % per year .

The third Section is devoted to briefly describe the case study in this paper : the Spanish city of Caceres , offering some data about supply , demand and carrying capacity from a tourism activity perspective .

Sustainable production and consumption in the field of tourism at the present time is so important that the World Tourism Organization has published a report in order to integrate sustainable consumption and production into tourism policies .

This research paper seeks to contribute to the knowledge of the degree of sustainability awareness that exists among tourists by measuring this consciousness through their willingness to pay extra for a more sustainable product or service .

In the second one , different socio-demographic factors are taken into account in order to determine their possible influence on the willingness to pay additional charges on the products and services analyzed .

In 2017 , the tourism industry represented 10 % of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the entire world , and approximately 10 % of the total number of employees .

If these forecasts are met , it will mean that more than 1.8 billion international tourists will cross the borders of the countries where they reside to enjoy tourist activities .

When analyzing the consequences of sustainable production ( supply approach ) and sustainable consumption ( demand approach ) , the scientific literature provide evidence that is not always in agreement .
