It should be noted , however , that changes in ribosomal gene expression have been reported in different plant-pathogen interactions ( e. g. , ) , and importantly , according to the ‘ ribosome filter hypothesis ’ alterations in ribosomal composition or specialized ribosomes are thought to bias incorporation of specific mRNAs to translation .

It is not known whether W-finger mutations occur as a natural resistance mechanism in plants , although in vitro translation assays demonstrated that ribosomes isolated from the FHB-resistant cultivar , Frontana , exhibit a higher tolerance to DON than those isolated from the susceptible cultivar Cassavant .

In a similar study , the same group had earlier reported that co-expression of ΔL3 together with a Pokeweed Antiviral Protein ( PAP ) in tobacco cells resulted in increased expression of the host RPL3 gene , and this was coincident with improved DON tolerance .

The authors expressed truncated yeast RPL3 ( ΔL3 ) in wheat and found that , in addition to an increase in the expression of the endogenous wheat RPL3 gene , transgenic plants displayed a reduction in FHB symptoms as well as DON accumulation .

There are many potential explanations for this up-regulation , though at this stage only speculation can be offered , and it is also unknown whether there is a direct link with this expression pattern and resistance in these genotypes .

In a transcriptomics study by Foroud et al. , DON induced higher expression of ribosomal components , but only in the resistant genotypes , which incidentally were generated through a process that provides selection pressure for trichothecene resistance .

It has also been suggested by Di et al. that expression of a truncated RPL3 from yeast could reduce DON toxicity in cereals by drawing the toxin away from the functional wild-type RPL3 .

The ribosome can resist the effect of trichothecenes if a point mutation occurs at the tryptophan ( W ) residue within the highly conserved W-finger of Ribosomal Protein L3 ( RPL3 ) .

Thus , the filter hypothesis offers the possibility that the reported DON-induced changes in ribosomal gene expression might coordinate defense-related translation rather than conferring ribosomal resistance to the toxin .
