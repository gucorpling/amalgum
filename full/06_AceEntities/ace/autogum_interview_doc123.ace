The main difficulty experimentally and theoretically is to combine all these fields simultaneously and make them work together to create a " clean " system that can test ‘ friction ’ or other theories .

Indeed , velocity dependent friction could also be used to slow down microscopic objects to the point where these objects would reach what is called the quantum ground state for their centre of mass .

: Indeed , two or more spheres would bring an additional degree of freedom to the experiments that would allow the study of the rotation rate as a function of the distance between them .

Creating these states on demand would bring quantum technology a step closer and might lead us to " couple " quantum mechanically [ macroscopic ] objects — a phenomenon more accurately termed entanglement .

One of the main drives in present quantum technology is to create what is called mesoscopic or macroscopic quantum states , that is quantum states that can be see in a microscope .

: One of the challenges in this experiment is that it brings together many different parts of physics such as vacuum science , optical micro-manipulation , thermodynamics and potentially quantum mechanics .

The other reason for the size of the sphere is that we experimentally found that smaller spheres are presently more difficult to levitate .

So it would be very interesting to fabricate a series of spheres that have same optical properties but different mechanical failure points .

One can expect that , depending on the mechanical failure property of the sphere , it would breakup sooner or later .
