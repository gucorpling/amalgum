Obesity and related disorders are widely perceived by both the public and the scientific community as a major and growing threat to global human health ; more than 2 billion people worldwide are currently overweight or obese , and obesity is associated with an increased hazard for a range of ailments , including type-2 diabetes , cardiovascular diseases and hypertension , multiple cancer types , chronic inflammatory diseases , dementia , and neurodegenerative diseases .

They express a set of beige-specific genes , such as Cited1 and Tbx1 , but also have similarities with brown adipocytes , including abundant mitochondria , multilocular lipid droplets and expression of brown-specific genes such as uncoupling protein 1 ( UCP1 ) and Cidea ; similar to brown adipocytes , they are able to dissipate energy as heat .

Induction of beige adipocytes ( i. e. , WAT browning ) can be induced by environmental or physiological stimuli ( such as cold exposure , physical activity , or thyroid hormones ) , but also pharmacologically ( for example , with PPAR agonists ) , and could prevent or combat obesity by increasing energy consumption through non-shivering thermogenesis .

In rat models of obesity , Pt reduces fat accumulation and ameliorates liver steatosis modulating lipolysis , lipogenesis , fatty acid oxidation , improves glycemic control by modulating glycolysis , gluconeogenesis , and glucose uptake , increases thermogenic markers in brown adipose tissue , and induces changes in the gut microbiota towards a healthier composition .

A nutraceutical approach could be a useful supporting tool to treat overweight people , since the use of natural compounds offers clear advantages over drug treatments in terms of adverse side effects , suitability for chronic treatments , marketability , and safety .

With the only exception of orlistat ( which decreases fat absorption by inhibiting lipases ) , most of these drugs act through the central nervous system to reduce food intake ( via reduction of appetite or enhancement of satiety ) .

Interestingly , Pt was able to induce WAT browning , leading to an increase in the transcription of beige- and brown-related genes and of UCP1 protein levels , which , however , did not achieve significance .
