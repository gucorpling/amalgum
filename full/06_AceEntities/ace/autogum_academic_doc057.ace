The lymph nodes are extremely critical in responses to pathogens or danger signals , and their major functions are to filter out deleterious substances by their unique mesh microstructure , to maintain matured immunocytes , and to initiate the antigen-specific adaptive immune response .

A variety of cancer immunotherapies , including DC-based cancer vaccines , chimeric antigen receptor-T lymphocyte therapies , immune checkpoint blockade antibody therapies , oncolytic vaccine , and cytokines therapies , have been developed to induce tumor-specific and cytotoxic T lymphocyte immune responses .

The aim of this study was to establish a natural decellularized lymph node scaffold ( dLN ) , with preserved original microstructure and ECM , and to validate the ability of the dLN to support DC proliferation and maturation in vitro .

Previous studies demonstrated that spleen-derived decellularized ECM or lymph node-associated decellularized ECM can deliver immune cells and promote the organization of lymphoid-like scaffolds ; however , whether these can induce antigen-specific immunity or the antitumor immune response is still unknown .

Thus , it is important to establish an in vitro culturing system or an in vivo DC delivery system that can more reliably induce the immune response and more potently deliver antitumor immunity .

Then , DCs are stimulated with the patient ’s tumor-associated antigen in vitro , and the antigen-stimulated DCs are injected directly back into the patient to induce the activation of T lymphocytes .

First , only a few DCs actually migrate to the lymph nodes and interact with T lymphocytes , with the result of a failure to induce antitumor immune responses .

Decellularization has emerged as a process for producing a natural extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , which preserves the intrinsic biological cues and architectural structure of the original tissue .

The lymph nodes might lose their function because of cancer , obstruction , or infection ; in such cases , surgical resection of lymph nodes is usually indicated .

When DCs mature and become activated , they will swallow the foreign substances and subsequently present the antigenic epitopes on major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) molecules .

DCs are known as professional antigen-presenting cells , responsible for swallowing tumor-associated antigens , presenting them to T lymphocytes , and inducing antigen-specific immune responses .

At the same time , DCs up-regulate the maturation receptor , release potent cytokines , and migrate into lymph nodes to induce systemic immune responses .
