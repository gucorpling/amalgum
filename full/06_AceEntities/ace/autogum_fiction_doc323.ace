As we have placed before the young ladies so many specimens of young gentlemen , and have also in the dedication of this volume given them to understand how much we reverence and admire their numerous virtues and perfections ; as we have given them such strong reasons to treat us with confidence , and to banish , in our case , all that reserve and distrust of the male sex which , as a point of general behaviour , they cannot do better than preserve and maintain — we say , as we have done all this , we feel that now , when we have arrived at the close of our task , they may naturally press upon us the inquiry , what particular description of young gentlemen we can conscientiously recommend .

THAT a case has occurred in Camberwell , in which a young lady informed her Papa that ‘ she intended to ally herself in marriage ’ with Mr. Smith of Stepney ; and that another , and a very distressing case , has occurred at Tottenham , in which a young lady not only stated her intention of allying herself in marriage with her cousin John , but , taking violent possession of her said cousin , actually married him .

THAT these and other the horrors and dangers with which the said Bissextile , or Leap Year , threatens the gentlemen of England on every occasion of its periodical return , have been greatly aggravated and augmented by the terms of Her Majesty ’s said Most Gracious communication , which have filled the heads of divers young ladies in this Realm with certain new ideas destructive to the peace of mankind , that never entered their imagination before .

As there are some good points about many of them , which still are not sufficiently numerous to render any one among them eligible , as a whole , our respectful advice to the young ladies is , to seek for a young gentleman who unites in himself the best qualities of all , and the worst weaknesses of none , and to lead him forthwith to the hymeneal altar , whether he will or no .

You have but a very few years to be young and handsome in the eyes of the world ; and as few months to be so in the eyes of a husband who is not a fool ; for I hope you do not still dream of charms and raptures , which marriage ever did , and ever will , put a sudden end to . ’
