Furthermore , the cost of road materials delivered to a construction site comprises two parts : The cost of the raw material at the quarry or gravel pit ; and transport costs , both financial and environmental , which are frequently the higher of the two .

The first objective of this paper is , therefore , to explore the reasons why many road authorities find it difficult to move from primary to secondary ( e. g. , industrial by-products ) , recycled or locally-available but possibly inferior sources .

In the UK , for example , roads consume some 25 % of all materials extracted from the ground and , while most of these sources are not in immediate danger of becoming exhausted , the impact on the environment is substantial .

The need to minimize use of scarce primary resources is becoming ever more urgent in most industries as humanity relentlessly exhausts this planet â€™s ability to satisfy its demands and carelessly discards waste to the detriment of the environment .

And if , as reported by Oke et al. in the case of Nigeria , failed asphalt is routinely discarded rather than being recycled , this in itself represents a direct and negative environmental impact .

To this must be added the fact that if in situ recycling can be achieved , there are substantial time savings , beneficial for both the road authority and the user .

They suggest this is often because designs and specifications do not allow for the use of a possibly inferior but more readily available material , which would include recycled materials .

It will be suggested that management of the risk accompanying the use of non-conventional materials requires effective partnership between public and private sectors in a transparent and no-blame environment .

The second , and certainly more significant , is organizational and relates to the type of contractual arrangement that best enables such materials to be used .

For example , in relation to Malawi , Kamanga and Steyn list material cost and/or shortage as a key reason for project delays .

Thus , the drivers are strong , both economic and environmental , in support of recycling and/or the use of locally-available materials .

A further objective is to suggest the changes that have to be put in place if this move is to be made .

The first is technical and relates to the developments needed in design methodology in order to incorporate materials with non-standard properties .

Furthermore , even if exhaustion of resources has not yet occurred , the costs are real .
