As a result , Henriet et al. showed that Si concentration in different shoot organs of banana plants was directly related to its transpiration rate . Cornélis et al. attributed the higher Si uptake by Douglas fir leaves compared to Black pine leaves to a higher transpiration rate and Euliss et al. showed that the leaf Si concentration of different grasses and wetland species was directly linked to its transpiration rate .

Climate also plays a key role in Si accumulation by plants , mainly through soil water availability and plant evapotranspiration . Ryalls et al. showed that plant Si concentration increases in roots and shoots under elevated rainfall , and thence soil moisture , in Microlaena stipoides Robert Brown .

Understanding the drivers of Si accumulation as a natural plant defense is key because seven of the top 10 most widespread crops in the world are Si-accumulating Poaceae species , especially in the face of expected climate changes and the lack of resilience of conventional agriculture .

Besides soil water availability , the rate of plant evapotranspiration — driven by net irradiance , air density , air heat capacity , vapor pressure deficit and latent heat of vaporization among others-also controls plant Si uptake and concentrations .

Field studies showed that Si uptake increases under drought stress as a defense mechanism . Fulweiler et al. observed that anthropogenic changes ( elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ) may increase biological Si pumping in forest .

Climatic variable ( air temperature , CO2 concentrations ) and pedoclimatic variable ( soil water content ) are therefore two key properties that must be integrated for better understanding of Si accumulation in plants .
