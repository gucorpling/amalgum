Recently , it has been described that the alterations of the intestinal barrier play a crucial role in the pathology of several human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases . Mohanan et al. documented the crucial role of the C1orf106 inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) susceptibility gene in stabilizing intestinal barrier function and intestinal inflammation . Manfredo Vieira et al. evidenced the role of pathobionts in the process of intestinal barrier alterations , which were followed by their translocation to lymph nodes and the hepatic portal system , triggering systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . Thaiss et al. reported that hyperglycemia leads to disruption of the intestinal barrier followed by intestinal inflammation and systemic infection . Spadoni et al. recently documented that the presence of the gut-vascular barrier ( GVB ) in the small intestine controls the dissemination of bacteria into the bloodstream .
