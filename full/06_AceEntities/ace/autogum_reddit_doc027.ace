Will I go to jail ? I honestly would just like to plead guilty and pay the fine , I know it will be on my record and all of that but I just want to move on so I do n’t have to keep dealing with the court system .

About 2 years ago , I was pulled over for speeding , the cop said he car smelled like marijuana and I consented to a search ( I had no idea at the time I could have said no ) .

So first , I ’ve never been to jail , and I ’ve never had any serious charges on my record , just a few speeding tickets here and there .

I did a few hours at a place in my city , but received no guidance on the job and was just expected to know what I was doing .

Out of all the shenanigans I pulled that should have landed me in jail , blowing off the community service is what got me .

It tends to piss them off if they give you multiple chances to do your community service and you keep not doing it .

I ended up getting a ticket for it ( possession of drug paraphernalia , which looks so much worse on paper ) .

Now I have a warrant bc it was never completed so I will have to go in front of a judge again .

I called some places and most of them did n’t take community service , only volunteers ( makes no sense ) .

You may want to get your stuff in order before you go to court and prepare for the worst .
