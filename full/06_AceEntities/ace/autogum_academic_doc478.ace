For example , hydrophilic molecules readily leach out ( e. g. , erythromycin , mitomycin C , fluorouracil etc. ) , while hydrophobic molecules , or those which display a strong chemical affinity for the matrix components , are released more gradually ( e. g. , streptomycin , sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim , cefazolin , enocitabine etc. ) .

In order to restrict this breakdown of the matrix , the co-entrapment of proteolysis inhibitors ( aprotinin , matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors such as galardin ) was investigated . Ahmed et al. identified in their model ( i. e. , chondroprogenitor clonal cell line ) the enzymes responsible for fibrin gel breakdown .
