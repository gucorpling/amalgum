The procedure achieves an optimal water blend at the lowest overall cost and improves the resilience and sustainability of urban water supplies . Byeon et al. proposed a new water balance assessment system as part of a smart water grid project in Korea and suggested a smart water management system to counter potential risks to the water distribution system for Yeongjong Island . Park et al. developed a decision support system for blending multiple water resources and system diagnoses in water treatment plants and tested it in the demo plant of the city of Incheon . Puleo et al. studied the optimal control of a multi-source water supply system ( desalination/surface water/groundwater , etc. ) , while reducing the source cost and energy cost ( pumping ) in addition to maintaining satisfactory water quality . Avni et al. developed and tested an optimization ( Q and C domain ) model to provide recommendations for a water distribution system ( WDS ) quality control in terms of meeting optimal water quality requirements ; they carried out computational experiments based on an actual regional WDS .

They generalized the water supply system into three modules : the water supply source , the water station , and the water user . Wei et al. established an urban water supply system ( UWSS ) , optimization framework for alternative water resources configuration , considering the trade-offs among total cost , life-cycle greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions , and an extended water ecosystem objective by integrating a multi-objective optimization model based on a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ( NSGA II ) with life-cycle assessment and a water distribution system simulation model . Liu et al. studied a “ two-stage multi-water sources allocation model in regional water resources management under uncertainty ” to solve for optimized water allocation among multiple sectors and water sources and made recommendations for the future of sustainable utilization of regional water resources .

For many years the optimization concept of economic dispatch ( ED ) for optimally matching multiple power sources to multiple demands has been popular in the energy system field , and has been solved by various optimization techniques including genetic algorithm ( GA ) , evolutionary programming ( EP ) , honey bee mating optimization ( HBMO ) , tabu search ( TS ) , particle swarm optimization ( PSO ) , harmony search ( HS ) , and firefly algorithm ( FA ) .

Considering this background , the main objective of this study is to propose a methodological approach that provides the optimal withdrawal of water from multiple sources with different qualities , while minimizing the total costs and complying with the source constraints of varying supply capacities , marginal water quality , and different types of water demands .

In the literature , several optimization methodologies have been proposed to deal with the multi-water resource management problem . Zhang et al. developed a multi-water source joint scheduling model using a refined water supply network and proposed the concept of a water treatment and distribution station ( water station ) .

Accordingly , water resources managers need to determine the optimal water withdrawal rates from multiple sources to satisfy multiple water demands , while meeting the water quality constraints , at the lowest possible overall economic and environmental cost , and enhancing sustainability .
