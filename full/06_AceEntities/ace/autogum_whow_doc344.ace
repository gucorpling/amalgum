If you ca n't do this for one reason or another ( such as surgery being booked for the next day , it does happen ) , try to email your teachers at least , and this way they will hopefully give you an extension on the work being done on your surgery day , and potentially for a few days after your surgery ( in case you need to stay out of town overnight , or are in too much pain to go back the day after ) .

It helps to wear short , baggy shorts , or loose pyjama-type bottoms , as if you need a drain after surgery , this will make it easy to get your bottoms over the drain , and also the bulky dressing that will be on your knee after surgery . You may also have a knee immobilizer , which , again , is quite bulky .

This may include a brace/immobilizer , an ice machine/ice packs , pillows and blankets for comfort in the car on the way home from the hospital , or a prescription for pain meds ( some surgeons will give you the prescription ahead of time , others will only give it on the day of surgery ) .

Especially in rural areas , there may not be an orthopaedic surgeon in your town/city , so you may have to stay in a hotel before and/or after your surgery , especially if you need to have a drain removed the morning after surgery .
