For example , for the case when the targets are located in the middle of the phantom , the FWHM obtained by the full-field illumination system is 8 mm , whereas that obtained by the scanning system is 6 mm which is 25 % lower .

Much attention has been focused on developing novel probes emitting light in the NIR spectral window , because tissue has minimal absorbance in the wavelength range between 650 nm and 1000 nm , allowing for deep penetration depth and higher sensitivity .
