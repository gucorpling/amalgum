Well , now I am working with a , because I have done a lot of work stuff on licensed works , doing stuff which is other people 's properties : so be it big franchises , like Assassin 's Creed and Wolfenstein where it 's very well established things that you have to sort of , you know , there 's certain fan expectations in that and things that you need to , things you need to have .

Oh man ! I originally thought I was gonna get into film-making , but that 's such a slow and arduous process , and sort of relinquish control to so many people because of such a big team and everything , that I sort of fell into comics as something where you , where the writer has a little bit more control , like , directly .

Ah , well , Caspar Wijngaard the artist and I pitched Limbo to Image Comics , in-person at a festival , a ComicCon , in the UK called Thought Bubble , and , we got the go ahead , to go away and make that book , but we were brand-new , we had no idea of what we were doing .

It was just the two of us making this book , which was just amazing and terrifying , but such a sort of trial by fire as far as these things go so there 's no one to tell us how to do things things , but it was great , I mean , really happy how the book came out .

And so it 's a big difference between writing from something that 's entirely your own and you can do anything with it ; and writing something that 's someone else 's that has the weight of history , you know , has a weight of series history behind it .

Major influence-wise , I was a huge fan of old-school Vertigo stuff : say , Sandman , Lucifer , Swamp Thing , Doom Patrol : those were the books that really made me want to write .
