How Henry would think , and feel , and look , when he returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her being gone , was a question of force and interest to rise over every other , to be never ceasing , alternately irritating and soothing ; it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence , and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment .

From this , she was preserved too by another cause , by feeling no eagerness for her journey 's conclusion ; for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting with those she loved best , even after an absence such as hers -- an eleven weeks ' absence .

Leaning back in one corner of the carriage , in a violent burst of tears , she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head ; and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it .

Unfortunately , the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from Woodston ; and , for fourteen miles , every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different .

The pressing anxieties of thought , which prevented her from noticing anything before her , when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston , saved her at the same time from watching her progress ; and though no object on the road could engage a moment 's attention , she found no stage of it tedious .

Her youth , civil manners , and liberal pay procured her all the attention that a traveller like herself could require ; and stopping only to change horses , she travelled on for about eleven hours without accident or alarm , and between six and seven o'clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton .

Every mile , as it brought her nearer Woodston , added to her sufferings , and when within the distance of five , she passed the turning which led to it , and thought of Henry , so near , yet so unconscious , her grief and agitation were excessive .

Salisbury she had known to be her point on leaving Northanger ; but after the first stage she had been indebted to the post-masters for the names of the places which were then to conduct her to it ; so great had been her ignorance of her route .
