The following are contributions of this paper : ( a ) we build a framework for the operation of online stores , which provides a more comprehensive perspective to understand e-commerce , ( b ) we consider the systematic impact of positive and negative e-WOM on online stores ’ operation , which were ignored in previous studies , and the findings update the context of e-WOM to some extent , and ( c ) the real data used in this study can complement the empirical research methods used in previous research .

In addition to the e-WOM towards a product , the product price is also an important factor that contributes to online stores ’ sales and profits , while it is the promotion measures taken by the online stores that influence the price fluctuations .

Therefore , in order to fit the research gaps , this paper uses the system dynamic method to structure a model of online stores ’ operations and especially consideres the impacts of e-WOM and promotion .
