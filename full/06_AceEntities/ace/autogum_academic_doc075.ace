Thus , encapsulation of tannin extract has the potential to mask the astringency by restricting the biological activity of tannins in the mouth and provide a sustained release in the rumen , guaranteeing the modulation of microbial fermentation , and , therefore , the tannin effect is limited to the rumen and post-rumen environment .

Recent studies have shown that encapsulation may be used to mask or reduce the negative effects associated with tannins and other bioactive compounds in the food or feed industry , with additional tendency to control the release of the active ingredient at the required site for optimum effectiveness .

The aim of this study , therefore , was to determine if encapsulating Acacia mearnsii tannin extract in a lipid matrix will favourably mask the bitter taste of tannin and possibly slow down its release in the rumen without reducing its antimethanogenic potency .

By this , the anticipated utilisation of encapsulated CT extract in methane reduction can be achieved without the associated negative effects on dry matter intake , nutrient digestibility and N-balance , using South Africa Mutton Merino wethers as a model animal .

However , moderate to high concentrations of dietary CT , which proved consistently effective in methane reduction , may also significantly depress dry matter intake and nutrient digestibility depending on the concentration and biological activity of the tannin .

One type of plant secondary metabolite known for their wide application in animal production are condensed tannins , which are water-soluble polyphenolic compounds of high molecular weight with the ability to modulate rumen fermentation .

It is hypothesised that encapsulated Acacia tannin extract ( ATE ) will confine the effect of tannin to the rumen , resulting in improved anti-methanogenic effect without an associated depression in feed intake .

According to Mamvura et al. , the productivity of bioactive compounds may be enhanced when they are fully available at the precise location where they are required such as in the rumen .

Condensed tannins exhibit their anti-methanogenic activity directly by inhibiting the growth of methanogens through the tanning action of their functional proteins , resulting in bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects .

Beyond the rumen , free CT may also re-bind to dietary protein , digestive enzymes , or membrane proteins of mucosal cells , thereby reducing nutrient absorption .
