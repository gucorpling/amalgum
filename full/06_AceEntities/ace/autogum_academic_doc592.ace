Kim and Lee proposed a new ANN learning algorithm using an objective function and sensitivity to solve the problems of the conventional ANN , which has shortcomings such as a longer learning time and the need to predetermine the desired structural response . Cho et al. presented an algorithm for selecting the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer of a neural network controller based on a measure of the network performance and applied neural controllers to single-degree-of-freedom ( SDOF ) and two-DOF systems subjected to the El Centro earthquakes .
