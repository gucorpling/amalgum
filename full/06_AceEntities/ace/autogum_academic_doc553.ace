In the past decade , with the successful launch of the soil moisture and ocean salinity ( SMOS ) satellite by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , the Aquarius/SAC-D satellite , and the soil moisture active passive ( SMAP ) satellite by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , global sea surface salinity ( SSS ) observations from space have become possible and a significant improvement has been made to understand the ocean dynamics and climate change .

Over the past decades , the correction for sea surface roughness effects were studied based on the in-situ and airborne measurements ; for example , the experiments made from a tower , wind and salinity experiments ( WISE ) , airborne Passive-Active L-band Sensor ( PALS ) campaign and Combined Airborne Radio instruments for Ocean and Land Studies ( CAROLS ) campaigns .

As the foam effect is significant at high wind speed conditions ( above a threshold of 12 m/s ) due to strong wave breaking , it has been corrected by numerous models ; for example , the semi-empirical models and radiative transfer equation ( RTE ) based models , which were developed to estimate the foam covered sea surface emissivity .

At the end of 1990 , two airborne microwave interferometers , the electronically scanned thinned array radiometer ( ESTAR ) and the scanning low-frequency microwave radiometer ( SLFMR ) , successfully produced SSS maps in coastal areas in agreement with in-situ measurements with an accuracy of about 1 psu .

Furthermore , the satellite measurements of SSS are hampered by the effect of radio frequency interference ( RFI ) in offshore areas of China ( i. e. , Bohai sea , Yellow sea and East China sea ) , which causes a large amount of data to be discarded .

For example , the sensitivity of vertically polarized brightness temperature to SSS variation is 0.4 to 0.8 K/psu for different observing angles and sea surface temperatures ( SST ) , and it is only 0.2 to 0.6 K/psu for the horizontal polarization brightness temperature .

It is widely accepted that the corrections of the sea surface and atmospheric effects are essential for remote sensing of SSS , since these effects could alter the value of sensor-measured brightness temperature and introduce errors into the SSS retrieval process .

Although drifters and buoys , together with cruises , have accumulated large amount in-situ water salinity data in different regions , it is still difficult to monitor global ocean salinity with high temporal-spatial resolution by the in situ measurements .

Among these models , the small-slope approximation/small perturbation model ( SSA/SPM ) , two scale model ( TSM ) and empirical/semi-empirical models have been widely used by the research community and implemented in different satellite data processing systems .

In addition , the widely used empirical models decouple the wind effect from SSS and SST effects , which means that the surface emission is due to a perfectly flat sea surface and the wind-roughened sea surface .

Moreover , the sea surface reflection of downwelling atmospheric emission is another contribution to satellite-observed brightness temperature , thus the determination of the cutoff wavenumber is required not only for sea surface emission but also for reflection .

Besides the atmospheric effects , the increasing of sea surface emissivity due to the sea surface roughness and foam effects is the main source of error , which could significantly hamper the accuracy of SSS retrieval .

The wind-roughened sea surface is associated with the increased brightness temperature ( due to sea surface roughness effect ) , which induces regional biases when applied to different areas .
