In terms of copyright in SL , I ’m sure there is a cease and desist procedure in place but lots of real world brands are on board and make a profit in game already , if a user number of say 500K was to jump to billions I ’m sure they ’d soon realise it ’s the best place to sell your product .

The sheer about of people logged into the OASIS makes sense because they had to , as a means of survival - but getting the general population on board without a reason would take many years and I ’m sure there would be some insane data breach revelation before that time came anyway haha .

In terms of people living inside an online virtual world , I guess we ’re already doing that stuck to our phones constantly ... wearing the device on our faces everyday ( excl Tues and Thurs ) ; ) probably is n’t that far away .

For one OASIS to have access to every piece of 80 ’s culture is ridiculous ( Unless this OASIS is made after the copyright wears off , and they can use it freely ) , although possible .

Many companies will try to make their own OASIS ’s , and on top of that , there ’ll probably not be one VR console to rule them all , like in RPO .

It ’s probably the closest thing to the OASIS in terms of its scale , being whoever you want to be , creating the world you live in , in-game economy etc.

My solution to this would be to split each planet ( or maybe each sector on each planet ) into its own server , so the entire OASIS would n’t crash .

The most far out thing about the OASIS is it ’s extremely life-like graphics , which VR systems do n’t have just yet , but are entirely possible .
