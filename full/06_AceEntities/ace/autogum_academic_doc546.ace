Among the other considered software , SurgiCase_CMF was analyzed by Bianchi et al. and Marchetti et al. ; they reported that the percentage of error was less than 2 mm for the majority of patients , but in both studies an important error in the areas of lips and chin was reported . Khambay et al. , Terzic et al. and Ullah et al. used 3dMDvultus to predict soft tissue changes ; in general , they reported that its use on specific anatomical regions was more meaningful than on the full face .

Concerning the works based on Maxilim , Shafi et al. found that this software makes a clinically satisfactory prediction of soft tissue changes , but with an over-prediction of the position of the upper lip ; according to Liebregts et al. , its accuracy is influenced by the magnitude of maxillary and mandibular movements , by the age of the patient and by the usage of V-Y closure , and these authors further reported a low predictability of lower and upper lips .

With regard to Dolphin software , Resnick et al. reported that the ability to predict 3D soft tissue changes was limited , with an accuracy that may be acceptable for linear changes but not for lateral facial points . Peterman et al. reported various degrees of accuracy at each soft-tissue landmark in the horizontal and vertical axes ; lower lip prediction was the least accurate .

The treated software are commonly used in clinical procedures to have a preview of the patients â€™ outcome after corrective surgery ; the most common methodologies on which these software are based are the mass spring model , the finite element model and the mass tensor model , each of them with its advantages and disadvantages .

MSM presents an easy architecture and a low memory usage but it has no real biomechanical foundations ; FEM is more relevant from a biomechanical point of view , but it has a high computational cost and a rather long simulation time ; MTM tries to combine the advantages of MSM and of FEM .

Moreover , it requires plotting 79 landmarks on the CT volume ( 42 for the hard tissue and 37 for the soft tissue ) ; the localization of such a large number of points seems to require too much time for a stable usage in clinical daily practice .

In particular , the lip region is the most difficult to predict , since lips do not rely on bony structures ; moreover , it is difficult to replicate the same lip position from one acquisition to another .

It was suggested that Maxilim inaccuracy in the prediction of the lip region might be due to the modelling algorithm , i. e. , mass tensor , and might indicate a non-linear response of the upper lip .

The difficulty in accurately predicting the appearance of this sub region is a crucial point in the development of a prediction method , since it is particularly related to aesthetic self-perception and satisfaction of the patient .

Conversely , two articles affirmed that the statistical differences between Dolphin soft tissue prediction and the real outcome of the patient did not invalidate the software prediction , as it was close to real surgical results .

Dolphin 3D imaging uses a landmark-based photographic morphing algorithm that was developed for two-dimensional prediction and then adapted to three-dimensional prediction ; this could be an explanation for its imprecisions .
