However , if their sequences are not fully paired , the translation of the target mRNA will be inhibited and the integrity of the mRNA will not be affected . miRNAs have the broadest range of gene regulation and regulate a variety of biological processes , including early embryo development , cell proliferation and differentiation , apoptosis and death , viral infection and tumorigenesis .

Viruses that cause immunosuppression in chickens include Marek ’s disease virus ( MDV ) , reticuloendotheliosis virus ( REV ) , avian leukosis virus ( ALV ) , infectious bursal disease virus ( IBDV ) , chicken infectious anemia virus ( CIAV ) and avian reovirus ( ARV ) .

The maturity of miRNA includes the following stages : First , the non-coding region of DNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase I to form a precursor transcript ( primary miRNA , pri-miRNA ) with a hat structure ( 7MGpppG ) and a poly(A ) tail .

The infection of chickens with these viruses not only causes death , but also increases susceptibility to other microbial infections and the risk of failure in subsequent vaccination against other diseases , leading to serious economic losses .
