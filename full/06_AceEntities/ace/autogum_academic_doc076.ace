For all of these reasons , we aimed to optimize a simplified Polychromatic Flow Cytometry ( PFC ) method for a fast identification , enumeration and characterization of bacterial derived EVs , as well as for the analysis of their eDNA-associated subtypes , produced by the planktonic and the biofilm phenotypes of a Gram-negative ( H. pylori ATCC 43629 ) and a Gram-positive ( L. reuteri DSM 17938 ) bacterium .

Modifications in terms of EVs production and content might also be associated with the growth phase , as well as with the bacterial phenotype ( biofilm or planktonic ) and the media composition . Park et al. demonstrated that EVs associated to the P. aeruginosa biofilm phenotype showed a unique proteome profile , with respect to the one carried by EVs stemming from its planktonic counterpart .

For example , iron-limiting conditions increase the EVs production from Helicobacter pylori , Haemophilus influenzae , Escherichia coli , and Vibrio cholera ; the oxygen availability affects the generation of EVs and the antibiotic treatment ( i. e. , polymyxin B or colistin ) promotes an increase of EVs production that confers protection to the bacterial cells , thus allowing their survival .

In particular , H. pylori -derived bEVs seemed to “ bridge ” bacterial cells , thus playing a possible structural role ; however , the fact that eDNA are carried by EVs , may protect the eDNA from the enzymatic activity of DNase I in breaking up the biofilm .

Many studies support the hypothesis that the generation of EVs is a controlled and regulated process , although Turnbull et al. demonstrated that the EVs ’ biogenesis is associated with a rearrangement of the bacterial membranes , derived from lysed cells , which incorporate soluble molecules .

We demonstrated that PFC can be used as a tool to study the modifications of EVs production under different environmental conditions , as well as for the detection and enumeration of bacterial derived EVs , and in particular eDNA-associated EVs , in clinical samples .

It was demonstrated that EVs stemming from Pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to interact with Shigella flexneri pouring their content into the periplasm of eukaryotic cells ; conversely , EVs derived from P. aeruginosa adhere to the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus .

It has been reported that EVs are involved in a number of physiological and pathological mechanisms , including biofilm formation , inter-cellular cross-talk , as well as bacteria – host and bacterium – phage interactions .

The EVs composition and content are strictly dependent on the environmental conditions where they are generated , as well as on the bacterial species from which they are produced and on their growth phase .

ATCC 43629 and Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 are biofilm-producing strains , and both the planktonic and the biofilm phenotypes generate EVs ( pEVs and bEVs , respectively ) carrying extracellular DNA ( eDNA). .

It is also known that EVs fuse with the outer membrane of Gram-negative cells , while they are not able to interact with Gram-positive bacteria .
