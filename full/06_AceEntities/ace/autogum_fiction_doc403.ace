The nature of Paul Harley ’s inquiries -- inquiries which , presumably from the death of Sir Charles Abingdon , had led him to investigate the movements of two persons of international repute , neither apparently having even the most remote connection with anything crooked -- was a conundrum for the answer to which the detective inspector sought in vain .

Innes had frankly outlined the whole of Paul Harley ’s case to date , and Detective Inspector Wessex , although he had not admitted the fact , had nevertheless recognized that from start to finish the thing did not offer one single line of inquiry which he would have been capable of following up .

Wessex , who was a thorough artist within his limitations , had satisfied himself that none of the callers who had asked for Ormuz Khan , and no one who had loitered about the lobbies , could possibly have been even a disguised Paul Harley .

“ Nevertheless , ” replied Innes , slowly , “ you know the chief , and therefore you know as well as I do that he would not have instructed me to communicate with you unless he had definite evidence in his possession .

The official machinery of Scotland Yard was at work endeavouring to trace the missing man , but since it had proved impossible to find out from where the message had been sent , the investigation was handicapped at the very outset .

Arrived at his destination , he asked to see Miss Abingdon , and was shown by the butler into a charmingly furnished little sitting room which was deeply impressed with the personality of its dainty owner .
