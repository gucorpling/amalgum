Only two other of Rubens ' assistants were registered with the Guild . Panneels ' registration with the Guild shows that he had fulfilled the requirements towards becoming a master and that he was ready to start his own workshop .

The fact that Panneels registered with the Guild is exceptional since Rubens and the members of his workshop were exempted from registration with the Guild because of Rubens ' appointment to the court as a court painter .

The cantoor of Rubens was very extensive because of the many assignments he had worked on and his regular travels abroad where he would make sketches of the many new things he encountered there .

It was not general practice for collaborators to have unrestricted access to the cantoor as it was regarded as important intellectual property of the artist that he would use in his creative process .

Panneels put his own signature on the copies thus making clear that they were copies after Rubens and that he did not want to resell them as original Rubens drawings .

Rubens had therefore provided in his will that the works in the cantoor should stay in the family should any of his children wish to follow in his artistic footsteps .
