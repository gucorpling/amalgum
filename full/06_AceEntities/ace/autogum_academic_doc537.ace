After analyzing the background and continuous sound levels in the Port of Cartagena , it was found that impulsive sound must have a level above approximately 70 dB re 1 µPa to be detected , depending on the frequency ( between 80 and 45 dB re 1 µPa in the frequency range from 10 to 100 kHz , respectively ) .
