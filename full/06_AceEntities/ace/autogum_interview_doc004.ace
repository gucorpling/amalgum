We decided to look at this subject because although there have been some studies that reported an association between household gun ownership and youth suicide rates , one could argue that the reason for this association is that gun households differ systematically from non-gun households in that they are more likely to have youth with depression and therefore youth who are more likely to attempt suicide .

Siegel and colleagues including predoctoral fellow Anita Knopov , the lead author , compared data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2004 , when the body last surveyed US gun owners , to corresponding information on suicides by 10 â€“ 19 year olds from 2005 through 2015 .

Professor Siegel noted guns to be a more lethal method than this famed and high-profile example , and theorised this accounted for household gun ownership being a stronger predictor of successful suicides than the rate of failed suicide attempts .

There were states that did not match the overall trend : Alabama and Mississippi had low youth suicide rates of around 4.5 per 100,000 people but high household gun ownership rates of over 50 % .

The team wrote that guns " are 2.6 times more lethal than any other means of suicide ; thus , access to firearms might be expected to contribute to a higher incidence of suicide .

Our study was designed to control for these factors in order to determine whether differences in suicide attempt rates explain the observed association between household gun ownership and youth suicide rates .
