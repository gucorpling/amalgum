He is a member of the Institute and an officer of the Legion of honor ; he is thirty-six years old , has an income of twenty thousand francs from the Funds , his pictures sell for their weight in gold , and ( what seems to him more extraordinary than the invitations he receives occasionally to court balls ) his name and fame , mentioned so often for the last sixteen years by the press of Europe , has at last penetrated to the valley of the Eastern Pyrenees , where vegetate three veritable Loras : his father , his eldest brother , and an old paternal aunt , Mademoiselle Urraca y Lora .

Gazonal , though commander of the National Guard in his own town and one of the most capable manufacturers of the department , found himself of so little account in Paris , and he was , moreover , so frightened by the costs of living and the dearness of even the most trifling things , that he kept himself , all this time , secluded in his shabby lodgings .

The following lines , ending an article , struck Gazonal as if the mysterious voice which speaks to gamblers before they win had sounded in his ear : “ Our celebrated landscape painter , Leon de Lora , lately returned from Italy , will exhibit several pictures at the Salon ; thus the exhibition promises , as we see , to be most brilliant . ”

During the summer of 1841 cousin Sylvestre Gazonal went to inform the illustrious unknown family of Lora that their little Leon had not gone to the Rio de la Plata , as they supposed , but was now one of the greatest geniuses of the French school of painting ; a fact the family did not believe .

But it was not until 1840 that Leon de Lora received a letter from Monsieur Sylvestre Palafox-Castal-Gazonal ( called simply Gazonal ) to which he replied that he was assuredly himself , -- that is to say , the son of the late Leonie Gazonal , wife of Comte Fernand Didas y Lora .

In 1845 , Gazonal considered his cause as wholly lost ; the secretary of the Master of Petitions , charged with the duty of drawing up the report , had confided to him that the said report would assuredly be against him , and his own lawyer confirmed the statement .
