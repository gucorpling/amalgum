Given the possibility that children may be susceptible to sleep alterations that may favor the risk of excess food intake and that sleep is a modifiable factor , it is important to continue with research that aims to explain the influence and determine the importance of adequate sleep so that policies and interventions for nutrition management programs can be developed .

The purpose of the current study was to analyze the relationship between objectively measured sleep duration , efficiency and variability in sleep duration with energy and macronutrient intake in children between 6 and 9 years old .

Numerous findings suggested that reduced and poor sleep were linked to increased snacking and preference for poorer food choices , including energy-dense foods and snacks with higher fat and refined sugar content .

In an environment that offers free access to ultra-palatable foods or caloric snacks , delayed bedtime or reduced sleep increases the potential time available to eat while engaging in sedentary activities .

With respect to macronutrient composition , sleeping less is associated with an intake of a higher proportion of calories from fats , however , the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear .

Actigraphy allows for a more objective recording of sleep parameters , such as sleep duration , efficiency , and variability , than traditional parent-report and is less intrusive than polysomnography .

Studies have observed that sleep deprivation might be one of the modifiable factors that promote inadequate nutritional intake and contribute to unhealthy food consumption behavior and excess weight gain .

In addition , recent studies have shown that not only sleep duration contributes to obesity , but also timing , quality and sleep disturbances could play an important role .

It is vital that children are provided with a diet containing adequate quantities of energy , macro- and micronutrients to allow them reach their growth and development potential .

A recent meta-analysis identified that reduced sleep was consistently related to a greater risk of being overweight or obese and its effect was even more pronounced in children .

Diet is one of the numerous factors that have been associated with childhood weight status , which , when grouped together , are known as the obesogenic environment .

Previous cross-sectional and prospective studies have identified a relationship between shorter sleep duration and increased obesity in children , even after covariate adjustment including important obesity-related behaviors .

On the other hand , delayed bedtime favors later wake up times and sleep disturbances induce daytime sleepiness and tiredness , which stimulates food intake .

Some hypotheses have proposed that the relationship between reduced sleep and excess food intake is based on social , behavioral and hedonic reasons .

In summary , short sleep duration would favor excess food intake by reducing opportunities for physical activity and enhancing opportunities to overeat .
