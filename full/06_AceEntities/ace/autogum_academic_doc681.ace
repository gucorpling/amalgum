The authors incorporated low impact development ( LID ) into a Storm Water Management Model ( SWMM ) , and built scenarios showing the effects of green roofs , permeable pavement , and other LID technologies on runoff . Chao et al. reported the results of implementing sustainable residential development on water consumption in two urban regions in Australia . Xian et al. used remote sensing to assess the impacts on water-quality parameters of increased impervious surface and population density in the Tampa Bay , FL , USA watershed .
