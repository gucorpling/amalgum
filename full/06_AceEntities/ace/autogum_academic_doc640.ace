The result can also be attributed to the DS users understanding that supplement consumption helps them keep pace with the demands of campus life , which is known to present easy access to rapidly available snacks , regardless of the health condition and consciousness of students .

An intriguing finding in this research is that although the respondents ’ knowledge levels were low , they still carefully examined nutritional information on packaging , suggesting that some information can be misleading or some other reasons for consumers .

DSs can be beneficial to one ’s health ; if an individual is driven to take these products out of concern for his/her well-being , then such behavior may motivate other healthful habits , such as regular exercise .

Given that DSs are dispensed without the need for a prescription and are available to all individuals who may have different health conditions , the benefits of such products may be minimal , and their efficacy remains controversial .
