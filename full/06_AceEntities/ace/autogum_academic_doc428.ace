Among these strategies and tools , the microfinance institution ( MFI ) , which distinguishes itself from traditional financial institutions , such as the commercial bank , by operating small loans to “ unbankable poor people and small businesses ” , is not only considered an effective way for the poor to manage their finances and take advantage of economic opportunities while managing risks , but also an important way to promote economic development , employment and growth , through the financial support of small businesses .

Meanwhile , given the negative influence of failed MFIs , some mathematical models have been proposed for evaluating the financial sustainability of MFIs , such as the order preference by similarity to ideal solution ( TOPSIS ) , and the data envelopment analysis operating frontiers model ( DEA-OF ) , .

More and more research has recognized that the performance of MFIs is not only influenced by internal factors , but also impacted by their external macro-environment , including the finance sector environment , macro-economic environment , and information technology environment .

It should be noted that neglect of macro-environmental factors may lead to an overestimation of the financial sustainability score of MFIs , and have implications for managerial decision making , which should contribute to effective MFI performance .

According to the recent disclosure of the World Bank , the total volume of people who are still struggling to meet basic needs was 3.4 billion in 2018 , which is almost half the world ’s population .

However , to the best of our knowledge , the majority of prior studies evaluating the financial sustainability of MFIs adopted accounting ratios and corporate governance factors as criteria , in the context of one country .

The MFI has attracted tremendous interest from both practitioners and academic researchers for its significant role in poverty reduction , by bridging the gap between formal financial institutions and low-income groups or individuals .

In recent years , in addition to social and financial sustainability , more and more studies have paid attention to the environmental sustainability of MFIs , analyzing the green environment performance of MFIs .

There has been no study evaluating the financial sustainability of MFIs integrating this many factors as criteria , especially ones accounting for the interaction between MFIs and their external operating environment .

In practical terms , this interaction includes the externality of MFIs to their environment and the influence of uncontrollable environmental factors on the financial sustainability of MFIs .

However , as well as the traditional financial system , MFIs are also a part of the social economy system , shown in

At the same time , MFIs are also suffering from fierce competition and rapid changes in the business environment .

It is generally believed that it is better not to have any MFIs than to have unsustainable ones .

Generally , sustainability is the ability to meet the needs of the present without compromising future generations .
