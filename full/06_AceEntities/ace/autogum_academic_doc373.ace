Ecological monitoring in the WMAs is especially challenging due to the lack of a quick , effective , and technologically user-friendly monitoring system that can be applied by both researchers and locally-based monitoring teams to generate useful real-time data as an alternative to the traditional biodiversity and habitats assessment techniques .

These areas are jointly managed through the establishment of a Community Based Organization that will later be upgraded to Authorized Association ( AA ) status by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism once they have accomplished all the requirements stipulated by the Wildlife Management Area Regulations of 2012 .
