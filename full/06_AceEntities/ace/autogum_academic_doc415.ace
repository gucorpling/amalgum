Therefore , it is not known whether the bacterial species resistant to in vitro growth are randomly distributed among known bacterial phyla , classes , orders , families , genera or species , or whether the microbiota members resistant to in vitro growth are clustered in particular lineages , which is exactly what we investigated in this study .

However , Lactobacillaceae , though common in the small intestine , form only a small fraction of gut microbiota in the distal parts of the intestinal tract like the caecum , microbiota of which is formed by hundreds of anaerobic bacterial species different from Lactobacilli .

Furthermore , the experimental design also enabled us to address secondary aims such as to which extent feed or food additives , therapeutics or drugs influence in vitro bacterial growth in complex microbial populations and what are the most selective culture conditions for particular taxa .

Studies administering defined bacteria , followed by verification of their presence in the intestinal tract and their association with tested characteristics , are much less frequent and most frequently involve the administration of Lactobacillaceae family members .

However , the vast majority of published data are based on epidemiological studies and correlation analyses , which may not necessarily prove the causative link between the tested intervention , microbiota composition and host response .

In addition , the correlation analysis cannot distinguish between the cause and the consequence â€” is the change in gut microbiota composition the cause of the behavioural change or its consequence ?

Using a larger set of different culture conditions , the primary aim was to determine which bacterial lineages colonising the chicken caecum have not yet been cultured in vitro .

Soon after we formed an initial laboratory collection of chicken gut anaerobes , we compared the isolates from the collection with those commonly found in chicken intestinal tract .

Because of this , we and others have initiated systematic culturing of gut anaerobes to have them available for whole genome sequencing and subsequent experiments .

These studies concluded that between 50 to 90 % of total gut microbiota could be cultured in vitro if the appropriate culture conditions are provided .

Other studies addressed the same question by comparing the bacterial composition in original faecal or caecal samples with those in nutrient broth after culture .

Unfortunately , these studies did not perform phylogenetic analyses of the OTUs ( operational taxonomic units ) capable or incapable of in vitro growth .

In other words , we were interested whether there were any chicken gut anaerobes which were difficult to culture .

Consequently , various studies have associated the composition of gut microbiota with age , disease or behaviour .

Assessing gut microbiota composition is currently relatively simple due to recent developments in DNA sequencing techniques .

Indirectly , such data also points towards possible functions of individual microbiota members in vivo .
