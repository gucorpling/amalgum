Epilepsy is a disorder in the central nervous system ( CNS ) that is characterized by an increase in the number of electrical impulses that occurs in one focal locus of the brain and/or the entire brain , resulting in partial or generalized seizures .

The ideal delivery systems of antiepileptic drugs are the ones which provide localized and controlled drug release to targeted sites in the brain , which helps to reduce drug-associated toxicities and enhances the efficacy of the drug .
