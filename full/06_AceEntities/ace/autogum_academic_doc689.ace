It is argued that if social justice is a concept that requires qualitative judgements about a given situation rather than quantified measurements , regressing or accumulating individuals and their experiences into measurable categories cannot account for the uniqueness of each individual neither can it explain how cultural differences play a role in networked learning activities .

This assumption is problematic because researchers in the field of education continue employing frameworks that cannot reflect the nuanced ways in which complexly interwoven forms of identifications ( such as class , ethnicity , sexual orientation , and gender ) operate to produce differentiated experiences across cohorts of students .

Lastly , a discussion is made that the mediated experience in online spaces should be conceptualised in tandem with one â€™s social presence and social absence if online education is to be studied more rigorously and if claims of equity and justice are to be made in networked learning .

The research reporting on empirical data , such as studies illustrating the variety of identities among participants ( e. g. , ) or comparing the number of contributions across different cohorts of students ( e. g. , ) , can provide only tangential support for these idealistic propositions .

In specific , it provides a theoretical lens for going beyond a wide-spread speculation that networked learning practices inherently provide equal opportunities to participate , a speculation that has long hindered the development of critical frameworks and approaches in the theory of networked learning .

The core to these claims is the rhetoric that the networked nature of such practices can provide equal opportunities for all individuals to freely and openly share their ideas and participate in group activities ( see , for example , ) .

To determine what is socially just , therefore , is not limited with concerns whether there is an actual or perceived equality in a given situation , but includes judgements on whether the given situation is fair or not .

At this point , it should be asserted that the difference between justice and equality ( since , as it is argued above , research tends to employ the concept of equality when making claims on social justice ) .

There is an urgent need for a theoretical framework that does not limit equity with access or participation but focuses on the otherwise hidden ways in which group work can yield suboptimal outcomes .

Networked learning is an umbrella term for pedagogical approaches or applications where technology is utilised to connect learners , tutor(s) , and resources to form a learning network .

This article aims to expand the current understandings of social justice in networked learning practices by challenging the ways in which being is conceptualised in communal settings .

This potential for more egalitarian or democratic forms of engagements among people is accepted to be somehow actualised naturally within collaborative or cooperative forms of learning .

If networked learning is becoming more diverse and widened , research should critically examine the extent to which these claims can be substantiated in practice .

This , however , requires clarification of what networked learning is and how social justice is conceptualised before proceeding further with the conceptual analysis .
