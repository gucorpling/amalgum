The IHNV genome consists of six genes in the order 3’-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5 ’ , representing the nucleocapsid protein ( N ) , phosphoprotein ( P ) , matrix gene ( M ) , glycoprotein ( G ) , nonvirion protein ( NV ) , and polymerase protein ( L ) .

No study has reported the complete genome sequence of the IHNV isolates in Korea , and the quality of data associated with the phylogenetic analysis of the Korean IHNV isolates is poor compared with that of the data of studies conducted in other countries .

Although the consumption amount of salmonids and the size of the fisheries rearing this species in Korea are relatively smaller than those in other countries in Europe and North America , some previous studies have been conducted on the presence of IHNV in Korea .

Outbreaks of IHNV infection are usually associated with a mortality rate of 50 – 60 % , but can be up to 95 % , and younger fish have been found to be more susceptible to the clinical symptoms and acute infections .
