The study found that in a comparison between countries with a responsible land consolidation ( Rwanda , Lithuania , and the Netherlands ) on one hand and a country with customary lands but without a land consolidation ( Ghana ) on the other hand , there were three areas that needed attention to develop a responsible land consolidation the land administration processes , the land valuation approach , and the land reallocation approach .

The participatory land administration ( PLA ) was developed to bring together traditional land administration approaches , deeply rooted in western views , together with bottom-up emerging approaches that challenge traditional approaches , as well as technological advances that drive these approaches together with the growing societal needs .

This study finds that though the land consolidation strategy developed is significantly able to reduce land fragmentation , both physical and land tenure , the local customs are an obstruction to the technical processes to achieve the best form of farm structures .

In addition , future work should focus on further developing land valuation and land reallocation approaches by automating them using Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal ( CAMA ) systems with GIS , and Spatial Decision Support Systems ( SDSS ) , respectively .

Further research also needs to be done in the implementation , through active research in the conduct of a pilot land consolidation process in the customary areas , to further ascertain the limitations that the approaches have in other areas .

Further research should therefore be conducted into the legal framework of Ghana , vis á vis land consolidation in order to develop an integrated , flexible , and inclusive framework for customary lands towards land consolidation .

However , the consideration of all aspects of the society and technology being a basic tenet of responsible approaches , the changes to the local customs is beyond the scope of this study .

Furthermore , as shown in Section 5.1 , customary lands are independently managed in each community , saved for the national legal framework that tries to harmonise their management .

The valuation approach was developed in the rural farming context , it can therefore also be developed further looking at urban land to put it in a broader context .

A further comparative study can be undertaken on other SSA countries ’ rural customary lands to further understand the differences , in terms of the requirements of land consolidation .

Finally , a land reallocation approach was developed based on the political , economic and social , as well as technical and legal characteristics of rural customary farmlands .

This will further deepen and enrich the use of market information in the valuation of urban lands , especially for slum areas for non-market values .

This , in tandem with the scaling up approach by further establishing workflows , will enable the testing of the approach with a wider coverage .

A valuation approach was then developed to enable the comparison of the farmlands in rural areas that are without land markets .

This means that a single land consolidation approach will not fit the whole country .
