This paper proposes a new transportation pattern approach , namely the method of reserving axle loads ( here , the “ method of reserving axle loads ” means that a train makes room at the departing station , so that the train can pick up some wagons at other stations ) , which can improve the delivery speed of high value-added shipments in regions without express train services as well as attract more high value-added shipments to the railway .

In a railway freight system , commodities can be divided into two categories : bulk commodities ( e. g. , coal , ore , oil , etc. ) and high value-added commodities ( e. g. , electronics , foods , etc. ) .

According to statistics released by the China Railway , from 2015 to 2018 , the total amount of freight transported by railway first decreased and then increased , while the number of high value-added shipments continually increased .

Section 3 introduces the delivery methods of general trains and express trains and puts forward the method of using the long-distance direct train to transport the high value-added shipments in the area without express train services .

The model can be solved in four scenarios : reserving axle loads for departing ; reserving axle loads for arriving ; reserving axle loads for both departing and arriving ; and not reserving axle loads .

The transportation of bulk commodities is generally less sensitive to shipping time but concerned more with shipping costs , while that of high value-added shipments is usually concerned with shipping time and punctuality .
