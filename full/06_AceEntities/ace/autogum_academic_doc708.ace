However , the above research methods have some limitations : the AHP method may be too subjective when comparing the importance of various indicators ; the entropy weight method can obtain relatively objective results , but it has higher requirements on the number of data samples ; and multi-objective linear weighting and SFA require a definite function to show the relationship between high-quality development efficiency and influencing factors , which is easily affected by the misspecification and , thus , leads to inaccurate results .

These research methods follow nearly the same research idea : firstly , establishing an evaluation system in advance ; secondly , selecting different kinds of indicators ; thirdly , determining the weights of them through the analytic hierarchy process , multi-objective linear weighting method , and entropy value method , etc. ; and , finally , conducting a comprehensive assessment of the high-quality development of research objects .

Therefore , this paper firstly evaluates the high-quality innovation development level of 30 provinces and municipalities in mainland China ; secondly , on the basis of the evaluation results , it introduces role theory to determine the role of different governments in promoting high-quality innovation development of the provinces and municipalities .

As to the advantages of super-efficiency DEA model , it does not need to determine the index construction function relation in advance , which can avoid the influence of subjective factors on the model construction and can distinguish the efficiency value of effective and non-effective decision-making units .

With the reflection on the rapid economic development in the past 40 years of reform and opening-up , China ’s economic development has shifted its focus from scale and speed to efficiency and quality , which also symbolizes the start of China ’s high-quality development .
