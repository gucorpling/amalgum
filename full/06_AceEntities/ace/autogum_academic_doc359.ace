Numerous techniques have been developed over the past years , which can be classified in the following three major methods : ( a ) binding to a solid support ( carrier ) , ( b ) entrapment ( encapsulation ) in polymer networks , or ( c ) cross-linking in the form of cross-linked enzyme aggregates ( CLEAs ) or cross-linked enzyme crystals ( CLECs ) .
