In the soil security concept , soil capability currently refers to “ …the ability of the soil to function , and in particular answers the question ‘ what can the soil do ? ’ ” ( p. 17 ) . McBratney et al. further suggest that soil capability can be thought of “ … as a reference state that defines an optimal capacity of the soil to which the current condition of the soil can be compared ” .

There is a recognition that soil capability has a link to soil management , and that soil should be managed within its capability . McBratney et al. also recognise that the response of the soil condition to land management is included within the soil capability dimension , “ …the management of soil over longer periods of time may result in changes to the soil which needs to be accounted for ” ( p. 206 ) .

An important implication is that while soil condition indicates the actual state of the soil at the time of measurement , soil capability , while making assessment of the potential capacity of the soil to perform various functions , it also makes predictions about how soil condition changes with time .

Both the soil properties and land features can be used to assess the soil and land capability . Dominati et al. and McBratney et al. acknowledge that soils are part of the landscape and that land features or land qualities have a bearing on land evaluation and soil capability .

This was the approach common in land capability schemes such as Klingebiel and Montgomery , Emery and Helms , or the land and soil capability schemes of the Office of Environment and Heritage ( OEH ) and Levin et al. .

In the latest use of the term capability for land evaluation , it has been defined as “ land and soil ” capability , in which both land features and specific soil properties are used in the evaluation .

However , once the extent of the land to be assessed expands beyond a field , the landform is no longer constant , and at the catchment/regional scales , the climate is no longer constant .

The difference between the baseline condition of the soil in the reference state and the current soil condition , the phenoform can be used as a quantified measure of the soil capability .

One interpretation is that the soil capability defines or predicts what are the mechanisms or “ forcings ” that change the soil condition from the reference state to the current condition .

As it is intended to be used , the scale at which soil capability can be applied is specific soil type or to an area defined by a soil mapping unit .

A soil mapping unit represents a parcel or tract of land and this will be characterised by series of land features as well as soil properties ( Table in Reference ) .

Frequently , and possibly mostly in its application , the soil capability of a soil mapping unit , or group of soil mapping units will be the object of assessment .

In fact , soil capability can define how the soil condition responds to stresses , pressures , influences or forcings imposed on the soil by the environment and land management .

At the field scale , it is possible that assessment of the soil capability can be dominated by soil properties alone because the climate and landform features are approximately constant .

Hence , its assessment ideally should include information about land management and how this can change soil properties and about environmental variables such as climate and landform .
