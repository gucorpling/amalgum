While more frequent earthquakes are less of a problem for regions like the Midwest , a geology professor from the University of Southern Indiana , Dr. Paul K. Doss , believes the disposal of wastewater from the hydraulic fracturing ( or " fracking " ) process used in extracting oil and gas has the possibility to pose potential problems for groundwater .

" From a purely seismic perspective these are not big earthquakes that are going to cause damage or initiate , as far as we know , any larger kinds of earthquakes activity for Midwest . [ The issue ] is a water quality issue in terms of the ground water resources that we use .

While the USGS group which conducted the study says it is unclear how the earthquake rates may be related to oil and gas production , they 've made the correlation between the disposal of wastewater used in fracking and the recent upsurge in earthquakes .

It was said in the study released by the New Brunswick University professors that if fracking wastewater would contaminate groundwater , that current conventional water treatment would not be sufficient enough to remove the high concentration of chemicals used in fracking .

Oil wells , which are under regulation , pump out salt water known as brine , and after brine is pumped out of the ground it ’s disposed of by being pumped back into the ground .

The regulation is tied to the ‘ the run-of-the-mill ’ disposal of waste , in other words the rush to produce this gas has occurred before regulatory agencies have had the opportunity to respond .

According to the USGS study , the increase in injecting wastewater into the ground may explain the sixfold increase of earthquakes in the central part of the United States from 2000 - 2011 .
