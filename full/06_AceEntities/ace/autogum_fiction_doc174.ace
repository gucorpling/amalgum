And next he was entering Frank ’s restaurant in Montgomery Street , San Francisco ; he had ordered a pan-stew and venison chops , of which he was immoderately fond , and as he sat waiting , Munroe , the good attendant , brought him a whisky punch ; he saw the strawberries float on the delectable cup , he heard the ice chink about the straws .

He had a vision of a high-lying cattle-drive in California , and the bed of a dried stream with one muddy pool , by which the vaqueros had encamped : splendid sun over all , the big bonfire blazing , the strips of cow browning and smoking on a skewer of wood ; how warm it was , how savoury the steam of scorching meat !

He could have broken forth in curses ; he could have stood there , like a mortified tramp , and shaken his fist and vented his gall upon her by the hour — or so he thought ; and the next moment his heart bled for the girl . ‘ Poor creature , it ’s little she knows ! ’ he sighed .

We have seen John in nothing but the stormiest condition ; we have seen him reckless , desperate , tried beyond his moderate powers ; of his daily self , cheerful , regular , not unthrifty , we have seen nothing ; and it may thus be a surprise to the reader to learn that he was studiously careful of his health .

WHERE he ran at first , John never very clearly knew ; nor yet how long a time elapsed ere he found himself in the by-road near the lodge of Ravelston , propped against the wall , his lungs heaving like bellows , his legs leaden-heavy , his mind possessed by one sole desire — to lie down and be unseen .

If he were to sit there and die of cold , there would be mighty little gained ; better the police cell and the chances of a jury trial , than the miserable certainty of death at a dyke-side before the next winter ’s dawn , or death a little later in the gas-lighted wards of an infirmary .

And then he woke again to his detested fate , and found himself sitting , humped together , in a windy combe of quarry refuse — darkness thick about him , thin flakes of snow flying here and there like rags of paper , and the strong shuddering of his body clashing his teeth like a hiccough .
