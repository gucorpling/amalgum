In findings published earlier this month in Ecological Applications , scientists from the University of Washington and Center for Ecosystem Sentinels examine the reason for the plummeting numbers of female Magellanic penguins , Spheniscus magellanicus , that have been reported at the birds ' breeding sites in South America over the past twenty years and more .

Since 1983 , the research team has been putting stainless steel bands on tens of thousands of chicks hatched at the Punta Tombo breeding site in Argentina , noting which juvenile and adult birds make it back to the site the next year and extrapolating how many lived and died .

Penguins and other seabirds are also important to study because they tell us something about the health of the ocean ecosystems they feed in , similar to the use of canaries to test air quality in coal mines .

According to the data , since 1987 , overall population of Magellanic penguins in Punta Tombo at one of their annual breeding sites in Argentina has declined 40 % , while the male-to-female ratio has greatly increased .

But now we 're starting to understand that , to help Magellanic penguins , you have to protect waters where they feed in winter , which are thousands of miles north from Punta Tombo .

Findings also suggested the pronounced sex disparity might make population models used to predict survival among other birds with a more even gender balance inappropriate for use on Megallanic penguins .

" The findings suggested a disparity in the death rate of juvenile and adult penguins , rather than differences in chick survival , account for this difference .
