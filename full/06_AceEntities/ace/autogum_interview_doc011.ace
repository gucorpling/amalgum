Do you have any thoughts about how sponges could survive periods of time in the distant past when the Mars axial tilt exceeds 45 degrees , for instance , might there be subsurface oxygen-rich oases in caves that recolonize the surface ?

We were also tempted to speculate about this temporal driver but realized that we still know so little about the potential for life on Mars/principles of life that anything related to this question would be pure speculation , unfortunately .

When asked about plans for a future model that might include seasonal timescales , StamenkoviÄ‡ told Wikinews , " Yes , we are now exploring the kinetics part and want to see what happens on shorter timescales .

Could the brines that Nilton Renno and his teams simulated , forming on salt/ice interfaces within minutes in Mars simulation conditions , get oxygenated in the process of formation ?

Wikinews asked StamenkoviÄ‡ if he had any ideas about whether and how sponges could survive through times when the tilt was higher and less oxygen would be available :

Wikinews also asked StamenkoviÄ‡ how their research is linked to the recent discovery of possible large subglacial lake below the Martian South Pole found through radar mapping .

StamenkoviÄ‡ et al 's model also takes account of the tilt of the Mars axis , which varies much more than Earth 's does .

I notice from your figure [ 4 ] that there is enough oxygen for sponges only at tilts of about 45 degrees or less .

( It looks like about 45 degrees from the figure but the paper does n't seem to give a figure for this . )

Could the oxygen get through ice into layers of brines such as the possible subglacial lakes at a depth of 1.5 km ?

The radiolytic power for this would come from radionuclides naturally contained in rocks , something we observe in diverse regions on Earth .

If not , how long would it take for them to get oxygenated to levels sufficient for aerobic microbes ?

Also what is the exact figure for the tilt at which oxygen levels sufficient for sponges become possible ?
