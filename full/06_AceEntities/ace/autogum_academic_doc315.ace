Many research studies have successfully applied this method to evaluate the effect of different parameters on the optical performance of solar collectors . Chen et al. used ray-tracing method to analyze the optical performance of an E-W oriented CPC collector coupled with tubular receiver for different truncation heights of reflectors and tilt angles . Terron-Hernandez et al. also applied the ray-tracing technique to investigate the energy availability at the receiver surface for static and multi-position setups in E-W installations .

Gallagher and Winston reviewed basic principles of the non-imaging optical design of CPCs for some selected arrangements of evacuated and non-evacuated solar collectors . Derrick et al. analyzed different concentrators with non-evacuated tubular absorbers and compared annual energy collection for East-West ( E-W ) and North-South ( N-S ) orientations . Aguilar-Jiménez et al. also developed and experimentally tested a CPC collector integrated with a non-evacuated concentric tube receiver .

Thermal performance of N-S oriented collectors was slightly better than E-W installation during cloudy or hazy conditions . Nkwetta et al. modified a heat pipe array by integrating it with an internal CPC and compared the thermal performance with another array comprising of an internal CPC coupled with direct flow absorber for both evacuated and non-evacuated options .

Owing to the promising benefits of these collectors , many researchers have designed and evaluated CPC collectors for various low-to-medium temperature applications , including industrial process heat , solar heating and cooling , water treatment and purification , methanol reforming and hydrogen production , building-integrated water heating systems and photovoltaic/thermal ( PV/T ) hybrid systems .

The experimental results revealed that N-S arrangement showed better performance at relatively lower temperatures ( <165 °C ) while E-W installation was best for higher temperatures ( with 40 % efficiency at 200 °C ) , probably due to higher concentration ratio for this arrangement .

Energy collection in a CPC collector greatly depends on the absorption of concentrated radiations at the absorber surface which is affected by configuration , material and surface properties of collector components as well as manufacturing and alignment accuracy .

It is worth noting that thermal losses from the non-evacuated receivers of concentrating collectors are increased due to higher surface temperatures resulting from solar radiation concentrated on the smaller area of the absorbers .
