And because he stood thus between the two races of men , his exact social status a subject always open to argument , not even the fact that he was looked upon by the Harts as one of the family , with his own bed always ready for him in a corner of the big room set apart for the boys , and with a certain place at the table which was called his -- not even his assured position there could keep him from sometimes feeling quite alone , and perhaps a trifle bitter over his loneliness .

Put when he sold his last claim -- others he had which promised little and so did not count -- he had signed his name with an X. Another had written the word John before that X , and the word Imsen after ; above , a word which he explained was “ his , ” and below the word “ mark . ” John Imsen had stared down suspiciously at the words , and he had not felt quite easy in his mind until the bag of gold coins was actually in his keeping .

In the very teeth of that , and in spite of the fact that he was neither very good , nor an Indian -- nor in any sense “ dead” -- men called Grant Imsen “ Good Indian ” to his face ; and if he resented the title , his resentment was never made manifest -- perhaps because he had grown up with the name , he rather liked it when he was a little fellow , and with custom had come to take it as a matter of course .

Phoebe Hart had mothered him from the time when his father had sickened and died in her house , leaving Grant there with twelve years behind him , in his hands a dirty canvas bag of gold coin so heavy he could scarce lift it , which stood for the mining claim the old man had just sold , and the command to invest every one of the gold coins in schooling .

The money had lasted long enough to take him through a preparatory school and into the second year of a college ; and the only result apparent was speech a shade less slipshod than that of his fellows , and a vocabulary which permitted him to indulge in an amazing number of epithets and in colorful vituperation when the fancy seized him .

And Grant , if he had little taste for the task , had learned books and other things not mentioned in the curriculums of the schools she sent him to -- and when the bag was reported by Phoebe to be empty , he had returned with inward relief to the desultory life of the Hart ranch and its immediate vicinity .

When , two months after that , he had faced -- incredulously , as is the way with strong men -- the fact that for him life was over , with nothing left to him save an hour or so of labored breath and a few muttered sentences , he did not forget that vow .

He rode , hot and thirsty and tired , from Sage Hill one day and found Hartley empty of interest , hot as the trail he had just now left thankfully behind him , and so absolutely sleepy that it seemed likely to sink into the sage-clothed earth under the weight of its own dullness .

Because his paternal ancestry went back , and back to no one knows where among the race of blue eyes and fair skin , the Indians repudiated relationship with him , and called him white man -- though they also spoke of him unthinkingly as “ Good Injun . ”
