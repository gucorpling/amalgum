But it 's a really nice thing that turns off , it 's the only thing I know that turns off that side of my brain , that turns of the right side , there 's so much problem-solving that you ca n't think of other stuff while you are doing it .

And I think in the last few years we have seen a real build-up and influx of shorter , create-your-own books , which is something I really like , because it means that 's just like ideas after idea after idea after idea sort of getting out there .

It 's a really nice to have a balance between making your own stuff from scratch , and working on other things where you do n't have to worry about the sort of world-building and creating everything , explaining everything .
