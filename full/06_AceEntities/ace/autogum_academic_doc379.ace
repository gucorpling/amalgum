First , in line with experimental studies , this study found that the efficacy messages “ Quit now ! Go to www . ikstopnu . nl . , or call the quitline at 0800 – 1995 ( free ) ” ( 1 ) were not enough to change self-efficacy levels .

However , the mediational model was partly cross-sectional , making it difficult to draw causal conclusions about the relationships between all outcomes , notably those between the policy-specific variable and the mediators , both of which were measured at the same wave .

Nonetheless , since the construction of the mediational model tested in this study was based on the ITC conceptual model and behavior change theories , the results provide some support for the possible causal pathways from health warning salience to quit attempts .

We based our mediational model on the ITC conceptual model , which hypothesizes that policies influence quit attempts and smoking cessation via health warning salience as a policy specific variable and a set of eight potential psychosocial mediators .

The knowledge , as communicated by the current EU tobacco health warnings , may not have been enough to motivate smokers to quit smoking , contrary to another study , but sufficient research on this is lacking .

Second , in addition to inconclusive results on the direction and size of the association between health warning salience and quit intention in previous literature , we found no direct association between both variables .

Another strength of this study is the use of a longitudinal design that is conducive for demonstrating the causality of the tested pathways between the psychosocial mediators and quit attempts and smoking cessation .

A study from Thailand also found a positive association between health warning salience and such attitude , and experimental studies showed that PHWs could be effective to elicit a negative smoking attitude .

The pathway from health warning salience to quit intention to quit attempts , and to smoking cessation was mediated by two psychosocial mediators between health warning salience and quit intention .

Second , health warning salience was associated with increased self-reports that health warnings stopped smokers from having a cigarette when they were about to smoke one and avoiding health warnings .

Perceived social norms were associated with quit attempts at follow-up , as also found in a previous study , although sometimes , this association is mediated by quit intention .

Furthermore , health warning salience was associated with three psychosocial mediators that were not directly or indirectly associated with quit intention , quit attempts , or smoking cessation .

A major strength of this study is that due to the high number of respondents and the imputation of missing data , we had high statistical power .

In line with other population-based studies , avoidance of health warnings did not have negative effects on quit intention , quit attempts , or smoking cessation .

First , health warning salience was associated with more knowledge about the health risks of smoking , in line with other longitudinal observational studies .

First , we found positive associations between health warning salience and attitude towards quitting , and between health warning salience and health worries .

Health warning salience might have been positively associated with stronger perceived social norms due to the accompanying ( THWs ) :
