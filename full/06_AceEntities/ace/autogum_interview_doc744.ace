( running computer hardware at a higher clock rate than normally ) is more of an enjoyment for senior gamers or engineers , while the average computer users may lack the basic concepts of it , causing hardware to halt when they attempt it .

With those issues in mind , Wikinews freelance reporter Rico Shen interviewed Peter " Shamino " Tan , an overclocking expert from Singapore , to clear up some of the basic issues relating to overclocking .

: 3D Mark , CPU-Z , PCMark05 , SysTool , CPUCool , and CPUIdle are often used for overclocking , but it depends on the individual users to make their own decisions .

But , in fact , if someone does proper research over the Internet before doing overclocking , then an relatively safe overclocking test can be tried .

: If someone wants to try overclocking , all hardware should be waterproof and safety is a paramount issue that experts should be concerned about .

If they are seeking to raise the profile of this pavilion by winning awards , I do n't think it 's practical .

I remember that in a conference , an expert recommended engineers to be cautious for safety reasons , why is that ?

: I remember that a foreign magazine set up this pavilion for companies to examine performances in it .

But some senior engineers also try overclocking tests to examine performance on newly-developed hardware before marketing it .
