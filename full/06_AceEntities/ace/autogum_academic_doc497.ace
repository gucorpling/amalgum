To date , the best protocols showing the highest EC yields were developed by culturing a monolayer of hiPSCs on a matrix-coated culture plate and by treating them with different molecules or growth factors in a timed fashion in order to guide the progressive differentiation of hiPSCs toward the EC lineage .

In view of this , several authors have exploited GSK3 inhibitors to differentiate hiPSCs into ECs . Patsch et al. exposed a monolayer of hiPSC to GSK3 inhibitor CHIR-99021 ( CHIR ) and to mesoderm inducer bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( BMP4 ) .

Monolayer differentiation holds a significantly higher efficiency that depends on external factors , such as medium constituents , showing a final yield that is still too low in the view of clinical applications .

This method is affected by low efficiency ( 1 â€“ 5 % ) and slow production rate ; however , differentiation can be improved by adding proper growth factors to the culture medium .
