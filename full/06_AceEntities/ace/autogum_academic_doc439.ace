Also , the use of these by-products as ruminant feedstuffs could reduce competition between ruminants and humans ( or other non-ruminant farm animals ) for food or land , contributing to moderate the demand for feed resources ( cereals or forage ) by these species .

Therefore , there is a need for information on the chemical composition and nutritive value of materials and by-products derived from agriculture , horticulture and fruit farming to expand our knowledge on their potential as feedstuffs before making recommendations about their inclusion in ruminant diets .

The potential use of these by-products as ingredients in ruminant diets could reduce the environmental impact of the disposal of these residues , and would favour of the development of a circular economy by recycling the biomass derived from crop production .
