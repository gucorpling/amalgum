Applying a budget limit on the investment cost with an investment period of five and ten years results in 5 % and 13 % decrease in NPV and 9 % and 12 % decrease in CO2 savings compared to the solution without any budget limitation but they still provide significant improvement compared to the baseline .

To simulate a more industrially-realistic scenario ( i. e. , refurbishment planning of plant infrastructure ) , an investment budget is imposed and the investment period is restricted to the first five or ten years , with the possibility of transferring budget from one year to the next .

Although more conservative investment planning strategies result in slightly lower savings in the operating cost , they still lead to reductions of ~50 M€ , or , in other words , a payback time of less than two years for the investments .

The optimal solution using the proposed method without investment restrictions leads to a ~463 M€ increase in the NPV of the system and 7748 kt CO2 savings compared to the baseline , owing to operating cost benefits of investment decisions .

As the investment strategy becomes more conservative ( i. e. , lower annual budget in a longer investment period ) , competition between investment in energy conversion technologies and inter-plant steam pipes increases , as parallel investments are not feasible .

When the investment budget and period are not limited , all investments improving the operating cost are made in the first year , to maximise benefits from the operating cost savings as long as possible .
