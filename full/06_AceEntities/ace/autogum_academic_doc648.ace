In particular , some methodological differences in the spindle analysis should be taken into account : ( a ) Saletin et al. did not provide a specific spindle detection , analyzing the whole sigma band ; ( b ) some protocols did not include parietal derivations , where the spindles typically show their maximum .

Indeed , the longer SOL , the shorter TST , along with the reduced SE and the indices of faster transition of stages/cycles ( e. g. , a higher rate of SS and a greater number of sleep cycles ) reflect -to some extent- the sleep dysregulation in ADHD .

Although no other differences in SWS were found , it should be underlined that both stage 4 amount and REM sleep density were correlated with the improvement in motor skills performance after sleep in children with ADHD , as assessed by Prehn-Kristensen et al. .

On the one hand , the assumption that children with ADHD have an altered sleep architecture is consistent with the subjective parent reports , mentioning a delayed sleep onset or a sleep fragmentation with several night awakenings .

In this regard , the bedtime resistance could depend on multiple factors : ( a ) inadequate parenting ; ( b ) Inadequate pre-sleep bed routines and/or sleep environment ; ( c ) pharmacotherapy side-effects .

Specifically , several findings highlighted that REM sleep duration is longer in children with ADHD compared to controls , and only Gruber et al. found a reduced amount of REM sleep in ADHD .

The subjective reports of increased SOL — confirmed only by some investigations using objective measures ( e. g. , ) — may be explained by “ behavioral ” sleep problems occurring before bedtime .

In this respect , a strong relationship between SDB and ADHD behavior was found ( e. g. , ) , likely inducing the disruption of sleep homeostasis and less deep sleep .

We have to underline that a lower SWS has been found in an ADHD sample characterized by a higher rate of comorbidities or when a higher apnea-hypopnea index was detected .

This study suggested a possible beneficial role of sleep on tasks measuring procedural memory in ADHD , that – instead- showed compromised performance during the waking state .

As already suggested , the increased number of sleep cycles may result in a faster transition to REM sleep , contributing to the increased REM sleep amount .

REM sleep alterations could be related to the dysfunctional reward learning , one of the core deficits of ADHD , due to the dopamine hypofunction .

In light of the above , it is fair to assume that subjective reports could overestimate sleep problems in ADHD , reflecting parental concerns .
