We did n't push it too strongly , because there are a lot of challenges in moving to an eCensus and running it as complementary to the traditional pen-and-paper census , and I think both Australia and New Zealand - New Zealand was about 7 % and Australia was between 9 and 10 % - were very pleased with the level of response , and the level of feedback from the community here in Australia was that those that completed their census forms online thought that it was a very positive experience , and so I think we 've positioned ourselves well for 2011 to try and encourage and be perhaps a little more on the front foot of encouraging more Australians to complete the census online rather than the traditional pen-and-paper , but it 'll only be after the event that we 'll know how successful we 've been .

: I 'm told that the quality of the responses in the electronic census were slightly higher than with pen-and-paper , and it 's possible - it 's very difficult to know , but it 's possible that the sequencing , which is one of the things that people found attractive in the electronic instrument , so that , you know , you were taken straight from the last question to the next relevant question that you needed to answer .

: No , I think the 2011 census , as I said , will have a traditional pen-and-paper and obviously an electronic lodgement option as well , I think 2011 will be very much a repeat of what we 've done in 2006 , but we may see a bigger proportion of the responses moving from pen-and-paper to electronic .

I thought that we might look at some of the things that actually happened during the past year , firstly just things that have happened with the Bureau , and probably one of the biggest things that happened last year was the release of 2006 Census data .

The other thing that 's happened in the past year is the release of the 2008 Year Book , and in fact the release of all the Year Books from 1908 to 2008 on the ABS web site .

I think that may have had a little bit of an impact on the quality because people felt they 've moved through the questionnaire more quickly .
