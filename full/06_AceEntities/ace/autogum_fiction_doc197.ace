There seemed no doubt that she had been married to Bevis , Lord Fauntleroy , and had quarreled with him and had been paid to keep away from him ; but Mr. Havisham found out that her story of the boy 's being born in a certain part of London was false ; and just when they all were in the midst of the commotion caused by this discovery , there came the letter from the young lawyer in New York , and Mr. Hobbs 's letters also .

It took the less time because , after all , the woman who had called herself Lady Fauntleroy was not nearly so clever as she was wicked ; and when she had been closely pressed by Mr. Havisham 's questions about her marriage and her boy , she had made one or two blunders which had caused suspicion to be awakened ; and then she had lost her presence of mind and her temper , and in her excitement and anger had betrayed herself still further .

But one fine morning , as she sat in her sitting-room at the inn called “ The Dorincourt Arms , ” making some very fine plans for herself , Mr. Havisham was announced ; and when he entered , he was followed by no less than three persons -- one was a sharp-faced boy and one was a big young man and the third was the Earl of Dorincourt .

It had taken only a few minutes , apparently , to change all the fortunes of the little boy dangling his red legs from the high stool in Mr. Hobbs 's store , and to transform him from a small boy , living the simplest life in a quiet street , into an English nobleman , the heir to an earldom and magnificent wealth .

She was told nothing , and Mr. Havisham kept her from suspecting anything by continuing to have interviews with her , in which he assured her he was investigating her statements ; and she really began to feel so secure that her spirits rose immensely and she began to be as insolent as might have been expected .
