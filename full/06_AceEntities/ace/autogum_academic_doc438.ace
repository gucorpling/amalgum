The International Labor Office , through the Guide on the collection of agricultural production , makes a series of determinations regarding the support of transport costs both by the members and the cooperative , diversified according to product categories , perishability , durability , value , and season .

In addition , at this stage , the co-operators must understand that the participation in the cooperative is a medium and long-term investment , and that the initial contribution must be supplemented , together with the maintenance and development of the group cohesion for a harmonious operation of the cooperative .

The involvement of the participants in the cooperative through the capital , in a regulated proportion , represents , in Ostrom ’s opinion , “ a collection of both formal and informal forms and standards ” that determine the members to work together and to cooperate .

In order to comply with the objective of the agricultural cooperative to obtain better prices than by individual trade or by trade immediately after harvest , the existence of at least one collection/storage space of the harvest is important for the sale at advantageous prices .

As Cook and Burress state , it is necessary for the members to understand both the benefits of the cooperative ( economic justification ) and its role of common protection of the cooperative members , as compared to the individual risk .

Given the complexity of the relationships within a cooperative , represented using each member ’s own production factors and their desire to exercise control and ownership , the cooperatives cannot be viewed in the same way as other enterprises .

The absence of the three elements of the initial stage , which ensures the cohesion of the group , including the trust , capital , and communication between members , discourages their involvement in collective actions .

According to Iliopoulos , the traditional agricultural cooperatives must be in a continuous development process in order to be able to resist the market and to cope with the challenges and competition .

The same opinion is also expressed by Bercu , who draws attention on the strengthening of the farmer ’s position in the food chain , in order to combat unfair commercial practices .

Under these conditions , the main financing sources of agricultural cooperatives during the setup phase are represented by the share capital deposited by the members and by accessing non-reimbursable funds/subsidies .
