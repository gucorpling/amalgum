In the early 1970s , phytochemists such as Youyou Tu investigated plants used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine and identified the usefulness of the traditional remedy qinghaosu in eradicating Plasmodium spp . infections , the causative agent of malaria , for which she received a Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2015 .

Following the cloning and expression of CYP71AV1 , which converts amorpha-4,11-diene to artemisinic alcohol and aldehyde , Zhang et al. characterized the artemisinic aldehyde Δ11(13 ) reductase ( Double bond reductase 2 , Dbr2 ) , which preferentially reduces artemisinic aldehyde to dihydroartemisinic aldehyde .
