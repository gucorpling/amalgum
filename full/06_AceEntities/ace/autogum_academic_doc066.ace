Physiologically , these AGEs are formed in response to so-called “ dicarbonyl stress ” as given under conditions of hyperglycemia or in the presence of highly reactive α-dicarbonyls ( α-DCs ) such as glyoxal ( GO ) , methylglyoxal ( MGO ) or 3-deoxyglucosone .

Aging-associated disabilities are generated by an accumulation of randomly occurring molecular damages during life time , which affect the organism at multiple levels such as metabolism , immune response , repair , and regeneration as well as altered inter- and intracellular communication .

Activation of the pathway leads to the stabilization of β-catenin and its accumulation within the cytosol and the nucleus , where it interacts with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor ( TCF/LEF ) transcription factors and thereby regulates transcription of multiple target genes .
