The systemic inflammatory environment created by the arthritis induction leads to decreased metabolic activity and proliferation of CIA-derived MSC , and increased differentiation capacity determined by the expression of osteogenic ( runt-related transcription factor 2 ( RUNX2 ) and alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) ) , and chondrogenic ( aggrecan ( ACAN ) ) markers in basal conditions .

Our results have shown that the combination of the two models is feasible and that CIA animals respond to the bone injury with a significant increase of systemic myeloid cells number and their co-stimulatory molecules ( CD40 and CD86 ) expression , accompanied by increased levels of IL-13 , IL-2 , and IL-6 in plasma .

In fact , the similarity to human RA regarding the disease clinical , histological , and immunological signals — including high articular levels of inflammatory cytokines — like tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) , make it an invaluable model to study the pathologic process and to search new therapeutic strategies .

MSC are multipotent progenitor cells with the potential to differentiate into mesenchymal lineage tissues ( e. g. , bone , cartilage , and adipose tissue ) , described to have immunomodulatory roles , being capable of recruiting different cell types and promoting tissue repair .

Over the last decades , animal models — especially the rodent models — have been crucial tools for understanding the biologic process of RA , and their use can aid in developing new therapeutic strategies for fracture healing in RA inflammatory conditions .

Herein , we propose CIA as a reliable model to study bone regeneration in inflammatory conditions , and additionally we investigate the effect of RA induction on the biological behavior of endogenous MSC as crucial cells involved in repair/regeneration .

The incidence rate of overall fractures in RA patients is 33 per 1000 person-years , and the risk is increased with disease activity and associated with overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can disturb the bone remodeling process .
