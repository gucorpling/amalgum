We looked at individuals that had been sexed using both a certain method ( e. g. genetics ) and visual methods to calculate how often we got it right based on visual cues alone and found that we have very high accuracy .

: Because penguins migrate such long distances over the non-breeding season , a mixture of tools ( including no-take marine protected areas and traditional fisheries management tools , like catch limits ) is likely to be needed .

: In a separate study currently under review , we have shown that aggression between males of Magellanic penguins is higher when the sex ratio at the colony is more skewed towards males .

And , of course , everyone can contribute to penguin conservation by reducing their plastic waste , making more sustainable food choices , and reducing their carbon footprint .

: The two main threats to the food sources of this colony are climate change , which cause shifts in primary productivity and fish stocks , and fisheries .

: We have some methods of sexing penguins that we feel confident about — using genetics or measures of cloaca size around egg laying , for example .

However , these methods are time intensive , so we have also developed visual cues for sex penguins ( bill size , behavior , forehead shape ) .

Single male penguins sometimes intrude [ on ] nests of mated pairs and interrupt the incubation of eggs or feeding of chicks , leading to mortality .

Although there is currently some spatial protection surrounding the species ’ breeding colony , this protection does not extend to their migratory route .

We also showed that nearly all females at the colony breed but that , over time , fewer and fewer males find mates .
