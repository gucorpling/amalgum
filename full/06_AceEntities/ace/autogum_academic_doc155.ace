Specifically , from the perspective of government functions , the supervision of the electric power industry in China is mainly carried out by the National Development and Reform Commission ( NDRC ) , the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Management Commission of the State Council ( SASAC ) , the National Energy Administration ( NEA ) , and other auxiliary departments .

In addition , China ’s power grid enterprises have high administrative level and monopoly status , which increase the information asymmetry between the government and enterprises , bring many obstacles to the implementation of regulatory policies , and lead to the high cost of power grid enterprises and the difficulty of rationalizing the pricing mechanism of power transmission and distribution .

Reference argued that China ’s regulatory capacity should be comprehensively enhanced from three aspects : ( 1 ) strengthening the incentive supervision of transmission and distribution links , ( 2 ) vigilance against market forces , and ( 3 ) strengthening the overall planning of electricity reform and environmental policies .
