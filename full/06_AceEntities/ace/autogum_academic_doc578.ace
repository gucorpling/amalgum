Therefore , any Physicality Quantifier dos not change in time under their action : ( 44 ) Given a monotonically decreasing functional on , one may distinguish between an internal information content relative to the systems S , only ; namely , ( 45 ) and a global one concerning the entire closed compound system together with its statistical ensembles of the form , the environment state being the equilibrium state from which , together with , one derives the reduced dynamics of the open system S .

By subtracting from the global information content the internal one , one gets a measure of the information external to S : ( 46 ) Since the dynamics of is unitary , is constant in time ; then , ( 47 ) Therefore , if decreases , the information content of the environment increases ; this is an effect that can be interpreted as a flow of information from the system S to the environment E .

( 42 ) This expression vanishes only when and it has been much used in describing entropy production in quantum thermodynamics . Recently , it has been shown that Positivity of is sufficient to ensure that ( 43 ) Though the relative entropy , being unbounded on , is not a Physicality Quantifier as in Definition 2 , we will nevertheless consider it as such by virtue of its monotonic behaviour .

Rather , lack of Markovianity is identified with back-flow of information as witnessed by the lack of monotonicity of some Physicality Quantifier of a certain degree that might be higher than that of the trace-distance or of the generalised trace-distance and might thus require statistical ensembles comprising more than two density matrices .

Indeed , whether the latter goes into the system S from the environment E or vice versa from S into E can be witnessed by suitable bounded functionals from all possible statistical ensembles of states of S into the positive reals , that monotonically decrease under the action of Completely Positive maps .

The most used among such Physicality Quantifiers are the trace-distance ( see ( 35 ) ) ( 40 ) and the extended trace distance ( 41 ) Both these Physicality Quantifiers involve two density matrices and thus act on the first one being characterised by fixed weights .

However , lack of Markovianity is not identified with lack of CP-divisibility ; indeed , as we have seen , the trace-distances and the relative entropy behave monotonically also under the action of P-divisible , but not necessarily CP-divisible maps .

The fact that , unlike CP-divisibility , P-divisibility is not stable under double tensorisation represents a puzzle within another approach to non-Markovianity that identifies it with an information back-flow from the environment E into the open quantum system S .

All the three previous functionals on measure the degree of distinguishability of two density matrices and can thus be related to how the information about the system S behaves in time : the argument goes as follows .

Both these quantities decrease under Positive ( and thus a fortiori under Completely Positive ) maps because , as already observed , Positive trace-preserving maps are contractive with respect to the trace-norm .
