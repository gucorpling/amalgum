Plus , I think it is important to give WikiLeaks credit for raising awareness about in how bad shape freedom of information and expression is in our world and it is eroding at an alarming rate because of the fact that legal firms for corporations and corrupt politicians have understood the borderless nature of the legalities of the information flow online – we who feel it is important that people have access to information that should remain in the public domain need to step up our fight for those rights .

A lot of our dirty laundry has been aired via the USA cables – our diplomatic communications with USA were leaked in those cables , so far they have not stirred much debate nor shock .

I want to stress that I understand the reasoning of trying to get to Assange through me , but I find it unacceptable since there is no foundation for criminal investigation against him .

It is unlikely for tens of thousands of cables to leak from Iceland since we do nt have the same influence or size as the USA , nor do we have a military .
