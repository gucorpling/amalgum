In animal husbandry , I supplementation as calcium iodate , sodium iodide , and other iodine compounds is needed since the native iodine content of plant straight feed-stuffs is low ; moreover , the increasing use of rapeseed meal ( RSM ) in livestock diets is associated with the intake of glucosinolates , which are known to be iodine antagonists inhibiting the activity of sodium iodide symporter .

Moreover , we tried to correlate the information concerning the signaling pathways influenced by I supplementation , with the qualitative parameters of milk and derivatives , taking into account those studies in which it was shown that dietary iodine supplementation in ruminants contributes to an improvement in the quality of dairy products .

Consequently , several studies have been carried out to evaluate the productive performances in animals fed the I supplementation . Weiss et al. showed that I concentration increased in serum but not in milk after supplementation of this element in diets of dairy cows .

For this reason , the European community has recently brought to 5 mg/kg the maximum level of I supplementation for milk-producing ruminants ( milk intended for human consumption ) , while it remained at 10 mg/kg of complete feed for other ruminant categories .

Recently , the RNA-sequencing approach was shown to be useful to elucidate which molecular pathways are affected by I supplementation in sheeps and showed the positive effects of olive pomace-supplemented diet on inflammation and cholesterol in laying hens .

For infants , milk constitutes the only I source ; therefore , the dietary calibration of this micronutrients in dairy animals assumes relevant importance in order to obtain I-rich milk without inducing variations in animal performances .

In contrast , studies performed in small ruminants showed that I supplementation doubled the milk iodine content when compared with the control group , even though no evident effect was observed in the milk gross composition .

Among them , iodine ( I ) plays a unique role because it is the main component of the thyroid hormones , i. e. , thyroxine ( T4 ) and triiodothyronine ( T3 ) .

Thus , when the I demand is not satisfied , reduced functionality of the thyroid gland could occur ( hypothyroidism ) with negative consequences for proper mental development , body growth , and fertility .

Moreover , it was shown in lambs that high-dose potassium iodide supplementation can be effective to decrease the severity of airway viral infections , supposedly through the augmentation of mucosal oxidative defenses .

Since the thyroid gland regulates many metabolic processes , the extent of I requirement strongly depends on the age and stage of development of the individual .
