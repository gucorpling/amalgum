Each of them consists of ( i ) an N-terminal domain for oligomerization , ( ii ) a coiled-coil domain for interaction with regulatory proteins , ( iii ) a DNA-binding domain for recognition of specific DNA sequences , ( iv ) a Src homology-2 ( SH2 ) domain that triggers phosphorylation and dimerization after docking to phosphorylated receptors and ( iv ) a C-terminal transactivation domain with specific tyrosine ( Y ) ( present in all STATs ) and serine ( S ) residues ( absent in STAT2 and 6 ) that are phosphorylated upon transcriptional activation .

Second-line treatments include regorafenib and cabozantinib , also MTKIs ; nivolumab and pembrolizumab , immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death-1 ( PD-1 ) ; and ramucirumab , the first biomarker-driven therapeutics approved for HCC that targets the angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , all of which have not been established until the past few years and require further investigations .

Although local ablation and transarterial chemoembolization respectively confer 5-year survival rates of 50 â€“ 70 % and survival benefit of >6 months , they are confined to patients with single tumors or multinodular tumors with good liver reserve .
