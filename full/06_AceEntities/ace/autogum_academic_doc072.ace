Global agro-economic models incorporating water constraints on agricultural production include GLOBIOM ( GLObal BIOsphere Management model ; linked to EPIC and LPJmL ) , MAgPIE ( Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the Environment ; linked to LPJmL ) , GCAM ( Global Change Assessment Model , IMAGE ( Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment ; linked to MAGNET and LPJmL ) , and IMPACT-WATER ( International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade ) .

PE models include : ( 1 ) agro-economic , models which are designed to identify land use , management , and demand responses in the agricultural and forestry sectors ; ( 2 ) energy-economic models , which evaluate transformations of the energy sector ; and ( 3 ) hydro-economic models , which evaluate management and demand responses in the water sector .

However , it should be noted that although MAgPIE , GLOBIOM and IMAGE make production decisions at high resolution , commodity demands , prices , and trade are calculated within coarser economic regions ( up to 57 regions in GLOBIOM , 10 regions in MAgPIE , and 26 regions in IMAGE ) (

However , the results across models are quite diverse as a result of differences in the potential for endogenous productivity responses , availability of cropland , and the ease of land conversion and trade ( see and for descriptions of model differences ) .

However , the economic models add the important capability of evaluating economic trade-offs and synergies among multiple strategies for both mitigating environmental degradation and ensuring the provision of adequate and affordable food , energy , and water to meet future anthropogenic demands .

Integrated nexus frameworks have also been developed for evaluating interactions among water , energy , and land management , either through the linkage of PE models or the extension of CGE models , which endogenously capture interactions among global economic sectors .

The main response strategies that are evaluated by these models are spatial re-allocation of crops and livestock production to locations with higher productivity ( including inter-regional trade ) , expansion of managed land , agricultural intensification , and demand response .

Agro-economic models are useful for exploring the interactions between water and land management as they quantify how future food , fiber , and bioenergy demands can be met under water , land , and climate constraints and economic impacts .

This assumption may be appropriate in developed regions with sophisticated food distribution infrastructure , but may misrepresent cropland expansion and overestimate the potential for adaptation in developing regions with poor infrastructure and a reliance on subsistence farming .

Furthermore , developments are needed to improve the representation of localized water constraints , governance , and the heterogeneity of both agricultural producers and consumers in order to better account for financial and institutional constraints on adaptation .

Finally , most global agro-economic models do not track the energy requirements associated with agricultural production , which will be necessary for examining the land-energy nexus including the response of farmers to varying energy prices .

The fact that demands need only to be met by the aggregated regional production tends to concentrate agricultural expansion in the most profitable and productive areas , regardless of their proximity to demands .
