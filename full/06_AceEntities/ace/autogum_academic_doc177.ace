The proposed system consists of three functional steps : ( i ) image reconstruction using registration based on phase correlation and image composition , ( ii ) facility detection using deep learning-based object detection , and ( iii ) facility inspection using image comparison approach based on Weber contrast .

Moreover , single image-based systems cannot detect defects caused by structure ’s shape deformation and loss of components since most overhead lines and supporters consist of durable metal materials unlike tunnel walls .

To automatically inspect railway facilities , we should find out their positions and classify types of them since each type has different risk management standard for a deformed area .

It is more efficient to coarsely register two large-scale images than spatial domain-based motion estimation methods because of simple multiplication of fast Fourier transformation ( FFT ) .

Most facilities installed in the tunnel , such as overhead rigid conductors , are used to supply electric power into the train through its pantograph .
