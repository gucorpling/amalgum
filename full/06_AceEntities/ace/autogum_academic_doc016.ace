Consequently , increasing grain weight appears to result in a grain N % penalty , particularly at low N. The reduction in grain N % with increasing grain weight may reflect the high priority placed on elevating grain weight by wheat breeders rather than grain N % accumulation under low N conditions .

Therefore , the increase of shoot biomass and carbon assimilation after flowering can compete with grain demand for N. In Gazelle and QAL2000 , which are genotypes used for low GPC purposes , low N supply did not trigger accelerated development and a decrease in the time to maxAGR (

It appears that the high N requirements of plants seen in this experiment , meant that the applied N at low and medium N was mostly used for grain weight production rather than to increase grain N % .

It might be that high grain N % genotypes sense the low N status early in development and shorten their vegetative growth phase to maintain sufficient N for grain development and filling .

Accelerating the life cycle is a typical response of plants to low N. N translocation corresponds with senescence since senescing leaf and stem tissues are an important N source for grains .

The relationship between above-ground biomass and grain weight is likely to be due to the positive correlation between leaf surface area and total photosynthesis per unit ground area .

Our results indicated that the rate of t-maxAGR reduction from high to low N was related to the grain N concentration ( Table 1 and
