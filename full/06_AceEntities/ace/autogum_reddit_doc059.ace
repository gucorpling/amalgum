What kind of world do we live in that we 're telling people to be living breathing harmful stereotypes and locking the aspects of sex to a very and I mean VERY SMALL BOX ! What happened to the days where it was empowering to deny gender norms and not ruin your body for stupid reasons .

So I 'm quite passionate about this topic because not only is it grooming a bunch of GNC children and adults to think they have to transition to be the way they are ... It 's also going to bite the transgender movement hard when they experience dysphoria for real .

I ca n't see the same way I used to anymore and I have serious body dysphoria now even to the terms that my genitalia which maybe needed a light correction procedure now actually needs an intrusive surgery because of the dysphoria and anxiety it invokes in me .

Well one particular thing I thought of was the fact we lead them to healthier life styles and try to set them up on kid-friendly diets that would prevent these effects but not lead to the other body ruining aspects of HRT .

It gets worse though , those that are GNC and have no interest in doing anything but hormones are even calling themselves transsexual now ? ! How much terminology does the transgender movement have to change before they 're happy ? ! ?

It is your body and your rules but the effects of hormones are dangerous and for trans individuals it is used to help alleviate their dysphoria while they prepare for their long and grueling journey of treatments and judgement .
