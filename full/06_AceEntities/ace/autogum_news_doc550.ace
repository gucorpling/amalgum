As Heald told The Huffington Post , US surface ozone has dropped partly due to the Clean Air Act . " Despite an increase in vehicle miles driven and energy consumption , surface ozone has declined by 25 percent on average across the U.S. from 1980 to 2012 [ ... ]

A research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Colorado State University of the US and the University of Sheffield of the UK has analysed effects of global warming and ozone pollution over 2000 – 2050 on the worldwide production of wheat , rice , maize and soybean .

Results of NCLAN studies , published in a paper by AS Heagle in 1989 , show dicot species , such as soybean , cotton , and peanut , lose more yield from ozone than do monocot species such as sorghum , field corn , and winter wheat .

Depending on region and crops , the yields may be primarily sensitive to ozone — in the case of wheat — or heat — in the case of maize — alone , providing a local estimation of relative benefits of climate change adaptation versus ozone regulation .
