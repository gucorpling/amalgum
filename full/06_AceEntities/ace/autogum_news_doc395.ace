We quantified bee visit rates at plant with and without ant nests , assessed the pollination effectiveness of the different flower visitors , examined the association between weaver ant presence ant fruit an seed set and finally we tested whether weaver ants were attracted to flowers .

By doing field observations in Singapore I realized that the aggressive weaver ant , Oecophylla smaragdina , spent a lot of time on rhododendron flowers causing different responses in their floral visitors .

Since then we conducted a number of experiments and observations to elucidate the role of the weaver ants , flowers visitors and the plant species in this complex system .

The researchers discovered that the flower produces substances to attract weaver ants to drive away the smaller Nomia bees , which are a worse pollinator than larger carpenter bees .

I am an evolutionary biologist interested in how ambush predators on flowers , such as crab spiders , praying mantises or ants , can modify pollinator-plant interactions .

However , the activity that took most time and attention was to determine pollen production per flower in order to evaluate pollination effectiveness of the floral visitors .

While the presence of the weaver ants on flowers deterred small floral visitors , large carpenter bees were unaffected by the presence of the ants .

The ants do n't drive away the larger bees , which pollinate the flowers and visit them more often as they get better .

Probably the most sophisticated technology we used was the microscope under which we counted pollen grains .

Additionally we developed a simple optimal-foraging model and compared its prediction with observed patterns .
