If we admit that the references of sentences are situations ( states of affairs ) that these sentences describe ( in analogy with the assumption that the semantic references of terms are objects named by these terms ) , then the Fregean principle is not only a semantic principle , but also an ontological one which imposes a quantitative restriction on the universe of situations : there are at most two situations described by sentences .

Thus , the advocate of classical logic , if he is also a proponent of the Fregean semantic principles , must accept that all true sentences have one and the same denotation , namely the logical value , and denotation of all false sentences is the logical value .

Therefore , in the non-Fregean approach , it is assumed that the semantic correlates of names are objects from the universe of objects , the semantic correlates of predicates are appropriate sets , and the semantic correlates of sentences are situations described by these sentences .

In other words , in classical logic , propositional variables occur only at the metalogical level ( they are not treated as real variables ) or , as it holds in propositional calculus , variables range over the two element set of logical values .

The consequence of Frege ’s semantic principles , according to which denotations of sentences are logical values , is usually called the Fregean principle , and every logical system that adopts this principle is called a Fregean system .

The Fregean approach can be considered as philosophically justified in the study of mathematical languages , but it is not obvious that such an approach is justified as a foundation of a philosophically adequate semantics .

It is often acknowledged that the first precisely formulated semantic principles — that serves as a foundation for contemporary formal logic and have determined its development — were presented by Frege in his Begriffsschrift .

One of the tasks of formal logic is to provide adequate tools for the formal analysis of certain fragments of natural language , as well as for the languages of particular fields of science .

The basic philosophical assumption underlying non-Fregean logic is the thesis in reality to which the language is referring , and there exist semantic correlates of all expressions that are not purely syntactic .

If two expressions have the same denotation , then they are exchangeable in any propositional context of a sentence without changing the logical value of that sentence .

From the formal point of view , the answer to this question requires , in particular , to decide what the denotation of a propositional variable is .

The debatable cases of the applicability of the Fregean account in the formalization of any language are , for instance , theories of meaning or ontology .

In classical logic , this ambiguity is removed as it identifies denotations of sentences with their truth values .
