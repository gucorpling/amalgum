The Normalized Difference Sea Ice Information Index ( ) , which is the normalized ratio of Band 20 to Band 21 in OLCI TOA reflectance images , and the Enhanced Normalized Difference Sea Ice Information Index ( ) , which is a modification of in which Bands 12 and 16 are also incorporated , can effectively detect sea ice information in the Bohai Sea and suppress most background information , such as coverage by land , cloud , and snow .

The results also show our approach can extract most of the sea ice ( including nilas ice , gray ice , and gray-white ice ) in OLCI images , but the new ice which is small and thin is hard to interpret and detect from the medium-resolution OLCI images due to the limitation of the spatial resolution .

Comparison between the results from our indexes , famous NDSI , and SVM methods indicates that sediment-laden water can interfere with sea ice extraction with the and NDSI but that the and SVM suffer from less such interference .

Overall , our proposed method provides a convenient and effective technique for sea ice detection and evolution study in the Bohai Sea , which can help monitor the recent impacts of global warming .

Moreover , it would be better to reset the threshold values when employing our indexes to detect sea ice extent in other years because the ice conditions vary with the years .

After reaching its peak in late January 2018 , sea ice coverage remained high until early February , and the sea ice then gradually melted from south to north in mid-February .

The whole period when there was ice coverage lasted for about four months , within which there was a significant expansion in mid-January and a final fading away in early March .

However , these four methods have poorer performance in detecting thin sea ice in the western Bohai Sea than they do in detecting thick sea ice .

Comparison of the extraction results with higher-resolution Sentinel-2 MSI imagery verifies that these indexes enable sea ice mapping with OLCI data in the Bohai Sea .
