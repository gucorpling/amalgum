Firstly , applying a multilevel study design allows us to analyse the relations between the leadership style of entrepreneurial firm owners ( representing a higher level of analysis — Level 2 ) and their employees ’ work behaviour ( representing a lower level , i. e. , individual-level — Level 1 ) .

Studies on innovations in general and on ecological innovations specifically tend to focus on external influences ( such as policy making and market opportunities ) , but usually ignore the processes within the company — the mechanisms operating at the micro-level which stimulate innovative behaviour .

Today , as the disreputable conduct of some company managers has been unveiled , it is significant to direct attention to the leaders ’ behaviours in terms of displaying sincerity and authenticity in work relationships rather than manipulation or work towards hidden purposes .

Leadership scholars have also noted that more studies are needed that investigate the effects of leadership behaviours at different levels of analysis , such as linking leaders ’ characteristics to the attitudes and behaviours of their employees within teams or organisations .

In the present era , the implementation of innovative ideas in organizations is crucial , both for the long-term survival of a firm and for the development of new solutions that protect the environment and the well-being of societies .

This especially prominent in small firms , which provide the majority of private employment and do not have special innovation departments , and thus the innovative behaviour of their employees is major driver of the organization ’s innovation .

Based on this , we postulate that the relationship between the authentic leadership displayed by the entrepreneurial owner and his or her employees ’ innovative behaviour is mediated by employees ’ work engagement and their personal initiative .

If the leader exhibits authenticity , his or her followers are inspired by their supervisor , they are likely to become more engaged with their assignments , and are more willing to go beyond their job description .

Authentic leadership theory defines the authentic leader as being characterized by high self-awareness , balanced processing of information , relational transparency and internalized moral perspective , and acting in accordance with their inner thoughts and feelings .

The innovative behaviour of employees , i. e. , creation and implementation of new solutions in the workplace as manifested in everyday activities , is an important micro foundation of the innovativeness of the whole firm .

High work engagement and personal initiative are expected to result in increased innovative behaviour , as they equip employees with energy and motivation , and enable them to introduce novel practices in the workplace .

Taking into account that entrepreneurs in small firms perform multiple roles and are usually direct managers of their employees , we treat them as leaders of these organizations , as proposed in other research .

We propose and test a multilevel model which postulates that the more authentic the leader is perceived to be , the more innovative behaviour his or her followers show .

However , leadership scholars have identified a lack of research addressing underlying mechanisms that explain how leaders influence important processes in organizations , including stimulation of innovativeness .

This suggests that personal motivational variables related to involvement and engagement may play a role in transferring leader ’s attitudes into employees ’ behaviours .
