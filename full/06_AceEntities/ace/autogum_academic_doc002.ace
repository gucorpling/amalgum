Although links between 8-oxo-G and human pathologies have been based largely on the analysis of total RNA , rRNA is the most abundant cellular RNA type , which typically accounts for about 80 % of the total RNA , from which one can reasonably assume that oxidative damage to ribosomes in all these pathological conditions must be widespread .

The extent of cellular RNA oxidation was reported to exceed that of DNA when cells were directly treated with H2O2 or subjected to conditions that induce secondary oxidative damage , such as UVA irradiation and ammonia overload .

Since ribosome activities in translation depend on many precisely tuned conformational changes and movements within its rRNA framework , oxidation of the bases that are critical for maintaining the correct rRNA structure may impair ribosome functions .

A striking disappearance of many guanines from mitochondrial rRNA and reduced overall RNA content may be two such evolutionary adaptations that “ hardened ” mitoribosomes against damage from the abundant ROS generated inside mitochondria .
