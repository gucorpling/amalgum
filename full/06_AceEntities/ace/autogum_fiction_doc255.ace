Hastily tidying myself up , and giving my hair a comb , as though just off to see Mr. Secretary for the Navy , or on the way to get a senator to push a new patent medicine for me , I rejoined my guide outside , and together we crossed the wide courtyard , entered the great log-built portals of Ar-hap 's house , and immediately afterwards found ourselves in a vast hall dimly lit by rays coming in through square spaces under the eaves , and crowded on both sides with guards , courtiers , and supplicants .

The returning army had apparently fallen away exhausted on its march through the town ; only some three hundred of the bodyguard straggled up the hill , limp and sweating , behind a group of pennons , in the midst of which rode a horseman whose commanding presence and splendid war harness impressed me , though I could not make out his features ; a wild , impressionist scene of black outlines , tossing headgear , and spears glittering and vanishing in front of the red glare in the sky , but nothing more .

Even the dry throats of the suitors in the courtyard hardly mustered a husky cry of welcome as the cavalcade trooped into the enclosure , and then the shadows enfolded them up in silence , and , too hot and listless to care much what the morrow brought forth , I threw myself on the bare floor , tossing and turning in a vain endeavour to sleep until dawn came once more .

A fine fellow , swarthy , huge , and hairy , at any other time or place I could have given him due admiration as an admirable example of the savage on the borderland of grace and culture , but now I only glanced at him , and then to where at his side a girl was crouching , a gem of human loveliness against that dusky setting .

A thin mist which fell with daybreak drew a veil over the horrible glare in the west for an hour or two , and taking advantage of the slight alleviation of heat , I rose and went into the gardens to enjoy a dip in a pool , making , with its surrounding jungle of flowers , one of the pleasantest things about the wood-king 's forest citadel .

It was the king 's custom , it appeared , to hear petitions and redress wrongs as soon after his return as possible , but today the ceremony was to be cut short as his majesty was going out with all his court to a neighbouring mountain to " pray away the comet , " which by this time was causing dire alarm all through the city .

When she saw me stride into the hall she rose swiftly from Ar-hap 's side , clasped her pretty hands , and giving a cry of joy would have rushed towards me , but the king laid a mighty paw upon her , under which she subsided with a shiver as though the touch had blanched all the life within .
