By utilising a triangulation approach incorporating explicit rating measures ( which require conscious , evaluative reasoning and responding via cortical brain processing ) , SRM ( which is a measure of raw , affective information processing and is sensitive to sub-cortical brain processes ) , and EEG ( which measures cortical graded potential changes of pyramidal cells ) , we were able to demonstrate that our participants differed in their subjective rating and their objectively measured neural responses to affective stimuli .

These studies posit the idea that the smaller P300 component may be due to cognitive deficits or be associated with increases of aggression . Wang et al. stated that this effect may imply a reduction in brain activity which has been known to reflect activation of the averse motivational system which can be linked to aggressive behaviour .

The ERP of the ‘ violent ’ emotion category appears to be more attenuated in the high aggressive group and so follows a similar trajectory to the ERP curve of the ‘ pleasant ’ condition , whereas the ERP curves of the ‘ violent ’ and ‘ pleasant ’ conditions remain separate in the low aggressive group .

Upon visual inspection of the curves in the frontal areas of the brain , the ERPs of the ‘ pleasant ’ and ‘ violent ’ emotion categories appear to follow a similar trajectory in the high aggression group which then separates in the left hemisphere approximately 800 ms post-stimulus onset .

Much like the results obtained in the present study , Gagnon et al. showed a similar response among aggressive individuals who responded with a larger N400 than their non-aggressive controls when both groups were presented with a critical word which violated a hostile expectation .

The present study aimed to determine whether a particular sub-section of the general population , characterised only by their self-reported aggressive tendencies , differed in their conscious evaluation of emotional stimuli compared to objectively measured neurophysiological reaction to the same stimuli .

These results can be compared with a study performed by Lu et al. who demonstrated that highly aggressive individuals in their study reacted to threat-based stimuli ( fearful faces ) with a decreased fronto-central response compared with individuals with low aggression .

Since individuals who are low aggressors are perhaps less likely to view violent images , the larger amplitude of their ERP is perhaps indicative of an increased motivational relevance due to the perception of threatening stimuli .

In the low aggression group , both curves ( ‘ pleasant ’ and ‘ violent ’ ) appear to follow a similar trajectory across both hemispheres but remain separate throughout the 1000 ms epoch studied .

The increased negative attenuation of the ERP amplitudes , noted in later time periods of the high aggression group to images portraying violence , may be due to increased attention payed to the image .

An explanation of the observed findings may be that , changes were seen in later time periods due to variations in meaningfulness of the displayed emotion images between the groups .

The authors stated that this immediate reaction to threat-based stimuli was due to a fearful face representing a threat-based stimulus which requires a quick response .

Heading more posteriorly to central and parietal sites , similar trends between the ‘ pleasant ’ and ‘ violent ’ emotion conditions can be seen .

Alternatively , as a consequence of life experience , high aggressors may be somewhat less responsive to violent stimuli , due to desensitisation effects .

This may prevent them in engaging cognitively with the stimulus , resulting in the observed attenuated ERP amplitudes .
