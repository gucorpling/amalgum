I was thinking something almost Godelian like saying making a sentence that in some way depends on the way it 's presented on Wikipedia and if you try to present it on Wikipedia with a neutral point of view by virtue of taking that action you are changing the point of view to do something .

And if you make it important enough people ca n’t just cling to the guidelines and say I ’m writing it the best way , and if you make it something like a million dollars to either Africa or Asia , hunger relief suddenly you have the responsibility

So by making the decision about where to place it you would be making the decision about how the real life event would go and how the rest of the article would go .

You go to the news sources and you do n’t know which of those sources they have .
