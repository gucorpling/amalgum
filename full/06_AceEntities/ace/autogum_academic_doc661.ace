In terms of the factors related to anxiety , after adjusting for possible confounding factors in the path analysis , we found that the number of basic ADLs attended , the hours of surveillance or supervision by the caregiver , the cognitive impairment of the recipient of care , and the subjective burden of the caregiver were related to higher levels of anxiety ; and that the subjective burden mediated the effects of the number of basic ADLs attended , the hours of surveillance or supervision by the caregiver , and the cognitive impairment of the recipient of care on anxiety .

In the present investigation , the characteristics of the caregivers that start caregiving in the hospital are similar to those in a study conducted in Spain by the Institute for the Elderly and Social Services ( IMSERSO , acronym of the Spanish name of the Institute ) , which investigated the care of elderly persons in their homes in Spain in 2005 .

The findings in this study highlight a positive direct effect of subjective burden on anxiety , after adjusting for objective burden , and are consistent with other studies focused on caregivers in the home ( both cross-sectional as well as longitudinal ) that had valid and reliable measurements that were adjusted for objective burden .

However , for the caregiver , providing care in an unknown environment such as a hospital , even though in a lesser grade that at home , and being required to take on this care suddenly without information or previous training , may be more stressful than providing care in the home .

With regards to the level of anxiety , our results are similar to those presented in a systematic review by Sallim et al. on caregivers of patients suffering from Alzheimer disease , and are higher than those in a review by Loh et al. on caregivers of stroke survivors .

In the present study , the level of subjective burden and anxiety was assessed in family caregivers of dependent older adults aged 65 years and over , who had recently started caregiving in the hospital , and the factors associated with anxiety in these caregivers were analysed .

Our results demonstrate a higher level of burden than that measured in other studies of hospital caregivers , but similar to studies of family caregivers in the home environment , with sociodemographic characteristics similar to the population sample in our study .

Hence , family caregivers that have just started caregiving may have higher levels of burden and anxiety than those that have not recently started .

Caregivers in the hospital could have theoretically less requirements than at home because several care recipient needs are attended by the healthcare team .

This possibly results in the appearance of negative emotional consequences in the caregiver , such as subjective burden or anxiety .
