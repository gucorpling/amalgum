RM : When it first started out there was a brief flurry of people when Cory Doctorow linked to me with Boing Boing and it had only been up for a couple of weeks then , but “ whoa there are lot of people reading this .

RM : xkcd is a webcomic that I started while I was in the middle of more productive things , school and work , that sort of by accident turned into a big thing and eventually became what I did professionally .

So but on the other hand , I try not to make things too hard on people so I say “ ok , all lower case is preferred if you want to capitalize , I prefer all caps .

And from then on , it was just a matter of ok , we ’ve hit a hundred readers a day , ok we ’ve hit 500 . and then a thousand .

But I really grew to dislike capital X , lower case “ kcd ” because that made it seem like a word or a name more than a string of letters .

RM : Well , the first thing is , it started off as a screename and an irc nick , where I ’m very used to seeing it all lowercase .

So , you have a somewhat non-standard style rule for typing out " xkcd " which I know has caused great consternation on Wikipedia and elsewhere .

There are a lot of trendy things , from e. e. cummings , the poet , up through businesses that take that sort of thing .

I stopped for that winter , 2005-2006 , and then started doing it again , and at that point I was picking up readers gradually .

So when it is in its canonical form , that ’s the real xkcd , the other forms look wrong to me .

If you want to start a sentence with “ xkcd ” it seems very wrong not to capitalize it .

If you ’re used to treating abstract strings in programming , changing case is not a trivial thing .

Mixed case is my third and least favorite choice ” But to some extent that ’s just style .
