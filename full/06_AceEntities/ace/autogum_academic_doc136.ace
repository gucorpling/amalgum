Our argument is that to practise ethically and effectively requires that social workers need to be aware of and to engage with identity politics and not fall back on default positions that they may feel pressured or socialised to adopt in respect of what is the right thing to say or do in particular circumstances .

Sikes , for instance , found herself in what she calls the eye of a storm of criticism and hostile publicity for seeking to problematise schoolteacher/pupil relationships , while Sikes and Piper discuss the difficulties they encountered from a university ethics committee in seeking approval for research into false allegations made against teachers .

The Beech case destabilises current public and criminal justice policy around the default position of ‘ believing ’ those claiming to be victims of abuse , and highlights the need to be able to question such dictums , regardless of the contemporary cultural potency they have come to assume .

While the social work academy has previously engaged with questions of identity and identity politics , these sorties have been overtaken by recent cultural shifts , which highlight the threat posed to free speech and to viewpoint diversity by revivalist outbreaks of identity politics .

The article begins by locating identity politics in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and how these have since morphed from concerns around structural disadvantage affecting major societal groupings to the expression of a myriad of personal and minority group identity claims .

The particular prompt for writing stems from the experience of one of the authors ( Mark ) who , at different points , has been subject to negative professional and press attention for questioning dominant narratives of historical abuse in residential child care .

Concerns about the implications of questioning the basis of abuse claims are set against a backcloth of wider disquiet experienced by the authors as to how to prepare students to negotiate contested identity issues in an increasingly regulated and foreclosing professional context .

We argue that free speech is a prerequisite for critical thinking , a skill that is consistently called for in social work education , but which is often lacking in academic engagement and in professional practice .
