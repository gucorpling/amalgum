As for the aggregation framework for combining the two major components into a composite indicator , a new aggregation function incorporated with a quadratic mean formula was proposed to produce higher vulnerability outcomes when the two components ( potential and risk indicators ) are both higher , and have some degree of compensability even when either of the two components is zero , as a complement to the existing multiplicative aggregation function .

As there have been many assessments of vulnerability to hydro-meteorological disasters based on the IPCC ’s three components , such as exposure , sensitivity , and adaptive capacity , the potential flood damage index was developed by the product of the potential indicator ( sensitivity ) and the risk indicator ( exposure minus adaptive capacity ) , similar to the livelihood vulnerability index adopting the IPCC ’s vulnerability concept .

Furthermore , to assess the future vulnerability to storms by the proposed assessment methodology based on the analysis of the past damage cost records , the human and economic damage costs need to be predicted by the regression analysis of the meteorological data in the event of a disaster for the use of future damage cost estimations according to climate change scenarios .

Hence , instead of the use of the difference between exposure and adaptive capacity components for the risk indicator , a comprehensive analysis result on both frequency and severity of the historical damage cost records can be interpreted explicitly as a measure of actual experiences and behaviors arising from the lack of adaptive capacity to exposed hazard risks .

The risk analysis results indicate that the human and economic damage risk were higher mostly in small and medium cities exposed to storm hazards , which tend to have a relatively higher population and infrastructure densities than rural districts but have relatively less ability to prevent or recover from storm damage than metropolises , in general .

The risk indicator is measured by an expected value for integrating both frequency and severity of the human and economic damage costs , which can provide a better interpretation of the risk indicator outcomes and reduce the nature of uncertainty in the proxy variables being used .

The proposed damage vulnerability index needs to be continuously updated by including the most recent storm damage records and successively evaluated with damage data series over several time periods to provide feasible and effective information on sustainable mitigation plans for changes in storm damage patterns .
