Unable to complete her thought , she sank down upon a pillowy divan , stretched out an arm , cried : “ Fulmer ! Fulmer ! ” and , while Susy Lansing stood in the middle of the room with widening eyes , a man emerged from the more deeply cushioned and scented twilight of some inner apartment , and she saw with surprise Nat Fulmer , the good Nat Fulmer of the New Hampshire bungalow and the ubiquitous progeny , standing before her in lordly ease , his hands in his pockets , a cigarette between his lips , his feet solidly planted in the insidious depths of one of Violet Melrose ’s white leopard skins .

After those first exposed days when , in the persistent presence of Fred Gillow and his satellites , and in the mocking radiance of late summer on the lagoons , she had fumed and turned about in her agony like a trapped animal in a cramping cage , to be alone had seemed the only respite , the one craving : to be alone somewhere in a setting as unlike as possible to the sensual splendours of Venice , under skies as unlike its azure roof .

She had shaken off Fred Gillow , sulkily departing for his moor ( where she had half-promised to join him in September ) ; the Prince , young Breckenridge , and the few remaining survivors of the Venetian group , had dispersed in the direction of the Engadine or Biarritz ; and now she could at least collect her wits , take stock of herself , and prepare the countenance with which she was to face the next stage in her career .

WHEN Violet Melrose had said to Susy Branch , the winter before in New York : “ But why on earth do n’t you and Nick go to my little place at Versailles for the honeymoon ? I ’m off to China , and you could have it to yourselves all summer , ” the offer had been tempting enough to make the lovers waver .

The revolving year had brought around the season at which Mrs. Melrose ’s house might be convenient : no visitors were to be feared at Versailles at the end of August , and though Susy ’s reasons for seeking solitude were so remote from those she had once prefigured , they were none the less cogent .

But Nick had objected that Paris , at that time of year , would be swarming with acquaintances who would hunt them down at all hours ; and Susy ’s own experience had led her to remark that there was nothing the very rich enjoyed more than taking pot-luck with the very poor .

“ In China ... in China , ” Mrs. Melrose stared with dreamy eyes , and Susy remembered her drifting disorganised life , a life more planless , more inexplicable than that of any of the other ephemeral beings blown about upon the same winds of pleasure .

These thoughts were in her mind as she drove up to Mrs. Melrose ’s door on a rainy afternoon late in August , her boxes piled high on the roof of the cab she had taken at the station .

It was such an artless ingenuous little house , so full of the demoralizing simplicity of great wealth , that it seemed to Susy just the kind of place in which to take the first steps in renunciation .

“ Am sure Mrs. Melrose most happy ” ; and Susy , without further thought , had jumped into a Versailles train , and now stood in the thin rain before the sphinx-guarded threshold of the pavilion .

She had travelled straight through from Venice , stopping in Milan just long enough to pick up a reply to the telegram she had despatched to the perfect housekeeper whose permanent presence enabled Mrs. Melrose to say :
