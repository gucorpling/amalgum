Sometimes i think its because i 'm not that interesting , or maybe just look unfriendly , or maybe because i do n't follow people and leave a social gathering faster than anyone( its more of an escape because i 'm sacred they find me uniteresting ) So do you guys know a reason for this ?

Make people rise to your level , do n't grovel for their attention or seek it out if they 're not seeking you . the best gift you can give to others is to make the most of yourself remember that and repeat it . let the fakes and haters stay where they are .

It 's really tough trying to figure out how to socialise intially because the problem can be very hard to pinpoint sometimes , but just keep trial and error and im sure you 'll get closer to figuring it out .

I 'm not really a hated person and i have a few friends , but i 'm just never invited anywhere , therefore i have no solid or true friendships , i honestly feel sad sometimes .

Life is suffering homie . plain and simple , we bond over our mutual struggles and interests , what people seek out the most is someone who can make their life bearable and entertain them .

When you 're out hanging out , remember that it 's also for you , so try to enjoy it in whatever way you like , while still maintaining polite manners .

love is not possible without personal growth and self respect , love actually develops naturally if those 2 things are a solid part of your personality and life .
