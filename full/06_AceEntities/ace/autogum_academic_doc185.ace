Layered double hydroxides ( LDH ) are anionic clays represented by the general formula of [ M2+1−xM3+x(OH)2]x+(An−)x/n·mH2O , where M2+ and M3+ are divalent and trivalent metallic cations and An− depicts the anions which can be present in the hydrated interlayer galleries of the clay .

LDHs composed of Mg and Al hydroxyl sheets with carbonate ions as counter anions and M2+ : M3+ = 3:1 are called hydrotalcite , and quintinite when the ratio M2+ : M3+ = 2:1 .
