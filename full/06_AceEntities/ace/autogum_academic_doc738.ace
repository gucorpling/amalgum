At the same time , the practice of making management decisions by economic entities allowed to outline the main features of such tasks : Multidimensionality , the need to simultaneously take into account when choosing alternatives of several targets , the need to evaluate alternatives from the perspective of a fairly wide range of criteria , difficulties ( sometimes impossible in principle ) to form conditions for implementing alternatives , factors criteria , and goals in quantitative form .

Due to this , the traditionally used mathematical methods for matching interests have been supplemented by authoring tools developed on the methodological foundation of the hierarchy analysis method by T. Saaty as a recognized method of supporting management decision-making through the hierarchical composition of the problem and multi-criteria rating of alternatives .

The decomposition of the problem consists in dividing it into hierarchy levels so that the elements of the lower level of the hierarchy are comparable in pairs to the elements of the next level up to the top of the hierarchy ( the law of hierarchical continuity ) .

The hierarchy analysis method ( HAM ) is a systematic procedure for the hierarchical representation of the essential elements of a problem situation , the resolution of which is aimed at making the management decision by the subjects — public – private partnership participants .

The hierarchical structure of the method reflects the interrelationship of alternative solutions with the factors on which they depend , as well as with the criteria for rating them , which visualizes the participants ’ views on the situation of decision making ;

This procedure consists in the decomposition of a specific problem into more and more simple components ( from the goal to the comparable solutions to the problem — alternatives ) and further processing of the sequence of decision judgments by pairwise comparisons .
