We also found that the expression and activation of downstream signaling molecules including TLR7-MyD88 ( binding of TLR7 with adaptor molecule myosin D88 ) , TLR9-MyD88 , or TLR4-Flottilin ( localization of TLR4 in lipid raft ) complex formation , TRAF6 , IKK-α , and p65 ( NFκB activation ) have been increased upon gut virome and microbiome dysbiosis .

Here , we found an independent or cumulative effect of both virome and bacteriome dysbiosis in weakening of GI tight junctions ( increased Claudin-2 and decreased ZO1 and Occludin ) , GI inflammation ( increased MCP1 and IL6 ) , systemic inflammation ( increased serum IFNγ and IL6 ) and neuroinflammation ( increased microglia activation and brain IL6 ) .

However , nonavailability of germ-free and gnotobiotic mice or mice completely devoid of gut viruses prove to be a serious handicap in establishing the exact role of viruses in GWI or any other disease pathology though use of antiviral cocktails similar to our approach have been shown to serve the purpose .

We used a broad-spectrum antiviral compound Ribavirin to test the hypothesis that ( a ) inhibition of gut viruses in the host may prove the role of gut virome in GWI and ( b ) antiviral treatment may help to reconstruct and restore the virome signature in GWI .

In our study , we observed that increased TLR3 might switch to pro-inflammatory response via IL6 or fail to produce significant IFNβ in order to support its anti-inflammatory role in GWI though such mechanisms in the host remain inconclusive at this time .
