In a recent report , Pérez-Riesgo et al. have assessed differential gene expression of all human TRP channels by Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) to investigate differences in expression of several genes involved in intracellular Ca2+ transport in CRC .

Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , the most prevalent cancer of the GI tract , represents the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy worldwide in men and women and the second largest cause of death in Europe related to cancer .

TRPs activity implicates many aspects of cancer development or “ hallmarks of cancer ” , such as tumor migration and invasion , exaggerated cell proliferation , cell survival , angiogenesis , and enhanced resistance to cell death .

Animal models have demonstrated a protective role for TRPV1 in the tumorigenesis of colon cancer , indeed TRPV1- Knockout mice exhibited lower expression of anti-inflammatory neuropeptides and greater occurrence and number of CRC compared with controls .

Those differences have been recognized mainly in melanoma , glioma and prostate , breast , kidney , and bladder cancers , suggesting an oncogenic role for some TRPs while others may function as tumor suppressors .

The results obtained , comparing human normal colonic cells versus human colon cancer lines , revealed that only a dozen of the TRPs are expressed in colonic cells , either normal or tumor .

On the other hand , an overexpression of TRPV6 in SW480 colorectal cancer cell lines and colon carcinomas have been associated with an enhanced proliferation of malignant cells .

The data also indicated that TRPV6 was the unique TRP gene significantly overexpressed in CRC cells , resembling the previously reported enhanced levels of TRPV6 in prostate cancer .

As mentioned above , the TRPV1 channel is also involved in IBD , a chronic disorder strongly correlated with risk of CRC .
