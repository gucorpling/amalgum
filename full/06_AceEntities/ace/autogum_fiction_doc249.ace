Three of the villagers did certainly assure us that they had seen the woman , but as they were quite unable to describe her , and quite incapable of agreeing about the exact direction in which she was proceeding when they last saw her , these three bright exceptions to the general rule of total ignorance afforded no more real assistance to us than the mass of their unhelpful and unobservant neighbours .
