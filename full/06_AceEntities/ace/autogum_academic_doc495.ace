Furthermore , given the fact that amnestic MCI is the most frequent MCI subtype , it was expected that patients with MCI or mild dementia would show greater deficits in the memory section of the SKT , while depressed patients would be more impaired in subtests measuring speed of information processing .

Since the cognitive deficits associated with depression are less pronounced than those found in dementia , making a differential diagnosis much more difficult when it is not a full-blown dementia , but “ mild cognitive impairment ” ( MCI ) , which has to be differentiated from depression .

For almost 30 years , MCI has been conceptualized as a transitional phase between normal aging and dementia ; it is discussed as a clinical condition with a high prognostic value for future dementia development , mostly towards Alzheimer ’s dementia .

The SKT ( acronym for Syndrom-Kurztest ; however , this German term is outdated and not used anymore ) is a short cognitive performance test assessing memory and attention , the latter in the sense of speed of information processing .

In the same way , the DSM-5 recommends inspecting the cognitive profiles of patients suggesting memory and executive impairment as typical for Alzheimer ’s disease , whereas nonspecific and more variable test performance could be expected in major depression .

Accordingly , among the differential diagnoses of dementia , in the first place the ICD-10 lists depressive disorders , which can show characteristics of incipient dementia with memory impairment , slowed thinking and lack of spontaneity .

The diagnostic differentiation of MCI and depression is further complicated by the existence of several MCI subtypes ( amnestic vs. non-amnestic , single vs. multiple domains ) causing a potential variety of neuropsychological performance patterns .

Depressive disorders in old age are associated with cognitive impairment in 40 % to 60 % of patients . Conversely , about 40 % of dementia patients develop depression symptoms .

Thus , the SKT addresses exactly those two cognitive domains that are considered to be primarily impaired in patients with mild dementia and depressive disorders , respectively .

Worldwide , patients suffering from depression frequently are not correctly diagnosed ; therefore , in many countries less than 10 % of depressed subjects receive adequate treatment .

Due to an overlap in symptoms , a valid differential diagnosis between dementia and depression is sometimes difficult to establish :
