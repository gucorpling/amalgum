Continuous flow for VADs may allow simulated pulses ; however , until the date of circulatory assistance , despite tolerance to left ventricular and Pao , the continuous flow rate is traditionally of a medium constant rotation , which always decreases the pressure pulse .

This allows the left ventricle to automatically adjust the RV output ( represented by the increased or decreased pump pulsatility ) , thereby decreasing the danger of suction or an inefficient pumping aid connected to improperly defined PI target values .

Naturally , as the VAD and the controller are implanted in humans , because their lifespan depends largely on the suitability of the pump control , we must have great certainty in the robustness of the control algorithms .

The pump flow pulsation and mean flow pump used in the current controller can be estimated using an algorithm for flow estimation previously established in our laboratory using the pump speed and current that are not measured invasively .

We now believe that non-invasive technology has advanced to a level where it can be considered for long-term implantation , combined with sensorless signals , to form a robust control system that provides physiological behavior to RBPs .

The current control approach uses flow pulsatility as a parameter to determine the required flow rate compared to the continuous pulsatility index ( PI ) control strategy , which regulates PI directly at a specific stage .

We have found that the aortic valve offers a lower resistance pathway than the LVAD bypass route , as the native heart sometimes pumps a significant flow relative to that of the LVAD .

Clinically , it is observed that large changes in pump pulsatility during postural changes cause patients to sometimes feel weak during Valsalva maneuvers ( e. g. , when coughing or straining ) .

The methodology of this work is proposed to evaluate the merits of a full-state feedback control method involving sensorless and non-invasive approaches in a range of identical simulation scenarios .

In addition , during use in a clinical setting , it was found that controlling the pulsatility index to a pre-set point did not prevent antagonistic pumping states .

The pulsatile flow pump is used as a non-invasive substitute for the LV filling pressure , as it has been proven to be closely interrelated .

Therefore , we believe that this different pumping state could greatly impact our overall control strategy , and therefore requires online detection .
