High-resolution mass spectrometry ( HRMS ) can use exact mass measurement coupled to database and software packages to become an increasingly more effective tool regarding the accurate identification of the suspect and unknown compounds without the use of certified standards , where target analysis is unfeasible .

These variations in the core structure of each cyanopeptide multiply the number of combinations which is the cause of the large variety of potential congeners ; to date , more than 500 cyanopeptides , including 240 MCs and 96 APs have been identified .

Based on the proposed combinations , one could theoretically propose a significantly higher number of congeners , although most of the variants may not occur naturally in practice , due to the low frequency of some amino acids in the possible combinations .
