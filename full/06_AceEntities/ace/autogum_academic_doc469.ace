The mechanisms of the HIF response have therefore been studied in ischemic vascular diseases , such as myocardial infarction ( consequence of obstruction of coronary arteries ) or peripheral vascular disease ( PAD , consequence of obstruction of arteries going to the limbs ) .

A study using a porcine model showed an association of HIF-1α expression with the degree of neointimal hyperplasia in grafts , and suggested that reducing hypoxia might inhibit venous NH formation , possibly by reducing the phenotypic switch of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts .

Detection of HIF-1α and activation of its target genes occurs in atherosclerotic plaques . During atherogenesis ( plaque build-up ) , hypoxia increases angiogenesis , releases pro-inflammatory mediators , activates MMPs , forms reactive oxygen species , and oxidizes low-density lipoprotein .

Paradoxically , increased activation of the HIF pathway may also protect against NH formation . Nakao et al. studied the role of carbon monoxide , a physiologically important vasodilator that acts via cyclic guanosine monophosphate , in the formation of NH .

There is growing evidence that the HIF pathway is implicated — for better or for worse — in the response of the vascular wall to inadequate oxygenation and/or increased cellular oxygen , a demand secondary to various stresses or injuries .

These apparently contradictory studies suggest that , at least in the setting of vein graft NH , transient activation of the HIF pathway may protect the wall from hypoxia , whereas chronic activation may maintain the ongoing NH process .

Although vein grafts and prosthetic grafts are not identical , because of different hemodynamics and oxygen tension , the characteristics of NH in vein grafts are similar to those of NH that form in AVFs .
