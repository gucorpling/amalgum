I do n't sparge because I 'm trying to come up with a process where I can hit 70 % without sparging , and it seems like everyone on here swears up and down that they do n't sparge when BIAB and they hit well over 70 % .

Could sparging and mashing out really be the 20 % difference here ? I am at a loss , and throughout all of my searching in this sub , it seems like the #1 thing that everyone says is a problem is crush .

All looks good there , and my water amounts seem correct ( I end up with the right amount of wort at the end of the boil to put in the fermenter ) • I use Portland , OR water .

Here are some of the details I figure are important : • I use Beersmith , and did the Brulosophy tutorial for setting up mash profile and equipment profile .

As for mashing out , I have n't been doing that yet because I do n't have a false bottom , but I am ordering one .

I squeeze the bag real well , and jostle it around to make sure I 'm really letting the trapped wort escape the bag .

Once I get it , I 'll feel comfortable enough that I wo n't burn my bag in the bottom of my pot .

As far as I can tell , the two things that I do n't do right now are sparging and mashing out .

First , I 've had my water tested by Ward Labs and use BruNWater to figure out what additions my water needs .

I am assured by the brew store people that our water is insanely good and mash PH is not an issue . •

Plus , I 'm hitting my water volumes based on Beersmith , so this does n't seem to be an issue .
