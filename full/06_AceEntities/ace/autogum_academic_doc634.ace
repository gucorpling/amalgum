When the original sequence PTKR/S of SARS-CoV was replaced with RRKR/S , SARS-CoV could invade susceptible cells while no longer relying on cathepsin L. Additionally , after the S2′ site mutated into the furin-S2′ site of the MHV-A59 strain , MHV can fuse with susceptible cells in the early endosome , but not lysosome , without requiring lysosomal enzymes such as MERS-CoV .
