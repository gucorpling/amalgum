Step Four/ Congrats-Magic ! you have completed the wash effect for the first time ! ... well not quite . you still need to do the rest of you painting ... if the colour has n't turned out clear enough just do another layer on top ( wait for it to dry ) . do n't take this as a reason to add more paint to your watercolour solution , it 's better this way because you can see weather it should be a little darker without it already being too dark , ruining your painting and the point of wash effect anyway .

Step Two- dilute the paints and fill in an area of an outline ( its best to draw a very faint outline of your scene so you get the exact shape you 're looking for ) . do n't dilute your pain too much , you do n't want the water flowing the paint out of the lines and ruining your painting ( unless this is the effect you wish to achieve ) .

Also , if the colour goes a little out of the lines that 's okay , it gives a nice affect but if you do n't like it that 's okay too . it all depends on your style . you should n't be able too see the lines if you 've done them right but if you can see them , that 's fine .

One- get a hold of some watercolour paints or pencils . the wash technique is much easier with water colours as they look better diluted then poster paints or acrylics , you can still try it with these types though , it may look more like what you 're looking for .

Fold it neatly( ! ) and gently press on top of the water colour you have just applied . it will soak up the excess water that has n't already soaked into the paper ( you need to act quickly or all the water will soak up and its ruined ) .

This does n't mean you should go outlining the drawing while pressing VERY hard on your pencil ( probably the best outlining tool but do n't restrict yourself to graphite- experiment with chalks and charcoal as well ) , pressing too hard can damage your paper/canvas .

Grab some paper towel . it cannot be tissue or Kleenex or even toilet paper , those will get soggy and fall apart all over you artwork . it needs to be like in the picture to the right .
