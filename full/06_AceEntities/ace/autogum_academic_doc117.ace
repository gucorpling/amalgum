That is to say , there is a threshold of household income , which is the floor level to meet the basic life needs in cities , and the urban household incomes are mostly above the threshold value .

One result of this is that the rich get richer , while the poor are still at a low-income level , thus widening the gap between the rich and the poor and aggravating inequality .

Private transfer payments can create more wealth in high-income family networks , while in low-income family networks , private transfer payments are also at a low level , which plays a very limited role .

From the analysis of income , consumption , and household poverty , we found that the IPTP not only directly subsidizes the total household income but also indirectly promotes the increase of household income .

However , in rural areas , the income of poor families is very low , and the income of rich families may be very high , resulting in greater inequality than in urban areas .

Secondly , although the IPTP may deepen the inequality of household income , it makes the rich richer by promoting the income growth of high-income families , thus widening the income gap .

Therefore , urban and rural residents should be encouraged not to reduce their production and work time even if they have IPTP , so that IPTP is independent of family income expectations .

Because the living standards and consumption levels in urban areas are far higher than those in rural areas , only when household income reaches a certain level can they live in cities .

If IPTP is exogenous , it can reduce the inequality of both rural families and urban families , and the improvement in rural areas is greater than that of urban areas .

To get rid of poverty and become rich , people should rely on their own efforts to increase family income , instead of expecting other people ’s private gifts .

The main reason is that for most families , the IPTP has directly transformed into household consumption expenditure and has not played a greater role .

Firstly , IPTPs improve people ’s living standards from two aspects : Increasing the total family income and rising household consumption expenditure .
