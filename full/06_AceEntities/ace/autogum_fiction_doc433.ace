Among these names perhaps the most unknown to fame is that of an artist named Pierre Grassou , coming from Fougeres , and called simply " Fougeres " among his brother-artists , who , at the present moment holds a place , as the saying is , " in the sun , " and who suggested the rather bitter reflections by which this sketch of his life is introduced , -- reflections that are applicable to many other individuals of the tribe of artists .

A great artist is swamped . Decamps ' " Turkish Cafe , " " Children at a Fountain , " " Joseph , " and " The Torture , " would have redounded far more to his credit if the four pictures had been exhibited in the great Salon with the hundred good pictures of that year , than his twenty pictures could , among three thousand others , jumbled together in six galleries .

In 1832 , Fougeres lived in the rue de Navarin , on the fourth floor of one of those tall , narrow houses which resemble the obelisk of Luxor , and possess an alley , a dark little stairway with dangerous turnings , three windows only on each floor , and , within the building , a courtyard , or , to speak more correctly , a square pit or well .

Whenever you have gone to take a serious look at the exhibition of works of sculpture and painting , such as it has been since the revolution of 1830 , have you not been seized by a sense of uneasiness , weariness , sadness , at the sight of those long and over-crowded galleries ? Since 1830 , the true Salon no longer exists .

Historical , high-art , genre paintings , easel pictures , landscapes , flowers , animals , and water-colors , -- these eight specialties could surely not offer more than twenty pictures in one year worthy of the eyes of the public , which , indeed , cannot give its attention to a greater number of such works .

Fougeres , being merely a genre painter , does not need the immense machinery and outfit which ruin historical painters ; he has never recognized within himself sufficient faculty to attempt high-art , and he therefore clings to easel painting .
