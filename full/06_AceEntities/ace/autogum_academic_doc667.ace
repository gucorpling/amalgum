Ageing is also associated with increased vulnerability of the neurons to oxidative stress , emphasizing the potential importance of changes in the concentration of neurotrophic factors such as a decrease in the concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , which supports the growth and maintenance of neurons .

It is thought that this may be due to the provocation of an unchecked immune response within the brain via the increased production of reactive oxygen species , which can lead to brain damage via the upregulation of inflammatory mediators .

Decreased concentrations of such neurotrophic factors render brain cells more prone to damage caused by inflammatory processes and oxidative stress , which are key events in age-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis experienced by many older adults .

Depression is a complex disease involving a chronic low-grade inflammatory response , activation of cell-mediated immunity , and progressive neuropathology , which can lead to neurodegeneration and later on contribute toward the development of dementia .
