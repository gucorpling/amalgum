In this paper , a reasonable compromise is found : Using the widely known half bridge converter as shown for example in at low voltage as a foundation to cycle single cells is still a practical approach that is cheap , scalable and does not have to deal with high voltage and severe noise .

At the cost of higher noise and a slight signal dependency on the state of the circuit , actual DC/DC-converters might also be used as cycling circuits that induce ripple currents on the batteries as De Breucker et al. have done in .

This is a very viable approach since the spectra only consist of the fundamental wave in case of the sinusoidal excitation or in the well known form of odd harmonics that decline in orders of in case of triangular ripple currents .
