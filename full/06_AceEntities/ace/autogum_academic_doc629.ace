Two important aspects of HAM development have been reported , including the efficiency of the cellular immune response and the rate of spontaneous expression of the viral antigen , due to the numerous immunological alterations , mediated mainly by the expression of Tax ( regulatory protein of the virus ) in the peripheral blood and in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HAM .

The present manuscript presents the most relevant published results from several laboratories , including ours over the years regarding the associations between the genetic variations of the host related to the immune response and HTLV-1 infection , particularly those showing the close relationship between HTLV-1 infection and single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes of the immune system .

The absence of symptoms in most of the infected people raises the question of the multiple etiological roles of the virus-associated diseases and some of the interesting questions still unanswered includes : does the immunogenic characteristics of the host contribute to the upsurge of symptoms associated with HTLV-1 infection ?

HAM is a chronic progressive demyelinating disease that affects the spinal cord and the white matter of the brain , leading to a severe clinical syndrome due to the motor limitations that affect the lower limbs associated with the autonomic dysfunction .

In these patients , the clinical conditions appear to be the result of the interaction between the virus and the host susceptibility , leading to the abnormal functioning of immuno-modulatory mechanisms , cell proliferation , and inflammation .

Other opportunistic-like infections , such as Strongyloidiasis , Norwegian scabies , infective dermatitis , as well as autoimmune syndromes , including rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren ’s syndrome , have also been described among HTLV-1 carriers .

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATLL ) develops in up to 5 % of infected people , and sometimes a chronic neurodegenerative inflammatory disease called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy ( HAM ) develops .

To establish persistent infection , HTLV-1 deregulates CD4+ T cells , sometimes leading to ATLL or to chronic inflammatory diseases , such as HAM and uveitis .
