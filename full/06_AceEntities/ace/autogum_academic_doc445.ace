In an unrelated crop , Russian dandelion ( Taraxacum kok-saghyz ) , Hodgson-Kratky et al. reported that , after three cycles of recurrent selection for increased seed germination at a negative water potential , the percentage seed germination of breeding lines was increased 34.5 % and 42.5 % , and the germination time was reduced by three and five days , respectively .
