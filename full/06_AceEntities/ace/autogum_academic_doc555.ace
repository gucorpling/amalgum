However , the GPR measurements on frozen ground with a thin snow cover of only 5 – 10 cm thickness resulted in the data images with highest signal-to-noise ratio regarding the archaeological target structures , better even than measurements conducted on bare ground at temperatures above freezing .

The differences in obtained data quality in regard to the imaging of buried archaeological remains is understood to have been mainly caused by the variable GPR pulse absorption rates due to the different properties of the snow cover and the underlying topsoil .

Too great a distance from the ground will cause the reflection of a large part of the transmitted electromagnetic energy of the GPR pulse , preventing it from reaching further below for subsurface imaging .

When the air temperature is above zero and the top soil is not frozen , the amount of liquid water in the soil has a great effect on GPR pulse propagation and attenuation .
