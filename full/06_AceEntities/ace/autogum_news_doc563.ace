One , an international group led by Manuel Llinás of Penn State University in the US , examined Plasmodium falciparum , which is responsible for the worst form of human malarial infections ; the other , led by UK scientists Oliver Billker from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in England and Andy Waters from University of Glasgow in Scotland , looked at Plasmodium berghei , which infects rodents .

Dr. Oliver Billker commented on the potential of getting the transmission of malaria under control , unlike the existing focus on addressing the phrase causing the clinical symptoms , " Current drugs treat patients by killing the sexless form of the parasite in their blood — this is the detrimental stage of the malaria lifecycle that causes illness .

The parasite triggers formation of the sexual gametocytes into the human 's circulatory system every two days in small quantities — not wasting energy on the process at the dry time of year when few mosquitoes are available — but little was known about the mechanism .

The P. falciparum group was kickstarted by research in Spain which found different organisms from the same strain with identical DNA had varying levels of AP2-G , with a strong correlation to their levels of sexual activity .

Both teams confirmed the finding by gene therapy — both by adding the gene into a mutated strain and observing its ability to form gametocytes , and the other way round .

Researchers in England , later also drawn into the international team , analyzed the genomes of two mutated strains of P. falciparum which were both unable to form gametocytes .
