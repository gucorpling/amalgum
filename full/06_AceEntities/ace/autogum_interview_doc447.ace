Actually , I think the fence has received the approval of people who live on both sides of the border in my community , because before we built that border fence in San Diego — I do n’t know if you read the book Lines and Shadows , that was a best-selling book by Joseph Wambaugh , who wrote The Onion Field — it was about the no-mans land that existed between Tijuana and San Diego before we built that fence .

You had armed gangs , some of them with machine guns , that preyed on the illegal aliens , murdered a number of people , robbed people by the hundreds every night , and they preyed on people not only on the northern side , but in the northern Tijuana neighborhoods .

There ’s another reason that we need to have one , and that ’s this : today we have 250,000 criminal aliens , mostly people who came across from Mexico , not to look for work or for a better life , but to hurt Americans .

When we built the double border fence , we took away the mobility of the border gangs , put them out of business , and we actually brought about a much better situation for people on both sides of the border .

So until we built the double fence — it ’s two fences with a road between — and we took away the mobility of the border gangs , we were n’t able to handle that .

Is a fence the remedy for that , or is finding a remedy for the needs and causes of those gangs and for the illegal migration of people a remedy ?

Those people did n’t come across to find job , they came across to commit crimes , got convicted , and are presently residing in our penitentiaries and jails .

The fence that was built in Israel is seen by many as divisive in an area that is far more explosive than the Mexican -U.S . border .

How do you respond to people who say that a fence is more symbolic of divisiveness than a resolution of the issues that cause illegal immigration ?

If they were pursued in the north , they ’d go south ; if they were pursued in the south , they ’d go north .

We had law enforcement operations on both sides of the border , and the gangs ran wild .
