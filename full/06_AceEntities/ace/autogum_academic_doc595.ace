It is equally important to understand whether food neophobia is just an extreme situation , a clinical condition consisting of unjustified rejection of unfamiliar food products , with no logical justification for the adverse emotional reaction of disgust and refusal , or whether it reveals an ingrained attitude that may extend to a wide range of situations .

The literature seems to show that feelings of “ fear ” or “ disgust ” towards the new in many cases reflect very specific ideological or value choices , which may cause the individual to take up positions in favor of environmentalism , animal welfare or ecology or simply because an individual is clinging to tradition .

As the literature shows , however , it is not always easy to distinguish between cases where consumers ’ resistance can be circumvented by improving specific product characteristics , and cases where resistance is more deeply rooted , as it is linked to specific ideologies about food and is thus not readily overcome .

Indeed , innovation is born from the continuous interaction between the food industry and the institutional and social context in which it operates : it is an opportunity to meet the needs of citizen-consumers , while also responding to emerging social challenges such as environmental sustainability and animal welfare .

With a global population expected to reach 9 or even 10 billion by the year 2050 and natural resources for food production already scarce in many parts of the world , humankind is facing a serious challenge : how can we feed everybody ?

Accordingly , it can be useful to analyze the various facets of food neophobia , or “ human unwillingness to consume unfamiliar food ” , which cuts across the technological challenges now facing the European food industry .

Knowing which products are generally associated with neophobia , and which details of the products trigger it is important because it can provide the industry with insight into how to overcome or curb sales resistance .

In fact , neophobia is marked by an underlying “ mistrust ” of foods that have never been tasted , and is probably linked to a pre-coding of food in a rigid visual schema .

As food neophobia can be elicited by a wide range of foods in an increasingly demanding and specialized food market , it can be a major obstacle for producers and consumers alike .
