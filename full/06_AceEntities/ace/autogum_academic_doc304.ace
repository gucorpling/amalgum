A second success factor is that the cooperatives often have regular and direct communications with municipal or regional governments , this allows them to provide their insights and push for change at controlling government levels , this is especially important if the cooperatives manage to collaborate with the government to conduct sustainability projects .

These indicated roles are : ( 1 ) mobilizing the public ; ( 2 ) brokering between government and citizens ; ( 3 ) providing context specific knowledge and expertise ; ( 4 ) initiating accepted change ; and ( 5 ) proffering the integration of sustainability .

The final success factor is related to this as it is non-commercial interests , whereas many other energy initiatives have a direct incentive to sell a certain product , the cooperatives try to steer away from these biases , leading to more citizen acceptance .

While many cooperatives are focusing on small-scale projects , a small number of cooperatives such as Leudal Energie are working on major projects such as a wind farm , indicating the potential of cooperatives for contributing significantly to the energy transition .

While regular collaboration with a municipality enables local small scale energy projects such as improvements of home insulations or small arrays of solar panels , collaboration with regional governments have the potential for larger projects such as wind-turbines or solar farms .

The framework is built around three key interactions shaping these governance roles , between ( 1 ) LRECs and their ( potential ) members , ( 2 ) LRECs and the government and ( 3 ) LRECs with other LRECs .

And the last ( fifth ) role is proffering the integration of sustainability , here cooperatives take an active role is advocating for a more integrated sustainability approach towards the energy transition by focusing on factors beyond just energy generation .

These five roles are a new addition to academic literature as the literature review did not reveal any peer-reviewed articles that attempted to identify the governance roles that LRECs fulfil in the energy transition .

Based on the survey and in-depth , semi-structured interviews in the province of Limburg , the Netherlands , five different roles for LRECs for facilitating the energy transition could be distilled .

As the projects are initiated from the community and community members can have a say in how the project develops , there is a bigger chance that the project is accepted .

Third , providing context specific knowledge and expertise , here local energy cooperatives leverage their local embeddedness and personal approach towards facilitating the energy transition to provide context specific solutions .

The third success factor is honesty and transparency where the openness and honest trustworthy advice that the cooperatives try to provide earns them respect and trust from local citizens .

This success will be largely dependent on the cooperative ’s ability to mobilize citizens , government actors and resources resulting from these success factors and handling the following barriers .
