Most times , the minor roads at those intersections will have a " give way " sign , but sometimes they do n't , which is both confusing , because you never know if the crossing road has a sign or is unmarked , and dangerous because you might expect the vehicle coming from your left to let you pass while it will assume you have a " give way " sign and will carry on travelling like a bullet .
