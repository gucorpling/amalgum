( Bengali : মহেশচন্দ্র বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায় , fl. 1850 ) or Mahesh Chandra Banerjee was a strong chess player from Bengal , many hundred of whose games survive through the writings of John Cochrane , who regularly played Bannerjee between 1848 and 1860 , during Cochrane 's tenure at the Calcutta bar .

Fianchettoes appear to have been a favourite style in Indian chess variants , and the Queen 's Indian defence was also a frequent opening for Mir Sultan Khan , who visited England for five years and won the British Chess Championship in 1929 , 1932 and 1933 .

The Indian Defences by P-KKt3 coupled with P-Q3 , or P-QKt3 coupled with P-K3 , were largely taught to European players by the example of Moheschunder and other Indians , to whom the fianchetto developments were a natural legacy from their own game . [ 1 ]

The theory behind these openings were developed in recorded chess history much later , but Cochrane introduced the term Indian defence for this class of openings , which has now come to cover the Nimzo-Indian and many other popular openings .

It was stated that the man , ' Moheschunder Bonnerjee , a Brahmin ' , of about 50 , hardly knew the European rules of chess ; yet his play was presumably under European rules . [ 1 ]

He played traditional Indian chess , which in Bengal at the time , pawns did not have the option of moving two squares from the starting row and pawns would promote to the piece of the square reached .

Of this worthy , Mr Cochrane has himself remarked that he possesses as great a natural talent for chess as any player he ever met with , without one single exception . [ 2 ]

In the Chess Player 's Chronicle for 1851 are published some games between Cochrane and Moheschunder ; and " the Brahmin " figures as a player in various collections of games .

It is notable that many of Bannerjee 's openings were based on single pawn moves , the " legacy " mentioned by Sergeant , as in the rules of Indian chess .

In the autumn of 1848 , a member of the Calcutta Chess club heard of a Brahmin in a village ( mofussil ) who had never been beaten at chess .

Moheshchunder , like other Indian players of the time , favoured fianchettoed openings , trying to control the centre with long-distance pieces rather than occupying it with the pawns .

Among his recorded games is the first instance of Gruenfeld Defence , more than 60 years before Ernst Grünfeld was to launch it against Alekhine at Vienna , 1922 :

Moheshchunder had a flair for dramatic play evidenced by his sacrifices in this King 's Indian Defence game ( a variation known today as the Four Pawns Attack ) :

It appears that Cochrane , who had defeated every player in England barring his protégé Howard Staunton , had been searching for some worthy opponents for some time .

The only player here who has any chance whatever with Mr Cochrane , upon even terms , is a Brahmin of the name of Moheschunder Bonnerjee .

What little is known of Moheschunder comes from articles that John Cochrane , stationed at Calcutta in the 1840s , wrote for the London chess magazines .

Also Bengal chess rules did not have castling , but an unchecked king could execute a knight 's move once during a game .

Moheshchunder , also known as " the Brahmin " , was a player from the mofussil or suburbs of Calcutta .

Possibly these ideas germinated in an environment of chess rules that did not permit the initial two-square move for pawns .
