The Alliance for Religion and Conservation ( ARC ) led by Martin Palmer , was founded by Prince Philip in 1995 when he convened a meeting of leading conservation groups and nine world religions at Windsor Castle in England , the aim of which was “ to link the secular worlds of conservation and ecology with the faith worlds of the major religions . ” ( ARC n. d. ) .

The CDA ’s green agenda , however , would have been unlikely to achieve concrete results without the inspiration and financing of Allerd Stikker and the Valley Management Foundation , who played an instrumental role in the concrete realization of the goal of producing a model “ ecology temple ” within the Heihe National Park .

At the same time , analysis of the CDA ’s documents reveals a gradual shift away from the formulation of unique Daoist values and concepts regarding environmental and ecological issues , towards a focus on more practical and more globally recognizable concerns such as environmental education , energy conservation , and biodiversity preservation .

Ten years prior to this , Prince Philip , as head of the World Wild Life Fund for Nature ( WWF ) had organized a meeting between leaders of the world ’s largest religions and several environmental organizations to discuss the role that faith could play in address growing ecological problems .

The development of a green agenda by the CDA can be seen as the fruitful engagement between a local religious tradition , one not widely known or understood even in China , let alone abroad , with a global environmental NGO .

That the first Daoist ecology temple in China was realized principally through a Chinese-UK-Dutch partnership stands as testament to the role played by global actors and global capital in the practical development of the Chinese Daoist Association ’s environmental agenda .

The ecological declarations and statements of the CDA make repeated references to overarching policies such as restrictions on incense burning , banning endangered species from being used in Traditional Chinese Medicine practices and injunctions to make all temples ecological temples .

Indeed , the ARC website , though now defunct , was a major regular source of English-language information about the ongoing activities of the Chinese Daoist Association , and of course served to highlight the CDA ’s ecological activities .

The ecology temple stands as the first practical example of what the CDA ’s green agenda might actually look like and gave a real impetus to the production of laws , guidelines and statements over the next decade .

As Miller ( 2017 ) has noted , environmental communication in China has tended to adopt a global scientific discourse of environmental concepts and principles , rather than favoring their reworking or reformulation in traditional Chinese terms .

A question that arises from this is whether this shift is partly the result of the CDA ’s engagement with global environmental actors , or whether this reflects changes within the domestic environmental policy situation in China .

With funding largely from the World Bank , ARC sought to bring a global environmental agenda to the world ’s major faith traditions , including the Chinese Daoist Association , a particular interest of Palmer .

That is to say , is the CDA ’s focus on more generic and less uniquely Daoist formulations of environmental policy the result of its engagement with ARC ( or other global agencies ) ?

Together , we can theorize that the environmental agenda developed in partnership with ARC contributed to the development of a religious policy discourse focused principally on the good governance and management of temples .

Indeed , as Yeh ( 2013 ) has amply demonstrated , the disjunction of global environmental goals and local traditions has produced miscommunication and even failure of environmental projects .

The environmental agenda pursued by the CDA took the form of a top-down initiative designed to be applied more or less uniformly across temples in China .

The second is the increasing important of ecological juridifcation , the creation of environmental laws as a means to assert central authority over local practice .
