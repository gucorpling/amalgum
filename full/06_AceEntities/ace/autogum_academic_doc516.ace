Some examples include the construction of CD4 positive cell knockouts of Irf4 by breeding Cd4 Cre mice with those containing floxed Irf4 sites ; breeding dendritic cell driven CD11c Cre mice with floxed TGFRβ II and the construction of neuronal tissue knockouts of Rem2 by breeding Rgs9 Cre with Rem2 LoxP/LoxP mice .

During the breeding process , it was unexpectedly found that the floxed Dbc1 allele in some mice was totally deleted and the off-target recombination of floxed Dbc1 allele occurred in tissues other than T cells .

Conditional knockout mice using this technology are constructed by breeding a floxed ( i. e. , flanked by LoxP ) gene of interest with mice expressing Cre-recombinase driven by a tissue or cell-type specific promoter .

Another limitation is the potential for germline recombination of conditional alleles due to the transient Cre expression in the germline .
