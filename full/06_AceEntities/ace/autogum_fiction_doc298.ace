They thought so from the first moment , but when they found the back of the house covered with jasmine , and in white flower , and smelling like a bottle of the most expensive scent that is ever given for a birthday present ; and when they had seen the lawn , all green and smooth , and quite different from the brown grass in the gardens at Camden Town ; and when they had found the stable with a loft over it and some old hay still left , they were almost certain ; and when Robert had found the broken swing and tumbled out of it and got a lump on his head the size of an egg , and Cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hutch that seemed made to keep rabbits in , if you ever had any , they had no longer any doubts whatever .

Mother , curiously enough , was in no hurry to get out ; and even when she had come down slowly and by the step , and with no jump at all , she seemed to wish to see the boxes carried in , and even to pay the driver , instead of joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and the orchard and the thorny , thistly , briery , brambly wilderness beyond the broken gate and the dry fountain at the side of the house .

Of course there are the shops and the theatres , and Maskelyne and Cook 's , and things , but if your people are rather poor you do n't get taken to the theatres , and you ca n't buy things out of the shops ; and London has none of those nice things that children may play with without hurting the things or themselves - such as trees and sand and woods and waters .

But the house was deep in the country , with no other house in sight , and the children had been in London for two years , without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train , and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise .
