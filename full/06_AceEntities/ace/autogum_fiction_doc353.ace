“ If you would wear me , prince , ” said Matilda , “ you must win me : ” and without giving him time to deliberate on the courtesy of fighting with the lady of his love , she raised her sword in the air , and lowered it on his head with an impetus that would have gone nigh to fathom even that extraordinary depth of brain which always by divine grace furnishes the interior of a head-royal , if he had not very dexterously parried the blow .

The circumference of darkness bounded the scene on all sides : and in the centre raged the war ; shields , helmets , and bucklers gleaming and glittering as they rang and clashed against each other ; plumes confusedly tossing in the crimson light , and the messy light and shade that fell on the faces of the combatants , giving additional energy to their ferocious expression .

Matilda was only intent to get rid of her antagonist at any rate : the edge of her weapon painted his complexion with streaks of very unloverlike crimson , and she would probably have marred John ’s hand for ever signing Magna Charta , but that he was backed by the advantage of numbers , and that her sword broke short on the boss of his buckler .

He hurried to the spot , and found that his camp had been suddenly assailed from one side by a party of foresters , and that the baron ’s people had made a sortie on the other , and that they had killed the guards , and set fire to the machine , before the rest of the camp could come to the assistance of their fellows .

Matilda received intimation of this design by the usual friendly channel of a blunt arrow , which must either have been sent from some secret friend in the prince ’s camp , or from some vigorous archer beyond it : the latter will not appear improbable , when we consider that Robin Hood and Little John could shoot two English miles and an inch point-blank ,

He constructed an immense machine on wheels , which , being advanced to the edge of the moat , would lower a temporary bridge , of which one end would rest on the bank , and the other on the battlements , and which , being well furnished with stepping boards , would enable his men to ascend the inclined plane with speed and facility .

On one side , the crimson light quivered by its own agitation on the waveless moat , and on the bastions and buttresses of the castle , and their shadows lay in massy blackness on the illuminated walls : on the other , it shone upon the woods , streaming far within among the open trunks , or resting on the closer foliage .

In the height of this imaginary turmoil , he awoke , and conceived for a few moments that certain sounds which rang in his ears , were the continuation of those of his dream , in that sort of half-consciousness between sleeping and waking , when reality and phantasy meet and mingle in dim and confused resemblance .

Prince John sat down impatiently before Arlingford castle in the hope of starving out the besieged ; but finding the duration of their supplies extend itself in an equal ratio with the prolongation of his hope , he made vigorous preparations for carrying the place by storm .

He therefore formed a party of men into a wedge , only taking especial care not to be the point of it himself , and drove it between them with so much precision , that they were in a moment far asunder .
