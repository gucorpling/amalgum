The pathogenesis of IBS remains unclear , with several factors supposed to be involved , including environmental and host factors such as psychosocial stressors , food intolerance , antibiotics , enteric infections , altered pain perception , altered brain – gut interactions , dysbiosis ( imbalance within the bacterial community ) , increased intestinal permeability , increased gut mucosal immune activation and visceral hypersensitivity .

Nevertheless , while the beneficial role of this diet on microbiota remains unclear , a reduction of commensal bacteria has been reported . Hustoft et al. have shown a reduction in fecal Actinobacteria , Bifidobacterium and Fecalibacterium prausnitzii in patients on a low FODMAPs diet .

On the basis of this theory , the pathogenesis of IBS would be related to the action of central stimuli , such as stress , that could disrupt mucosal immunity , reduce microbial diversity and alter gut barrier function , leading to gut dysfunction .

Second , the benefits reported in some studies after antibiotic or probiotic administration on IBS symptoms are proof in favor of a role of microbiota in the pathogenesis of this disease . Data from animal models provides a plausible explanation for this benefit .
