This database included statistics regarding objective amount of avoidable household food waste ( the terms ‘ avoidable food waste ’ , ‘ food waste ’ , and ‘ food wastage ’ are being used alternately throughout the paper to describe edible , avoidable food discarded by households ) ( kg per household ; measured through a physical waste survey ) , sociodemographic factors ( gender , household age structure , household size , household composition , home ownership status , type of residence , local authority , presence of children , employment status , and socioeconomic status ) , and behavioral variables ( meal preplanning , pre-shopping cupboard checking , preparing a shopping list , using leftovers , food storage practices , type and frequency of shopping trips , and presence of fussy eaters ) .

For example , participants in Stefan et al. and Stancu et al. were asked to assess the relative amount of food waste of the total food purchases , i. e. , ‘ food waste proportion ’ , while in other studies ‘ discarding frequencies ’ were recorded and respondents were asked to indicate how often food is disposed ( e. g. , daily , weekly , never , most mealtimes ) .

Household size , the presence of fussy eaters , employment status , home ownership status , and the local authority were all identified as main drivers of food waste . Grainger et al. found no significant effect of any of the behavioral factors on measured amount of food waste .

The underlying assumptions of self-reporting is that respondents ( 1 ) are able to recall specific waste events ; ( 2 ) provide a proper generalization about the total produced amount ; and ( 3 ) are aware of all food waste generated by other household members .

Another critique on the use of questionnaires is that they are strongly affected by the ‘ social desirability bias ’ , i. e. , participants are prone to report on what they believe is the socially desirable behavior/attitude , which leads to biased waste estimates .

However , to the best of our knowledge , so far , only two studies exploring the relation between food waste and its proposed drivers have used an alternative approach that does not rely merely on self-reports .

Biased assessments might also be affected by a ‘ self-serving bias ’ , the tendency to perceive oneself in a favorable manner , which leads individuals to deny responsibility for negative environmental behaviors .

According to SDG 12 , by 2030 , per capita global food waste among consumers and retailers should be cut in half , while efforts should be put into reducing upstream food losses .

However , some degree of divergence between the behaviors and attitudes of different household members exist , and therefore responses of one person may not fully reflect the household as a whole .

They also rarely provide quantitative measures to indicate the effectiveness of different interventions and those that do , report only a 5 % to 20 % reduction in food waste generation .

More specifically , the relationship between different behaviors , attitudes , and food waste quantities has been almost exclusively explored by questionnaires , of which validity has been recently questioned .

A major barrier toward a comprehensive understanding of food waste drivers is the fact that most studies rely on self-reports , which are difficult to verify .

Another limit of self-reports is that there is no common practice to assess food waste behaviors , hence , cross-study comparisons are practically unfeasible .
