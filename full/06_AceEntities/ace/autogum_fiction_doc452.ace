All through that evening , and through the first part of the succeeding day , I was crowded out of the curate 's mind by a host of thoughts with which I had nothing in common ; and though I hovered about him as he taught in the school , and visited several sick people , and argued with an habitual drunkard , and worked at his Sunday sermon , a Power , which I felt but did not understand , baffled all my attempts to gain an entrance and attract his notice .

Undoubtedly a man like Zaluski , with his easy nonchalance , his knowledge of the world , his genuine good-nature , and the background of sterling qualities which came upon you as a surprise because he loved to make himself seem a mere idler , was apt to eclipse an ordinary mortal like James Blackthorne .
