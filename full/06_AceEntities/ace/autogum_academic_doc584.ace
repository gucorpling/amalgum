The former layer is provided equally to developers , literally , as a middleware framework , and the latter layer includes the components developed by IoT service developers according to the domain requirements .

To construct a generic conceptual architecture , we have designed to separate IoT service domain-dependent components from the core MAPE loop components , which are domain-independent parts .

One is the MAPE Core Bundle Layer , which implements the connectors between the four MAAPE components , the Publish-Subscribe Communication Layer , and the ParticipantRegistry .

The developers can easily perform a series of tasks until the actual IoT service is launched , including the creation/deletion/start/stop of each IoT collaboration service VM .

Whenever the devices or systems which can participate in an IoT collaboration are power-on , information of the participant is automatically registered to the Participant Registry .

To help developers easily manage the IoT Service Bundles , we provide each operation of the IoT Service Launcher in the form of a cloud service .

The other layer is the IoT Service Bundle Layer , which consists of concrete MAPE components required to control a specific IoT collaboration service .

The passive actuator may be embedded in and controlled by a single system , or directly receives the commands of the IoT collaboration controller .

The addition/removal of a specific service bundle can be done by using the cloud service provided by the IoT Service Launcher as well .
