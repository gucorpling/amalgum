According to the sectional system of CDR , scholars argued that inhabitants ’ activities , living density , even social development were also sections following natural resource distribution . Patrick Geddes ’ Valley Section ( 1909 ) concluded that natural conditions guided human activities from mining to fishing and this concept shaped the subsequent analysis of both eco- and urban systems .
