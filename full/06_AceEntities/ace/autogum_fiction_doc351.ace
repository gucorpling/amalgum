Offenders against the revenue laws , and defaulters to excise or customs who had incurred fines which they were unable to pay , were supposed to be incarcerated behind an iron-plated door closing up a second prison , consisting of a strong cell or two , and a blind alley some yard and a half wide , which formed the mysterious termination of the very limited skittle-ground in which the Marshalsea debtors bowled down their troubles .

On these truly British occasions , the smugglers , if any , made a feint of walking into the strong cells and the blind alley , while this somebody pretended to do his something : and made a reality of walking out again as soon as he had n’t done it -- neatly epitomising the administration of most of the public affairs in our right little , tight little , island .

He was a shy , retiring man ; well-looking , though in an effeminate style ; with a mild voice , curling hair , and irresolute hands -- rings upon the fingers in those days -- which nervously wandered to his trembling lip a hundred times in the first half-hour of his acquaintance with the jail .

In practice they had come to be considered a little too bad , though in theory they were quite as good as ever ; which may be observed to be the case at the present day with other cells that are not at all strong , and with other blind alleys that are stone-blind .

Hence the smugglers habitually consorted with the debtors ( who received them with open arms ) , except at certain constitutional moments when somebody came from some Office , to go through some form of overlooking something which neither he nor anybody else knew anything about .
