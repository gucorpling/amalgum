We have chosen to use the two-concept pairs ‘ replaceable and irreplaceable ’ and ‘ available and unavailable ’ to analyze the fathers ’ use of the father ’s quota in two different work organizations in order to see how different institutional logics impact the use of the father ’s quota .

The brokers have close contact with clients and they think being away on leave for three months is too long a period . Halrynjo et al. ( 2019 ) found that parental leave and absence from work are especially pinpointed as risks in Front End Finance .

This informant is the youngest in this study , and it is possible that a new generation is joining the finance industry and will contribute to a gradual change in the institutional logic when it comes to the use of the father ’s quota .

The managers in the engineering industry experience that it is possible to be unavailable and replaceable at work , thus they also choose to make themselves unavailable for work when they use the father ’s quota .

In theory , it is not problematic among the fathers in this study to give up clients to colleagues , but then one has to start all over again when one is back from leave .

The findings show that the terms ‘ replaceable and irreplaceable ’ and ‘ available and unavailable ’ work somewhat differently among male managers in the engineering industry and male brokers in the financial industry .

The lower use in this group has been explained by the fact that these fathers are in jobs where career logic indicates the need to be always available and to be seen as irreplaceable .

By not taking the father ’s quota or just parts of it , they make themselves more available for work , and this becomes the general practice and the institutional logic within the organization .

This is similar to the use made by one of the managers of the father ’s quota as a protest against the workplace and the prevailing ‘ old-boys culture ’ .

The father ’s quota which reserves part of the parental leave for the fathers has played an important role in getting more fathers to use parental leave .

This is because one has a lot to lose in terms of customers , salary development , bonuses , and career opportunities .

By making themselves unavailable , they become replaceable at work because the organization has to find solutions without them .
