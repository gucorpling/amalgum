There are generally three available approaches for WTP elicitation , namely , ( 1 ) via open-ended questions for the respondents to directly state their WTP ; ( 2 ) via payment cards for the respondents to select the amount closest to their valuation from a range of possible payments ; and ( 3 ) via dichotomous choice questions ( including the single-bounded model and the double-bounded one ) for the respondents to give Yes or No answers .

A substantial number of CVM practices are used in determining WTP in many environment-related areas , ranging from areas related to outdoor recreation ( such as national park or nature reserve management ) to the reduction of risks from drinking water and ground water pollution , and from improving air and water quality to protecting wilderness areas and endangered species , indicating a constantly broadening application scope of the CVM in the environmental sector .

Existing CVM literature positively confirmed that level of income ( both at the individual and household levels , including household assets such as ownership of house and car ) , education , knowledge of air pollution and PM2.5 , and risks of respiratory disease from air pollution are the most common and strong factors that significantly affect people ’s WTP for improved air quality .

Researchers have also identified a special strength of using the CVM on the environment , that is , the CVM can be applied to a wide spectrum of situations to gauge the benefits of environmental changes , and at the same time contribute to a better knowledge of the good and/or service being valued and the corresponding public preference to facilitate decision-making .

The CVM presents hypothetical opportunities for the consumers to buy public goods and services and then asks people ’s WTP for these goods and services , which enables individuals to consider all factors ( e. g. , income level , other key socio-economic characteristics ) that are important to them in the supply of the goods and services .

Defined as the maximum price at or below which a consumer will definitely buy one unit of a product , the concept of willingness to pay ( WTP ) was originally developed for establishing prices for public goods and services or valuing subjects that are not usually given monetary terms such as human life .

In contrast , with regard to values that are usually not directly observable , stated preference methods are applied , which use survey techniques to induce WTP for either enabling a marginal improvement or preventing a marginal loss .

As the CVM is a survey-based tool for assessing non-market goods and services like environmental preservation or pollution impacts , questionnaire design is critical because all estimated values are contingent on the information collected from the survey .

These studies not only established a benchmark of monetary values for air quality improvements in different localities , but also identified a series of analysis models and major factors which may affect the amount of WTP .

WTP has been extensively applied by researchers to evaluate environmental benefits or losses to address the challenges arising from the lack of a competitive market for environmental goods and benefits .
