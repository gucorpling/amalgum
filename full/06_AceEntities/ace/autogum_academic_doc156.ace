The two proposed fully automatic segmentation approaches were tested on two case studies with very different characteristics ( e. g. , different types of urban development and average point density value of the ALS input data ) in order to increase the robustness and completeness of the proposed investigation .

This is confirmed by the fact that the minimum value of the RSME ( using both segmentation methods ) evaluated for each of the Toronto buildings is equal to 0.76 m , slightly higher than the value shown in Table 2 ( i. e. , 0.7 m ) .

Processing was conducted on a consumer laptop ( Intel Core i7 , 8G RAM ) and is presented as solid models with simplified facades and faithfully reflected roof structure considering that the aims of these kinds of approaches are to realize an interactive visualization covering large areas .

First , an ALS data set with reference data made available via the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing ( ISPRS ) web site over downtown Toronto ( Canada ) was used to evaluate the performance of the two above-described segmentation approaches .

This manually reconstructed 3D building is considered the gold standard because it is based on detailed survey measurements and , therefore , it can be compared with the outcomes of the two proposed segmentation approaches in order to evaluate their vertex geometry accuracy .

However , the potential-based method can also yield a stable estimate on the number of clusters and initial cluster centers which are needed for the following fuzzy k-means clustering calculation for an efficient segmentation process , saving computational resources .

The region growing segmentation approach exhibited slightly better performances but required a greater computational time ( two times greater ) than the clustering-based approach , similar to the performance in the previously described case study over downtown Toronto .

Hence , the region growing approach analysing the LIDAR cloud points one by one can be more efficient to reach the best spatial detail possible but , at the same time , this process is more time-consuming .

The better performances of both proposed methodologies on the Matera building with respect to the Toronto case study could be associated with the different quality of input ALS data adopted .
