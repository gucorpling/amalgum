I ate a few hits in t12 and t13 maps that would have killed me in a t15 , but those hits come sooooo infrequently it puts me in a weird position where , because I know I ca n’t be “ on my A game ” for so many maps , I simply elected to run maps that I had a very low chance to die in .

* Abyss belts/jewels . I was pretty shocked when they announced they would keep these in the game , and lo and behold they have become ubiquitous . I dislike how these items are so strong that they render other items irrelevant . I wonder what the usage rates on Quartz and Silver flasks have fallen to , and a quick look through the SSFHC ladder

PoE is an awesome game ( did I say that twice ? ) The bad : Bestiary mechanics , from the nets to the crafting to the menagerie and everything in between . Enough has already been said about this , so I wo n’t beat a ~~stupid beast~~ dead horse . I hope GGG takes this as a learning experience .

Do n’t get mad . * ) The good : PoE is an awesome game , and GGG is an awesome company . The grind from 97 to 100 was terrible and I really wanted to give up , because I had so much loot accumulated and I desperately wanted to reroll and try a new playstyle .

leaderboards show basically everyone wearing a Stygian or a unique belt with few exceptions . Getting perma-onslaught and phasing is really easy on any character that kills monsters themself , which seems to go against the general design philosophy of making players choose which effects they get and needing to sacrifice something to gain them .

I say this to embolden players who want to try SSF but are afraid they will be too limited on builds ; you might not find the one item you want , but you ’ll probably find something good ! ( And if you play long enough , you ’ll find basically everything ) .

For 99->100 , I would estimate less than a fourth of these maps had any elder/shaper influence on them , as I changed my atlas a bit to experiment with xp/hour and could n’t be bothered to set up a new elder position .
