That 's not to say that looks do n't have anything to say , as attraction is obviously necessary for a relationship .

This ensured that we actually liked talking to each other , and that it was n't just based on physical attraction .

If someone is kind , caring and able to carry an intellectual conversation , looks just do n't mean as much .
