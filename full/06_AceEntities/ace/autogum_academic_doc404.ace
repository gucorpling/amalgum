At last , these perspectives could also provide a new insight for agricultural water resources allocation management and relative decision support for the governor , such as the sustainable development of water resources , the interactions between the governor and users , competition between users , penalty – reward mechanism , multi-stage multi-agent and multi-objective decision-making , and so on .

What is left for future research also includes the distribution plan and incentive mechanism under these conditions , and the fact that these water users may have private information , risk-preference , or risk-aversion , which would be left for future research .

Therefore , this mechanism involves not only the interactions between the government and users , but the interactions between two users , which could help the governor balance the economic and environment developments , and balance the short-term development and long-term development .

Even though this two-stage allocation is just a small part of the long-term allocation cycle , it could reflect the real allocation process and reflect the requirement of water resources sustainability under the current social – environmental – economic development .

The internalization of the external costs could help the governor transfer the costs to the users , which could further motivate the two users to act according to the governor ’s interests rather than their own interests .

If hydropower is considered , the two water users will also need to consider the secondary distribution of water resources , which makes for another incentive mechanism from the water user j ’s point of view .

In fact , in addition to the water user j ’s allocation , the players could get water resources from various channels , such as water reuse , buying from other players , and so on .

The second extension is the multi-principal and multi-agent model , including many governors and many water users , existing in transboundary river basins , such as Lancang River , Nu River , Yalu River .

In case of less disposable water resources , due to extreme drought weather , like what happened in Meikong River Basins in 2011 , the overall supply water will be less than normal year .

Second , the performance-based incentive mechanism will induce competition between the two users based on the penalty – incentive system to motivate them to act in accordance with the governor ’s goals .

As this paper only presents a one-principal and two-agent model , we can naturally extend this model to multi-principal or multi-agent ( more than two agents ) .

Under this situation , the governor will need another incentive mechanism or an emergency mechanism , which will be another interesting research direction .

There are also uncertainties of the water allocation process , such as flood or extreme droughts , which affect water allocation substantially .
